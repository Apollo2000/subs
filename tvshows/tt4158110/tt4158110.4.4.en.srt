00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:09,445
Everything we did
was what they wanted.

3
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:11,755
<i>I'm a prisoner,
just like before.</i>

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,413
I'm going after Whiterose.

5
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:15,089
I'm in.
Give me your phone.

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,717
I rigged Signal's API
so we could share locations.

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,119
You fucked me!

8
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:20,794
I lost everything
because of you.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,931
<i>My son's taken to Denmark,
and my wife's dead!</i>

10
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:25,570
<i>The Dark Army
are just hackers.</i>

11
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:27,193
<i>He turned the gun
on himself.</i>

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,535
<i>He erased his history.</i>

13
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>You work for
the Dark Army now.</i>

14
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:33,104
<i>My whole life is ruined
because of you.</i>

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,192
<i>Olivia Cortez,
she's the Deus Group's</i>

16
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,694
<i>only U.S. account manager.</i>

17
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:37,795
<i>She's our way in.</i>

18
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:40,539
You wanted to work with me,
this is the way it is.

19
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:42,798
If there's a problem,
don't be here when I get back.

20
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:45,289
I'm resigning
as CEO of E Corp.

21
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:48,605
Call Mr. Wellick and offer
him the CEO position.

22
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:51,968
That van's been following us
since we got off the subway.

23
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:56,714
Elliot, we're on the inside.
It's time to take them down.

24
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,896
<i>Elliot, I've come with the
news we've been waiting for.</i>

25
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:07,308
<i>They want to make me CEO
of E Corp.</i>

26
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:08,342
<i>Are you hearing me?</i>

27
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:10,978
<i>The offer came directly
from Whiterose.</i>

28
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:13,739
<i>This is... what are you doing?</i>

29
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:16,191
<i>This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.</i>

30
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:19,245
<i>We're on the inside.
It's time to take them down.</i>

31
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>I'm sorry, I've been under
a lot of stress.</i>

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,662
<i>I didn't mean to snap.</i>

33
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:32,333
<i>No, uh, I get it.</i>

34
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,502
<i>Okay, uh, here,
have a seat.</i>

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,339
<i>You want... you want water
or something?</i>

36
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,599
<i>Let me get you a glass.</i>

37
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:46,013
<i>There you go.</i>

38
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,848
<i>I'm gonna boot up my computer.</i>

39
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,434
<i>It'll just take a minute.</i>

40
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:51,518
<i>Fuck.</i>

41
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:52,853
<i>I forgot the install
this morning.</i>

42
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,731
<i>Looks like it failed.
I wonder why.</i>

43
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,780
<i>Logs say "out of disk space."</i>

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,282
<i>Just give me a second.</i>

45
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,368
<i>I need to adjust
the swap partitions.</i>

46
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:12,539
<i>That should fix it.</i>

47
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,292
<i>"Boot device not found."</i>

48
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,712
<i>Shit, now
my terminal's frozen.</i>

49
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,474
<i>Hard drive might be shot.</i>

50
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,477
<i>You know what, I'm gonna...</i>

52
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:55,916
- Oh, fuck.
- Get in, check the logs.

53
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,511
If the recording wasn't
send back to Dark Army,

54
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:02,673
wipe everything and make sure
they can't track the van.

55
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,683
What about him?

56
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,096
He's dead.

57
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,462
To be clear,
I am not calling you

58
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:44,298
because we are good.

59
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,800
I am calling
because I got into

60
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:49,228
Olivia's
Cyprus National Bank Account.

61
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,731
Unfortunately,
her access isn't good enough.

62
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,808
I can see all
the Deus account numbers,

63
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,561
but she's not authorized
to transfer anything.

64
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,063
I got lateral access
inside the bank's system

65
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,899
but hit a wall.

66
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,485
All their authentication
goes through a proxy,

67
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:07,413
and everything else on
their domain is read-only,

68
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,992
which means we are gonna have
to break into Virtual Realty

69
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,660
and get on their servers.

70
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:15,412
Since the Deus Group meeting
is tomorrow,

71
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,247
I'm scouting the place now.

72
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,333
Security is lax with Christmas,

73
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:23,587
so we need to do it ASAP.

74
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:28,759
Also, can't help but wonder
why exactly the fuck

75
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,845
you are not answering my calls.

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,847
We were supposed to meet
at Allsafe,

77
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,016
or did you forget again?

78
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:39,353
Dick.

79
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,188
Okay, you know what?

80
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,023
I'm coming to your apartment,

81
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,024
and when I get there,

82
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,527
I expect you to have
heard this message

83
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:49,112
and already be prepping
for Virtual Realty.

84
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,032
Oh, and when you do
get this voicemail,

85
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:55,369
keep this in mind: fuck you!

86
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:58,705
You are a fucking selfish
dickhead of an asshole

87
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,793
who is the shittiest brother
on Earth!

88
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,796
I don't wanna say I hate you,
but I hate you.

89
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,632
I hate you so fucking much.

90
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,801
If I show up at your apartment
and you're hanging

91
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,887
from the goddamn ceiling
by a rope, that's cool.

92
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,557
In fact, that would be
my preference.

93
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:19,643
So in sum, fuck off and die!

94
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,565
<i>To continue your recording,
press two.</i>

95
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,742
<i>To delete your recording,
press three.</i>

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,999
<i>Please re-record your message
at the tone.</i>

97
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,745
Hey, Elliot,

98
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,714
it's me.

99
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,677
Elliot?

100
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:07,561
Okay, it looks like
the logs were never sent.

101
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:09,646
So all we gotta do
is get rid of the body

102
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,782
and the van,
and we're good to go, okay?

103
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,245
I'm gonna go pick us up
a couple of snow shovels.

104
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,172
We're not here for shovels.

105
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,342
What are we here for?

106
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,303
Go inside, pay for the gas,
and grab a lighter.

107
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,804
Oh, Internet's down.

108
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,264
No Ecoin.

109
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:50,904
$19.86.

110
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,324
Do I know you?

111
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:59,580
I don't think so.

112
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,543
You look awfully familiar.

113
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,004
Yeah, sorry,
we're kind of in a hurry.

114
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,383
You sure we
haven't met before?

115
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,877
Yeah, you must have me
mistaken for someone else.

116
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:14,836
You an actor?

117
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:17,005
Can you just ring him up?

118
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:20,509
Wait, were you on
"Big Brother"?

119
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:22,969
Yeah, that must be it.

120
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:25,847
I knew it.
I never forget a face.

121
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:27,682
Keep the change.

122
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,735
Merry Christmas!

123
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:44,199
Where'd you move the van to?

124
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,993
I didn't move the van.

125
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:14,780
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

126
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:18,275
Hey, hey, thief!

127
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,786
- Thief, I've called the police.
- Shit.

128
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,737
Hey, dude, you're straight up
trying to steal my car.

129
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:23,738
It's cool, man.
It's cool.

130
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:25,791
You don't need
to call the cops, okay?

131
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,200
- I'm walking away.
- No... hold on.

132
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:30,629
You trying to steal my car
and walk away.

133
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:31,705
What's up?

134
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,789
Dude, do you really
want to deal with the hassle

135
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,125
of calling the cops?

136
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,877
It's just gonna end in
an all-nighter for you

137
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:39,754
at the station, followed by
a shit ton of paperwork.

138
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,632
Besides, nothing...
nothing happened.

139
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,426
You busted me,
I'm walking away.

140
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,094
No harm, no foul.

141
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:50,807
Yeah, but I got questions
that need answering.

142
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:55,979
First, have you seen my keys?

143
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,614
No.

144
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,152
That was my only question.

145
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,904
Can I please go now?

146
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,998
Oh, wait,
I got another question.

147
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,542
Can you start my car?

148
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,945
Really?

149
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:15,790
Yeah, I usually use my keys,
and I can't seem to find them.

150
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,342
Okay, you're
not really planning

151
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,919
on driving like this, are you?

152
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:22,005
Well, I gotta get home.

153
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,849
Dude, you are drunk as shit.

154
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:26,676
Can't you just call a cab
or something?

155
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,638
No, cabs don't go
where I'm headed.

156
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:31,514
Where is that,
the North Pole?

157
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,358
No.

158
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:36,320
It's Upstate.
Foxrock.

159
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,818
What's your name?

160
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:45,487
Tobias.

161
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,655
Hi, Tobias.

162
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,791
I'm Darlene.
We're friends, right?

163
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,828
Yeah, I'd like that.

164
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,497
Great.

165
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:56,623
So here's an idea.

166
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,384
I'll drive you home
if I can borrow

167
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,803
your car afterwards
for a quick errand.

168
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,383
You drive a hard bargain,
Dolly.

169
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,300
Darlene.

170
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:10,187
Exactly.
Let's ride!

171
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:16,393
Oh, guys, I understand,

172
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,229
but like I said,
Internet's down.

173
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,563
Phone's hooked to the Internet,

174
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,575
so that means
phone is down too.

175
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:25,577
We're kind of in the middle
of nowhere here.

176
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,912
None of our phones
have service.

177
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:30,415
There's gotta be someplace
nearby with cell reception.

178
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:33,493
- Sure, back in town.
- What town?

179
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,495
Pike's Hollow.

180
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,089
How do we get there?

181
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,592
It's too far to walk
unless you take the shortcut.

182
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,379
But my husband's coming
to pick me up in a bit,

183
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:45,755
if you want a ride.

184
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,382
Where's the shortcut?

185
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,555
Got it!

186
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,932
Tyrell Wellick, right?

187
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,393
That's how I know you.

188
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,770
But I never knew
you were on "Big Brother."

189
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,773
Holy smokes!

190
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,902
I cannot believe
you are in my store.

191
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:08,954
Can I get a selfie?

192
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:11,790
No, I'm not him.
You have me confused, okay?

193
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,575
The shortcut,
how do we get there?

194
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,952
Are you sure you're not
Tyrell Wellick?

195
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,295
E Corp fella.

196
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,414
You are the spitting image
of him.

197
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:22,417
Yes, I'm sure.

198
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:25,253
That's too bad.

199
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,256
Sure like to meet him one day.

200
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,142
Seems like a nice guy.

201
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:32,477
Jesus fucking Christ, woman!

202
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:35,731
Where is the shortcut?
How the fuck do we get to town?

203
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:41,311
Whoa, aren't you
friggin' rude?

204
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,276
Directly across the street,

205
00:13:48,353 --> 00:13:50,495
you'll see
an opening to a trail,

206
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:52,906
and that will take you through
the woods for a stretch,

207
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:55,617
but be sure you veer left
at the creek.

208
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:57,577
You'll find yourself
in Pike's Hollow

209
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:02,290
in 30 minutes or so.

210
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,918
Fucking finally.

211
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:08,513
Wouldn't hurt you to learn
some manners on the walk.

212
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,386
This is the right trail,
right?

213
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:23,056
The one across
from the gas station.

214
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:26,318
There was only one.

215
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:29,070
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

216
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,830
So quiet out here.

217
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:46,379
Have you ever
considered leaving?

218
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,501
What do you mean?

219
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,296
Just walking off,
disappearing,

220
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:57,632
leaving the life
you're living behind you,

221
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,185
all the bullshit,
the stress, the pain,

222
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,020
everything?

223
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:04,356
You know, maybe start over

224
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:06,691
where no one knows you
and reinvent yourself

225
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:10,812
and forget about all the
mistakes you made in this life.

226
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:13,606
Find some peace.

227
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,609
Some rest.

228
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:19,204
I think about that.

229
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,498
Don't you?

230
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:24,417
No.

231
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,332
Any sign of the creek?

232
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:35,220
Well, maybe it's still
up ahead.

233
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:37,722
Ah.

234
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,632
We've been walking
for a while.

235
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,509
We shoulda come
across it by now.

236
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:43,895
How do you know if we should
have come across it by now?

237
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,014
Because we've been walking
for fucking hours.

238
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,807
- That's how.
- Don't get mad at me.

239
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,642
I don't know where
the goddamn creek is.

240
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:50,977
You were the one
who took off this way.

241
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,571
Unbelievable... you're
blaming me that we're lost?

242
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:56,566
I blame you
that we're even here.

243
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,568
- You said he was dead.
- He was.

244
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,361
Well, then how did
he drive the van?

245
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:01,746
I don't fucking know!

246
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,573
All right, all right.

247
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,658
Let's all calm down.

248
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,035
Take it easy.

249
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,764
What was that?
A dog?

250
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:24,761
Who knows?

251
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,845
We're in the middle
of the woods.

252
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,555
Could be anything.

253
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,274
Maybe a coyote.

254
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:30,391
Or a wolf.

255
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,446
That.

256
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:39,901
You hear it?

257
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:42,829
Let's just keep going.
Maybe the creek is up ahead.

258
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:57,627
She knew my face.

259
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,462
What?

260
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,547
The cashier.

261
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:03,758
She knew my face.

262
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,803
So what?

263
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,830
That means she can ID me.

264
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:17,489
<i>You search, you find,
all is well.</i>

265
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:20,158
<i>But what if you search
and you don't find?</i>

266
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:21,651
<i>How long do you look?</i>

267
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,407
<i>Eventually, you've
gotta give up, right?</i>

268
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,951
<i>Then what?</i>

269
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:33,004
<i>That thing you were searching
for, what becomes of it?</i>

270
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:35,340
<i>How could you ever know?</i>

271
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:52,181
Big night tonight?

272
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,477
Uh, no.

273
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:59,814
I'm not the real Santa.

274
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,108
Yeah.

275
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:04,744
Sometimes I wish I were.

276
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,949
Sometimes I wish I were...

277
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,623
Where'd you go there, Tobias?

278
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:21,210
Oh, just thinking.

279
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,713
Jimmy.

280
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,965
Good guy.

281
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,968
Fell on some tough times.

282
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:32,513
You know how sometimes
the world just seems like

283
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,351
it's kicking you down
and you can't get up?

284
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:39,312
Christ, do I ever.

285
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:41,981
That's Jimmy.

286
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,816
And you know how it is.

287
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:47,028
Soon you're out
in the cold winter night,

288
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:50,239
asking a lot of questions,

289
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,250
looking at the world,

290
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:57,130
thinking about what it might be
like without you in it.

291
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:24,524
Do you have to do that?

292
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,659
- It's a Christmas song.
- It's annoying.

293
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:38,037
I just got it.

294
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:40,456
Why you wear that hoodie.

295
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,125
I've never seen you
in anything else.

296
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,546
Black hoodie,
black jeans, black shoes,

297
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:48,297
always the same.

298
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,258
I've been wondering
this whole time,

299
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:52,927
but now I finally get it.

300
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:55,480
You don't care.

301
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:58,766
Sure, why not?

302
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:01,227
Silk tie,

303
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,530
$6,000 suit.

304
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:11,279
I mean, it sounds pathetic
to say aloud, but...

305
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:14,949
I actually care.

306
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:17,994
And you know what?

307
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,580
That's why I'm a failure.

308
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:24,292
My entire life,
I've been an outsider,

309
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:27,253
worried what other people
think of me,

310
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,256
how I can make them happy,

311
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,726
because I needed their approval
and their acceptance.

312
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,524
But you never cared.

313
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:42,143
The first day we met,

314
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:45,271
there we were, Allsafe's
most important clients

315
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:49,409
roaming through the office,
and you couldn't care less.

316
00:22:57,902 --> 00:23:00,536
We're gonna die out here.

317
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,539
Maybe not tonight, but soon.

318
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,000
The Dark Army soldier,

319
00:23:06,077 --> 00:23:09,462
he's likely
reported back by now.

320
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:12,340
It's only a matter of time
before they find us.

321
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,394
Did you hear that?

322
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,814
If there's traffic,
we gotta be close to town.

323
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,835
- Hey!
- Hey!

324
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,046
- Hey!
- Hey!

325
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:54,307
- Hey!
- Hey!

326
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:00,313
Jesus Christ!

327
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:15,528
So what's with the getup

328
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:19,365
Mall Santa?
Salvation Army?

329
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,951
Sloan Kettering.

330
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,620
It's a cancer center.

331
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,540
I do it for the kids.

332
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:30,876
Dude, that's dope.

333
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:36,132
You're definitely
a better person than me.

334
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,551
So what,
the kids served spiked nog?

335
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:42,763
No, me and some
of the other volunteers,

336
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,893
we got a little tradition
after visiting the hospital.

337
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:49,562
What's that?

338
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:52,031
We get drunk.

339
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,985
Nice tradition, I guess.

340
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,655
Yeah, you know the kids,

341
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,783
they love when we drop by.

342
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,663
So many smiling faces.

343
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:12,418
This might be the last time
I do it though.

344
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:15,722
You know, the thing
that really gets you?

345
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:20,535
Some of 'em are so small.

346
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:29,852
It's almost as if
they were just born to die.

347
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,149
Jesus.

348
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:38,110
No wonder you're plastered.

349
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:41,697
How else do you
get through that?

350
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:46,160
Well, it was easier
when my wife went with me,

351
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:48,621
but...

352
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:51,540
since the accident...

353
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,720
What do you got there,
Tobias?

354
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:09,183
Oh, I like to keep
a nip or two on me

355
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,560
during the holidays.

356
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,021
I'm not talking
about the booze.

357
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:16,982
Oh, Percocet.

358
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:26,408
Sometimes the...
the pain's just too much.

359
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,083
Alexa, play
"slow jams" playlist.

360
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,835
<i>Playing "slow jams"
playlist.</i>

361
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:39,672
So this is my apartment.

362
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,053
You know,
when we were chatting,

363
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,774
I just imagined
this super organized.

364
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:53,269
Well, I... I actually
did clean up earlier.

365
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,230
No, I like it.

366
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:06,031
You want a drink?

367
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:09,410
I have one Tecate.

368
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:11,453
We can share.

369
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:29,638
So my apartment
being organized

370
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,224
was part of your fantasy
in our chat?

371
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:36,821
Well, you know,
just visualizing.

372
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:42,651
I guess that's
the thing about IRC.

373
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,404
Everyone gets to imagine
exactly what they want.

374
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,578
Is that why you do it?

375
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:55,247
I like how I can
control everything.

376
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,675
I have this fantasy that
I'm the only person from IRC

377
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,011
you've ever invited over.

378
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,352
You are.

379
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,342
Just...

380
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,553
let me just...

381
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,347
I'll be right back.

382
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:56,183
Okay.

383
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:32,019
Stop fighting so hard.

384
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:39,268
You're gonna lose control
faster that way.

385
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,690
Give into it.

386
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,118
Give up control.

387
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:54,366
Realize you'll never be free.

388
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:02,434
<i>Um...</i>

389
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,479
Tobias?

390
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:07,531
What's up?

391
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,694
Hold on now.

392
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:16,115
<i>Whose car is that?</i>

393
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,283
That was gonna be
my question.

394
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,660
Hey.

395
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:22,588
That's my car.

396
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:28,502
Oh, I get it now.

397
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:32,381
Uh, you see,
I didn't drive today.

398
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,967
Kenny drove.

399
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,803
- He picked me up at...
- Okay, Tobias.

400
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,899
If that is your car,
whose car is this?

401
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,528
I have no clue.

402
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,741
Christmas, huh?

403
00:31:54,438 --> 00:31:56,288
Good-bye, Tobias.

404
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:01,669
Good-bye
is short and final.

405
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,720
Hey.
Hey.

406
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,680
Hey.

407
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,098
Look,

408
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,893
I know it might not
be my place, but...

409
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:28,937
I wanna help you.

410
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,448
You wanna help me?

411
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:33,659
I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

412
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,865
Holy crow, what the heck
are you talking about?

413
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,950
What do you mean,
you're all sad and lonely

414
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,745
going on about Jimmy,
your suicidal "friend."

415
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:46,580
Jimmy Stewart.

416
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:48,290
"It's a Wonderful Life."

417
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,042
Christmas classic.

418
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:52,920
Tobias, you just told me
good-bye is final.

419
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:54,588
That is Steinbeck.

420
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:57,549
He's a national treasure.
Read a book.

421
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,885
Okay, what about the pills?

422
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:02,262
Okay, you're drunk as shit and
you have a bottle of Percocet.

423
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,057
Explain that.

424
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:06,642
For my wife.

425
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,068
Your wife's dead.

426
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:12,981
My wife is dead?

427
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,576
Wait... you said
she had an accident.

428
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,780
She threw her back out

429
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:25,285
when we were putting the Santa
on the roof yesterday.

430
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:27,329
She's in brutal pain.

431
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,414
She can barely move.

432
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:30,749
Doc wrote a prescription...

433
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:33,510
Okay, you fucking scared me.

434
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:38,590
- Hey, Dolly.
- Darlene.

435
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,593
Are you okay?

436
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,896
Yeah, I'm okay.
Why wouldn't I be?

437
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:49,101
You wanna talk about it?

438
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,362
There's nothing
to talk about.

439
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:54,740
You sure?

440
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,785
Yes.

441
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,947
All right.

442
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:04,149
Have a great night.

443
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,955
Fine.

444
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,629
I have lost
absolutely everyone,

445
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:21,300
my boyfriend,
my best friend, my parents.

446
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:23,468
The only one I have left
is my brother,

447
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:28,473
who is an asshole that
treats me like absolute shit.

448
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:30,851
But I'm really worried
about him right now,

449
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:32,728
and it pisses me off
that I'm worried,

450
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,314
because I am always
worried about him,

451
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:38,317
and he flat-out told me
to fuck off.

452
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,327
So why do I bother?

453
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:45,324
I don't know.

454
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,744
I don't know, I'm afraid
this time it's different.

455
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,246
I'm afraid he might be dead.

456
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,515
Okay.

457
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:21,577
- Reception?
- No.

458
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,414
Time.

459
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:30,336
Just realizing
it's Christmas.

460
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,916
- Can't be much further.
- To what?

461
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:37,968
Town.

462
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:39,211
Let's stop
lying to ourselves.

463
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:41,797
We're nowhere near town.
We're completely lost.

464
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,141
- We just gotta keep moving.
- Why?

465
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:46,802
Even if we magically made it
to this Pike's Hollow place,

466
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,979
the town is gonna be swarming
with Dark Army.

467
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:52,316
- We've gotta try.
- You aren't listening to me.

468
00:35:52,393 --> 00:35:55,736
Whatever we're walking towards,
it ends with death.

469
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,458
What are you doing?

470
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:14,046
There's a rock in my shoe.

471
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:36,235
You honestly don't care
about me, do you?

472
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:39,604
What are you
talking about now?

473
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:42,607
Like why you wear that
same hoodie every day.

474
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:45,444
You don't care.

475
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,779
Did you ever care about me?

476
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:49,531
I mean, be honest,
I can take it.

477
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,158
What is the point of this?

478
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:53,168
Just answer the question,
did you?

479
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,495
Tyrell, you didn't
make it easy...

480
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:59,124
- Just answer the question!
- No!

481
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:07,883
The sound of death.

482
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,144
It's just some stupid animal.
Let's go.

483
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:13,564
- Go without me.
- What?

484
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,391
- You're giving up?
- Yeah.

485
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,152
I think so.

486
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,738
I can't deal
with this shit anymore.

487
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,757
Come on.

488
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:43,001
You stay out here alone,

489
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:46,263
you can be sure
it's game over.

490
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,590
You're better than this.

491
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,935
Yeah, maybe I was,
but not anymore.

492
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:54,221
I'm going.

493
00:37:54,297 --> 00:37:56,106
Yeah, go, Elliot.

494
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,850
- I will.
- Yeah, good.

495
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:00,685
'Cause you don't need me.
You never needed me.

496
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:01,853
That's the truth, right?

497
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:05,398
Yeah, that's the truth,
I never fucking needed you!

498
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:07,400
You were only in the way!

499
00:38:07,477 --> 00:38:08,401
If it weren't for you...

500
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:11,363
The world
would've been saved?

501
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,949
And you would have been
the savior?

502
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,575
Is that what you think?

503
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:17,911
Is that the fantasy
I ruined for you?

504
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:20,247
Stay here, die!

505
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:23,750
I don't give a fuck about you!

506
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:26,053
I'm done!

507
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:30,131
Good!

508
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,258
Look around you!

509
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:36,471
All signs lead to the same
hopeless destination,

510
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:39,266
and the sooner you realize
that, the better,

511
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:41,393
for you're so much
in your own head

512
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,395
that you can't see the truth!

513
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,405
That it's over!

514
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,818
<i>Seems like we're always
thinking of ourselves</i>

515
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,613
<i>when looking for something
that's lost,</i>

516
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,284
<i>but we never think much
about the lost,</i>

517
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,837
<i>whatever, whoever
is unable to be found,</i>

518
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:05,083
<i>whether it's a set of keys
left somewhere and forgotten,</i>

519
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,005
<i>a couple of guys wandering
aimlessly in the woods,</i>

520
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,841
<i>or someone who's disappeared
inside himself.</i>

521
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,019
<i>What if that's what
they wanted all along?</i>

522
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:18,430
<i>Not to be found.</i>

523
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,617
You're wrong.

524
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:41,003
I don't like being
an outsider either.

525
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:44,923
Maybe I'm just good
at hiding it.

526
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:50,262
Why'd you come back?
Why aren't you going?

527
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:53,965
I don't know.

528
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,176
I guess...

529
00:39:56,252 --> 00:39:58,186
it felt wrong to leave you.

530
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:03,516
Besides,

531
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:05,402
I think you're
the only person I know

532
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:07,446
that actually likes me.

533
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,826
You were right about one thing.

534
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:16,246
I've known
that we're gonna die

535
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:20,000
since we walked out of that gas
station and the van was gone.

536
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:24,838
I don't think there's
a way out of this for us.

537
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:28,300
Why do you want
to keep going?

538
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,887
My sister.

539
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,674
I have to warn her.

540
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:39,386
I have to at least try.

541
00:40:39,462 --> 00:40:42,222
I got her into this miss.

542
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:45,942
Same as last time
and the time before that.

543
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,894
I've been a horrible brother.

544
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:50,155
I treated her like shit.

545
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,024
Least I can do

546
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:56,069
is call her
and tell her to run.

547
00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:03,410
Maybe she can still escape.

548
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,752
How much longer do you think
until they find us?

549
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:14,796
I don't know, man.

550
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:24,189
All right.

551
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:29,102
Let's keep moving.

552
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:32,105
Maybe you can still
make that phone call.

553
00:41:47,414 --> 00:41:50,832
- Dolly.
- Dar... what?

554
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:54,010
I know you're worried
about your brother,

555
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:57,556
but you gotta worry
about you too.

556
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,844
I'm trying.

557
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:05,764
And I hope he's not dead.

558
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,016
Merry Christmas.

559
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:14,865
Hi.

560
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:16,867
Ho, ho, ho.

561
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:18,985
Santa's home.

562
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,796
Fu...

563
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:26,765
Tyrell.

564
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:32,145
You okay?

565
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:43,740
Oh, Jesus Christ.

566
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:46,117
I'm okay.

567
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:50,622
We can't just
leave him here.

568
00:45:55,778 --> 00:45:58,705
Gotta get you
to a hospital, man.

569
00:45:58,781 --> 00:46:01,332
Fuck.

570
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,760
No... no hospital.

571
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:06,471
The Dark Army will find me;
they'll find you.

572
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,103
No... no, we gotta
keep moving, man.

573
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:15,888
We'll find someplace
that can help you.

574
00:46:15,965 --> 00:46:17,983
No, I'm done.

575
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:22,821
Burn the van
and all the evidence.

576
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:30,862
Make sure you take care
of Whiterose.

577
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,572
Okay?

578
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:40,839
Tyrell.

579
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:49,097
I can't let you die.

580
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:54,135
I'm just gonna go
for a walk.

581
00:48:57,511 --> 00:49:02,511

00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:08,841
<i>Is this really it...</i>

3
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:12,294
<i>The moment
this can all truly end,</i>

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,296
<i>reverse everything we've done,</i>

5
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:16,590
<i>finally bring Five/Nine
to an end?</i>

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,184
This is what
democracy looks like!

7
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,636
<i>I fought so hard to protect
the New York facility</i>

8
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,764
<i>that I couldn't see
the bigger picture.</i>

9
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,526
<i>A reported 71 buildings
exploded or caught fire.</i>

10
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:31,196
You have been appointed
CTO at E Corp.

11
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:33,866
The CTO title
is nothing more than that.

12
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:35,776
The position is worthless.
You heard him.

13
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:36,860
We can use it.

14
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,705
I suppose there's some
banal excuse why a month

15
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:42,374
isn't enough time to get my
project shipped to the Congo!

16
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:45,544
Now I want you to imagine
your mom, Trudie.

17
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:48,455
Am I illustrating my point?

18
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,123
You work for the Dark Army now.

19
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:52,292
It was you
who exported the keys.

20
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,553
You could make it like
Five/Nine never happened.

21
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,556
Whatever happens after this,
I want us to keep talking.

22
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:58,557
I want us to be a team.

23
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,894
My associates
found your pet employee.

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,886
<i>I am your father.</i>

25
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:03,896
Angela Moss was allowed

26
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:05,972
to continue
with her lawsuit,

27
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,642
<i>which put my plant
in jeopardy.</i>

28
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,402
You're panicking
right now.

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,230
<i>The minute you remove
emotion from this,</i>

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,481
you'll do just fine.

31
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:15,982
<i>You need
to talk to Angela.</i>

32
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,076
<i>She is not doing well.</i>

33
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,485
<i>Last time I saw her,</i>

34
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,579
<i>she was going through
a full-on breakdown.</i>

35
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:23,240
<i>The cyber bombing,
that was my fault.</i>

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,575
<i>She used me for that.</i>

37
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,246
I have to believe
that there was a purpose.

38
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:32,082
Pettiness.

39
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,419
It was a dig at me.

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,881
It's that small,
unfortunately.

41
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,679
No, it's not over.

42
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:48,098
It's not over.
It can't be.

43
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,102
She was gonna
bring my mom back.

44
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,022
We were gonna be reunited.

45
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,875
What are you gonna
do to her?

46
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:19,721
What are you asking?

47
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,800
Retribution...

48
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,977
I want it.

49
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,805
I'm afraid
your only move here:

50
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:33,443
accept that
you've been conned.

51
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:38,323
Find a way
to live with what you did.

52
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:43,320
No.

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,498
You're wrong about her project.

54
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:49,334
I know it's possible.
I've seen it.

55
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,923
And I know
how to take it from her.

56
00:02:57,953 --> 00:03:00,086
Don't you get it?

57
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,838
With everything that we know,

58
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,224
this is what
we have to do.

59
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,685
- Shut up.
- We can expose her.

60
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,011
We can tell everyone
what she showed me.

61
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,471
Shut up!

62
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:10,597
Sh-shut up.

63
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:13,358
No, I won't.

64
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:14,100
And if you're
not gonna help me,

65
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:16,195
I'm gonna do it
on my own.

66
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,773
And there is nothing
you can do or say to stop me.

67
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,959
I wish you hadn't said that.

68
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,979
You have to understand.

69
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:56,643
I have been trying
to stop her from hurting you.

70
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:59,905
That's... that's why
I brought you here.

71
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:03,700
But you ta... you talk like this,
and I cannot protect you.

72
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,456
You have to relent.

73
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,326
There's a chance,
if... if you... if you beg.

74
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,755
It's the only way out of this,
please, please, please.

75
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,832
Shh.

76
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,926
You're panicking right now.

77
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,847
Remove all emotion,
and you'll do just fine.

78
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,686
Isn't that what
you're good at?

79
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,993
I'm not gonna run.

80
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,587
So you should
probably leave.

81
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:52,402
<i>She made her choice.</i>

82
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,912
Choice?

83
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,081
That's not allowed
when it comes to you.

84
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:58,324
No, no, you...

85
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,502
you did this to her.

86
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:05,331
You... you... you recruited her
and you k...

87
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,666
you killed...

88
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:08,718
<i>And you let it happen,
didn't you?</i>

89
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:17,177
<i>It wasn't without a valiant
attempt on your part, though,</i>

90
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,271
<i>trying to talk
some sense into her.</i>

91
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,106
<i>It isn't your fault
that she wouldn't listen.</i>

92
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:23,775
You didn't give me
enough time. She...

93
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,520
She could have... she could...
she could...

94
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:29,105
she could have come around.

95
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,358
I meant everything
I said to her.

96
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:34,527
You are psychotic.

97
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,998
<i>You're certainly not
mincing words today, are you?</i>

98
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,622
It's all psychotic.

99
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,125
<i>Phillip, if you feel
you must take this out on me,</i>

100
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,127
<i>then I am happy
to bear the burden.</i>

101
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,213
<i>I've become very good at it
over the years,</i>

102
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,848
<i>don't you think?</i>

103
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:05,892
She was my daughter.

104
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,236
I'm sorry for your loss.

105
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,161
Our team has an update
on the shipment hack

106
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:18,780
we obtained
from Mr. Alderson.

107
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,323
It appears it will grant us

108
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,501
the clearance we need
by the end of the year.

109
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:23,576
It's October now,

110
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,004
so that's two more months
we'll have to wait.

111
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,884
Just in time
for the holidays.

112
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:40,810
What is it?

113
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:45,357
Mr. Alderson is
a good-for-nothing wretch

114
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,025
that is not to be trusted.

115
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:49,519
Oh, Wang Shu,
you needn't worry.

116
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,938
Once our project ships,
he'll have served his purpose

117
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,699
and then he can
be terminated.

118
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:58,361
In the meantime, he needs
to be kept on a short leash

119
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:02,707
and trained
not to bite his master.

120
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:04,876
Very well, then.

121
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,622
Send him a reminder
of what's at stake,

122
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:12,801
should there be
any interference.

123
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,806
I hope you enjoy
your last Christmas,

124
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:28,233
my dear Elliot.

125
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:10,894
And then she says to me,

126
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,079
"I don't think
that's the North Pole."

127
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,458
Freddy,
got a package for you.

128
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:19,460
And I got a package for you.

129
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,631
That's not funny.

130
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,758
Can we at least get
the Secret Santa going?

131
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:27,593
It's already 8:00.

132
00:11:31,132 --> 00:11:32,140
Fred?

133
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,529
Come on, we gotta
start wrapping it up.

134
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:40,690
My babysitter
keeps texting me.

135
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,702
Just a sec.

136
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:52,285
<i>Oh, that's great.</i>

137
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,495
<i>Can you say it again?</i>

138
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,122
<i>What?</i>

139
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,802
<i>Can you tell me you like me?</i>

140
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,297
<i>I like you.</i>

141
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,642
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

142
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,730
<i>Uh, I love you.</i>

143
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,807
<i>Okay.</i>

144
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:20,980
<i>Maybe, uh, stand up,
turn around, and say it again.</i>

145
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,815
<i>You want me to stand up?</i>

146
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,409
<i>Yeah.</i>

147
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,336
<i>How ya doin', Freddy?</i>

148
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,171
<i>Not too good?
That's okay. I get it.</i>

149
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,339
<i>Jerking off to underage girls</i>

150
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,216
<i>on live video chats
is one thing.</i>

151
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:51,511
<i>When it's played back, though,
kinda loses its magic.</i>

152
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:53,346
- Who is this?
- <i>Check your email.</i>

153
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,181
<i>You should have received
a message from me.</i>

154
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,353
<i>Need you to open the email
and click on the link.</i>

155
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,113
You the one
that sent me the package?

156
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,856
Listen, please don't do this.

157
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,041
Look, I-I can pay.

158
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:08,027
<i>Open the email
and click on the link, Freddy.</i>

159
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,198
Okay, look, if... if this

160
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,200
is some sort
of a ransomware thing

161
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:17,370
or you're trying to get money
out of me, listen...

162
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,205
<i>You obviously don't know me,
because if you did,</i>

163
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,041
<i>you'd already know I don't
give a shit about money.</i>

164
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,251
<i>Do what I'm telling you,</i>

165
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,393
<i>or I'm sending the video
to the FBI.</i>

166
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:25,920
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

167
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,129
No.

168
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,382
Fred, I gotta go.

169
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,050
I'm just wrapping up
in here.

170
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:33,594
Then you have to ask Trish
to do the Secret Santa,

171
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:35,304
because I need to get home.

172
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,816
Okay, okay, fine.
Okay, good, yeah.

173
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:39,725
<i>Freddy, I need you
to pay attention.</i>

174
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,769
What are you doing in there?

175
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,729
Are you on the phone?

176
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:46,983
Merry Christmas,
and I'll... I'll see you in 2016!

177
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,569
<i>Open the email
and click on the link.</i>

178
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:52,405
You know, this isn't
gonna get past our IT guys.

179
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,407
<i>That's what I'm counting on.</i>

180
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:59,829
Okay, I just clicked it.

181
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,080
Are we done?

182
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,216
<i>Get the USB
from the envelope.</i>

183
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:07,169
<i>I left instructions
on how to archive your inbox.</i>

184
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,631
<i>Copy the .pst file
to the thumb drive.</i>

185
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,009
Inbox?

186
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,635
I'm an attorney, pal.

187
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:18,264
That inbox is full of sensitive
client information.

188
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,099
You hear me?

189
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,146
Hello?

190
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:28,608
<i>I was just taking a moment</i>

191
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,151
<i>to think about whether or not
I give a fuck.</i>

192
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:31,944
<i>I don't.</i>

193
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:37,533
♪ Oh, jingle bells,
jingle bells ♪

194
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,953
- ♪ Jingle all the way ♪
- All right, so...

195
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,955
what are you gonna do with
my emails once you do get 'em?

196
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,065
<i>Once you're finished,</i>

197
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:45,875
<i>leave all your personal
effects in your office:</i>

198
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,960
<i>your phone, your Fitbit,
your smartwatch,</i>

199
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:49,629
<i>anything with
an on-off switch,</i>

200
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:51,797
<i>then bring the USB drive
to Grand Central.</i>

201
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,633
You know, this isn't
just gonna destroy me.

202
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,302
It's gonna destroy
the people that work for me,

203
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:59,472
my firm,
their families, everyone.

204
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:00,506
<i>Keep this phone on you.</i>

205
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,309
<i>Expect another call
when you get there.</i>

206
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,687
Who the fuck is this?

207
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:10,149
<i>This is Mr. Robot.</i>

208
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,592
I'll load it up for ya.

209
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,178
Taxi!

210
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,525
42nd and Lex,
Grand Central.

211
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,026
<i>Increase by 20%</i>

212
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,070
- <i>this holiday season.</i>
- <i>Can you believe that?</i>

213
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:58,406
<i>Not long ago, we were talking
about an economic collapse</i>

214
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:00,366
<i>on par with
the Great Depression.</i>

215
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,034
<i>Especially hard to believe</i>

216
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,203
<i>given the November jobs report
that was released on Friday.</i>

217
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:07,123
<i>Over 400,000 jobs
were added.</i>

218
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,083
<i>This really shows
the resilience of E Corp</i>

219
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,210
<i>and their CEO,
Tyrell Wellick.</i>

220
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,212
<i>If it weren't
for their data recovery</i>

221
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,047
<i>and their Ecoin loan program,</i>

222
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:16,924
<i>we wouldn't be enjoying
the turnaround</i>

223
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,801
<i>we're experiencing right now.</i>

224
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,553
<i>A quote from the chair
of the Federal Reserve</i>

225
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,388
<i>seems to echo public opinion:</i>

226
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,391
<i>"Sometimes the good guys
really do come out on top."</i>

227
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,563
All right.

228
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:53,169
Hey.

229
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,005
<i>Walk to the furthest kiosk.</i>

230
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,276
Get in line.

231
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,461
<i>Okay.</i>

232
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,205
I'm, uh... I'm here.

233
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,956
I'm in line.

234
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,004
Don't get freaked out.

235
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,297
You're being tailed.

236
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,466
What?
Why?

237
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,009
They want to know
who you're meeting.

238
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,472
<i>I'll take care of them.</i>

239
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:47,973
- Right now...
- Okay.

240
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,141
I need you
to stop looking around

241
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:50,559
like you're
a coked-up Henry Hill.

242
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:55,448
Well, I-I-I actually
did some.

243
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:58,150
- What?
- Yeah, some blow, you know.

244
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,653
Uh, some of the girls
had some at the party,

245
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:01,987
and I... you know,
the Christmas party.

246
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,739
- <i>A little or a lot?</i>
- What?

247
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,325
How much did you do,
a little or a lot?

248
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,326
Shit, man, I don't know.

249
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:09,662
Right now, it seems like
a fucking lot, okay?

250
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,497
Take a breath, Freddy.

251
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:12,998
We're gonna get through this.

252
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:19,672
Wait a second.
Where are you, anyway?

253
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:22,258
As far as you're concerned,
I'm everywhere.

254
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,884
What does that even mean?

255
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:27,179
It means I own
the entire station.

256
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,283
Buy a ticket home.

257
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,944
No, don't want these guys
to know where I live.

258
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,747
Trust me, Freddy,
they already know.

259
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,409
All right, uh, I'd like a...

260
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:50,336
first train
to Brewster, please.

261
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:53,722
Okay, I got it.

262
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,541
All right, now you're gonna
head to the train,

263
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:56,876
but we're gonna
take the long way.

264
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:58,711
<i>Want you to walk
past the clock</i>

265
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,379
<i>and go towards
the Hudson News.</i>

266
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:07,887
Take out all your cash.

267
00:19:07,922 --> 00:19:09,722
Give it to the guy
in the Santa hat.

268
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,152
Why?

269
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,231
We gotta buy time.

270
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:20,900
Fold it into a ball,

271
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,277
<i>make a fist,
toss it in the case.</i>

272
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,667
<i>Don't stop.
Keep going.</i>

273
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:32,253
Make a right
and head to the tracks.

274
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:34,580
Hey, hey, hey.

275
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:35,414
Hey, hey,
that's my money.

276
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,422
<i>Track 19,
last car on the right.</i>

277
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:46,300
So you have been
following me, haven't you?

278
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:48,302
<i>No, I've been waiting...</i>

279
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,929
For you on the train.

280
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,121
Who the fuck are you?

281
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,674
Thought I answered
that already.

282
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,970
Don't think you need
the phone anymore.

283
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,800
Sit down and give me the drive.

284
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,016
Yeah, first
you're gonna give me

285
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:38,477
all the copies
of that video you have.

286
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:45,484
You gonna shoot me
in front of all these people?

287
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,325
Put the gun away, Freddy,
and sit down.

288
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,343
I'm serious.

289
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:57,037
I'm not afraid
to use this if I have to.

290
00:20:57,114 --> 00:21:00,040
And then that video will
not only be automatically sent

291
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:02,468
to the FBI
but to your wife and kids.

292
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:06,138
Is that something
you're afraid of?

293
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:10,884
Sit down.
Give me the drive.

294
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:25,858
So we're square, right?

295
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,827
You gonna erase
that video?

296
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:30,863
I mean, it goes without saying.

297
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,532
I can't have
anyone seeing that.

298
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,743
Look, I'll tell you what:

299
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:37,411
you keep that drive.

300
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:39,580
That'll show you how much
I trust you, huh?

301
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:40,481
You understand me, man?

302
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,842
I'm trusting that
your word is good?

303
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:45,711
I'm gonna head on back
to the office.

304
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:46,879
Sit down.

305
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:48,714
We're not done.

306
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,221
Do you know
who those guys were,

307
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:58,316
the ones who were
following me?

308
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,110
Dark Army.

309
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:03,604
Jesus Christ.

310
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,490
What the fuck were those guys
doing following me?

311
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,067
They want to know who
you're giving these files to.

312
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:09,251
Why?

313
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:11,662
Because they're protecting
one of your clients.

314
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,405
What client?

315
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:14,999
Whiterose.

316
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,450
What the fuck
are you talking about, man?

317
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:17,659
Who's that?

318
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,577
You know her as Zhi Zhang,

319
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:20,954
the Chinese minister
of state security.

320
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:22,247
He and his partners
have been using

321
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:24,917
shell corporations
to move money around,

322
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:28,253
and your name keeps popping up
on all their company filings.

323
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,755
Oh, shit.

324
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,432
That's what this is about?

325
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,135
I'm a dead man.

326
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:37,513
I need to know how you've
been helping them funnel money.

327
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,274
Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't
want to fuck with these guys.

328
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:44,311
If half the shit
that I've seen is real,

329
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:47,106
then these guys are
the official fucking bogeymen.

330
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:50,442
And I'm not talking conspiracy
bullshit either, man.

331
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:53,112
I mean,
these guys are pure evil.

332
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:55,498
I'm kind of ahead of you
on that point.

333
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:01,453
Cyprus National Bank.

334
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,092
That's it.

335
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:08,669
That's their bank.

336
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,965
Tell me what you know about it.

337
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,803
I don't know shit, man, okay?

338
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:20,139
The reason they even
hire peons like me

339
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:21,565
is 'cause I'm willing
to look the other way

340
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:23,734
and push the right papers
for 'em,

341
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:26,812
small stuff,
incorporation documents.

342
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:27,829
Look at me.
I'm a dumb shit.

343
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:29,648
You think they're gonna
tell me anything?

344
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:46,665
I may have...
a contact in the city.

345
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,004
Who?

346
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,675
Stop fucking around, man.

347
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,886
We don't have a lot of time.

348
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:00,312
Give me the name.

349
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,391
John Garcin.

350
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:05,276
Where can I find him?

351
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:07,686
Well, I don't have
the address on me.

352
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:11,449
I-I gotta go
back to my office.

353
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,868
I told you to leave
all your electronics.

354
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,244
I did.

355
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,079
I don't... I don't
have anything on me.

356
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:27,506
Look, I have nothing.

357
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:42,221
Go straight
to the 42nd Street exit

358
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:43,764
and wait for my call.

359
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,890
Don't stop.
Don't turn around.

360
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:46,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're leaving me?

361
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,237
If they see us together,
we're both dead.

362
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:53,148
Go.

363
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,712
Meet me at the corner
of 42nd and Vanderbilt.

364
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:49,788
<i>Okay.</i>

365
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:50,664
Then what?

366
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:53,542
Still need
Garcin's address.

367
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,544
Oh, no, you gotta be
fucking crazy.

368
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,554
I'm not going
back to my office.

369
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,130
<i>Those guys are gonna
be looking for me there.</i>

370
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,481
Let me worry about that.

371
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:03,302
Listen, I want your word that
if I give you what you want,

372
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:04,803
you're gonna
destroy that video.

373
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,055
You are in no position
to negotiate right now.

374
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,140
Just fucking move.

375
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,683
Then I want your word!

376
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,476
If we don't get out of here,
I'm not gonna be the one

377
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:13,237
you need to worry about,
you understand?

378
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:14,813
I am your only way out of this.

379
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,982
<i>And just how the fuck
are you gonna protect me</i>

380
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,650
<i>against the Dark Army, huh?</i>

381
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,152
Those guys just saw me
running away from them.

382
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,154
They know that
I'm up to something.

383
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:33,999
Oh, you can't...

384
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:36,543
protect me,

385
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,919
can you?

386
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:44,351
Freddy?

387
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,180
Jesus Christ.

388
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:51,609
You don't give a shit
what happens to me.

389
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:54,936
Freddy, we don't have time
for this.

390
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,855
You need to snap out of it.

391
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:59,900
<i>They are still
coming for you, man.</i>

392
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,620
<i>You need to make it to this
fucking corner right now.</i>

393
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,031
<i>Right now, Freddy.</i>

394
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,627
Freddy, you need
to keep moving.

395
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:13,705
Hello?

396
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,842
Just don't send
that video to my kids.

397
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,545
Freddy!

398
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,928
Freddy?

399
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,012
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

400
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:39,898
We need room here.
We need room.

401
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:41,066
Hey, listen...

402
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,401
Taking pictures
right now, lady?

403
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:44,152
What are you gonna do
with them? Come on.

404
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,405
Put it down. Back up.

405
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:57,174
Jesus Christ.

406
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,190
Today's gonna be
another busy one

407
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,003
because of the cyber bombings
memorial brunch.

408
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,370
The board of directors
would like you to do

409
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,899
some PR interviews today
before you head upstairs.

410
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:14,687
Our media consultant
is going to debrief you

411
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:16,580
with some talking points
back in the greenroom

412
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,520
before we put you
into hair and makeup.

413
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,689
You have about five minutes
before your meeting

414
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,816
with Mr. Milligan
and his team.

415
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:24,443
Thank you, Elizabeth.

416
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,027
Oh, that's not all.

417
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,779
After that, you have
a meeting with the board.

418
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:30,657
It's more of a meet and greet,
then straight into a meeting

419
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:33,618
with the Ecoin engineering team
to discuss the new rollout.

420
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:34,619
And tonight the board
would like...

421
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:36,872
Can we just...

422
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,207
push any of this
until tomorrow?

423
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,553
No, I'm afraid tomorrow's
already full as well.

424
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,715
Can you just
give me a minute?

425
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,226
Certainly, sir.

426
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,517
Congratulations.

427
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,811
I've been meaning to tell you
that for a while now,

428
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:02,355
but I wanted to give you
your space.

429
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:06,285
Most of us here consider you
a hero for what you did.

430
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:11,967
Mom?

431
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:04,644
Dom?
You up yet, hon?

432
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:07,439
I'm heading out to go
mall walking with Janice,

433
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:10,701
you know, that lovely girl I
met at church a few weeks ago?

434
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:14,037
I want you to meet her.

435
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:16,415
I think you two
would really hit it off.

436
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,492
Seriously, Dom?

437
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:21,453
It's almost noon.
You're still in your PJs.

438
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,422
What gives?

439
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:26,592
You all right?

440
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:28,668
What's he doing here?

441
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:32,339
I told you last week I was
renovating the master bathroom.

442
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:34,057
What's the big deal?

443
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,471
What's the matter
with you?

444
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,684
I thought we agreed I would
vet everyone you hired.

445
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:47,145
Oh.

446
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:49,189
Hon, I thought you were kidding
like you do.

447
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:51,316
Listen,
I'm glad you're up.

448
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,817
I want you to put a load in

449
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:55,028
so you have something to wear
to the bake sale later.

450
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:58,490
Janice is coming over after
for some macaroni and gravy.

451
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,792
You're just gonna
leave this guy here alone?

452
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,754
He's not alone.
You're here.

453
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:48,966
This John Garcin
practically posts

454
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:49,791
every shit he takes.

455
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,575
It's gonna take forever

456
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,469
to go through
his social media.

457
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,912
I know we have our issues,

458
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,090
but it's these people
that are the real psychos.

459
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,685
I mean, how proud
of your life can you be?

460
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:03,763
We have his address.

461
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,482
We should just go.

462
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,767
We'll get the info
we need there.

463
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:10,603
It's too early for that.
We don't know enough.

464
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,823
He's their liaison
at Cyprus National Bank.

465
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,492
He's gotta have something.

466
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,235
Be that as it may,
we can't just knock

467
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,280
on this guy's door and pretty
please ask him for his access,

468
00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:23,241
so we put our heads down,
do the research,

469
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:26,286
find a way to break him,
same as always.

470
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:28,079
Took us two weeks
with Freddy.

471
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:30,123
We can't wait
that long anymore.

472
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,251
We're running
out of time.

473
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:35,795
By next week, Whiterose
will ship her project.

474
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:37,848
We'll be dead.

475
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:39,924
I'm not gonna
argue that with you.

476
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:42,135
Freddy could have saved us
a lot of time

477
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:43,353
if his brains
weren't splattered

478
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,930
all over 42nd Street
right now.

479
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,687
He had it coming.

480
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,272
They all do.

481
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,222
Don't do this
for the wrong reasons.

482
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,635
You're angry,
and I get it.

483
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:25,970
But your anger is keeping you
from seeing

484
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:29,483
the bigger picture
of why we started this thing.

485
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,357
You told me once

486
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:39,484
you don't
take down a conglomerate

487
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,986
by shooting them in the heart,

488
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:43,955
'cause they don't have hearts.

489
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:47,584
You were wrong.

490
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:51,379
We found their heart.

491
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:59,838
We rob it...

492
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:02,715
she finally goes down.

493
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:04,518
What am I not seeing?

494
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,731
This used to be
about saving the world.

495
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:12,776
You're making it too personal.

496
00:35:12,853 --> 00:35:15,854
You're making this
about what they did to Angela.

497
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,357
You're letting your feelings
cloud your judgment.

498
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:21,451
My feelings?

499
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:24,445
See what's going on
out there?

500
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:28,366
People are already
forgetting about Five/Nine,

501
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:30,743
the cyber bombings.

502
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:36,541
They're buying their Ecoin
discounted stocking stuffers

503
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:39,636
and Christmas hams,
and they're gonna forget.

504
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:42,430
And I don't blame them.

505
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:45,851
They're exhausted.

506
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:49,479
I'm exhausted.

507
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:52,724
But we let this go,

508
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:54,601
it'll be back
to business as usual

509
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:57,437
for Whiterose
and her friends.

510
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:00,448
The more she gets away
with this, the worse this gets.

511
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:04,494
So fuck my feelings.

512
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,499
I'm done with
the therapy sessions.

513
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:21,761
This is all I'm focused on.

514
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:39,321
It's Darlene.

515
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:43,200
She says
it's about Angela.

516
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:50,373
Oh, my God,
thanks for calling me back.

517
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,451
Um, I think I figured it out.

518
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:56,046
Okay, I am... I am
really onto something.

519
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:57,214
Just wait until you hear this.

520
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,040
It's kind of a breakthrough.

521
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,884
Where's Flipper?

522
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:04,504
Uh, the landlord took her
for the week.

523
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,839
Why? What are you
too busy with?

524
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:09,467
What's going on, Darlene?
What are you doing here?

525
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,304
I think I saw Angela.

526
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:25,358
We talked
about this already.

527
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:27,577
Angela's gone.

528
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:30,488
Are you on something right now?

529
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:33,491
<i>Don't</i> make this
about that, okay?

530
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,703
Just listen to me.

531
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:40,164
Okay, I need you
to hear this.

532
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,166
I'm listening.

533
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:45,545
Okay, um,
I was... I was walking by

534
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:49,215
one of those shelters,
and I think I saw her.

535
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,509
Okay, I-I-I-I tried
to catch up with her,

536
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:54,053
but it was... it was crowded
and I lost her,

537
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,389
but... okay,
but this is proof, right?

538
00:37:56,466 --> 00:37:57,515
This is proof.

539
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,684
Maybe this is why
they never found her body.

540
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,185
Maybe she's still alive.

541
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:02,603
That's not possible.

542
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,616
No, I am telling you
I saw her.

543
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:09,619
She was on the street,
same red cart, same bathrobe,

544
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:11,529
exactly the way we saw her
in that security footage

545
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:12,530
before she got into that van.

546
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:14,407
- Darlene.
- Maybe she escaped.

547
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:16,534
I swear I saw her.

548
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,369
Maybe if you would
just help me,

549
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,204
we could find her together;
we just need to canvass

550
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:21,956
- all of the homeless shelters.
- This has to stop.

551
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,751
Elliot, we can't
give up on her, okay?

552
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:25,543
We can't.

553
00:38:25,578 --> 00:38:27,920
You did
a little too much coke

554
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:29,881
and you saw something
that wasn't there.

555
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:31,591
I will show you
where I saw her.

556
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:32,750
Just come with me.

557
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:35,928
Look at you, man.
You are so fucked up right now.

558
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:37,889
Fuck you.

559
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:40,975
This is exactly what you do
when shit like this happens.

560
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,435
You shut down.

561
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,562
Angela's dead.

562
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,564
Do you understand?

563
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,325
She's fucking dead.

564
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,041
And it's not our fault.

565
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:01,287
We tried to help her,
remember?

566
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:03,506
She did this to herself.

567
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:09,253
You have to stop
feeling guilty.

568
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,426
I'm not the one
that feels guilty.

569
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:32,610
Why didn't you just show her
the photo Whiterose sent to us?

570
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:37,782
You mean the one with
Angela's brains blown out.

571
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,326
Yeah, no,
I don't think so.

572
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:45,048
At least it would have
put her out of her misery.

573
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:55,633
It'd break her heart.

574
00:40:02,341 --> 00:40:04,142
We need to get back to work.

575
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,072
John Garcin should be
our only focus.

576
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:29,208
<i>I know we don't
usually do this,</i>

577
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:33,045
<i>but I have to fill you in
if he won't.</i>

578
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:36,766
<i>That's why you're back,
isn't it, to help?</i>

579
00:40:36,843 --> 00:40:39,760
<i>You gotta be noticing it,
then, too,</i>

580
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,272
<i>that he's not talking to you.</i>

581
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:45,183
<i>He doesn't talk to me
that much either,</i>

582
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:47,068
<i>not since Angela died.</i>

583
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:50,271
<i>Darlene's right.</i>

584
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,106
<i>He's shutting down,</i>

585
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,734
<i>compartmentalizing the pain,</i>

586
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,529
<i>living in the distraction,</i>

587
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:01,032
<i>just like the holidays:</i>

588
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:06,704
<i>the fake Santas,
the plastic trees,</i>

589
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,298
<i>the annoying
Christmas carols...</i>

590
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:11,801
♪ O come,
all ye faithful ♪

591
00:41:11,878 --> 00:41:13,970
<i>One big
song-and-dance production</i>

592
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:17,381
<i>to sell ourselves the theater
that everything's jolly,</i>

593
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:20,384
<i>at least for a moment.</i>

594
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,386
<i>But when it's all over,</i>

595
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:25,097
<i>Santa's gone back
to his shitty day job.</i>

596
00:41:25,174 --> 00:41:28,267
<i>The trees get disassembled
and thrown in a closet.</i>

597
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:30,228
<i>The music's faded away.</i>

598
00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:32,063
<i>What then?</i>

599
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:34,315
<i>That's why you can't
go anywhere.</i>

600
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,160
<i>I know he's keeping you away,
but I'll let you in.</i>

601
00:41:37,237 --> 00:41:38,903
<i>Don't think I'm doing it
for you, though.</i>

602
00:41:38,938 --> 00:41:40,279
<i>Let's be clear.</i>

603
00:41:40,356 --> 00:41:42,332
<i>I still don't give
a shit about you,</i>

604
00:41:42,408 --> 00:41:43,833
<i>but he does.</i>

605
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,451
This does not
feel right to me.

606
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:47,378
E Corp owns the building.

607
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,166
They own
half of Manhattan.

608
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,585
We stick to the plan.

609
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,755
<i>And right now, Elliot needs
you more than he lets on,</i>

610
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,425
<i>because when that cold, brutal
reality closes in on us,</i>

611
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,019
<i>we're gonna need a friend,</i>

612
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:05,355
<i>and that's still what you are,
right?</i>

613
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,873
Um, a delivery

614
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,669
for John Garcin
in apartment 7C.

615
00:42:46,973 --> 00:42:49,056
Seventh floor
to the right of the elevator.

616
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,067
Thank you.

617
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,912
This goes sideways,

618
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:04,914
We don't have enough
information to break this guy.

619
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:06,023
We're just gonna
own his Wi-Fi.

620
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:09,577
That'll grab us whatever
we need without him knowing.

621
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:16,417
Is it just me,
or is this

622
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,337
the quietest building
in all of Manhattan?

623
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,246
Hello!

624
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,207
Anybody home?

625
00:43:59,545 --> 00:44:01,888
Let's check things out
before he comes back.

626
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:05,216
That wasn't the plan.

627
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:07,927
We're only supposed
to own his Wi-Fi.

628
00:44:08,003 --> 00:44:09,136
Are you kidding?

629
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,981
He's not here.
We just got lucky.

630
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:14,058
Search everything.

631
00:44:58,888 --> 00:45:00,938
Something's not right.

632
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:01,864
No shit.

633
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:03,441
Ah, fuck.

634
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:04,650
Did you lock the door?

635
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:05,952
No.

636
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:08,913
Signal's dead in here.

637
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:11,615
They're jamming it.

638
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,456
Shit.

639
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:39,569
Phone's dead.

640
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:43,898
- It's almost as if...
- There is no John Garcin.

641
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,910
Freddy set us up.

642
00:45:58,498 --> 00:46:01,299
It must have been a distress
signal they gave Freddy.

643
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:09,173
Place is a honeypot.

644
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:14,405
No!

645
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:15,823
Let me go!

646
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,992
Stop! Let me go!

647
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:21,274
Wait! Wait!

648
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:35,712
So Father DiMarco spills
his potato salad all over her,

649
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:37,761
which I actually think
he did on purpose

650
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:41,683
because Sister Merkin has,
you know, those big tatas

651
00:47:41,714 --> 00:47:43,192
underneath all that
black and white.

652
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:44,184
Ma, come on.

653
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,644
Oh, get over it.

654
00:47:45,721 --> 00:47:47,438
She's a hottie.

655
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:49,356
I've seen you check her out
once or twice.

656
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,525
Janice, right, are you with me?

657
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:54,537
Sister Merkin is a ten,
am I right?

658
00:47:54,614 --> 00:47:59,283
Uh, s-she's
quite attractive, yes.

659
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:02,703
See, Janice agrees.

660
00:48:06,408 --> 00:48:07,875
Oh...

661
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,043
Look at the time.

662
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,219
I gotta get to bed.

663
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:12,129
I'm seeing Dr. Passante
in the morning

664
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:14,006
for that thing
on my neck.

665
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:16,884
Dom, hon?

666
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,770
Why don't you help Janice
carry out the leftovers?

667
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,223
It's just
some macaroni.

668
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,725
Dominique,
don't embarrass me.

669
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:25,776
Go on and help.

670
00:48:39,158 --> 00:48:40,824
Oh.

671
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,868
Uh, my apologies.

672
00:48:42,945 --> 00:48:44,662
I forget how frightened

673
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:46,080
people can be of them
the first time.

674
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,924
I'm a taxidermist.

675
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,416
Uh, I wasn't frightened,

676
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,877
just a little unexpected
is all.

677
00:48:55,675 --> 00:48:57,183
Taxidermy, huh?

678
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,603
Guess you were into
stuffed animals as a kid?

679
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:06,609
Not particularly, no.

680
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:14,784
Well, um, it was
nice meeting you, Janice.

681
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,781
And, uh, I'm sorry
about all this.

682
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,458
All what?

683
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:27,630
I think my mom
was trying to, you know...

684
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:28,798
set us up.

685
00:49:30,826 --> 00:49:32,251
Oh, my, I had no...

686
00:49:32,327 --> 00:49:33,961
Oh!

687
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,796
I...

688
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,140
Oh, this is...
this is terribly awkward.

689
00:49:38,217 --> 00:49:41,802
Uh, I-I-I-I think she might
have gotten the wrong idea.

690
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:42,979
It's all good.

691
00:49:43,055 --> 00:49:44,263
I'm on a self-imposed
time-out anyway.

692
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:45,147
Okay.

693
00:49:45,224 --> 00:49:48,142
My ma, she's just
trying to cheer me up.

694
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,059
She thought
this would help.

695
00:49:49,094 --> 00:49:50,477
Yeah, she said
you'd been through

696
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,154
kind of a rough patch.

697
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:54,448
Bet she did.

698
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:58,160
Um...

699
00:49:58,237 --> 00:49:58,995
It's not a big deal.

700
00:49:59,071 --> 00:49:59,903
It's just
a promotion at work

701
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:01,739
has been a lot
of stress is all.

702
00:50:01,774 --> 00:50:03,449
Yeah, she said
you haven't been sleeping,

703
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:07,619
and she told me
about the drinking, mm.

704
00:50:07,696 --> 00:50:10,289
Oh, I hope I'm not
speaking out of school.

705
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:13,000
I-I-I just meant to say
I've been there

706
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:15,127
with work, you know.

707
00:50:15,204 --> 00:50:16,512
Long hours can
really burn you out,

708
00:50:16,589 --> 00:50:17,847
especially in my field.

709
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,676
But I'm here to talk,
if you want.

710
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:23,536
Sometimes that can help.

711
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:26,180
Yeah.
Anyway, I should get to bed.

712
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,181
Good night, Janice.

713
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,766
Yeah, that's a good idea.

714
00:50:28,842 --> 00:50:30,142
You need your rest.

715
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:31,101
After all, you have
that interview

716
00:50:31,136 --> 00:50:33,404
about the Santiago case
in the morning.

717
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,539
Excuse me?

718
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,533
You've put it off for weeks.

719
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,161
It's starting
to look suspicious.

720
00:50:54,493 --> 00:50:56,043
What did you say?

721
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:59,630
I was just explaining that
unless you go to work tomorrow

722
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:02,132
and finish cleaning up
Santiago's mess,

723
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:03,550
then I'm gonna be forced

724
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,137
to do something
very bad to your mother,

725
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:10,900
like, really bad,
you know?

726
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:15,229
Like, I'm probably gonna have
to slit her from mouth to cunt.

727
00:51:20,185 --> 00:51:22,244
You touch my mom,

728
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:23,987
I will strangle you to death.

729
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:26,198
You understand me?

730
00:51:30,362 --> 00:51:33,163
Oh, you can strangle me
till the cows come home.

731
00:51:33,198 --> 00:51:35,332
That's not gonna stop
the rest of 'em.

732
00:51:47,963 --> 00:51:50,597
Now, you get that rest
we talked about.

733
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,100
You got a big day tomorrow.

734
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:56,353
Oh, and would you thank your
mom for me for the macaroni?

735
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:13,704
Real life, yo.

736
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:15,706
I'm just saying,
the skullduggery of scientists

737
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:18,250
led us to this point
in believing this bullshit.

738
00:52:18,327 --> 00:52:19,485
What bullshit,
exactly?

739
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:22,921
That the Earth is a sphere
when it so clearly is flat.

740
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:27,426
See, you ain't even
willing to question it.

741
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:29,761
- That's how they get you.
- If the Earth's flat,

742
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:32,723
then how come no one's
ever fallen off the side?

743
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:35,475
Easy answer:
Antarctica.

744
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,904
Whoever lives here
has to be fucking mental.

745
00:52:40,182 --> 00:52:41,565
Dar.

746
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,150
What's up?

747
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:45,068
I just got here.

748
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,573
Please tell me
you have something stronger.

749
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:51,575
Hmm, stronger than what?

750
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,327
Anything
I've already taken.

751
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:58,123
That's what's up.
I got you.

752
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,627
Shit, girl, you didn't even
let me tell you what it was.

753
00:53:01,703 --> 00:53:04,004
Why the fuck is someone
in Angela's bedroom?

754
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,589
Who's Angela?

755
00:53:05,624 --> 00:53:09,968
Oh, Prada, YSL, Chloé,

756
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:11,803
ballet shoes,

757
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,524
and a bunch of fish food
with no fucking fish.

758
00:53:15,601 --> 00:53:17,476
Smells like some
"American Psycho" shit's

759
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:18,769
going on here.

760
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:23,482
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking Mary Poppins whore!

761
00:53:23,558 --> 00:53:25,317
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

762
00:53:25,394 --> 00:53:26,693
The fuck did you give me?

763
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,320
Babe, you need to chill.

764
00:53:28,397 --> 00:53:30,322
- Fuck you.
- What?

765
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:32,282
Get out.

766
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:33,659
Get out.

767
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:36,536
Get the fuck out
right now!

768
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,331
Everybody, out!

769
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:42,000
Out!
Get the fuck out!

770
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,462
Go!

771
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:48,840
Get the fuck out!

772
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,468
Get the fuck out!

773
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:59,619
Is she listening?

774
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,039
Of course she is.
She always is.

775
00:55:02,115 --> 00:55:04,875
Was that her
in the SUV outside?

776
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,793
You tell her if she
goes through with this,

777
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,378
my shipping hack goes public.

778
00:55:08,413 --> 00:55:10,088
She won't be able
to move shit.

779
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:14,426
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

780
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:15,418
Listen to me.

781
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:18,930
The people you work for,
they're terrorists.

782
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:21,266
They don't care about you
or any of us.

783
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,226
I know you don't
want to do this.

784
00:55:23,303 --> 00:55:24,394
You're just getting paid to.

785
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:28,032
Please, I can't
leave like this.

786
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,278
I've hurt so many people.

787
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,541
I have to make this right.

788
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:47,459
Wait. Wait.

789
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,086
No.

790
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:51,963
You tell her if I die,
this won't be over.

791
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,850
I know all about
Cyprus National Bank.

792
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:58,929
Her money's as good as gone.

793
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:01,306
Even if I die...

794
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:04,476
She's gonna pay
for what she's done.

795
00:56:09,057 --> 00:56:10,866
Do you hear me?

796
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:15,278
You tell that piece of shit
that my anger won't die with me

797
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:18,615
and she can't hide
from what's coming for her!

798
00:56:18,692 --> 00:56:20,617
You hear me?

799
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:22,586
You hear me?

800
00:56:23,738 --> 00:56:25,455
Do you hear me?

801
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:33,505
Say something.

802
00:56:40,589 --> 00:56:43,348
Good-bye, friend.

803
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:27,044
He got too reckless.

804
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,623
Your job was to control him.

805
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,083
My job was
to protect him.

806
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:35,627
Your job was
to protect all of us.

807
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:37,587
What's gonna happen?

808
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:40,840
The inevitable.

809
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,259
We're all gonna go away.

810
00:58:48,784 --> 00:58:51,193
I just didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

811
01:00:35,657 --> 01:00:38,416
Hmm.

812
01:00:38,493 --> 01:00:41,956
Welcome back, Mr. Alderson.

813
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:47,020

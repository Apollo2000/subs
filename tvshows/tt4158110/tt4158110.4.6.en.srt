1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:03,525
- Unless you go to work
tomorrow, I'm gonna be forced

2
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:04,961
to do something very bad
to your mother.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,093
- Give me your phone.

4
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:07,877
I rigged Signal's API

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,835
to beam GPS coords
so we can share locations.

6
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:12,664
- My whole life is ruined
because of you.

7
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,102
All you deserve
is pure and utter agony.

8
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,017
- Olivia was
Susan Jacobs' contact.

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,322
- She's an addict.

10
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,107
If she gets caught using,
she loses her kid.

11
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,282
I'm not like most people.

12
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:22,805
- I'm starting
to pick up on that.

13
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:25,068
My mom got killed.
Murdered, actually.

14
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,939
- Olivia's access
isn't good enough.

15
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,376
- You know why
we came back here, right?

16
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:29,899
- So you could be king
of New York.

17
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:31,074
- And in order
for our kingdom to be built,

18
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:32,902
I need a brilliant architect.

19
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,687
- I'm trying to help him.
- You're trying to destroy me.

20
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,298
I'm done talking to you.

21
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,864
- One of your patients
hacked me.

22
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:41,215
- Krista.
- I don't feel safe around you.

23
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,130
- She knows something
I gotta know.

24
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,045
It's time we talked.

25
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:51,007
I'm gonna tell you a story.

26
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,966
A story
of a true "Xmas" miracle.

27
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,796
This is the tale of a bully

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,060
and a little bitch.

29
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,238
I'm talking about
a mean, nasty bully

30
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,415
and a scrawny-ass little bitch.

31
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,113
This bully
would pick on the little bitch

32
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,462
every day after school.

33
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,204
If little bitch had cash,
little bitch got robbed.

34
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,902
If little bitch bowed up,

35
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,991
little bitch got stomped.

36
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,173
Point I'm trying
to make here is,

37
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:29,437
this bully owned that bitch
like a Lincoln Continental,

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,006
but something happened
to change it all.

39
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,359
On this Xmas of our tale,

40
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:42,537
little bitch got lucky
with the gifts, see?

41
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,061
Something little bitch loved
more than anything

42
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:50,501
before family, God,
and country was...

43
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:53,287
baseball.

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,028
Loved the shit out of it.

45
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,769
Well,

46
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,902
on this Xmas morning

47
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:03,340
when he got out
of his little bedroom

48
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:07,127
and looked
under his little tree,

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,390
guess what he found.

50
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,528
- An Easton Magnum
aluminum baseball bat.

51
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:21,924
Little bitch grabbed that bat

52
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,579
and went right outside to play.

53
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:27,930
Didn't even take the bow off,
he was so excited.

54
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,933
And there he was
on the corner ball field,

55
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,544
hitting balls
like he was Sammy Sosa

56
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,417
when...

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,463
his bully comes up,

58
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,422
eyeing that bat.

59
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:48,907
And just as the bully
made his way up to him,

60
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,259
without any warning...

61
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,609
bam!

62
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:56,480
Blood.

63
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,962
Fuckin' everywhere.

64
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,138
Blood on the ground,

65
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,880
blood on little bitch,

66
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:08,971
blood dripping down the bow
still wrapped around that bat.

67
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,888
Little bitch
knocked every tooth out

68
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,151
of that motherfucker's head.

69
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,240
Cracked his skull open,

70
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:20,591
popped his eyeball out
on home plate.

71
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,948
- All because little bitch
saw the truth.

72
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:35,345
That bat may have been made
to play ball,

73
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,480
but that wasn't its purpose.

74
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,091
Nuh-uh.

75
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,963
In that moment
in little bitch's hands,

76
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,010
it was there to break
this nigga's head open.

77
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,975
See, Ms. Krista,

78
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,110
we all have a purpose
in this world,

79
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:05,027
and it's our lot in life
to wait for the cosmos

80
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,638
to reveal what that is.

81
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,299
But you don't have to look
no more...

82
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:23,263
'Cause for you,
that day has come.

83
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:29,138
Want to know why?

84
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:38,321
I'm gonna break Elliot...

85
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:41,281
and you gonna bemy aluminum bat.

86
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:01,736
- I'm, uhI'm on my way
to Olivia's now.

87
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,433
- How are we gonna
get to her boss?

88
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,956
We still need
his login credentials

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,393
to transfer the money.

90
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,265
- Don't worry about it.
I have a plan.

91
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,008
Did the proxy hack
at Virtual Realty check out?

92
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,010
- Yeah, we're good.

93
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,708
I'm seeing all the
unencrypted network traffic.

94
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,363
What about the venue
for this Deus Group shindig?

95
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,756
Do we know
where it's going down?

96
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,627
- Uh, Price sent me
the location.

97
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,673
It should be in your inbox.

98
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,370
There's a hotel
across the street

99
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,633
that we should work out of.

100
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,509
Are you there?

101
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,249
Darlene?

102
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,427
- Yeah.

103
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,214
- The other day, when...

104
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:50,132
I said that I should never
have let you back in my life...

105
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:53,440
I was an asshole.

106
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,530
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,447
- You still have my Signal mod
running on your phone, right?

108
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,145
- Yeah, why?

109
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:06,148
- Just be careful, okay?

110
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:10,152
Keep your phone on you
so I can see where you are.

111
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,328
I don't want to lose you again.

112
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,291
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,119
- II got to go.

114
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,485
- Elli.

115
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:42,053
Ah, long time no see, cuz.

116
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,664
Where do I knowthis place from?

117
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,492
- Do you have it?

118
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,494
Of course I got it, bro.

119
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,152
Under the table.

120
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,424
Where you going?

121
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,338
- I got to go.

122
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,514
- Damn, you just gon' leavelike that?

123
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,472
Thought we gonna catch up.

124
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,866
- Sorry, man,
II got shit to do.

125
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:17,088
Listen, just so you know,
I'm full-time freelance now.

126
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,526
Only loyalty
is to the almighty paper.

127
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,875
So hang on to my number.

128
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,529
Should you need anything,

129
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:25,183
you know I'm your guy.

130
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,620
You be strange, now,

131
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,839
but don't be a stranger,know what I mean?

132
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,629
Peace, Elli.

133
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,384
- We don't have to do this.

134
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,821
We can find a way
to talk to her.

135
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,518
- And if she says no?

136
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,346
Then we reason with her.

137
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,131
- And if she still says no?

138
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,177
We don't have timefor taking risks.

139
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,875
This is the only way.

140
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,532
- Hey. What you're about to do
is crossing a line.

141
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,448
- Well, it's a little latefor that, don't you think?

142
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,452
- He's right.

143
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,758
We used to have a code.

144
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:21,326
Lines we would not cross,
parameters we set.

145
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,286
Those seem to have been
seriously modified.

146
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,811
Question is, can we bring
those boundaries back?

147
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:30,727
Or is it like he said,
too late?

148
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,515
- Two large peppermint mochas.

149
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,343
- What were you doing
in Pike's Hollow this morning?

150
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,652
- How did you get in here?

151
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,872
- Where's your brother?

152
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,528
Did you take him somewhere?

153
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,488
Is he still in the city?

154
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,584
Okay.

155
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,638
Fuck, Darlene,
you should have kept driving.

156
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,335
- Who are you calling?

157
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,555
You can't call this into the FBI.

158
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,513
If the Dark Army finds outabout that crime scene,

159
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,514
they're gonna send someone

160
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,864
- They already did.

161
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,522
Have a seat.

162
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
- A guy who continually talks

163
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:31,266
to an invisible entity
that isn't there...

164
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,789
Has arguments with him.

165
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,878
The invisible entity
interrupts him sometimes.

166
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,536
Clorox.
- Market.

167
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,495
- How may I help you?
- I have her.

168
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,673
- Oh, well done.

169
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,762
And her brother?

170
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,852
- No, and she's not
giving him up.

171
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:54,289
- Uh-huh.

172
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:57,553
Well, that's not great.

173
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,425
Keep her close.
Let me run it up the flagpole.

174
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,253
Call you back in a bit.

175
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,343
- Return
of a biblical prophet,

176
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,780
Jan Matthys is preaching

177
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,651
death and repentance
before the Second Coming,

178
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,044
and those who are not part
of the chosen people...

179
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,393
- Hello, sweetheart.

180
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,916
- Are going to be
horribly killed.

181
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,968
- I brought peppermint mochas.

182
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,411
- They said it was Christmas
in a cup.

183
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,718
- Well, it is indeed Christmas.

184
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,636
Very sweet.

185
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,603
Do you want to come in?

186
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,084
- Yeah.

187
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,868
- Okay.

188
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,325
- What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound...

189
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,939
A little crazy.

190
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,466
- What's up?

191
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,602
- It's about your clients.

192
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,996
My clients?

193
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,957
- At Cyprus National Bank.

194
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:51,972
- I never told you
where I work.

195
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,104
- A bank
that primarily does business

196
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,977
with the Deus Group.

197
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,979
Whoa.

198
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,720
What the fuck is this?

199
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,634
- They're a criminal enterprise

200
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,507
that uses their power
and wealth to run the world

201
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,945
without anyone knowing it.

202
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,686
- Okay, I don't know
why you're

203
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,820
- Tiananmen Square,
civil war in the Congo,

204
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,692
both Iraq wars,

205
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,521
the paramilitary massacre
in El Salado...

206
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,527
The cyber bombings.

207
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,572
That's not even their top five.

208
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,403
- Okay...

209
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:35,798
You're really starting
to scare me.

210
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,975
Tell me what you're doing.
Why do you know where I work?

211
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:42,674
- I hacked you.

212
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:44,589
- Excuse me?

213
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,028
- I hacked you.

214
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:53,120
- Why?

215
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,731
- I need you to do something
for me.

216
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,169
- Whatwhat is this?

217
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,738
- I need you to make
one phone call to your boss.

218
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,871
I'm already on
their proxy server.

219
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:07,874
I just need him to log in
so I can swipe his credentials.

220
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,487
- I know this doesn't
make sense to you right now,

221
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,012
but trust me, Olivia...

222
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,667
they're using you.

223
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,713
They're using me?

224
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:25,587
- They are,
but I can stop them.

225
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,068
I can stop them
once and for all.

226
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,853
All I need is one phone call
from you.

227
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:37,817
- Get out.

228
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:43,083
- Don't do this.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

229
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,912
This conversation's over.

230
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,828
Get the fuck out.

231
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,525
Now.

232
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,689
- What happens
if you fail a drug test?

233
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,826
- What did you say?

234
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,220
- I know about
your custody battle.

235
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,835
If you test positive for Oxy

236
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,184
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

237
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,230
I'm eight years clean.

238
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,017
- No, you're not.

239
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,957
- You drugged me?

240
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,269
- I had to make sure
you would listen.

241
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:24,358
You're gonna call your boss
in Cyprus.

242
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,838
You're gonna get him to log in
to the bank website,

243
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,623
and that's it.

244
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,103
Then I'm gone.

245
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:43,203
If you don't do what I say...

246
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,988
you lose your son.

247
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,218
Why are you doing this?

248
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,269
- I was running out of time.

249
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,144
This was the fastest way
to convince you.

250
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,197
- This was taken one mile

251
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,286
from where the van
following Mr. Alderson

252
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,158
was found burned.

253
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,638
We have his sister,

254
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:30,250
but we're still searching
for him.

255
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,949
The minute we find him,

256
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,907
I think...

257
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,173
- You think what?

258
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:45,787
- It's time, Minister Zhang.

259
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,397
He's too much of a liability.

260
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,443
- Oh, you're being foolish.

261
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,748
If we kill him,

262
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,402
his shipping hack
dies with him.

263
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,275
- We have the Deus Group
meeting tonight.

264
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,103
- Think about
what you're saying.

265
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,148
- The entire membership
will be there.

266
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,323
It's too risky.

267
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:01,933
- I will not get this close

268
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:05,763
only to watch it
slip away again.

269
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:08,157
I want you
to locate Mr. Alderson

270
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,203
and bring him in.

271
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,335
He should see
the full potential

272
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,164
of what we're working towards.

273
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:22,345
It's time he learns
we're on the same side.

274
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,887
- Placemat.
- Bandit.

275
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,194
How's everything over there?

276
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,979
- Fine.
- Good news and bad news.

277
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,460
The higher-ups want Elliot,
not his sister.

278
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,463
I don't suppose she's
mentioned where he is yet?

279
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,900
- She wouldn't do that.

280
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,946
I heard her talking to him
earlier, though.

281
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,339
We can get his location
off her phone.

282
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,036
- Oh, interesting.

283
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,343
And you have her phone,
I assume.

284
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:06,389
- Yeah, I got it right here,
so we don't need her.

285
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,130
- Fantastic.

286
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,090
Well, then, I'll be there with
my team to collect the phone.

287
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:14,136
- And her?

288
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,486
- Kill her.

289
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,410
- What?

290
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,151
- You said it yourself.
We don't need her.

291
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,066
Cleaner this way.

292
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:38,160
You can handle that, right?

293
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,335
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:41,120
- Because I recall
the last time

295
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,425
you didn't feel 100

296
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,558
- No.

297
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,037
I'm fine.

298
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,518
- I'm just saying,
if you don't feel 100%

299
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:51,173
like last time, you should
let me know right now

300
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,566
so I can set aside the time

301
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:53,958
to kill your mother
and your entire family.

302
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:56,918
- No.

303
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:58,311
I can handle it.

304
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:02,402
- Great. I'll be there
at 3:30 on the dot.

305
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,317
Make sure it's done by then.

306
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,929
- What?

307
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,288
What did they say?

308
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,558
Fuck!
What the fuck?

309
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,952
Wait!

310
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,563
Wait! Fucking wait!

311
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,565
- Get up!

312
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:41,223
What the fuck are you doing?

313
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,964
- Keeping my family safe.

314
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,313
On your knees!

315
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:54,018
So this is it, then?

316
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,412
They tell you to kill me,
and you're just gonna do it?

317
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:57,979
- Your phone
gives them Elliot's location,

318
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,023
so they don't need you.

319
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,938
- This is crazy.This isn't you, Dom!

320
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,331
You don't need tofucking do this!

321
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,246
- I can't believe
you have the balls to say that.

322
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,639
You ruined my life.

323
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:07,118
- I did.I'll own that, okay?

324
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,468
But that doesn't make you this!

325
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,600
You don't just fuckingshoot people in cold blood!

326
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,299
- I'm here because of you.
- I know.

327
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:16,519
- You did this to me!
- I know!

328
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,347
Okay, you were right.

329
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,306
Okay? I was wrong.

330
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,177
Give me a chanceto make it right.

331
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,223
I can get you out of this.

332
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,181
- There's no way out.
- I have a plan.

333
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,183
- You think I give a shit
about your plan?

334
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,098
- We are gonna take downthe Dark Army once and for all.

335
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,143
It's happening tonight.

336
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,450
- It's too late.

337
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:37,105
Please, Dom, it's not too late.

338
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,541
- No, it has to be like this.

339
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,065
There's not enough time.
It's too late.

340
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,154
- Dom, listen to me!

341
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:45,418
Listen to me.I know I fucked up, okay?

342
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,463
But it's not too late.

343
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,683
If you let me go,I can stop this, okay?

344
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:52,076
I swear to God,if you just let me go.

345
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,991
Please!
- I'm sorry.

346
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:58,126
No, no, no, please!

347
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,475
Don't be sorry, Dom.

348
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,129
Don't be, don't be!

349
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,132
Don't be sorry, Dom, okay?Please, Dom, don't be sorry.

350
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,569
You don't need to do this.You are a good person!

351
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,268
This isn't you!
- Shut up!

352
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,189
Shit, shit, shit.

353
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,410
Shit.

354
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,152
- How soon
can he get back to me?

355
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:27,677
It's urgent, yes.

356
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,115
I know, but it's regarding
Mr. Kuklachev.

357
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,596
He'll want to know.

358
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,296
Okay, great.

359
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,256
Merry Christmas.

360
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,090
- How longdo you think it'll be?

361
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,397
- Fuck you.

362
00:21:56,489 --> 00:22:00,101
My life is over.
I want you to know that.

363
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,494
- You just have to talk to him.

364
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:04,018
Then I'll go.

365
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:06,629
Nothing will be traced to you.

366
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,459
- And you think that's it, huh?

367
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,333
You just drugged an addict.

368
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:18,467
- You'll get through it.

369
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:21,165
- You arrogant piece of shit.

370
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:23,864
Maybe you can have a slip

371
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:27,346
and it's not the end
of the world, but I can't.

372
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,349
It destroys me.

373
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,351
So fuck you.

374
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,703
- Maybe you should havethought about that

375
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,619
before you worked for them.

376
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:42,578
- What's that supposed to mean?

377
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:48,149
- Offshore bank in Cyprus.

378
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,673
Kind of moneythat goes through there.

379
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,633
You know, come on.

380
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:56,462
You're not dumb.

381
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:58,768
I'm sure a part of youhas always known.

382
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:01,292
You choseto look the other way.

383
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:04,208
- My choices
are none of your business.

384
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,341
- I get it.

385
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,561
You needed a job.
They were paying well.

386
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:11,390
That's how they do it.
That's their business model.

387
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,349
They back everyone
into a corner

388
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,048
until all that's left is for us
to compromise ourselves.

389
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,488
That's why what I'm doing
has to be done.

390
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:25,578
They're hurting you...

391
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,580
just like they're hurting
all of us.

392
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:31,235
-  The only one
hurting me right now is you.

393
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:38,242
I wonder how many people
you've had to hurt

394
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,810
to get what you want.

395
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,595
Hmm?

396
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,208
How many has it been, Elliot?

397
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,343
How many people
have had to suffer

398
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,433
because of you?

399
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,094
Was it worth it?

400
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,809
I'm a mess.

401
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,856
Can I use the bathroom?

402
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,599
- Yeah, go ahead.

403
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,268
So was fucking me
part of the plan,

404
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,575
or was that just
a happy accident?

405
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,796
- It was an accident.

406
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,543
- That's sweet.

407
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:22,738
- It's almost done.

408
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:26,960
Once her boss calls back,we'll get what we need and go.

409
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,054
This would have allbeen simpler

410
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:37,797
if she wasn't so deep in denialabout who she's working for.

411
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,801
- There it is.

412
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:44,412
That sense of dread.

413
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,676
It only happens
when you cross a line

414
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,506
you didn't even know existed.

415
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,987
Maybe that dread
is a good thing.

416
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:04,214
After all, when you realize
you've crossed a line...

417
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,567
That means you still had one.

418
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:14,703
When those crossed lines
are all behind you,

419
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,488
up ahead is only darkness.

420
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,798
- He has insomnia,

421
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,321
social anxiety.

422
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,497
II don't know
what else to tell you.

423
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,371
- Morphine addiction,
jail time, dead daddy.

424
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:33,679
You're giving me
the knockoffs, girl.

425
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,594
I want the brand name.

426
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,861
Please let me go.

427
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:44,646
Whatever you're looking for,
I don't have it.

428
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,563
- I know the two of you
had a special relationship.

429
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,743
- "Special"?

430
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,963
He hacked me.

431
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:59,356
He threatened
my last boyfriend.

432
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,620
He threatened me.

433
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,056
You know,
I had to stop seeing him

434
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:04,492
because he scared me so much.

435
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,842
- You weren't scared of him!

436
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:09,279
You loved his ass!

437
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,636
I saw the look on your face.

438
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,507
Don't lie to me.

439
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:25,731
- This isn't going to work.

440
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:28,777
Your outbursts.

441
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:31,737
Just because you were bullied
as a kid,

442
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,349
because people hurt you

443
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,307
until that day you swung a bat

444
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,571
and learned
how to hurt them back

445
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:44,314
doesn't mean it's going to work
with me.

446
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:58,415
- W-wait a minute.

447
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:03,072
Wait a fucking second.

448
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,860
Miss Krista, are you...

449
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,514
are you calling me
a little bitch?

450
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,825
Yo, Peanuts.

451
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:19,959
You hear that,
what she called me?

452
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,961
- She called youa little bitch.

453
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,615
- Hey, Javi.

454
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,835
You hear her calling me
a little bitch?

455
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,837
- That's what I heard.

456
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,759
See?

457
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:40,066
That's why you're good.

458
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:43,504
Not even my bitch
can call me a little bitch.

459
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,680
Oh, my God!

460
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,513
Who's that?
- Jason.

461
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,649
- Jason, huh?

462
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:04,003
- That your boy?

463
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:07,441
Maybe we should
bring him in here.

464
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,835
Maybe that's what'll
what'll get you going.

465
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:11,532
- Hello, babe.

466
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,663
Are you in there?

467
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,450
How about that, Miss Krista?

468
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,800
We gon' have
one big merry-merry.

469
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,857
- I was able
to stop the bleeding.

470
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,433
- Gonna be okay.

471
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:56,446
I'm sorry.

472
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:08,894
I don't believe you.

473
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,144
You said
the people I work for...

474
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:49,891
They were behind the massacre
in El Salado?

475
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,641
My mom died there.

476
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,298
- I know.

477
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,569
- Olivia...

478
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,532
I can stop them.

479
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,294
- Hi.

480
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:48,994
Um, I'm sorry
to bother you on a holiday,

481
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:52,736
but Mr. Kuklachev
needs the authorization

482
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,130
to transfer funds.

483
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:03,965
You don't see the request?

484
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,227
Are you sure?

485
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,852
- I still don't see it.

486
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,767
- Okay, that's strange.

487
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,857
He said it was urgent.

488
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,208
Maybe he changed his mind.

489
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,992
I'll just

490
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:34,778
I'll just check back with him
andand get back to you.

491
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,001
Okay, thanks.

492
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:45,224
Merry Christmas to you too.

493
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,707
- I'll wipe
all the traces of you

494
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,623
and your boss's involvement.

495
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,669
Nothing will be linked
back to you.

496
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:02,023
- You know,
I may work for monsters...

497
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,292
But you are one.

498
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,690
And you're the worst kind,
because you don't even know it.

499
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:52,204
Oh, damn.

500
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,423
Your boy's upset
you didn't let him in.

501
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,085
Ah, all right.

502
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,355
Now...

503
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,315
before your boy came and went,

504
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,317
you were calling me
a little bitch?

505
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:24,062
Chill, girl.

506
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,151
I didn't take no offense.

507
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,023
In fact, this was my bad,

508
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,764
'cause I didn't tell you
the whole story.

509
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,026
See,

510
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,117
I was just explaining
your role to you.

511
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,772
That you my bat.

512
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:44,299
But that bat
ain't the end of the story.

513
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:47,259
Nah.

514
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,783
That's where I come in.

515
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,313
So after being beaten

516
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:00,533
within an inch of his life

517
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:05,755
by that badass little bitch,

518
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,454
the bully woke up
in the hospital.

519
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,198
It was right then
when little bitch walked in

520
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:16,940
like the fucking ghost
of Xmas past.

521
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,551
Bully sees him
and starts crying.

522
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,161
I mean, this nigga was scared.

523
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:23,164
He must have thought that boy
had come to finish him off.

524
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:28,213
But you know what happened?

525
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:34,567
Little bitch
just walked right up

526
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,526
to his bully's bed...

527
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:44,098
And held his hand.

528
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,056
Yep.

529
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,797
He held his hand...

530
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,324
Just like so.

531
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,112
Real soft and gentle-like.

532
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,811
And then he got real close.

533
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:07,991
He looks at his bully,

534
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:11,560
all sniffling and crying.

535
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,041
He looked at him and said...

536
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,438
"I see you now."

537
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,534
Little bitch showed up
when no one else would.

538
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,623
He saw his bully

539
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:34,235
like no one else could...

540
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:37,064
and that was all it took.

541
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,240
And, Miss Krista,

542
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,895
from that moment on,

543
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:45,203
he owned that bully for life.

544
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:53,863
Now, if I want to own Elliot,
I don't just gotta break him.

545
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:55,996
Me and Elliot are linked

546
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,433
on a spiritual plane.

547
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,306
I got to come at him on
the same level I find myself,

548
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,134
andand breaking him
only gets you so far.

549
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,486
I gotta break him
so I can build him up.

550
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:08,965
I need to wound his soul

551
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,489
so I can be the one
to heal him.

552
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,318
That is how you own a nigga.

553
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,105
Now, the next words
out of your mouth

554
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,325
have to be exactly what I want.

555
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:21,978
Not for my sake,

556
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:25,634
but for yours
and for your boy Jason,

557
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,942
who lives
up on 1404 Jay Street.

558
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,513
Now, you know what I want.

559
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,343
You got to give it to me.

560
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:48,962
- You do that,

561
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:52,226
I got no reason
not to turn you loose.

562
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,059
Look me in my eye.

563
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,066
Trust me.

564
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,354
Go to the filing cabinet
in my office.

565
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,707
There's a folder
in the bottom drawer.

566
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:45,192
Go to the tab
that says "September 2015."

567
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:51,111
Look for Elliot's name.

568
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,696
- What am I gonna find there?

569
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:18,225
- Mr. Robot.

570
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,708
- What's that?

571
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,626
- That...

572
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,324
is how you'll break him.

573
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:51,301
Oh, my head hurts.

574
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:09,494
I thought
you were gonna kill me.

575
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,713
- They gave me an hour.

576
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,374
How long has it been?

577
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,117
- Just unlock your phone.

578
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,425
All they want
is Elliot's location.

579
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,689
- I can't.
- You can.

580
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,473
- What would you do
if it was your family?

581
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,562
- I'm doing it.

582
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,620
- You know that nightwe spent together?

583
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:51,797
I know you probably think of it

584
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,452
as the worst nightof your life...

585
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,672
The night all this shitwent to shit.

586
00:40:57,716 --> 00:41:00,545
But when I think about it,it was...

587
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:03,373
- Don't.

588
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,332
- Nice.

589
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,728
The last time I rememberactually feeling good.

590
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,257
You were just using me.

591
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,304
- You knowit was more than that.

592
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:32,664
Look...

593
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:36,189
whatever you have to do,I get it.

594
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:40,585
Okay? But justjust at least believe that.

595
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:58,254
I'm out of time.

596
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:09,265
Get up.

597
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,966
- Where are we going?
- Come on, get up.

598
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:15,837
- Where are we going?
- Up.

599
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,665
Come on, let's go.

600
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,062
You got the jump on me,

601
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,542
and before I knew what was
happening, it was over.

602
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,544
- What are you talking about?

603
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:29,764
- Take it and make it quick.

604
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,679
- You want me to shoot you?
- It's the only way.

605
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:32,680
Come on,
we're running out of time.

606
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:33,812
You have to kill me.

607
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,987
- I'm not fuckingkilling you, okay?

608
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,510
Let's go.We can make a run for it.

609
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,772
- If they show up
and we're gone,

610
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,295
my family's dead.

611
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,819
Don't you get it?

612
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:44,387
My life puts everyone I love
in danger.

613
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:46,955
This won't stop until I'm dead.

614
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,740
- I'm not gonnafucking kill you.

615
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:50,611
- I'd do it myself if I could.

616
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,657
I've thought about it every day
for the past two months,

617
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,919
but I can't do it.

618
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,616
I can't do it.

619
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,487
Please, Darlene,
just pull the fucking trigger.

620
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:58,488
- I can't.

621
00:42:58,532 --> 00:42:59,751
- Just pull
the fucking trigger!

622
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:01,535
- Dom, please.
- Pull the fucking trigger!

623
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,884
- I can't.
- Do it!

624
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:11,632
- Dominique?

625
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:20,598
Well, now,
I was not expecting this.

626
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:23,644
II'm stunned.

627
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,907
II don't know what to say.

628
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,822
My goodness.

629
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,700
Oh. Oh, don't worry,
I'm not gonna kill you.

630
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:38,398
You are still far too useful
to us for that.

631
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:43,272
But this is going to be

632
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:47,625
so painful for you.

633
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,630
Now, where's the phone?

634
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,814
I want you to understand,
I mean you no ill will.

635
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,816
My instructions were
to find your brother.

636
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:05,904
- Well, in that case,

637
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:06,905
my phone's not gonna do youany good.

638
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:08,994
I just wiped it.

639
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,007
- Huh.

640
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:26,838
- Shouldn't we be talking
about what just happened?

641
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,404
- We got the access we needed

642
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:31,016
to transfer the moneyfrom the bank's side.

643
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,540
Once we hack allof the members' phones tonight

644
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,760
at their meeting,we can rob them blind.

645
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:37,413
- That's not what I meant.

646
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:41,896
- What you meantdoesn't matter.

647
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:50,383
Krista?
- Elliot, I need to see you.

648
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:52,080
- I'm actually kind of busy.Can I call you

649
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:54,213
- I was kidnapped
by someone you know.

650
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,084
Fernando Vera.

651
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,132
He wanted to know everything
about you, everything I knew.

652
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:01,481
I'm sorry,
I didn't know what to do.

653
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:03,048
I didn't have a choice.
He had a gun.

654
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,397
Once he got what he wanted,
he let me go.

655
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,659
I went to the police,

656
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,487
but now I'm too afraid
to go back home.

657
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,141
I'm scared.
- Wait, wait, slow down.

658
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,056
Where are you right now?
- I'mI don't know.

659
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,274
Downtown, I think.

660
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,233
- I can meet you
at Washington Square Park.

661
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:16,975
Can you get there?
- I think so.

662
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,455
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

663
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:24,460
- There's no way
he's just gonna let her go.

664
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,422
- I know.

665
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:36,298
- Here we go again,
off to play the hero.

666
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:38,866
But is that even
who we are anymore?

667
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,999
You saw what we did
back there.

668
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:44,045
We just watched him
destroy someone's life

669
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:46,091
and none of us
did a thing about it.

670
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,010
Rules, morals, parameters
they only break

671
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:53,925
if you're broken
to begin with.

672
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,491
Did we change under pressure,

673
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:58,190
or did this only reveal
who we really are?

674
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,495
I don't know anymore.

675
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:02,281
The one thing I do know is
- Hey, hey!

676
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,982
Help, help!

677
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:09,462
Help!

678
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:10,158
Hey!

679
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:12,030
Hey, hey!

680
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:13,205
Help!

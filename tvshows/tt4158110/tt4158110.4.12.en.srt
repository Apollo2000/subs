1
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,531
What if I told you we could make it

2
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:10,261
like none of this ever happened?

3
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:12,952
What would you be willing
to sacrifice for that?

4
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,509
You wanna know what I believe?

5
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:17,236
That this isn't the end.

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,885
That there's another world
out there for both of us.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,493
And we'll see each other again.

8
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:25,153
You think Angela's dead, but she's not.

9
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:27,664
Elliot, I can't wait
to marry you tomorrow.

10
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:28,983
You can reset everything

11
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,778
and live in the world you deserve,

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,510
a world without your past...

13
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:35,891
Do you recall a time
your father ever hurt you?

14
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:38,565
- Yes.
- Without all the pain you carry...

15
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:40,156
Just finishing up a call.

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,245
- Be out in a jiff.
- Without your regrets...

17
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:45,471
"From the Mixed-Up Files
of Basil E. Frankweiler."

18
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:47,036
Your parents in town yet?

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,054
Hello, Emily? You there?

20
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:52,278
A 5.9-magnitude tremor
struck Washington Township.

21
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:54,357
I've imagined what it would be like

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,047
to be someone with a more exciting life.

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,483
Will you believe with me?

24
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:09,528
Who are you?

25
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:11,498
Can you tell me what
happened to that house?

26
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,293
Can you tell me what's your monster?

27
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,032
It's Mom. She's gone.

28
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:21,825
She was an asshole to us.

29
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:24,711
I need to go back to
Washington Township.

30
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,823
But soon you will see.

31
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,707
We will be reborn as new.

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,271
This place is gonna blow!

33
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,900
If we don't stop this,

34
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:34,188
the meltdown will destroy the whole town.

35
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:38,100
Did it work?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,074

37
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,304
Hello, friend.

38
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:53,470
Hello, friend.

39
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:56,466
Wait, you can hear me again?

40
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:58,976
Have you been there this whole time?

41
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,862
I was so focused on the hack

42
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,147
that I guess I thought you were gone.

43
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,815
But after what just
happened at the plant,

44
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:07,651
I thought for sure I was gone too.

45
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:09,537
We're dead, right?

46
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,823
There's no way we survived.

47
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,376
But if we're dead...

48
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:17,879
then how am I talking to you?

49
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,715
And if you're here...

50
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:23,083
where's Mr. Robot?

51
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,226
What was that?

52
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:50,110
You felt that too, right?

53
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:53,030
It was like an earthquake.

54
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:54,632
Wait.

55
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,236
I'm not dead.

56
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,588
I'm alive.

57
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:04,602
Which means you are too, right?

58
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,046
Where are we?

59
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,927
Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing.

60
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:25,729
This looks exactly like
where the power plant was,

61
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:28,065
except...

62
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:31,568
It's not.

63
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,960
I know what you're thinking, but don't.

64
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,412
That's impossible.

65
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:44,240
Whiterose is out of her fucking mind.

66
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:47,285
Yeah, yeah, I know. So am I.

67
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:51,672
But still, there's no way
her machine worked, right?

68

69
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,540
It can't be.

70
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:56,097
How?

71
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,399
It's been gone for 20 years, ever since...

72
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,553
He died.

73
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:58,194
Just finishing up a call.

74
00:06:58,197 --> 00:06:59,276
Be out in a jiff.

75
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:05,282
Tell me you heard that too.

76
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:12,673
Can this really be happening?

77
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:22,333
Is it...

78
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:25,802
is it really...

79
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:28,722
him?

80
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,814
I got a customer. We still on for lunch?

81
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:42,653
Okay.

82
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:46,180
See ya soon.

83
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:56,750
No problem. I'm always here for you.

84
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,566
My monster is still alive.

85
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,560
Sorry for the wait.

86
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:09,238
How can I help you?

87
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:12,533
Hmm.

88
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:16,412
Oh, there you are.

89
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,454
Hey.

90
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,629
Hey!

91
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:34,131
Hi, honey! How was your day?

92
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:37,760
Dad's home!

93
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,821
This is my old neighborhood.

94
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:44,125
That's my old house, but who's in there?

95
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,478
Who's he talking to?

96
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,773
Yo, can I ask you a question?

97
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:51,966
Hey, Elliot.

98
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:54,920
You know who I am?

99
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,207
Duh, you live right there.

100
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,226
Where have you been?

101
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:01,838
I haven't seen you in a while.

102
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,700
You look different.

103
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,997
Okay, okay, I'll pick it
up when I get to the city.

104
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,482
Back before dinner!

105
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:25,333
Your nose is bleeding.

106
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,481
If she knows who I am, maybe she knows.

107
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,658
I need your help.

108
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:37,554
I'm looking for Darlene.
Do you know where she is?

109
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,323
Who's Darlene?

110
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,325
My sister.

111
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:48,838
What's so funny?

112
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,524
You don't have a sister.

113
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,986
Elliot?

114
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,215
I wasn't expecting to
see you until tomorrow.

115
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,901
Hi, Mrs. Alderson.

116
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,536
Bye, Mrs. Alderson.

117
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:13,009
Well, why are you still standing

118
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,399
across the street there looking at me?

119
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:18,736
Stop being funny and come over here.

120
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,097
You just missed your father.

121
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:32,400
He went up to the city.

122
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:35,385
Let me look at you.

123
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:44,611
Have you lost weight?

124
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,564
You're too skinny.

125
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:50,317
Come on, let's scrounge
some lunch up for you.

126
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,457
I can't wait to show
you the new curtains.

127
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,325
I know, I know, you don't care,

128
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:01,244
but trust me on this,
you'll notice the difference.

129
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,762
This does look different.

130
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:21,515
Told you!

131
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:24,802
Only took me 30 years
to get around to it.

132
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:28,597
When I saw them, I
knew I had to have them.

133
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,491
Hmm.

134
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,878
Crazy how one small change can
make an entire place feel new.

135
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,683
Okay, so I can make you

136
00:12:56,685 --> 00:13:00,020
one of my special delicious sandwiches.

137
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:02,856
Do you want turkey or ham?

138
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:15,485
No Darlene.

139
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:19,039
Who's Darlene?

140
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,992
Anyway, I thought you
had a presentation today,

141
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,535
or was that yesterday?

142
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,537
How'd it go?

143
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,755
I'm not sure.

144
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:39,543
You've always been your
own harshest critic.

145
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:42,178
I'm sure you did great.

146
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:47,343
This doesn't sound like my mom.

147
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:51,021
This sounds like someone
who loves their son.

148
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:53,707
Everything's changed.

149
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,444
Even...

150
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:59,079
Me.

151
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,582
What was that, honey? You, what?

152
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:08,405
If their past has changed...

153
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,631
Has mine?

154
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,400
Does that mean...

155
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,528
The window.

156
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,422
What window?

157
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:47,911
Elliot?

158
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,613
What's gotten into you?

159
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:51,052
Where's my bedroom?

160
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,411
It was right here.

161
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:56,803
Are you all right?

162
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,982
My bedroom. Where is it?

163
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,121
Where it's always been.

164
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,818
No.

165
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:49,639
This can't be true.

166
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,492
What can't be true?

167
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:59,314
When I was eight years old,

168
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:02,902
do you remember me having an accident?

169
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:05,189
What accident?

170
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:07,691
When I broke my arm.

171
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:10,544
Honey, you've never broken your arm.

172
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:13,514
You've never broken a
bone in your entire life.

173
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,851
Elliot...

174
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:26,568
I'm worried about you.

175
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,322
Why don't we sit down?

176
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:41,850
If I didn't jump,

177
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,918
does that mean there was no reason to?

178
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:45,963
Mom...

179
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,300
Just tell me.

180
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,121
Did you ever hurt me?

181
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,539
Did...

182
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,435
Dad?

183
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,945
Elliot...

184
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:21,564
your father and I

185
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,893
never, ever hurt you.

186
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:32,242
We love you...

187
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:34,127
more than anything.

188
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:43,620
Where's all this coming from?

189
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:46,059
Did something happen
between you and Angela?

190
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:49,509
Is this about her parents?

191
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:50,844
I don't mean to overstep,

192
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,921
but I know they've had
their ups and downs,

193
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:54,535
and if you two think
you're gonna end up like...

194
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:55,816
Angela?

195
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:58,852
She's...

196
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:00,304
Alive?

197
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:03,098
It's totally normal to be nervous

198
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,708
before your big day tomorrow.

199
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:08,194
My big day?

200
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:11,440
I know the stress of a wedding can be

201
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:12,926
taxing for a couple...

202
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,202
Wedding?

203
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,095
I'm marrying Angela?

204
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,114
Mom?

205
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,977
Where is Angela right now?

206
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,215
Unless she decided to
become a runaway bride,

207
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:32,886
she must be back in her
apartment in the city.

208
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:42,195
What do you think?

209
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:44,997
Do you buy any of this?

210
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,320
We started out wanting
to change the world,

211
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,819
but did it happen?

212
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:53,072
Is this the world I fought so hard for?

213
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:56,409
A world free of all the
pain I went through?

214
00:18:56,411 --> 00:19:00,322
Am I actually considering
that this could be real?

215
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:09,831
No. I won't let myself.

216
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:16,095
Not yet.

217
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:18,006
Not until I see Angela.

218
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,852
Then I'll know.

219
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,625
If I see her, will this
world make more sense

220
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:46,927
or less?

221
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:51,155
I don't know, but it's worth the risk.

222
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:01,283
Mr. Alderson.

223
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,219
Oh, scared, huh?

224
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:06,733
Well, you should be.

225
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,390
After all, as far as you're concerned,

226
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:10,375
I am evil incarnate.

227
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:13,569
Phillip, stop giving
him such a hard time.

228
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,571
Oh, come on, Em, he knows
I'm only joshing him.

229
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,573
Besides, if I'm to be his father-in-law,

230
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,459
he should be a little frightened of me.

231
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:21,995
Sweetie, come on in.

232
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,180
Come on.

233
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:34,451
We came up a few days
early to help Angela out

234
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:36,167
with a few last-minute adjustments,

235
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,319
but when we got here, as usual,

236
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,762
she's done everything herself,

237
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:41,264
so we've got nothing to do.

238
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,632
Don't be fooled.

239
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:45,351
She's bitter about
that, so tread carefully.

240
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:47,821
She is amazing that way, isn't she?

241
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:49,656
She always has been, I guess.

242
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:52,460
Oh, and wait until you
see her in her dress.

243
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:57,965
Okay.

244
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:06,006
Well, yes.

245
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:12,012
Anyway, to... to what
do we owe the honor?

246
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:13,814
Was Angela expecting you?

247
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,193
No. I, uh...

248
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,242
Just wanted to see her.

249
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:29,395
Wow, you two really can't go a minute

250
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:30,980
without missing each other.

251
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:32,682
So sweet.

252
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:35,419
I remember that feeling, I think.

253
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,575
And that is usually my cue
to make everyone a drink.

254
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,879
Uh, that won't be necessary.

255
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,988
I'm just trying to find Angela.

256
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:50,085
Oh, well, she's meeting us for lunch.

257
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:55,092
- She is?
- Yes.

258
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,035
We're trying that cute
place on the corner.

259
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:58,208
You should come.

260
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,423
Phillip, I want Elliot to come along.

261
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:03,213
Only after we've had one
of my whiskey sours, hmm?

262
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:05,407
Only one. I don't wanna be late.

263
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:10,070
You know, Elliot,

264
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:14,741
I am so happy to see the two
of you finally tie the knot.

265
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:16,359
Watching you grow up,

266
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,187
I always knew there was
something very special

267
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,396
between the two of you,

268
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:23,116
but, frankly, I was
worried she wouldn't see it.

269
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:26,887
Between us, she didn't always
have the best taste in men.

270
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,891
Yeah, I know.

271
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,539
But this is the start of something new.

272
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,442
Are you excited?

273
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Oh, shoot.

274
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:52,562
That was meant to be a surprise.

275
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:57,733
We borrowed all of
these from your mother.

276
00:22:57,735 --> 00:23:00,604
Angela wanted to give something to you,

277
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:03,092
something that embodied
your whole story together.

278
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:05,158
I think she did a wonderful job.

279
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,410
I just love...

280
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:09,912
These images,

281
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:12,449
I've seen them before.

282
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:15,952
I've pictured this fantasy so many times.

283
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:19,172
This is what normal people
do when they're happy, right?

284
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:22,675
Get married, start a family,

285
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:25,962
surround themselves
with people they love,

286
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:27,589
with people that love them.

287
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:31,259
Trust me, Em, we got lucky.

288
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:33,603
He's good, this one.

289
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:36,439
True love prevails.

290
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:40,602
Ever since he retired, he
has become quite the softy.

291
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:43,104
You know, I know I'm not
supposed to say anything,

292
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:45,331
but when your father came
by and showed us that gift

293
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,485
that you got for her...

294
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:51,321
she's gonna love it.

295
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:54,040
Oh, don't worry. It's just between us.

296
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,452
I am a vault, and he
cannot remember anything

297
00:23:57,454 --> 00:23:59,162
past the last five minutes.

298
00:23:59,164 --> 00:24:01,022
Bottoms up!

299
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:07,504
Mm!

300
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:10,137
We should get going.
I don't wanna be late.

301
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,834
Mmm, it's good.

302
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:14,420
Oh, well, this is weird.

303
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:17,275
Elliot, it says that you're calling me.

304
00:24:19,756 --> 00:24:23,310
No, don't... don't...
don't fall for it, Em.

305
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:25,404
He's... he's just doing
a gag with the phone.

306
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:26,523
Am I right?

307
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,407
Oh, he's such a whiz with these gadgets.

308
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:29,876
What's the trick, huh?

309
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,970
What happens if you pick up?

310
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:34,997
What?

311
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,825
What happens if you answer?

312
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:45,841
Uh, here. Let me do it.

313
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:48,010
N-no. Let me... let me do it.

314
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,055
Hello?

315
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:02,209
Emily?

316
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:05,895
You there?

317
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:15,922
Are you all right?

318
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,928
What happened, dear?

319
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:26,207
Look at what you did.
He's getting cold feet.

320
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,268
Well, how exactly am
I responsible for that?

321
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,436
Because of your
passive-aggressive jokes.

322
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:32,422
Whoa!

323
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:33,698
Oh, my God!

324
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,946
Okay, nobody panic.

325
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:42,212
It's just a little
accident. I've got it.

326
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:46,736
Ouch!

327
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:47,987
Ow.

328
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,499
That voice, that was mine.

329
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,118
How can that be possible?

330
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,686
I saw myself in those pictures.

331
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,254
That was me, wasn't it?

332
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:08,924
Or no, was it him?

333
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:10,225
So are there two of me?

334
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:11,456
I didn't think about that before,

335
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,979
but that's possible, isn't it?

336
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:14,981
Everyone's different here:

337
00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:18,985
Price, my dad, my mom...

338
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:25,992
Me.

339
00:26:45,963 --> 00:26:47,963
But if this world isn't mine...

340
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:54,470
Then whose is it?

341
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:27,553
This guy is definitely not me.

342
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:37,763
And I am definitely not him.

343
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:32,067
I need to find out exactly who he is.

344
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:43,296
Shit, the boot drive is encrypted.

345
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:45,465
Maybe he's more like me than I thought.

346
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:25,465
Based on this, he doesn't
have crippling social anxiety

347
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:27,323
or paranoia.

348
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:30,292
He looks like he's fun at parties,

349
00:29:30,294 --> 00:29:33,496
makes a good living,

350
00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:35,164
has lots of friends.

351
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,220
Everything in his life seems perfect.

352
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,558
But nobody is as perfect as they seem.

353
00:29:57,989 --> 00:29:59,355
Come on, come on, come on.

354
00:29:59,357 --> 00:30:01,938
I know I'll find something.
He can't be this happy.

355
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:04,152
No one is.

356
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:05,878
Haven't you been paying attention?

357
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,822
Everyone has a secret.

358
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:09,832
People are always hiding something:

359
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:14,329
their vulnerabilities,
their fears, their shame.

360
00:30:14,331 --> 00:30:16,831
I don't care how happy he looks.

361
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,858
Everyone has a monster.

362
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,761
The question is, what's his?

363
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:34,857
And there it is,

364
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:36,549
a hidden partition,

365
00:30:36,552 --> 00:30:39,480
a drive full of files he
doesn't want anyone to see.

366
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,432
These are images...

367
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,061
Of me...

368
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,297
My life.

369
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,375
How does he know about me?

370
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,554
Did he somehow hack...

371
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:24,869
my world?

372
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:32,665
Am I... his monster?

373
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,028
Who are you?

374
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:56,880
I know this is fucked up.

375
00:31:56,883 --> 00:31:58,721
What are you doing in my apartment?

376
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,797
And why do you look like me?

377
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:11,787
I think we should talk.

378
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:13,399
I'm calling the police.

379
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:15,627
I don't know who you
are or what you want.

380
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,125
No, we can't involve the cops.

381
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:18,311
Stay where you are!

382
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,883
You're making a mistake.

383
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:28,071
Let's just take a seat.

384
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:33,034
I promise you, I can explain.

385
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:39,833
My name is Elliot Alderson.

386
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:41,734
I was born in Washington
Township, New Jersey,

387
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:43,836
September 17, 1986.

388
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:50,885
Same as you.

389
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:55,556
You could've looked all that up.

390
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,435
Look at me, man.

391
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:03,088
You really think I'm making this up?

392
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:15,851
Let's sit.

393
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:22,558
I'm good where I am.

394
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,193
Start talking.

395
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,114
Why do you have those
sketches on your computer?

396
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,368
What sketches?

397
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,589
The hidden partition.

398
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:40,076
How did you get in there?

399
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:41,356
Doesn't matter.

400
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,046
I need you to tell me why
you made those sketches.

401
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,609
Hey, you look exactly like...

402
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:04,733
Holy shit, how is this happening?

403
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,396
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

404
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:10,739
That's why we need to talk.

405
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:44,439
The files on your hidden partition...

406
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,327
What are they?

407
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:55,334
Sometimes when I get bored,

408
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,369
I create people in my head...

409
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:01,616
Like him.

410
00:35:01,618 --> 00:35:05,377
You know, someone with
a more exciting life.

411
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:09,348
Like a superhero,

412
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,401
except his power would be computers.

413
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:17,857
He'd a cybersecurity engineer by day,

414
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:20,642
vigilante hacker by night.

415
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:25,981
Is that what you are?

416
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:37,075
What about the girl with the brown hair?

417
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,657
She's just sort of like
his partner in crime.

418
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:48,587
And fsociety?

419
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:53,559
That's just a dumb name I came up with

420
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:55,093
for a hacker group.

421
00:35:57,097 --> 00:35:59,882
You know...

422
00:35:59,884 --> 00:36:02,100
fuck society?

423
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:05,721
I figured that's...

424
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:07,740
what an anarchist hacker

425
00:36:07,742 --> 00:36:09,775
would come up with.

426
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:30,045
This is you, isn't it?

427
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:37,052
Why did you create this person?

428
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,943
I guess...

429
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:52,567
Sometimes I fantasize about being him.

430
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:56,488
So you want to be him?

431
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:02,628
No, not really.

432
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,129
Look at him.

433
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:08,284
He's angry.

434
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:09,802
He has no life.

435
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:14,256
He's alone.

436
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:16,091
He's not normal.

437
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:27,769
Oh, shit, man.

438
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:31,307
I'm sorry.

439
00:37:33,144 --> 00:37:35,027
He shouldn't be.

440
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:36,812
He's right.

441
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,999
I'm not normal, and I never will be,

442
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:41,700
no matter what world I'm in.

443
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:42,784
What is that?

444
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:46,447
Did you hear that?

445
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:47,622
What?

446
00:37:50,953 --> 00:37:53,996
It sounded like you
were talking to someone.

447
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:55,998
Shit, he can hear us.

448
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,299
There it is again.

449
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:04,723
How are you doing that?

450
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:09,061
This was a mistake.

451
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:11,310
I don't belong here.

452
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:13,565
- I was stupid to think that I did.
- Wait.

453
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:36,872
Yo, man.

454
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:38,274
Are you okay?

455
00:38:41,845 --> 00:38:43,237
Say something.

456
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:55,221
Shit.

457
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,202
Fuck.

458
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:02,560
I-I'm gonna go get some help.

459
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,265
Hello?

460
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:21,934
Oh, my God, Elliot.

461
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:23,277
What have you done?

462
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:27,073
- Angela.
- You are out of control.

463
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:32,060
- The book.
- What?

464
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:33,721
How were you able to find it?

465
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:34,980
You're so amazing.

466
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:37,149
This is the best gift
anyone's ever given me.

467
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:38,726
Wait. H-hold on a second.

468
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:39,952
Seriously, Elliot,

469
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:42,904
I'm so lucky to be
marrying someone like you.

470
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:45,065
Angela...

471
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,625
I'm not who you think I am.

472
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:48,577
Oh, you're not?

473
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:50,629
Then what'd you do with my best friend?

474
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:52,723
No, you don't understand.

475
00:39:57,504 --> 00:39:59,788
I lost you.

476
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,624
What?

477
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:03,818
You never lost me. I'm right here.

478
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,929
No, you don't get it.

479
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:09,706
No, I do get it.

480
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:14,665
Look, all you have to
do is show up tomorrow,

481
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:16,321
and then we'll finally be together

482
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:17,503
for the rest of our lives.

483
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:19,191
Isn't that what you want too?

484
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:24,446
Of course, but...

485
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:27,666
Elliot, you always overthink everything.

486
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:31,336
You have to finally
let yourself be happy.

487
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:33,797
That's all it takes.

488
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,158
It's just a choice that you have to make,

489
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,010
a switch that you have to flick on.

490
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:43,290
Do you love me, Elliot?

491
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,459
What?

492
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:46,885
Do you love me?

493
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,224
Of course I love you.

494
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,531
I've always loved you.

495
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:02,984
Great, because I love you too.

496
00:41:05,147 --> 00:41:07,356
So how about it, then?

497
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,075
You wanna start this new
life with me or what?

498
00:41:10,077 --> 00:41:13,529
More than anything.

499
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:17,382
Okay, then it's settled.

500
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:20,001
I'll see you tomorrow.

501
00:41:29,046 --> 00:41:30,679
Help.

502
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:38,186
C-call someone.

503
00:41:42,685 --> 00:41:44,276
Please.

504
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,363
Call an ambulance.

505
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:51,449
I can't move.

506
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:56,621
I need an ambulance.

507
00:42:00,928 --> 00:42:02,627
But I'll lose her.

508
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,466
And I can't lose her again.

509
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,582
I'm sorry.

510
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,827
I think you should look away too.

511
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:43,028
Please, don't judge me.

512
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,979
This was inevitable.

513
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:47,349
You saw the earthquakes.

514
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:49,851
Both of us can't exist
here in this world.

515
00:43:51,738 --> 00:43:54,712
I had no other choice.

516
00:43:54,715 --> 00:44:01,430

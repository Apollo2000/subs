1
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,872
You're nothing.

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:11,901
You're worthless.

3
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:15,037
Mom, a lot's happened
since last I saw your.

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,557
I'm not gonna run. You
should probably leave.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,727
This is exactly what you do
when shit like this happens.

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,752
You shut down.

7
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,752
- Who are you?
- Just a brave traveler

8
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:26,558
who's finally come home.

9
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:29,811
Susan Jacobs, the General
Counsel at E Corp.

10
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,238
When they cleared E Corp, you laughed.

11
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:37,506
There's security
camera footage of him

12
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,717
kidnapping Miss Alderson.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,657
Unless you finish cleaning
up Santiago's mess,

14
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:44,751
I'm gonna be forced to
do something very bad

15
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,754
to your mother.

16
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:46,756
We found their heart.

17
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,745
We rob it, she finally goes down.

18
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,073
I know all about Cyprus National Bank.

19
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:53,210
Her money's as good
as gone. You hear me?

20
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:54,928
Was that her in the SUV outside?

21
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,036
Welcome back, Mr. Alderson.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,725
A symbolic breach in the structure

24
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,788
that separated millions and
claimed hundreds of lives.

25
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,566
That was 1989.

26
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,944
The world was up for grabs.

27
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:26,824
All the money, power,
natural resources,

28
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:30,638
hell, even borders were negotiable.

29
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:34,309
The Soviet Union, a
great world super power,

30
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:35,886
was collapsing.

31
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,816
And where some saw freedom,

32
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,630
a young, imaginative Minister Zhang

33
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:44,874
saw possibility.

34
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:47,911
A new world order.

35
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:52,384
So Zhang formed an
investment group called Deus.

36
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:55,485
The goal, bring together
the world's wealthiest,

37
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:59,231
most powerful men to consolidate control

38
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:02,688
and manipulate global events for profit.

39
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:05,632
Zhang courted dignitaries, world leaders,

40
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:06,967
oligarchs, businessmen,

41
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:09,077
and he was a damn good salesman.

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,544
The potential profit outweighed

43
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,639
anyone's moral reservations,

44
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,882
which was proven true
in an early endeavor;

45
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,219
the First Gulf War.

46
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,210
Something is happening outside.

47
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:24,758
The skies over Baghdad
have been illuminated.

48
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:27,261
A few backroom deals, a promise here,

49
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:28,295
a bribe there.

50
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:31,231
Like that, the Deus
Group was rich on oil

51
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,602
and had a foothold in the
military industrial sector.

52
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:37,813
With the right players in place,

53
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:41,442
running the world turned
out to be surprisingly easy.

54
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:45,005
I have to say, business was booming.

55
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:49,584
With his network of hackers
and terrorists in place,

56
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,718
Zhang suggested the Deus
Group look in a new direction.

57
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:55,539
Industrial espionage
was yesterday's work.

58
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,618
What better way to gain
leverage on everyone

59
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:01,521
than if everyone was connected?

60
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:04,024
During my service in the Congress,

61
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:07,510
I took the initiative
in creating the Internet.

62
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:10,530
The United States was a test case.

63
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:13,516
Americans seemed the most
ready to give their lives

64
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:14,868
over to a box.

65
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,784
Without hesitation
everyone jumped online.

66
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,652
Welcome. You've got mail.

67
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,171
Offered everything they had.

68
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:27,822
Bank accounts, electric bills,

69
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,865
medical records, DNA data,

70
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,314
baby pictures.

71
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:33,536
We staged the biggest
coup in human civilization

72
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:35,889
and the whole world
volunteered to take part.

73
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,706
Opted in, checked the box,

74
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,893
and clicked, "I agree."

75
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:42,002
With the Deus Group behind it,

76
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,880
E Corp became the world's biggest front.

77
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,733
With every new device we rolled out,

78
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,112
there was a new way for the Deus Group

79
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,737
to manipulate the public.

80
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,908
But as the world
embraced the digital age,

81
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,802
we began to see that Zhang

82
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,912
had been perfectly positioning himself

83
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,247
to take total control.

84
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:05,752
Zhang's billion dollar machine,

85
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:07,695
he clandestinely built it

86
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:10,924
under the Washington
Township Nuclear Power Plant.

87
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:14,928
The Deus Group now understood
we were working for Zhang,

88
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,354
not with him.

89
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:20,247
His pet project which
we'd belittled for years

90
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,937
had been the singular purpose
of the Deus Group all along.

91
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:36,264

93
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:47,710
Consider yourself lucky, Mr. Alderson...

94
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,590
That I was the one alerted when
you walked into that apartment.

95
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,636
It's my duty to dispose

96
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:59,201
of any intruder

97
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:00,974
and report the attempt.

98
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:02,851
But you didn't.

99
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:05,603
Why?

100
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,142
Crazy, right?

101
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:18,561
Yeah, I never thought we'd
still be here, either.

102
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,703
Thought we were goners.

103
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,025
But here we are still alive.

104
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,986
But that's not the crazy part.

105
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:34,990
The crazy part is we
were saved by him,

106
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:37,177
the enemy.

107
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,679
One we've been after this whole time.

108
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,645
Question is, what's the angle?

109
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:43,265
What's the cost?

110
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,017
Because one thing we know by now,

111
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,822
it ain't free.

112
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,572
It won't work...

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,466
Your heist.

114
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:56,529
But you just said the Deus
Group funds whiterose's project

115
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,531
and the Dark Army.

116
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,868
If I can find a way
to rob the Deus Group,

117
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,703
whiterose loses everything.

118
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:06,146
But like I said,

119
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:09,042
the Deus Group is impenetrable.

120
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:11,502
Whiterose designed it that way.

121
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,031
You can get us in.

122
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:22,162
Excuse me?

123
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,057
It's like you said.

124
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:27,501
E Corp is a front for the Deus Group.

125
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:30,063
Last I checked, you're still the CEO.

126
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:36,444
We can take them all
down if we work together.

127
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,098
You have to have a contact at the bank

128
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,818
that can get me the Deus
Group account numbers.

129
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,745
A real contact.

130
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,234
Susan Jacobs.

131
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:53,931
General Counsel at E Corp.

132
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:58,424
She was my designated associate
for Cyprus National Bank.

133
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,078
She handled everything.

134
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,764
Withdrawals, deposits,

135
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,206
transfers.

136
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,799
I would just receive a text

137
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,574
to authorize the transaction, but she...

138
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:12,438
Can get around two-factor authentication.

139
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,715
I just need their phone numbers.

140
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,276
Of course.

141
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:18,260
You think the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia

142
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:21,022
has the same cell phone
number for more than five days?

143
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,858
Or the chairman of Royal Dutch Shell?

144
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,027
Let me worry about that.

145
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,813
Just tell me how I can get a
hold of this contact of yours.

146
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:33,609
Well, that's where you'll
run into some difficulty.

147
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:37,005
Susan Jacobs disappeared months ago.

148
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:42,710
And given how open whiterose
is about my inevitable exit

149
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,948
from the group,

150
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,972
I haven't received another contact.

151
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:48,791
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson,

152
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:52,252
but I really can't help you.

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,944
You know what they've done.

154
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:01,263
You just gonna let them keep doing it?

155
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,990
You're trying to stop a speeding train

156
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,825
by standing in front of it.

157
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:10,237
All thi... all this,
this is just a blip.

158
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,562
They won't even notice.

159
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:13,148
Whiterose killed your daughter.

160
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,847
You think I didn't look into you, too?

161
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:36,338
I don't know how you
justify the shit you do.

162
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,014
Maybe you wanna look back at
what whiterose did to Angela

163
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:50,144
and see it as a necessary evil.

164
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:52,688
A cost of doing business.

165
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,120
Or maybe you don't
look back at it at all

166
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,882
because deep down you
know what happened...

167
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:05,885
what's been happening...

168
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,887
is wrong.

169
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,632
Something inside you is telling you

170
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,710
to stop looking the other way.

171
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
That can start here.

172
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:46,241
Even if I were to agree to help you,

173
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,030
it's like I said.

174
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,078
This heist...

175
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,082
It's not possible.

176
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,269
I'll find Susan Jacobs.

177
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:58,378
Just get them all in a room together.

178
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:03,050
You want me to randomly request

179
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:06,946
that the entire Deus
Group gather in one place

180
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:11,099
- without even a pretext?
- In the next eight days.

181
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,861
Eight days? Is that all?

182
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,045
That's all I got.

183
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,940
Once whiterose starts shipping
their project, I'm dead.

184
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:22,295
And how do you expect
me to pull this off?

185
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,738
You've done whiterose's bidding thus far

186
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,664
and paid a horrible cost.

187
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,710
That loyalty won't be lost on her.

188
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,805
You can use that.

189
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,722
And if it's your life
you're worried about...

190
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:50,990
Doing nothing,

191
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:53,267
not fighting back...

192
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,439
You may as well be dead.

193
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:09,342
I became a dead man walking...

194
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:14,922
The minute I agreed
to work with whiterose.

195
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,933
Just like you.

196
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,834
What are we supposed to do now?

197
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,763
He isn't out.

198
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:48,675
He just walked out that door.

199
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,824
I'd be dead on the floor of my apartment

200
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:51,884
if he didn't want in.

201
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:53,344
He'll be back.

202
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:58,224
Besides, he just gave us
the name of his bank contact.

203
00:11:58,226 --> 00:12:00,876
A contact that's been
missing for months.

204
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:03,896
So we find out why she disappeared.

205
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:05,806
We take anything she left behind.

206
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:11,904
- Yeah?
- It's Mom.

207
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,157
She's gone, Elliot.

208
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:20,708
Your mom was the nicest,
most thoughtful woman.

209
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:21,928
When my dad died,

210
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:24,107
she gave me a shoulder to cry on.

211
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:27,086
Always had a kind word for everyone.

212
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:30,298
You two must feel so blessed
to have had her in your life.

213
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:35,803
Yeah, we feel totally blessed.

214
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:38,806
What are we supposed to do?

215
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:44,003
Um, well, when my dad died,

216
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,731
- I turned towards the Lord.
- I mean with the boxes.

217
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,301
Oh, well, oftentimes,

218
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,428
like, families find sentimental value

219
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,717
in their loved ones possessions.

220
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,324
Donate everything.

221
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:01,120
Staff are not allowed to pack up

222
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:04,031
a deceased patient's belongings.

223
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,317
You can put a Post-It note on the boxes

224
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,920
with the items you wish to donate.

225
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:32,276
About yesterday...

226
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,396
I know I was a little mental.

227
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,115
We're cool.

228
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,994
- Are you just saying that or...
- No, we're good.

229
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:44,330
Let's just get this done.

230
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,903
Score.

231
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,080
Are you gonna help?

232
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:24,495
What's the hurry?

233
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:29,083
She's not gonna get any deader.

234
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,569
You know, for someone who
refused to enter this room

235
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,455
in the last few years,

236
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,843
you seem pretty comfortable
now with her gone.

237
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:42,847
Don't you feel a little relieved?

238
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:46,133
I know I sound like a total dick,

239
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,478
but you feel it, too, right?

240
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,982
I guess.

241
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,980
You know what? Fuck it.

242
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,575
Why should I feel like
a dick for being happy?

243
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:05,411
She was an asshole to us.

244
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:07,955
Now I don't ever have
to think about her again.

245
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:21,617
Rad. Your old Walkman.

246
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,054
Why is it even here? Mom hated music.

247
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:26,557
It doesn't matter.

248
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,793
Hold up.

249
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,128
I'll take it if you don't.

250
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,356
Cassettes are full-on back.

251
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,662
What?

252
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,164
Mom had a safe deposit box?

253
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:13,461
And how long did you
work under ASAC Santiago?

254
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:17,173
Three years, since I
started the New York office.

255
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:22,637
Describe his disposition
as a senior agent for me.

256
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,140
How'd he treat his squad? Any quirks?

257
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:28,143
- Oddities?
- No.

258
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:30,404
Santiago was always even-keeled.

259
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,023
He treated everyone
fairly, with respect,

260
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,075
both in the office and out in the field.

261
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,156
Did you ever see Agent
Santiago do anything

262
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:43,658
suspicious or out of character
before his disappearance

263
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,219
on October 23rd?

264
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,205
What do you mean by suspicious?

265
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,684
It's not every day
an ASAC ups and erases

266
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:54,210
security cam footage from
the FBI's parking garage

267
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,430
before dropping off
the face of the Earth.

268
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,098
Oh, right.

269
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,844
You okay there, Agent DiPierro?

270
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:07,223
I'm sorry, just, you
seem a little out of it.

271
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,609
You getting enough rest?

272
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:13,539
Can I...

273
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,857
just have some water?

274
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,309
Sir, there's something I
know I should tell you, but...

275
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,144
But what?

276
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:53,395
We're both here for the same reason.

277
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:56,888
To find Agent Santiago,
make sure he's safe.

278
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:59,418
Now, if there's anything you
can do to help us do that...

279
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,570
I think Agent Santiago
was a double agent.

280
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,451
A double agent?

281
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,767
Yes.

282
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,584
To be clear, Agent DiPierro,

283
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,270
you're accusing your
former commanding officer...

284
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:20,755
your FBI mentor... of
working as an operative

285
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,298
against the Bureau?

286
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,427
I'm sorry, Agent Horton.

287
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,638
I'm just having a little
trouble saying this aloud

288
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,473
knowing it's on the record and...

289
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:40,534
I'm worried.

290
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,127
I'm worried about what might happen,

291
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,462
about the repercussions.

292
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:47,633
What repercussions?

293
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:06,341
Santiago was working with
some awfully dangerous people.

294
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,398
No agent wants to see their brother,

295
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,850
their sister on the
wrong side of the law.

296
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,976
I get that.

297
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,480
But you know it's our duty to uphold

298
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,575
the integrity of the Bureau.

299
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,359
Well, take a breath.

300
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,448
Whenever you're set.

301
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:33,420
Can you tell me who Agent
Santiago was working with?

302
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,883
The Trujillo drug cartel.

303
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,776
You know, sort of the official punishment

304
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,944
of people who break the law,

305
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,706
and back then in that
place, in that time,

306
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,876
what the state did to
people as part of, you know,

307
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:08,622
lawful justice is worse than
anything Charles Manson did

308
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,383
to the people that he
had killed in his name.

309
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,794
What Charles Manson's

310
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,871
followers did to the
Manson murder victims

311
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:19,415
is merciful by the standards
of the lawful justice...

312
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,560
- Dugout.
- Bonsai.

313
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:24,304
Dominique, nice to hear your voice.

314
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,565
- How was the interview?
- Fine.

315
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:27,657
We're good.

316
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,839
Listen, instead of
Charles Manson doing...

317
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:33,930
Clarify for me what you mean by good.

318
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,576
Um, I fed them the cover story.

319
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,579
He bought it and praised
me for coming forward.

320
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:42,581
That's encouraging.

321
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,733
So, you believe it was
a successful meeting?

322
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:49,496
Your colleagues believe
all is aboveboard?

323
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,256
I mean, I was a little
nervous at the start,

324
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,449
but then I was fine.

325
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,785
Totally fine.

326
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,414
Agent Horton bought it. I'm sure of it.

327
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,433
Clarify sure.

328
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:04,742
And thought that when you
commit the kind of crimes...

329
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:10,300
Um, I mean, I don't know.

330
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,487
As sure as I can be,
I guess. 99.9% sure.

331
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,615
Interesting.

332
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:19,642
Well, it is just a red letter day.

333
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,812
Now, I know the beginnings
are always the hardest

334
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,941
but it's best for
everyone if you stay calm

335
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:28,943
and keep a level head.

336
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,808
Just one moment.

337
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,660
I'm just finishing a phone call.

338
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:42,975
Dominique, I want you to
know that we are very pleased

339
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:45,001
that you are back to
work and on the mend.

340
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,409
Don't be a stranger.

341
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:48,313
Let us know if there's anything you need,

342
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:49,815
and we'll do the same.

343
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,820
Sorry to keep you waiting.

344
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:56,321
You know, holidays.

345
00:21:56,323 --> 00:21:57,513
Busy, busy, busy.

346
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:58,641
What can I do for you?

347
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:01,643
I want Beatrice with me forever.

348
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:03,829
If you are adulterous or
involved in fornication...

349
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:06,171
which basically means sex
outside of marriage...

350
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,551
you get your head cut off.

351
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:12,190
There's the cost of living
and the cost of dying.

352
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:13,442
Seems you're paying the price

353
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:15,239
whether you're coming or going.

354
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,135
This is taking way too long.

355
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,730
Susan Jacobs?

356
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:22,900
No, death.

357
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:24,602
We have to get back to work.

358
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:26,396
Still running the password cracker

359
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:28,375
on the Ecoin wallet but nothing yet.

360
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:32,186
And then there's the real price.

361
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:34,737
Not cash or Ecoin.

362
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,906
The emotional toll.

363
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:38,908
How are you doing with all this?

364
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,137
As soon as we get the
death certificate, I'm done.

365
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,455
The toll Elliot isn't willing to pay,

366
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:46,934
whether he's not ready to
or just doesn't want to.

367
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm not talking about paperwork, kiddo.

368
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:53,816
I'm talking about the fact
that your mom died this morning.

369
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:57,611
Maybe you should take a minute,
deal with what's happening.

370
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:01,990
The fuck are you talking about?

371
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:05,602
I'm kind of an expert at observing you.

372
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:07,571
All I'm saying is that you need to stop

373
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:09,998
and take in your mom's death

374
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,608
or it's gonna eat away at you

375
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,877
like everything else you're holding in.

376
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,756
Here's the only thing I'm holding in.

377
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,252
We need to take down whiterose

378
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,753
or we die.

379
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,722
Darlene dies.

380
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:30,712
Did your expert observation
also pick up on that?

381
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,301
I agree. That could
have gone better.

382
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:39,945
Fuck you.

383
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:43,639
Okay, I mean,

384
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:46,276
how the hell should I know
what she would have wanted?

385
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,146
♪ But now it's cold and
Christmas is coming ♪

386
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:51,281
♪ La, la, la, la... ♪

387
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:53,876
Don't look at me like that.

388
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:57,287
Yeah, she was my mom,
but we weren't close.

389
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,624
There was no, "These are my
last wishes," conversation.

390
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:02,885
I mean, fuck.

391
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:05,828
I can't even remember
the last time we spoke.

392
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,133
So give me a goddamn
break here, all right?

393
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:17,006
Cremation, cardboard
coffin, cheapest urn.

394
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:27,850
You're not even a little
curious about what's in it?

395
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:30,320
I mean, she went through
the process of opening

396
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,605
a safe deposit box.

397
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:34,415
That is not the woman we grew up with.

398
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:38,695
So, I mean, there's gotta
be something important

399
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:40,589
in there, right?

400
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,243
Hello?

401
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:46,952
Bueller? Are you alive?

402
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,674
No, Darlene, I don't
think there's anything

403
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:52,414
important in there.

404
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,136
Well, you don't know that for sure.

405
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,213
I mean, maybe there's some secrets.

406
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:59,107
Secrets?

407
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:02,611
I don't know, like the secret
to why Mom was such a bitch.

408
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:05,280
Money.

409
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:08,692
The deed to a chateau in France.

410
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:12,028
Adoption papers.

411
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:16,733
Your adoption papers.

412
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,868
Yo, asshole!

413
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,236
Please stop ignoring me!

414
00:25:20,238 --> 00:25:21,738
What the fuck is with you, man?

415
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,872
I'm here, aren't I?

416
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:26,209
No, you're not.

417
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,910
I thought you said we were cool.

418
00:25:27,912 --> 00:25:29,078
We are cool.

419
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,380
Okay, then prove it.

420
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:32,048
Come with me to the bank.

421
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,625
What is the point?

422
00:25:34,627 --> 00:25:36,919
It's not gonna change
the fact that mom's dead.

423
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,389
Just fucking come with me!

424
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:46,730
I need to go, okay?

425
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:58,333
Remember when we were kids

426
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:00,410
and you were scared?

427
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:03,780
You were having one of your episodes.

428
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:06,657
And I would tell you to squeeze my hand.

429
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,418
And as long as you could feel my hand,

430
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,328
you knew I was there

431
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,016
and it was okay and everything was real.

432
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:20,188
Well now I need you to help me.

433
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:27,178
Make me feel like everything is okay.

434
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:31,867
You're not gonna find any answers

435
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:35,037
in the old safe deposit box.

436
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,706
Then it'll be a short trip.

437
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:45,154
Condolences.

438
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:54,100
He's an Irish mobster
out of Hell's Kitchen

439
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:55,994
trying to recreate the glory days

440
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:57,829
but online instead of the streets.

441
00:26:57,831 --> 00:27:02,042
Operates what looks like a
legitimate shipping website.

442
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:08,006
But shipping people, Mr. Maguire?

443
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:10,491
More like disappearing people.

444
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:13,178
We pieced together his
AlphaBay connections

445
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,957
and ID'ed 17 career criminals
he helped walk off the street,

446
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,851
never to be seen again,

447
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:22,462
living happy lives under new names

448
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:24,731
all over the world.

449
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,694
Mr. Maguire,

450
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:30,511
you and I, we could help each other.

451
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:33,014
You talk to me and maybe
I could put in a good word.

452
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:35,057
You seem a kind lass

453
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:37,393
and I'd love to help you help me,

454
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:40,313
should I need the helping.

455
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:42,899
But I'm an innocent man, you see?

456
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:52,050
Agent DiPierro, I'm sorry to interrupt.

457
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:53,534
You should see this.

458
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:55,674
Chaos and sadness in Tribeca tonight

459
00:27:55,677 --> 00:27:59,039
following the report of an
apparent suicide jumper.

460
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:01,334
You met with him today, didn't you?

461
00:28:01,336 --> 00:28:04,879
Did he seem upset or worried or...

462
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:06,231
What are you talking about?

463
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,090
They haven't publicly released the name,

464
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:11,592
but it's Agent Horton
from the Santiago case.

465
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:14,012
A spokesperson for the
New York Fire Department

466
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:16,791
confirmed that a middle-aged
man died on impact.

467
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:19,519
He jumped from an eighth
floor apartment window

468
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:21,395
shortly after 5:00 o'clock this evening.

469
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:23,689
- _
- At this time that's as much information

470
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:25,123
- _
- as they're willing to release.

471
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:27,400
- _
- However, I'm told that the identity

472
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:30,452
has been confirmed and
that the NYFD has notif...

473
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,261
It's gone.

474
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:37,429
What?

475
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:39,931
The safe deposit box. It's gone.

476
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:42,267
Payment lapsed two years ago.

477
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:44,627
We tried contacting the account owner...

478
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:46,605
your mother... but never heard back.

479
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:49,632
It's policy to dispose of the contents

480
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:51,968
after a 120 day grace period.

481
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,388
You threw away my mom's shit?

482
00:28:56,975 --> 00:29:00,142
It's policy.

483
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:04,897
What the fuck is wrong with you?

484
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,655
I'll, uh...

485
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:15,449
give you a few minutes.

486
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:26,144
This is ridiculous. Let's go.

487
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:29,648
We still have to pick
up her fucking ashes.

488
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,034
What's going on?

489
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:00,595
Didn't even know what was in there.

490
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,182
Don't you get it, Elliot?

491
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:05,684
It's not about the fucking box.

492
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:07,927
It's about the fact that
you don't give a shit.

493
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:08,961
About mom?

494
00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:11,213
Fucking sue me for not
giving a shit about her

495
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:13,215
- after what she did to us.
- Not mom.

496
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:15,217
Angela.

497
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:23,201
You were right.

498
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:27,038
She's gone.

499
00:30:32,987 --> 00:30:35,363
I mean, how do you do it?

500
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:37,573
How do you just move on like that?

501
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:46,266
I haven't.

502
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,988
- What are you doing?
- Open it.

503
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:13,693
You recognize that tape?

504
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:17,339
How did mom get this?

505
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,133
No idea.

506
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:23,678
This wasn't for her.

507
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,709
Maybe she wished it were.

508
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:32,253
Why would she even listen to it?

509
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:36,274
She was lonely.

510
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:46,618
What are you doing?

511
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,621
I'm gonna listen to it.

512
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,623
And you're gonna listen with me.

513
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:57,611
I can't.

514
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:59,255
Come on.

00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,536

521
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:47,327
- You ready, Angela?
- Ready.

522
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,370
Okay.

523
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:50,831
Three, two, one.

524
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,670
Good morning, Washington Township.

525
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:54,710
We are your hosts Elliot Alderson...

526
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:56,188
Darlene Alderson...

527
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,341
And Angela Moss.

528
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,663
And we're here to say... ready?

529
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,625
Happy Mother's Day, Mrs. Moss!

530
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:05,195
Happy Mother's Day. I love you, Mom.

531
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:06,698
We love you, too.

You're a little unbalanced.

535
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:32,766
The tree.

536
00:33:41,676 --> 00:33:43,551
Yes.

537
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:45,119
To the left.

538
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:51,076
Happy Holidays, Phillip.

539
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:52,893
I was pleased you reached out,

540
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:57,415
having been so quiet
these past few months.

541
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,292
Is that why you're here?

542
00:34:00,754 --> 00:34:02,921
- To make an attempt at...
- Look.

543
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:04,624
It would be a waste of both our times

544
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,907
to speculate on why I'm here.

545
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:08,701
The truth is simple.

546
00:34:08,703 --> 00:34:11,912
Let's give that a shot.

547
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:13,914
I'm resigning

548
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:17,852
as CEO of E Corp by the end of year.

549
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:28,637
Which means, of course,
I'll be parting ways

550
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,199
with the Deus Group as well.

551
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:36,979
Well, that is obviously unacceptable.

552
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:39,773
Your tenure at E Corp
will be over soon enough,

553
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:41,626
but you will simply have to wait.

554
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:43,652
Nothing can rock the boat now

555
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:45,821
as my project has not yet shipped.

556
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:49,658
Yes, yes, I understand,
but here's the thing.

557
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,619
I don't care.

558
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,488
Do not forget your loyalty.

559
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:22,375
My loyalty has been unquestionable.

560
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:29,340
You've taken nearly everything from me.

561
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:32,034
I'd like to leave with
what little I have left.

562
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:36,789
You know that in order for
me to replace you as CEO,

563
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,458
the Deus Group members must all agree

564
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,686
on your successor.

565
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:44,338
In person.

566
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,691
Well, perhaps a New Year's celebration

567
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:50,511
will befit this fresh start, hmm?

568
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:52,530
Your request is absurd.

569
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:55,224
You know we can't organize a
meeting within the next week.

570
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:58,244
And yet I have faith you'll find a way.

571
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:04,584
That is not how this
fucking game is played!

572
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:09,655
Game?

573
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:12,574
Game, that word.

574
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,832
There's our problem.

575
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:17,746
There's an end point.

576
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:20,708
There must be, eventually.

577
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,560
And I've reached mine.

578
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:26,064
Since the game is what you care about,

579
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:28,590
you should be happy.

580
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:29,817
You won.

581
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:37,933
♪ Oh God let us adore him ♪

582
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:42,354

583
00:37:04,608 --> 00:37:06,423
Hello?

584
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,568
I played my hand.

585
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:11,887
And?

586
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:15,575
And now we wait.

587
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:20,604
Thank you.

588
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,248
Don't thank me.

589
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,544
I'm not doing this for you.

590
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:33,718
You ready? I've got Mom's ashes.

591
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,514
Who was that?

592
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:40,850
No one.

593
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:48,924
I saw your phone earlier
when you were here.

594
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:51,194
And on the train platform.

595
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:04,273
Why are you hacking Susan
Jacobs's Ecoin wallet?

596
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:10,487
Why do you care?

597
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,948
Because I do.

598
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,509
Why?

599
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:22,592
I knew her.

600
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:42,019
The last transaction
in her Ecoin wallet.

601
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,024
At the animal shelter?

602
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:56,718
What about it?

603
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:04,500
That wasn't her.

604
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:06,710
It was me.

605
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,844
It was you...

606
00:39:15,846 --> 00:39:18,013
who broke into her house.

607
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,817
You were in jail.

608
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,746
Fsociety needed a new base.

609
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:28,565
But she caught you.

610
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:35,590
She was supposed to be out of town.

611
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:45,675
Darlene...

612
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,292
what did you do?

613
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:52,756
What, you want me to say it?

614
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:59,021
Jesus fucking Christ!

615
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,327
I knew you wouldn't get it.

616
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,731
Then why did you tell me?

617
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:12,627
I guess I had to know.

618
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,838
Know what?

619
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,550
That we'd still be okay.

620
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,137
Even if you knew what I did.

621
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:52,667
I read what she did.

622
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:55,486
The Washington Township case.

623
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:13,354
I need everything you
have on Susan Jacobs.

624
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:16,190
Why?

625
00:41:20,697 --> 00:41:24,440
Susan Jacobs was also
working for the Dark Army.

626
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,713
And what does that have to do with you?

627
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:43,158
I'm going after whiterose.

628
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,634
You know that's suicide, right?

629
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:57,565
Probably.

630
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,475
And you're gonna do it anyway?

631
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:06,741
Why not give up?

632
00:42:06,743 --> 00:42:08,934
Can't.

633
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:11,019
She'll find me.

634
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:17,585
Us.

635
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:20,612
She'll find us both. That's
why you're doing this.

636
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:28,203
I'm in.

637
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:30,080
No.

638
00:42:30,082 --> 00:42:32,605
This is exactly why I didn't
tell you in the first place.

639
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:34,918
I'm not giving you a choice.

640
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,212
Besides, you need me.

641
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:39,923
Face it, every hack
you've ever pulled off

642
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,717
is because Fsociety helped you,

643
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,278
and right now we're
all that's left, okay?

644
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:48,950
If this is the biggest
thing you're ever gonna do,

645
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:51,560
then we're doing it together.

646
00:42:53,123 --> 00:42:54,864
Give me your phone.

647
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,135
I rigged Signal's API to beam GPS coords

648
00:43:07,137 --> 00:43:09,244
so we can share locations.

649
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:10,972
That way if you're
ever worried about me,

650
00:43:10,974 --> 00:43:12,974
you'll know where I am.

651
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:15,217
It's done.

652
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:17,502
Okay, I'm in whether you like it or not.

653
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:23,592
I honestly wasn't expecting
you to say whiterose.

654
00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:25,281
I mean, I knew you were up to something,

655
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:28,656
but you were acting like
such a total sketchball,

656
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:30,641
I figured it had to do with Vera.

657
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,905
Vera?

658
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:38,207
What are you talking... what
does he have to do with anything?

659
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:39,780
Well, that's what I was wondering.

660
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,587
I mean, he freaked me the fuck out

661
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,837
when he showed up at your building

662
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,673
a couple months ago,
but when I told you,

663
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:48,676
you just blew it off
like it was no big deal.

664
00:43:56,761 --> 00:44:01,022
I don't need to worry about him, do I?

665
00:44:06,696 --> 00:44:09,030
No.

666
00:44:09,032 --> 00:44:12,182
You should get going.

667
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:14,309
Pull everything you have on Susan.

668
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,692
You coming?

669
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:25,821
I'll be right there.

670
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:31,552
Elliot, thanks...

671
00:44:32,722 --> 00:44:34,129
For today.

672
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:46,042
I don't know what Darlene is talking...

673
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:47,558
Price made his move.

674
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,344
We might actually have
a shot at whiterose.

675
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:51,722
But none of that matters 'cause
I can't fucking trust you!

676
00:44:51,724 --> 00:44:52,735
Listen to me.

677
00:44:52,738 --> 00:44:54,248
I don't know anything about Vera.

678
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:55,726
You heard what she said.

679
00:44:55,728 --> 00:44:58,079
She told one of us, and it wasn't me.

680
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,904
There's no reason for
me to keep that from you.

681
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:00,823
Fuck it!

682
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:02,955
You wanna go back to not
talking to each other?

683
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,377
Locking each other out?
Fighting for control?

684
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,090
Look at me! I am telling you the truth.

685
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:12,409
I am not the one Darlene talked to.

686
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:23,938
If it wasn't you,

687
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,439
and it wasn't me...

688
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:30,093
Who was it?

689
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,826
I've been looking all over for you.

690
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:26,334
You shouldn't be sitting
there. That's not your seat.

691
00:46:26,336 --> 00:46:27,409
Why? I thought...

692
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:29,837
They're not ready yet.

693
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,823
- We need to wait.
- For what?

694
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:34,717
For him.

695
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:37,845
You mean Mr. Robot?

696
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:39,755
No.

697
00:46:39,757 --> 00:46:41,164
Elliot?

698
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,683
No.

699
00:46:44,354 --> 00:46:45,794
The other one.

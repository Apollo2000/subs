1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:02,120
<i>Previously on Absentia...</i>

2
00:00:02,126 --> 00:00:04,771
Where is she?! Where is my wife?!

3
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:07,186
The serial killer's macabre signature:

4
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:09,389
removing the eyelids of his victim.

5
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:10,899
- <i>Hello, Nick.</i>
- Harlow?

6
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:12,687
- How the hell are you calling me?
- Nick.

7
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:13,958
<i>She's alive.</i>

8
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,430
- How long?
- You've been gone six years.

9
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:25,067
<i>Emily, you and I have both been
victimized by the same person.</i>

10
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:28,516
- How did you do it?
- You can see that look in your eyes,

11
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,527
we both have it.

12
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:32,709
They found my DNA on Semerov's body

13
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:34,197
and now Harlow is dead?

14
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:36,197
BPD has issued a warrant for you.

15
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,275
- I have to take you in.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

16
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,470
I'm gonna solve this.

17
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,680
Why do you have my
visions in your journal?

18
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:47,381
The bleeding eye was the only clue
I could never make sense of.

19
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,617
It's not a person, it's a place.

20
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,814
It's someone who is connected to
my childhood and to my captor.

21
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:56,019
- Did Dr. Shen hurt you?
- Yeah.

22
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,230
Your friend?

23
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:00,340
Did your friend hurt Dr. Shen back?

24
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:02,782
That's the mask Emily drew.

25
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:04,198
The children who saw these masks

26
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:06,812
had the idea way before
Harlow ever got involved.

27
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:08,915
I found a company called "Tri-King".

28
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:10,970
I think they made the tank that held me.

29
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,575
I need to find out who ordered
it and where it was sent.

30
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,189
Our whole life together,

31
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:16,992
it's just a consolation, isn't it?

32
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:19,080
I'm going to my sister's.

33
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:22,872
Alice!

34
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,334
<i>My family has been taken from me.</i>

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,238
<i>Emily, I know you're hurting...</i>

36
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:36,336
<i>but I beg of you,
please bring them home.</i>

37
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,348
<i>Nick, I'm not far from the cabin.</i>

38
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:43,059
Whoever planned this has eyes.

39
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:44,965
I need you to come alone.

<i>No.</i>

43
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:38,410
Yeah?

44
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:40,936
<i>Hey, Tommy, do you know
where Nick is? His phone's off.</i>

45
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:42,865
I don't know. I saw
him on a call about...

46
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,148
half an hour ago, and then he was gone.

47
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,354
<i>Damn it!</i>

48
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,201
<i>You think he's still close by?</i>

49
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,415
Probably. Maybe.

50
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,474
<i>I think I have a good lead near you.</i>

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,095
<i>Old employee from Barrett House.</i>

52
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,419
Okay, I'll take the lead.

53
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,199
You take down the boy.

54
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,346
<i>She has a bunch of old
files in her attic.</i>

55
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:01,472
- <i>Maybe there's something we can use.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you.

56
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:02,678
Good.

57
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:27,519
Alice, wake up. Alice,
you've gotta wake up.

58
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:30,315
<i>Up and at them, Agent.</i>

59
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,640
<i>This is your second chance.</i>

60
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:44,119
<i>Life doesn't give us
second chances too often.</i>

61
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,752
<i>Make the most of it.</i>

62
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:52,239
Where's Flynn?

63
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,418
Who are you?

64
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,253
<i>I am you.</i>

65
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,168
What do you want?

66
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,971
<i>I want to show you what you are.</i>

67
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:20,381
<i>Do you remember the
first life you destroyed?</i>

68
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:23,888
<i>You were just a child.</i>

69
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,989
<i>But it came so naturally to you.</i>

70
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:36,701
<i>"Child exhibits violent urges."</i>

71
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:40,489

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,916
<i>"Stimulation-seeking behavior."</i>

73
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,372
<i>"Does not respond to typical
disciplinary measures."</i>

74
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,965
<i>"Child appears to fit in with others,</i>

75
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,278
<i>but displays little affection."</i>

<i>"Low probability of adoptive success."</i>

79
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,550
<i>Nobody wanted you.</i>

80
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:23,142
<i>Too troubled.</i>

81
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:25,037
<i>Too flawed.</i>

82
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,914
<i>So you did something about it.</i>

83
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:32,352
<i>You took someone else's life.</i>

84
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:37,327
<i>My life.</i>

85
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:51,674
<i>All these years I've wondered why.</i>

86
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:54,418
- <i>Why Dr. Shen chose me?</i>
- _

87
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,360
- _
- <i>Why me?</i>

88
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,821
_

89
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:01,209
<i>Shen was looking for a profile.</i>

90
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:04,891
<i>A very specific profile.</i>

91
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:06,609
_

92
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,801
- <i>You had what he was looking for.</i>
- _

93
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:15,008
<i>You gave me your life, Emily.</i>

94
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,353
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:23,942
I'm so sorry.

96
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,611
<i>Tonight, I finish giving it back.</i>

97
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:30,911
Please, let them go.

98
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:32,490
Flynn's not a part of this.

99
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>Flynn is a part of this.</i>

100
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:37,006
<i>I was his age when Dr. Shen chose me.</i>

101
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,889
<i>He transferred in right after you left.</i>

102
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,818
<i>He would sign us out...</i>

103
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,334
<i>week-end trips...</i>

104
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,760
<i>the museum, the zoo.</i>

105
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,166
<i>But they would always end up</i>

106
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,158
<i>at his special place.</i>

107
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:53,449
<i>He promised he'd kill
us if we told anyone.</i>

108
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:54,947
<i>Who could we tell?</i>

109
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,122
<i>We had no one.</i>

110
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,380
<i>He had the power.</i>

111
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,813
<i>For six years, he tortured us.</i>

112
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:22,211
You can take it off now,

113
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,849
Logan.

114
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,354
You can take it off.

115
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:37,109
<i>You see,</i>

116
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:41,210
<i>Shen believed children who
survived early traumas like yours,</i>

117
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:43,022
<i>and weren't crushed by it,</i>

118
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:45,921
<i>could be forged into killer soldiers.</i>

119
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:48,938
<i>Clinical. Dispassionate.</i>

120
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:52,240
<i>Weapons that could be turned on and off,</i>

121
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:53,745
<i>like a switch.</i>

122
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:58,553
<i>Charles was the control subject and...</i>

123
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:02,024
<i>I was supposed to be a perfect killer.</i>

124
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:03,824
<i>Controllable.</i>

125
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:06,384
<i>One who followed orders.</i>

126
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,699
<i>A good soldier.</i>

127
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,320
<i>But we were both failed
experiments, Charles and I.</i>

128
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:21,776
- <i>We're not taking any lives today...</i>
- _

129
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,928
<i>♪ ...Ashes! We all fall... ♪</i>

130
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,881
You.

131
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,597
<i>So, you're not the only one who
can start a new life, Emily.</i>

132
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,030
I mean, you'd think that I'd go crazy,

133
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,749
but I didn't.

134
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,773
<i>And it just made me stronger.</i>

135
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:29,119
<i>Charles and I, we found
out where Shen was,</i>

136
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:30,999
<i>and we took care of him.</i>

137
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,993
<i>He's not gonna bother us anymore.</i>

138
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:19,752
<i>Shen's work was brilliant, no doubt,</i>

139
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,785
but it was flawed.

140
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:24,473
He was an amateur.

141
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:26,463
<i>And I had a lot more money.</i>

142
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,169
<i>Harlow made that comfortable.</i>

143
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,090
I couldn't have asked for
a more willing partner.

144
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,720
<i>Six years, breaking you down</i>

145
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:38,479
<i>and taking everything away from you.</i>

146
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:41,202
<i>Recreating you and setting you free,</i>

147
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,905
<i>to watch your life crumble
around you, once and for all.</i>

148
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:49,948
<i>It all went beautifully.</i>

149
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,479
<i>Nothing would have been more satisfying</i>

150
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,690
<i>than to see you kill
your husband's new wife</i>

151
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:59,667
<i>and show the world the
truth about Emily Byrne.</i>

152
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:05,832
<i>Sadly, I watched as you did nothing.</i>

153
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:12,798
<i>Shen would have been so surprised</i>

154
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,603
<i>to learn that all his
work could be undone</i>

155
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:16,939
<i>by a mother's love for her child.</i>

156
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,468
Tell me what you want.

157
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,725
I'll do anything.

158
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:30,844
I'll turn myself in,
I'll confess to murder, please,

159
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,842
just let Flynn go.

160
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:36,074
<i>You will confess to murder,
Emily, you committed it.</i>

161
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:37,880
<i>You killed Harlow.</i>

162
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,175
<i>You killed Robert Semerov.</i>

163
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,592
<i>You killed Semerov right
there in that room.</i>

164
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:43,996
I didn't do it.

165
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,535
You killed Harlow to frame me,

166
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,729
just like you killed
Semerov and Radford.

167
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:50,827
<i>Well, you're right about one
thing. I did kill Radford.</i>

168
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,806
<i>You left me no choice.</i>

169
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,328
<i>But now, it ends.</i>

170
00:14:57,976 --> 00:14:59,390
<i>The way it should have.</i>

171
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,609
<i>Mom!</i>

172
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,319
No.

173
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:16,125
Please, no.

174
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:19,439
<i>But you can save him.</i>

175
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:20,672
No.

176
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,178
<i>Kill Alice.</i>

177
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,157
Please, no!

178
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,141
No!

179
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,259
<i>Go on.</i>

180
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,074
<i>Do it.</i>

181
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:52,941
<i>Kill her.</i>

182
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,894
<i>Show yourself who you really are.</i>

183
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:27,072
<i>Kill her.</i>

184
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:37,871
- Emily! Emily don't do it!
- Stop it, Nick,

185
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:39,976
- it's not me.
- Get away! What is this?

186
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,408
- I gotta go. I gotta go outta here, please!
- No! Don't move, stand back!

187
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:46,087
- Nick, look it's...
- I swear to God...

188
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,493
Look behind you.

189
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:51,117
- Just look behind you, please!
- Don't move! Stay there!

190
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,750
<i>Mom!</i>

191
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:57,637
What is this?

192
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:03,697
- What is this? What is this?
- What?

193
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:05,315
- No!
- What have you done to my son?

194
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,621
Where is he, Emily?

195
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:09,470
- Please... Stop it, Nick, it's not me.
- Where is my son?!

196
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:11,062
You're gonna tell me where my son is.

197
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:13,546
- Tell me where my son is.
- Alice? Alice?!

198
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:16,556
I know where he is. I know where he is.

199
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,468
- Just step forward, slowly.
- Okay.

200
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:23,038
Alice?!

201
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:26,069
Nick, we gotta be careful,
she's still out there.

202
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:27,566
Your ideas suck!

203
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:29,170
Stop it!

204
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:35,338
Yeah. Okay. Crown?!

205
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,937
We got a triangulation on Durand's cell.

206
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:39,411
Okay, gather round, people.

207
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:42,831
I don't believe this.

208
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,427
Goddammit, he's at the cabin.
Okay, let's go.

209
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,459
I want a team ready in five. Let's go!

210
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:55,287
Face forward. Face forward!

211
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,729
Stop. Are you okay?

212
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:04,444
It's okay. It's...

213
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,412
That door!

214
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:12,735
Fast!

215
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:15,901
- The lock. Just pull it out.
- Mom!

216
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,917
Emily, go away! Emily,
get outta the away!

217
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:20,420
Get the lock!

218
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:22,494
Get the lock!

219
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,557
Stand up. Move! Move!

220
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:37,928
Nick.

221
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,166
Out!

222
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:43,221
You're okay, buddy. You're okay.
Come on. Come on. That's it.

223
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:45,321
Slowly. Slowly!

224
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:50,012
Come. Come!

225
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,083
Are you okay?

226
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,757
Get down! Get down. get down!

227
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,060
Run!

228
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,179
Go. Go!

229
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:25,717
Come on. Go this way.
Here it is. Here it is.

230
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:27,543
Come on, Flynn!

231
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:21,938
See the car?

232
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,778
- No.
- Go straight. Go straight

233
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,892
Alice. Alice, get in the driver's seat.

234
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,505
- What?
- Start driving south.

235
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:11,464
- What about you?
- I have to go back.

236
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,856
- No, Nick.
- Dad! Dad, don't go!

237
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,072
Get in the car.

238
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:44,927
I got Staties on the line.

239
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,691
This is Crown. I want a perimeter
at the access road.

240
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,088
No one in or out. Do not advance.

241
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:53,409
Repeat, do not advance until we
know the situation. Am I clear?

242
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:55,877
You got that? Great.

243
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,149
Look what they've done to us.

244
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:18,513
What?

245
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:39,497
No!

246
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,438
<i>The six bodies recovered in the forest</i>

247
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:50,552
<i>were the victims of Conrad
Harlow and Laurie Colson.</i>

248
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:52,442
- <i>These two serial killers</i>
- _

249
00:28:52,448 --> 00:28:54,165
- <i>operated together.</i>
- _

250
00:28:54,437 --> 00:28:57,176
<i>Emily Byrne has been cleared
of any involvement</i>

251
00:28:57,182 --> 00:29:00,573
<i>in those murders, as well
as those of Robert Semerov,</i>

252
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:04,683
<i>Conrad Harlow and Special
Agent Adam Radford.</i>

253
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:07,375
<i>Ms. Colson committed those murders.</i>

254
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,242
<i>She was killed 2 days ago by Emily Byrne</i>

255
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,630
<i>in an act of self-defense.
Thank you very much.</i>

256
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:21,258
So, Logan Brandt killed Shen
as revenge for the experiments.

257
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:23,401
Can't say I blame her.

258
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:24,912
Then she digs into his files,

259
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:27,318
finds out about the switch,
that leads her to Emily.

260
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:30,709
She dedicates her life to revenge...

261
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,359
reinvents herself as Laurie Colson,

262
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:35,555
and in Harlow she finds
the perfect partner.

263
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,320
He hated Emily.

264
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:40,434
Match made in heaven. Leopold and Loeb.

265
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,111
What'd you find in those
old Barrett House files?

266
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:46,304
Nothing. We're looking for more kids
that Shen might have targeted.

267
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:53,081
- You comfortable?
- Yeah.

268
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,193
Okay. Then get to it.

269
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:10,916
Hey.

270
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:13,718
Hey.

271
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,003
You're here.

272
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:20,873
Yeah.

273
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,920
How do you feel?

274
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:30,450
- Not much.
- Hmm.

275
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:32,303
You?

276
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:33,996
Eh...

277
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:35,865
Same.

278
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:41,002
Sorry I doubted you.

279
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:52,123
I almost got you killed.

280
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,843
But I should've believed you all along.

281
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:04,297
I hope you forgive me.

282
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:18,677
Nick, in the hotel room...

283
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:24,093
I didn't know if I was
gonna see you again.

284
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,633
- And I just wanted to relive it.
- I did too.

285
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:33,329
But, um...

286
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:35,668
I'm not the same.

287
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,235
I mean, we're both not the same.

288
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:42,085
Mmm.

289
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:45,411
And things are different now.

290
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:46,913
I know.

291
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,798
You know, Alice is good for you.

292
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,874
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:31:58,153 --> 00:31:59,654
Alice is pregnant.

294
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:09,179
Congratulations.

295
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:12,397
Yeah.

296
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,598
This is good.

297
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,450
We needed this.

298
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:58,458
Yeah. We did.

299
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,050
I bet I put people through a lot.

300
00:33:03,056 --> 00:33:07,352
Stop. You did what you had
to do in order to survive.

301
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:10,163
I know who you are...

302
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:12,558
and I know how far you've come.

303
00:33:13,086 --> 00:33:16,480
Even what you did as a child,
it's what you had to do.

304
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,407
But now it's time to move on,

305
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,818
because that's what survivors do.

306
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,339
- Oh.
- Oh.

307
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:29,040
What is that?

308
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:31,456
- Ma, check this out.
- That is amazing.

309
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:33,855
I bet your Uncle Jack got
that one for you, huh?

310
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:36,266
- Yeah.
- I love it. Happy birthday, baby.

311
00:33:36,272 --> 00:33:37,557
Thank you.

312
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,373
Why don't you go show it
to Alice and your dad?

313
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:40,579
Sure.

314
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:47,581
- Dad, you want anything to drink?
- I'll have a beer.

315
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:48,899
Okay, I'll go get it.

316
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:27,919
I told you I was the second type of cop.

317
00:34:29,472 --> 00:34:30,688
Yes.

318
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,975
I'm glad you are.

319
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,740
I believed you were innocent.

320
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:48,740
So, um... what now?

321
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:54,282
Crown asked me if I wanted
back in the Bureau.

322
00:34:57,786 --> 00:34:59,074
And?

323
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:03,805
And I think I'm gonna do it.

324

2
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,272
It is the judgment of this court...

3
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,533
that the defendant, Conrad Harlow,

4
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,646
having been found guilty
of the murder of Emily Byrne,

5
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:31,553
be committed to the custody
of the US Bureau of Prisons

6
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:34,385
for a life sentence without parole.

7
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:22,343
<i>...still the main
suspect in two additional murders</i>

8
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,304
<i>and five missing persons cases.</i>

9
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,726
<i>The FBI have only been able
to make a case against him,</i>

10
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:29,455
<i>for the murder of FBI agent, Emily Byrne.</i>

11
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:32,210
<i>The serial killer's macabre signature,</i>

12
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:34,505
<i>removing the eyelids of his victims.</i>

13
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:35,591
Hey!

14
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,367
Hey, where is he?

15
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,964
- Sir, please. Please step back.
- Where is my wife?

16
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,831
- I want my wife.
- Sir, please.

17
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:44,219
- Where did you put her?
- Nick, no. Nick!

18
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,423
- Where did you put her? Where is she?
- No. Nick!

19
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,427
- Where is she?
- Nick!

20
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,092
Where is my wife?

21
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:53,088
On the starboard, one.

22
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,473
Port side on two.

23
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,497
_

24
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,854
Tap it on. Tap it on, three.

25
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,826
Breathe... two.

26
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:08,869
Breathe... three.

27
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:12,900
Stop!

28
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,888
Hey, Tommy.

29
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,145
Cause of death is manual strangulation.

30
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:53,048
We're running his DNA
through the usual databases.

31
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:54,943
Here. Look at this...

32
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,630
Fish bites. Note the texture.

33
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,568
Now, look at the eyelids.

34
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:03,255
These are clean cuts, not bites.

35
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:06,174
So the eyelids were cut off?

36
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,782
You sure?

37
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,964
Unless a new species of fish

38
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:13,409
recently mutated in the Charles,
which I suppose is possible.

39
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,611
What is it?

40
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,114
Conrad Harlow...

41
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,802
killed that fed Emily Burn a while back.

42
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,122
You won't guess what his signature was.

43
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,478
You think the wrong man's in jail?

44
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,627
Or this is a copycat.

45
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:45,773
- You ready?
- Not really.

46
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:48,008
Come on.

47
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,408
You can do this.

48
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:11,680
Come on, Flynn!

49
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,208
Come on, Flynn!

50
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:18,254
Keep going!

51
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,310
Yeah!

52
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,774
Hey, how you doing? You feel good?

53
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:28,828
Come on, buddy!

54
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,985
Come on, Flynn!
Come on, keep going. Come on, Flynn!

55
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,400
Come on.

56
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:36,806
- I won!
- You won. Yes.

57
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,406
Come on, guys.

58
00:06:46,524 --> 00:06:49,664
- Oh, come on.
- What? Are you embarrassed?

59
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,440
Are you embarrassed?
Are you ashamed of me?

60
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,502
Adam.

61
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,487
- Nick, sorry, I was just...
- Oh, no, no. That's all right.

62
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:27,044
_

63
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,178
Hey, come here.

64
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,007
Look at me.

65
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,288
I know she would have loved
to be at your race.

66
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,259
To every race.

67
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:48,516
She wanted to make your life safer.

68
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:49,928
And mine.

69
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:52,357
We kind of owe her, don't you think?

70
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:55,706
You're my mom.

71
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,858
Hey, champ.

72
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:07,311
- Hey.
- Hey. How is he doing?

73
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,799
- This is always a tough day.
- Never gets easier.

74
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,288
Durand.

75
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:47,851
<i>Hello, Nick.</i>

76
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,302
Harlow?

77
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,327
<i>I imagine you're in bed
with your new wife right now.</i>

78
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,168
Why the hell are you calling me?

79
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,367
Nick...

80
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,618
<i>Up and at 'em, Agent Durand.</i>

81
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,932
<i>You have 60 minutes if you push it.</i>

82
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:09,181
- <i>She won't last a second longer.</i>
- Who is it?

83
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,359
Who are you talking about?

84
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,521
<i>She's alive.</i>

85
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,408
<i>This is your second chance, Nick.</i>

86
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:22,788
<i>Life doesn't give a
second chance too often.</i>

87
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:26,347
<i>Make the most of it.</i>

88
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:30,686
<i>Take I-93 north. Exit 44 A.</i>

89
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,733
Hey.

90
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,154
- <i>Follow the service road up north...</i>
- What's happening?

91
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,248
<i>- and take the right.</i>
- What are you doing?

92
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:38,295
<i>There's a cabin there.</i>

93
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:40,938
Please. Stop. Just stop.

94
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,481
Nick! Nick!

95
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,802
I'm telling you it was Harlow.
He called me at home.

96
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,433
He said it's a cabin.
Support meet me at the access road.

97
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:55,316
<i>Copy that, Nick. Radford is on his way
to question Harlow.</i>

98
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,426
<i>Let's see if he can get
anything out of him.</i>

99
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:12,795
The cabin is 100 meters that way.

100
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,208
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

101
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:39,808
Go.

102
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:50,069
- It's empty. I repeat the cabin's empty.
- <i>Can you repeat that?</i>

103
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:52,194
Subject is not in the cabin.

104
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,653
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Awaiting orders.

105
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:01,367
Wait, wait, wait. Move the flashlight.

106
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,208
Help me with these boards!
Help me with these boards.

107
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,568
Take those boards off.

108
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:21,850
Medic! We need a medic!

109
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,041
It's her. It's her. Open it! Open it!

110
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:30,115
Don't need a ladder.

111
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,402
Down here. Get over here.

112
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:36,644
- It won't open.
- Open it.

113
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:49,131
Step back! Step back!

114
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:07,960
- Get her legs. Get her legs.
- Go, go, go.

115
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:12,712
Turn, turn, turn.

116
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:20,793
Ma'am, can you hear me? Can you hear me?

117
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,903
Can you squeeze my hand?

118
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,208
Squeeze my hand. You're safe now.

119
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:31,843
Ma'am, squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand if you can hear.

120
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,007
Hold her still.

121
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:47,026
Emily!

122
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,773
Emily! They're trying to help you!
Trying to help you!

123
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,630
- Calm down.
- Here we go. Here we go.

124
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,700
Easy.

125
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:07,919
Go. Go.

126
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:09,989
Go!

127
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:12,800
Mr. Durand, what is it like
having Emily back?

128
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,648
<i>- Scusi.</i>
- Where has she been?

129
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:16,566
Has he told you anything?

130
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,597
- Go!
- Can you give us some information?

131
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,665
Mr. Durand. Mr. Durand.

132
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:26,853
Has he said anything? Mr. Durand!

133
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,859
What do we have?

134
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,453
Found her under water in a tank.
She's got minor cuts and abrasions,

135
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,527
and her breathing's shallow.
Blood pressure 140/95.

136
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,870
Tachycardia, 145.

137
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,819
- What did you give her?
- 15 mg Diazepam.

138
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,010
- What is her name?
- Emily. Emily Byrne.

139
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:43,954
Wait. You have to wait here.

140
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:06,819
<i>FBI agent Emily Byrne was
found alive earlier this morning.</i>

141
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:09,035
<i>Declared dead in absentia,
Byrne is believed to be</i>

142
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,680
<i>a victim of Conrad Harlow,</i>

143
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:13,327
<i>the suspect in several additional
missing persons cases</i>

144
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,007
<i>currently meeting life imprisonment</i>

145
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,955
<i>for the murder of Emily Byrne.</i>

146
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,088
Nick.

147
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,168
Hey. You heard anything?

148
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:28,337
Uh, not much. We're kind of
in a holding pattern here.

149
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:33,858
Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jack.

150
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:40,671
- I've tried calling you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

151
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:44,960
I just saw it on the news.
I just needed a moment.

152
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,497
I understand.

153
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,241
How is she?

154
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:55,881
I don't know.

155
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:58,728
<i>Her brother and I,
we're waiting for the doctor.</i>

156
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:01,007
How are you?

157
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:02,718
I'm fine.

158
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,780
Look, I can't say much right now,

159
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:07,491
<i>about where she was or...</i>

160
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,850
You don't have to.

161
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,624
Flynn just woke up.

162
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,546
He's picking his clothes for school.

163
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,836
We shouldn't tell him yet.

164
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:20,056
I want to be there.

165
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,766
Mom, do you have time for waffles?

166
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:23,718
Sure, honey.

167
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:26,882
I have to go.

168
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:30,393
- Okay. Me too.
- <i>I love you.</i>

169
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:32,798
Okay.

170
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:41,600
Flynn. Flynn. How do you feel about
your mother being alive and back?

171
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:53,765
I should have kept looking for her.

172
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,741
No, no... We did everything we could.

173
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:02,617
You had to do right by Flynn.

174
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:06,274
And what's he gonna have
to deal with now?

175
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:11,327
How is she?

176
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,705
I am Dr. Fletcher.

177
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,775
- I'm sorry, this is Jack. Emily's brother.
- She's stable.

178
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,896
I know your colleagues
will want to speak with her

179
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:21,871
but we need to proceed delicately.

180
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:24,207
Do you have any idea
what happened to her?

181
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,254
No. We're still running tests.

182
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:29,676
She's having intermittent laryngospasm.

183
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:33,672
A sudden constricting of the throat
usually in response to drowning.

184
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:37,253
The second she opens her eyes,
gentlemen, you will know.

185
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,624
- Right now, she needs to rest.
- Thank you.

186
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:42,168
Yeah. Thank you.

187
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,816
I need to do something.

188
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,168
I need to go to the office.

189
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:56,230
Let's start with the tank,
what the hell was it for?

190
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,888
Custom-made, we're checking
region manufacturers.

191
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,023
Water was from the creek at the back,
and the lock was on a timer.

192
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:04,195
CSU found traces of hallucinogens

193
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:07,007
- and nutrients in water.
- What about the cabin?

194
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,427
We're tracing ownership but

195
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,688
locals say no one used it in decades.

196
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,536
- And forensics?
- No prints, no blood, nothing.

197
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:16,419
Whoever cleaned it was good.

198
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:19,739
We don't know if she was in there
for 6 hours or 6 years.

199
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,380
Had to be in and out of the tank,

200
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,303
or the skin would start to break down.

201
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,920
Johnson and Briggs are
going house to house in the area

202
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,193
to see if anybody saw
anyone coming or going.

203
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:30,008
Vega's flying back from D.C.

204
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:32,704
He'll assist in Emily's debrief
and reassimilation.

205
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,301
Crown, comb Harlow's correspondence.

206
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,987
Every letter, every visitor.

207
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,581
Harlow's gonna walk, isn't he?

208
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:40,169
Harlow called me.

209
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,345
At my house.

210
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:44,134
He told me where to find her.

211
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:46,324
But Harlow's not admitting
he made the call.

212
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,938
We tossed his cell, checked the
footage... I even grilled him myself.

213
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,763
We know he's involved. He can't walk.

214
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:53,700
But he went to jail for murder,

215
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:56,006
now he has to be
retrialed for abduction.

216
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:58,024
Still no ID on the river body?

217
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,765
No hits yet.

218
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,998
The killer cut off a man's eyelids.

219
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:06,208
Someone out there had Emily
in that cabin, it's the same person.

220
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:09,855
We'll protect Emily and
we'll catch whoever did it.

221
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:11,969
Now get to it.

222
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:23,055
Take Emily's old case files.

223
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,586
Look for anybody who hates her
enough to be involved in this.

224
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:28,952
You're okay?

225
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,535
Good, now let's get him.

226
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,127
Emily...

227
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,127
Hold her. Hold her.

228
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:05,522
Grab her hands. Hold her.

229
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:06,807
Damn journalists had to get in here!

230
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:08,440
Hold her tight. Yeah, all right.

231
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,908
- Get her out of here.
- Get her out!

232
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:11,173
Calm down, Emily...

233
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,540
- Where is she?
- Hey. Relax, Nick.

234
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:18,767
All right, what she did?

235
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,208
What she did was an instinctive response.

236
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,618
She perceived that
journalist as a threat,

237
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,165
and she acted.

238
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:28,728
- She's still awake?
- Yes. You can see her.

239
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,248
Her father's with her already. Come on.

240
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:48,872
Emily.

241
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,098
Can you hear me?

242
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,898
We can send them away
if that's what you want.

243
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:12,794
Flynn.

244
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:17,151
Flynn's great.

245
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:20,208
He looks so much like you.

246
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:26,250
- I'll show you.
- I strongly suggest...

247
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:28,728
I think my daughter
wants to see her son.

248
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:40,638
Here he is.

249
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,691
How long?

250
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:52,009
Emily.

251
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,622
You've been gone six years.

252
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,973
Please, let's give them some time alone.

253
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,273
Warren, it's all right.

254
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,986
I had the perfect speech prepared.

255
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:55,970
Emily...

256
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:20,408
Is this about the call
I'm supposed to have made?

257
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,539
It's quite a mystery.

258
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:28,448
- Who held my wife in that cabin?
- I wish I knew.

259
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:32,367
But I have faith you'll find
whoever framed me.

260
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,048
How did you communicate
with this person...

261
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:38,627
to arrange Emily's release?

262
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:44,248
Now that she's free,
let's talk about my release.

263
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,345
You're trying my patience.

264
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:50,781
Well, so think about doing time
for a crime you didn't commit.

265
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:52,643
Don't you dare say that.

266
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,759
It builds patience.

267
00:23:56,314 --> 00:24:00,154
I will make sure
things happen to you in here.

268
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:03,688
Things even you wouldn't do to a person.

269
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,358
How about making sure
you keep her safe this time?

270
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,262
- Step away!
- Step away, sir!

271
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:25,407
Get him out of here!

272
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:32,374
He wore a mask.

273
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:36,616
It's good. What else?

274
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:42,823
I never saw his face.

275
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,759
He's... He's still out there.

276
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:25,017
You're gonna be fine.

277
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:27,803
I promise you.

278
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:33,650
Please, I just want to go home.

279
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,786
You know you don't have
to do this, Emily.

280
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,871
Maybe it's too much too soon.

281
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:01,578
No. I need to see Flynn.

282
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:03,727
Okay.

283
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,813
If it gets to be too much,
then you just...

284
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,917
let me know and we'll get out of there.

285
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,744
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay?

286
00:26:11,877 --> 00:26:13,502
Okay.

287
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,586
This is it.

288
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:53,754
- I told you.
- I'm sorry.

289
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,901
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

290
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:56,263
- How am I supposed to do...
- Alice, I'm sorry.

291
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:57,879
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot to fix it.
- Look at this!

292
00:26:57,904 --> 00:26:59,784
I forgot to fix it. I'm sorry.

293
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,566
It's not like I had a ton of time.
You know what I've been going through.

294
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,018
Have I not gone through it?

295
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:05,617
She just needs to feel welcome.

296
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,688
And she just needs to be with Flynn.

297
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,883
- I know this. I know this, Nick.
- She's not gonna care...

298
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,572
- Why do you think I want everything
- about the goddamn dishwasher.

299
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,857
to be all right for her to arrive?

300
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:27,596
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, come in. Come in.

301
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:31,005
Um, he's this way.

302
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,528
This is Alice.

303
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,608
Is this Riggs?

304
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:56,823
Yeah.

305
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,548
Hi, puppy.

306
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,962
Hello.

307
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:32,638
Come here.

308
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,459
Oh, my God.

309
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:49,178
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm happy to see you.

310
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,174
Oh, my God. Look at you.

311
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:05,136
Look at you, you're so cute.

312
00:29:05,636 --> 00:29:07,115
And tall.

313
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:17,707
Flynn, why don't you
show your mother your room?

314
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,955
It's just the dishwasher.

315
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:05,064
You can sit on my bed if you want.

316
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:07,947
Yeah.

317
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:24,566
I'm sorry about downstairs, Flynn.

318
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:28,367
The last time that I saw you,
you were very little.

319
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:31,248
You hurt my mom.

320
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:37,888
Your mom? How did I hurt her?

321
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:41,489
They were fighting. They never fight.

322
00:30:58,051 --> 00:30:59,650
I'm sorry.

323
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:08,096
Emily!

324
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:09,852
Emily, what happened? What's going on?

325
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,432
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- I don't even know what I'm doing here.

326
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,674
- Hey. Come here, come here, come here.
- Nick, please.

327
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,211
- All right. I know. I know. I know.
- Hey. Hey.

328
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:19,217
Hey.

329
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:28,447
- He hates me. He hates me.
- Hey, no, no.

330
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,282
No.

331
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:35,205
- He hates me.
- No, he doesn't.

332
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:36,706
Now listen to me.

333
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:39,272
Listen. Listen.

334
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:43,448
I'm not scared to fight through this.

335
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,680
Flynn deserves to know the real you.

336
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:53,269
Just go back inside, Nick.

337
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:56,161
Go back to your wife.

338
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,666
So, this is me.

339
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,634
Um...

340
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:33,361
The kitchen...
The kitchen's through there.

341
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,640
And the bathroom's back that way
with the bedroom.

342
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:40,191
Hey, give your bag.

343
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:43,721
Yeah. Okay.

344
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:47,854
Do you... Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?

345
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,499
Mm-hm.

346
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,448
Yeah, um...

347
00:32:58,968 --> 00:33:01,367
I'm selling medical supplies now.

348
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:06,735
- You don't practice anymore?
- No. No, I lost my license.

349
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,896
Things kind of got away from me...

350
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:13,545
um, after everything that happened but...

351
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,515
Hey, look, it's been...

352
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:18,914
2 years, 2 months and...

353
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:20,335
23 days.

354
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:23,696
So... I-I'm good, Em.

355
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:25,257
That's good.

356
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,912
Oh, hey, these... came for you.

357
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,994
They were on the doorstep
this morning when I got in. I think...

358
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,251
they're from your friends at the FBI.

359
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:51,453
Look, it's late. You must be tired.
Let me show you your room.

360
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,609
- You're gonna stay in mine.
- No. No, it's okay.

361
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:57,424
I'll sleep on the couch.

362
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,983
- You sure?
- Yeah, I don't wanna put you out.

363
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:02,847
Well, look, I'll get you some
sheets and pillows.

364
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:11,332
<i>It's like my mind is working against me.</i>

365
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:15,426
<i>I can't remember anything,
except for the mask and...</i>

366
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,610
<i>Harlow's voice...</i>

367
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:23,585
<i>and the tank.</i>

368
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:28,260
<i>The FBI, they asked me</i>

369
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:30,908
<i>if they can observe
the sessions from now on.</i>

370
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:33,875
<i>Do you have any problems with that?</i>

371
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:51,479
<i>Perhaps the eye symbolizes
something so...</i>

372
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:56,166
<i>so dramatic that probably
you had to block it.</i>

373
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:10,560
<i>I've been reading
about these techniques.</i>

374
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:13,467
<i>There's hypnosis and pentobarbital.
I wanna try one of them.</i>

375
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,255
<i>There's a reason those aren't accepted</i>

376
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,473
<i>forms of recovered-memory therapy.</i>

377
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:21,012
<i>Results often aren't reliable,
even fantasy.</i>

378
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,254
<i>I don't... care.</i>

379
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:26,284
<i>I will take any result over nothing.</i>

380
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:31,931
<i>Have you heard of a process
called "cognitive interviewing"?</i>

381
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:43,905
<i>I remember the rhythm.</i>

382
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:46,702
<i>The pump.</i>

383
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:49,672
<i>Stay with the eye,
stay with the eye, Emily.</i>

384
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:52,638
<i>Stay with your vision.
Remember the first time you saw him.</i>

385
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:55,307
<i>I see a lot of flowers.</i>

386
00:35:55,392 --> 00:35:58,541
<i>Good. That's very good, keep going.
Tell me about the flowers.</i>

387
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:00,646
<i>Dalia.</i>

388
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:03,767
<i>Lily.</i>

389
00:36:04,688 --> 00:36:06,127
<i>Rose.</i>

390
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,225
<i>Poppy.</i>

391
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,154
<i>Sena.</i>

392
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:14,916
<i>Violet.</i>

393
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:18,018
<i>Jasmine.</i>

394
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:25,596
Robert Semerov, sex trafficker.

395
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,489
One of Emily's early cases.

396
00:36:27,995 --> 00:36:30,409
She has never come up with
enough evidence to make an arrest.

397
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:33,767
She made him mad enough
to take out a contract on her, though.

398
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,881
We've seen her session with Vega,
here's the connection.

399
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:40,857
Robert Semerov had a habit of naming

400
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:44,048
his favorite girls after flowers.

401
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:47,568
No known address, but we do have this.

402
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:52,127
That's Semerov's Benz, last night.

403
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:56,773
Crown, Ericson, find the link
between Semerov and Harlow.

404
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:58,726
The rest of you, find Semerov.

405
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,058
Results came in on the river body.

406
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,513
I found trace amounts of tissue deep

407
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:07,193
under dead man's right index fingernail.

408
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:08,519
BPD must have missed it.

409
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,418
That's Semerov's skin
under that fingernail.

410
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:11,683
We just need to confirm it.

411
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:14,176
I already checked, we don't have
a sample of his DNA on file.

412
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,232
We'll get one. Try our friends at BPD.

413
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,400
Walk with me.

414
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:28,130
Detective Gibbs? Thanks.

415
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:33,410
Take a walk, Feeb.
You stole my body from the Charles.

416
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:34,933
This is why one of us is coming here

417
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:36,424
to ask you a favor is so awkward.

418
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,968
- And yet, here I am.
- What is it?

419
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:41,598
I wanna know if you have
someone's DNA on file.

420
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:44,113
Robert Semerov.
Traffics girls from the Eastern block.

421
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:46,660
- He's not in any system.
- I heard of him.

422
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,291
We were hoping you guys
had an evidence file,

423
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:50,596
from an old case.

424
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,968
You think he's the one
who took my floater's eyelids?

425
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:56,305
Will you help me or not?

426
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:00,618
It's always a one way
street with you feds, huh?

427
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:02,944
Thanks. I'll owe you one.

428
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:06,976
Riggs. Riggs.

429
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:09,390
Look at him. He's so cute.

430
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,577
Look at him. Look at Nick.

431
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:16,609
Hello, honey. Come here.
What's that? What is it?

432
00:38:16,683 --> 00:38:19,568
Oh. What is this?
Come here, Riggs. Come here.

433
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:02,070
_

434
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:09,057
_

435
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,729
We need your help.

436
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,928
We think there may be a connection,

437
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,431
between one of your old cases
and your abduction.

438
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:40,608
Robert Semerov.
Could he have been at the cabin?

439
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:50,675
I remember the case, I don't remember

440
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:52,187
seeing him at the cabin.

441
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:54,213
It doesn't mean he wasn't there.
Just think back...

442
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,157
- I know it's difficult.
- If you don't believe me, Nick.

443
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,448
Why are you even asking the question?

444
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,593
I'm trying to help you, Emily.

445
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:06,281
- We're in this together.
- Don't say that.

446
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,815
You're not the one who was taken.

447
00:40:11,253 --> 00:40:14,086
You're the one who is
fucking somebody else.

448
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,946
Okay. I'll go.

449
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:28,118
But I'm telling you
Robert Semerov was there.

450
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:31,308
The girls he trafficked,
he gave them all names...

451
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,635
flowers.

452
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:34,546
I watched you rattle
'em off to Dr. Vega.

453
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:37,698
To Iris, and... and
Dahlia and Lily, and...

454
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,251
Em.

455
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:54,108
Iris...

456
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,692
dahlia...

457
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:57,656
- lily.
- You need to put those down.

458
00:40:57,726 --> 00:40:59,335
That's evidence.

459
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:03,225
Yeah, give me forensics.

460
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,290
Emily.

461
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:06,602
Can you think of anything

462
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:07,861
you would have left out
of Semerov's case?

463
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:09,477
Anything to get us a lead on him?

464
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,076
No.

465
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:13,408
Hi. Yeah, I need an evidence pickup.

466
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:15,701
At Jack Byrne's apartment,
Emily's brother's place.

467
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:18,781
Copy that. I'll text it to you now.

468
00:41:19,663 --> 00:41:21,842
Hey. Y-You were undercover,

469
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,342
you know his operation.

470
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:26,127
Is there any safe houses he used?
Any aliases...

471
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,523
that he traveled under?
Did he have any contacts?

472
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:30,355
There is somebody.

473
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,410
Can you get in touch with him?

474
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,418
She'll only talk to me.

475
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:32,927
I saw on the news. How are you?

476
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:35,024
I'm all right.

477
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:36,902
I need your help.

478
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:38,902
You know I owe you.

479
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:41,277
It's about Semerov.

480
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:46,611
<b>Please, anything but that.</b>

481
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:48,205
<b>Anyone but him.</b>

482
00:42:48,705 --> 00:42:52,478
<b>He hurt both of us. But we can stop him.</b>

483
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:55,121
Where can I found him?

484
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,442
<b>You tried.</b>

485
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,688
I can get him out of your life
for good this time, I promise.

486
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:09,400
<b>The girls talked about
a shipment, tomorrow.</b>

487
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:11,259
<b>Where?</b>

488
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:20,237
Did you know she was gonna pull us?

489
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:23,424
No.

490
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:29,807
If you know how to find Semerov,

491
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,855
you have to tell us.

492
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:35,601
He might be the person who had me Adam.

493
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:40,383
I want to be there.

494
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:43,655
- You know you're not ready for this?
- I am ready.

495
00:43:46,803 --> 00:43:49,060
We just want to protect you.

496
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:17,327
Emily!

497
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:20,825
He approved.

498
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:26,885
This is a long time, Emily.

499
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:31,367
Now what do you have?

500
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:55,111
Don't move until we see the girls.

501
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:08,131
Does anyone have eyes on Semerov?

502
00:45:08,677 --> 00:45:10,765
<i>Negative. He should be in the car.</i>

503
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:25,928
- Around.
- Go.

504
00:45:26,127 --> 00:45:29,168
FBI! Don't move!

505
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:33,691
Don't move!

506
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,616
Semerov, halt!

507
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,964
- Emily. Emily.
- Hands in the air!

508
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:41,914
Hands where I can see them!

509
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:44,631
Who are you?

510
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:46,717
Where is Semerov? Out the vehicle!

511
00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:48,488
Hey, hey, hey.
I don't work with Semerov.

512
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:50,920
Hands on the car. Come on.

513
00:45:51,106 --> 00:45:53,098
- Go! Go! Fall back!
- Come on.

514
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,310
Come on. Come on.

515
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:05,248
What? What is it? I can't hear you.
Now is not the time.

516
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,273
Who are you? What's your name, huh?

517
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,695
What's your name? Turn around.

518
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:14,344
- Where is Semerov?
- I don't know.

519
00:46:14,368 --> 00:46:16,368
Haven't seen him in 2 years.

520
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,874
Where is Semerov? Talk!

521
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:24,522
- Talk!
- Emily!

522
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,524
Emily. Emily.

523
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,234
- He knows!
- Calm down. Don't look.

524
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,530
- Now calm down.
- Adam. Adam. Adam!

525
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,318
- That was Whitman.
- We got a hit?

526
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:41,529
The DNA under the nail
didn't match Semerov.

527
00:46:41,576 --> 00:46:43,528
- The body itself did.
- What?

528
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:45,454
The body in the river, it was Semerov.

529
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:46,954
We've been looking for this guy all over

530
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:48,477
and he was in the morgue the whole time.

531
00:46:49,168 --> 00:46:50,688
- Get inside.
- No.

532
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,992
What about the killer's DNA
under the nails?

533
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,928
Unfortunately we got a match on that too.

534
00:46:58,302 --> 00:47:01,239
- Unfortunately?
- The DNA belongs to Emily.

535
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:07,127
- It's a mistake. Redo it.
- Whitman already did.

536
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:08,568
Three times.

537
00:47:15,096 --> 00:47:16,345
What?

538
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:30,125

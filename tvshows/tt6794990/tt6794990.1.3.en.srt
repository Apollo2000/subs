1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,239
<i>Previously on "Absentia"...</i>

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,400
Conrad Harlow. Killed that fed
Emily Byrne a while back.

3
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,959
- You think the wrong man's in jail?
- This is a copycat.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,640
She's alive.

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:15,184
- How long?
- You've been gone 6 years.

6
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:18,282
I can't be around you, or her,

7
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:21,235
without feeling like
I'm betraying someone.

8
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:24,280
I've just got this blank space
where my memory should be...

9
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:26,463
and this rage that I can't control.

10
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,101
Emily! Emily.

11
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:31,497
- Could Emily have killed Semerov?
- No.

12
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,796
A fed. A crooked fed...
out of the Boston office.

13
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:37,568
If you could see that look in your eyes.

14
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:39,403
We both have it.

15
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:43,004
<i>Stabbing victim, possible DOA,
at 721 South Brooklyn.</i>

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,439
Tell me about the vision.

17
00:00:57,906 --> 00:00:59,560
The vision is getting worse.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,400
It's like it consumes me.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,001
And part of me just wants to forget it,

20
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:07,751
and then the other part
just wants to remember.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,797
And I'm terrified of what
would happen if I ever do.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,432
It's just like I'm far away, just...

23
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:17,355
looking at myself.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Watching her, Emily... doing things.

25
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:29,657
Does this make any sense?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,479
Complete sense.

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,530
You have to be patient with yourself.

28
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:41,617
What you're doing is not easy, Emily.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,399
You're trying. You
should be proud of it.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,276
He ordered an escort at... 11:46 p.m.

31
00:01:52,282 --> 00:01:54,290
She arrives just before 02:00...

32
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,852
*** the body. Multiple stab wounds.

33
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,706
Happened right here.

34
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:02,176
A knife?

35
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:03,951
From a *** in the kitchen.

36
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:05,761
Missing.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,319
- Security cam?
- Someone cut them off at 11:58.

38
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, Tommy, you finally
got your big one.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,200
You might wanna clean up your act.

40
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:20,139
You're not undercover anymore.

41
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,545
Not your jurisdiction, Feeb.

42
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,859
You're not the only Boston police
I know, Gibbs.

43
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,535
So you're here to talk
about your ex-wife?

44
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:52,859
She didn't do this.

45
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:54,836
Do you got an alibi?

46
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,407
I dropped her off at home,
her alibi is gonna be

47
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,559
that she was sleeping.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,733
- Couldn't you just say "no"?
- I know this doesn't look good.

49
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,160
That's an understatement.

50
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,640
Weren't you looking for
Semerov at first too.

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,010
You looked into any
witness yet, Kelly Price?

52
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:10,366
You mean Regina Talbot.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,360
'Cause matter of fact, I did.
Looks like she skipped town.

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,023
Someone is covering the tracks, Gibbs.

55
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,875
Someone is trying to frame Emily.

56
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,239
Well, you know as well as I do,
or you wouldn't be here.

57
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:26,043
And it's just a matter of time
before this lands on Emily.

58
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,680
Unless there's some
overwhelming evidence that...

59
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,792
There is... there is one more thing
and it's not evidence exactly.

60
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:35,777
What is it?

61
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,139
What?

62
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,000
There's a crooked agent,
in the Boston FBI field office.

63
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,400
That's who turned
Regina Talbot into Kelly Price.

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,879
And that person is afraid
that Emily is onto them.

65
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:57,385
You're reaching.

66
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,782
Yeah, m-maybe... maybe, but
I'm narrowing it down.

67
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,835
If you could just buy me
some time on your end.

68
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,097
Please. Please, um...

69
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,449
I need you to keep BPD off Emily.

70
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:13,649
Make sure your girl doesn't leave town.

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,185
They found my DNA on Semerov's body

72
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:40,677
and now Harlow is dead?

73
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:43,869
- After I broke into his house?
- All right. Calm... calm down.

74
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,612
Were you supposed to bring me in?

75
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,565
- Is that why you're here?
- They have circumstantial case at best.

76
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,331
You hate him, you confronted him.

77
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,651
That doesn't prove beyond
reasonable doubt that you killed him.

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,080
You're not going down for this.

79
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:58,190
Not if...

80
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,307
Not if we turn up another suspect.

81
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:04,016
The agent who set me up for Semerov,
that's who's behind this.

82
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:07,000
That's who killed Harlow.

83
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,345
What am I gonna do?

84
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,211
What are we gonna do?

85
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,563
We stay focused.

86
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,891
We find the crooked agent
behind Kelly Price.

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,640
- You don't have an alibi, do you?
- No.

88
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,176
I got those burners.

89
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:27,473
We should start using these from now on.

90
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Wait, wait. I'm not going with you?

91
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,781
Well, you're gonna take Flynn,

92
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,522
go karting as planned...
You can pick him up from swim practice.

93
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,415
Just me and him?
We were supposed to go together.

94
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,501
It's okay. You'll be fine.

95
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,138
Look, Nick...

96
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,428
Why do you trust me?

97
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,439
I know you.

98
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,814
I'm gonna take care of this.

99
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,664
All right?

100
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,283
Hey.

101
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:15,665
So, uh... It's just you and me... today.

102
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,760
Your dad told you?

103
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,091
- The coach told me.
- Okay.

104
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,514
It should be fine, right?

105
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,119
Where are we going?

106
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a surprise. Come on.

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,360
Okay. You're ready to go?

108
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,426
Okay, close your eyes.

109
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:47,794
Here we go.

110
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:51,121
Here you go. How's the... All right?

111
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,509
Ready?

112
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,239
Let me take a look at this.

113
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,298
How does that feel?

114
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,819
Feels all right? Okay.

115
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,865
_

116
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,085
- Hey.
- It was awesome!

117
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:03,640
- Yeah, you were great. Good job.
- I wanna go again.

118
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:05,800
- Yeah, okay.
- Do you wanna come with me?

119
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,097
- Yes.
- I'll get your helmet.

120
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,400
- Hey, Ericson...
- Yeah?

121
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,066
Can you tell me how Crown

122
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:38,879
could file a report from the office
at 10 p.m. when he left at 8?

123
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,793
Yeah, sure, it's no big deal.
He asked me to cover for him.

124
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,800
- Hey, you got a minute?
- What's up?

125
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,615
I just wanna ask you about
the other night, you left early.

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
What about it?

127
00:09:27,377 --> 00:09:29,580
You were clocked in
but you weren't here.

128
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:31,041
Where were you?

129
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:33,360
It's none of your business.

130
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:38,520
Oh. You're seriously asking, aren't you?

131
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,658
Fine, okay, uh...

132
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,384
You really need to know?

133
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,998
I may have left early
to meet a girl, okay?

134
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:51,592
But if you saw what
she looked like, Nick...

135
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,888
So that's it, you...
You were with a girl?

136
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,079
What else would it be?

137
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,559
I took her to Freddy's.

138
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,207
- What was that...
- Is Emily okay?

139
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm just trying to get home.
I have nothing to say.

140
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,720
Please, respect my privacy.

141
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,763
Any information on the case?

142
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:31,833
I've nothing to say. Please.
Please, no comment! Please!

143
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,640
Emily!

144
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:33,172
What are you thinking?

145
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,075
Hello?

146
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,722
What happened to you? When you were gone.

147
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,520
Did they hurt you?

148
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:01,507
I don't remember much.

149
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:07,400
But I do remember thinking about you.

150
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:10,473
That allowed me to go through it.

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,720
The rest of it doesn't matter.

152
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:19,203
Okay?

153
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,520
Here you go.

154
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:22,832
Yes, thank you.

155
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:27,730
You ready to do this?

156
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:29,306
Yeah? Let's go.

157
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,879
- You ready?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,479
Let's go!

159
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:41,481
Whoo! Whoo-oo!

160
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:50,064
Come on, Flynn!

161
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,728
Whoo!

162
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,360
Good job, honey. Good job.

163
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:15,353
- That was cool.
- Yes? You're cool.

164
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,280
- One more time round?
- All right, one more.

165
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,273
- Three more?
- Yeah, nice try.

166
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:21,959
I have to get you home. One.

167
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,080
Two?

168
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,434
All right. You ready?

169
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,140
This time race for real.

170
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:29,155
Get ready, buster.

171
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,102
Yeah! Come on!

172
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,459
No!

173
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,239
Flynn! Flynn!

174
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:18,558
Flynn! Oh, my God!

175
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:21,387
Baby, my love! Baby...
No! Let go! Let go!

176
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:24,434
Baby, just... call for help!
Do you hear me?

177
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,801
Baby, come on. Can you hear me?

178
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:28,127
What happened?

179
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:31,915
I... He just... He came out of nowhere.

180
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:35,063
- Does he have any previous head injuries?
- I-I don't know.

181
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:36,797
- Are you a relative?
- Yeah, I'm his mom.

182
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,560
- You have to stay here, okay?
- Yes.

183
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,545
- You have to... You have to stay here.
- Okay.

184
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,979
Hey, honey. Can I call you back in a sec?

185
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,239
What? He... He's okay?

186
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:13,072
Miss Byrne...

187
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,931
Uh, we ran some tests just to be sure,

188
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,560
but the results won't be ready
for another few minutes.

189
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:21,864
He's stable. He's got
a little dizziness.

190
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:23,384
However, he's...

191
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:26,184
- Is Flynn okay?
- Excuse me, who are you?

192
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,799
- I'm his mother.
- I thought you were his mother.

193
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,600
She is. Is he okay?

194
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:37,010
- Uh, he suffered a mild TBI, but...
- Is he okay?

195
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,930
There are no signs the concussion
caused any lasting damage.

196
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:44,094
However, there are some
symptoms to look for,

197
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,032
just... just to be sure.

198
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:48,830
- Can we see him first?
- Of course.

199
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:52,063
I'll get one of the nurses to take
you in and I'll check in after.

200
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:55,840
What happened?

201
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:01,128
You can see him now, if you'd like.

202
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,439
Hey.

203
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,119
Oh, look at you.

204
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:21,317
- How's your head?
- It's getting better.

205
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,375
- Is it?
- That's great.

206
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,055
I think we're gonna, um...

207
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,649
take a break on racing
for a little while. How's that?

208
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:31,922
Yeah.

209
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,562
Hey.

210
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:53,795
Hey.

211
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:56,277
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

212
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:58,957
How you feeling?

213
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,780
- I drove real fast today.
- Yeah...

214
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:04,733
Yeah, I heard.

215
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,857
We need you to take it easy
for a little bit, okay?

216
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,680
- Okay.
- Yeah.

217
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,601
Thank you.

218
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:24,546
For?

219
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,705
For being so patient with her.

220
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:28,930
It's not her fault.

221
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,479
It's yours.

222
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:34,169
You were supposed to be there.

223
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:39,275
She should never have been
alone with him to begin with.

224
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,642
It would've happened with me there too.
These things happen.

225
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,025
They didn't have before.
You didn't ask me if it was okay.

226
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,205
You didn't even let me know.
And when I got that call...

227
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,330
Yeah. I'm sorry.

228
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,824
I'm sorry. It's okay.

229
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,319
He's okay. He... He's okay.

230
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,560
- Next time I will...
- Next time?

231
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:03,588
We will talk about this,
but right now I have to go.

232
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,349
What? Now? You can't just take off.

233
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,994
- I have to.
- What could possibly be so...

234
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,809
Harlow was killed this morning.

235
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,570
They like Emily for it.

236
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,640
Wait, they think she murdered someone

237
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,996
and you left her alone with Flynn?

238
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,449
And now you're leaving
us alone to help her?

239
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,377
- Of course she didn't do it.
- How do you know?

240
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,877
- Were you with her?
- What? No, no, no, no.

241
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,604
Help me, Nick.

242
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,441
I'm trying to understand.

243
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm really trying.

244
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:39,701
Right now, I have to go and do my job.

245
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,336
And I need you to be okay with it.

246
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:46,099
Hey. You know how much I love you.

247
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:02,981
Hey.

248
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:04,554
I'm sorry.

249
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,119
He's gonna be okay.

250
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,415
Listen.

251
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,058
I have some leads.

252
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,640
- I think it could be Crown.
- Are you sure?

253
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,360
I don't know. There's too many variables.

254
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,858
We'll have to check his alibi.

255
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,320
So, we check alibis one by one?

256
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:28,014
I don't have that kind of time.

257
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:30,349
I know, but I don't know
what else we can do.

258
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,356
We should go back to Harlow's place,

259
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,739
we should see if there's anything there

260
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,359
that links up to one of the agents.

261
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,525
We don't have jurisdiction
over the Harlow crime scene.

262
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,803
So what's our option?

263
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:41,009
The only way this goes down,
is if I'm with you.

264
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:51,498
You don't break rules, Nick.
It's not who you are.

265
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,560
So don't start now.

266
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,403
I'll text you.

267
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:01,476
I'm coming with you.

268
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,121
Any news on the Harlow case?

269
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:20,350
Still crossing our t's.
This guy had a lot of enemies.

270
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:21,702
Cross them faster.

271
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,341
I'm getting pressure
from on high to make an arrest,

272
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,037
and they love the idea
of it being a fed.

273
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:27,082
If we arrest Byrne,
then we got to be certain.

274
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,505
I'm not yet. Are you?

275
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:31,889
No one in this department
thinks she's innocent.

276
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,446
Doesn't make her guilty.

277
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:36,101
Not all murderers look like one, Tommy.

278
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:47,121
Watch out.

279
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:41,682
There is nothing.

280
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:43,314
Nothing.

281
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,602
We have to move. We have to move.

282
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
Come on.

283
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,441
They're gone.

284
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,447
Send me the pics, I'll run 'em through.

285
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:28,738
Jack?

286
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,680
You're home?

287
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,035
Hey.

288
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,179
Hey.

289
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:16,059
What are you looking at?

290
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:19,606
Nah, just chasing down a...

291
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,614
soft lead and get nowhere.

292
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,785
Uh.

293
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,882
I just confirmed Cooper
couldn't have had Emily in the cabin.

294
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,585
He was in a Mexican jail for a year.

295
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,405
Got out after Emily was released.

296
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:34,540
That's good.

297
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,420
You got any more questions
you want to ask me, Nick?

298
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,810
No.

299
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:45,273
I'm cool.

300
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,046
You?

301
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:30,019
All right, so you're gonna
stand there judging me all night,

302
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:31,485
or you gonna actually say something?

303
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:33,659
You're drunk.

304
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:38,092
Judgment it is.

305
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,145
I'm worried, Jack.

306
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,567
- There's difference.
- Is there?

307
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:46,199
Is there really, Em?

308
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:48,871
- I'm just trying to help.
- And how...

309
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:51,690
exactly are you trying to help, Em?

310
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:54,408
Because it seems to me like all
I'm doing is to cleaning up your messes!

311
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:57,330
- Jack, what were you...
- No. No! It's my turn to talk now, okay?

312
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:59,613
You have no idea what's been like, Em.

313
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,001
No idea.

314
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,640
Do you think you have
the monopoly on pain?

315
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:07,456
I've been here, everyday,
in the real word,

316
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,566
taking care of Dad,
trying to keep the lights on.

317
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,824
Do you have any idea
the damage you've caused?

318
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,199
No, of course you don't.

319
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,808
Because you're the same
as you always were,

320
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:17,769
the goddamn Emily show,

321
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,637
from the day you were adopted.

322
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,330
And you know what really gets me?

323
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,544
Do you know what... really gets me?

324
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:28,270
It's that just as life was starting
to become bearable again...

325
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:32,275
you had to come back.

326
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,540
You're such an asshole when
you drink, you know that?

327
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:38,865
Yeah?

328
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:41,082
Well, cheers.

329
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,668
Fuck you!

330
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,792
_

331
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:48,952
Where are you?

332
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,772
I just checked into a hotel.
You get a match?

333
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:54,216
Then text me the address, I'm on my way.

334
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:56,467
No, Nick, talk to me.

335
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,513
Just text me the address.

336
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:16,553
Hey, come in.

337
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:19,859
- It's Adam.
- What?

338
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:22,374
He's the one behind Regina Talbot.

339
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:24,081
Oh, shit.

340
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:28,093
I have to... I have to take this.

341
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,322
- Yeah?
- Nick,

342
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:33,155
you gotta bring Emily in right now.

343
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:35,255
<i>We have new evidence. And it's bad.</i>

344
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,529
I'm... I'm really
close to something, all right?

345
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:39,303
If you could give me a little time.

346
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:42,894
We have a video of her in the
vacinity of Harlow's house, again.

347
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,454
Just minutes before the murder.

348
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:47,524
What? That's impossible.

349
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,099
- Are you sure?
- <i>Ask to her.</i>

350
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,341
Ask her to look you in the eye
and tell you she wasn't there.

351
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:56,662
Bring her in or I will.

352
00:28:57,793 --> 00:28:59,034
What?

353
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:02,454
What happened?

354
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:05,900
You want to tell me?

355
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:09,975
Where were you that night?

356
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,459
I said, where were you?

357
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,361
You want... you want help?

358
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:21,580
You were at Harlow's house... again?

359
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,521
I can explain.

360
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:29,586
You lied to me!

361
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
You have any idea how bad is this?

362
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:45,180
I didn't do it.
Please, Nick, I can explain.

363
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,894
You think I'm an idiot?

364
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,270
Do you think you can play me because

365
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:50,724
I feel like shit that I never found you?

366
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,247
No, I didn't kill him.
Just listen to me for a second.

367
00:29:53,272 --> 00:29:55,099
Where did you go?

368
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:58,214
I didn't go to Harlow's.

369
00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:00,905
Emily, stop telling me what you want.

370
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,116
Tell me where you were

371
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:05,307
or I'm walking out that door.

372
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,998
I wanted to see what it was like.

373
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:29,649
Your life.

374
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:33,680
What should have been my life.

375
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:37,905
What are you talking about?

376
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:45,452
Last night,

377
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,124
when Riggs started barking
at something outside.

378
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:50,706
It was me.

379
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,720
I was there.

380
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:00,152
Hiding.

381
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:09,846
Just... watching you with her...

382
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:11,853
with Flynn.

383
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:18,029
You guys are so beautiful
together. All of you.

384
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,512
I couldn't...

385
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:21,896
I couldn't stop looking.

386
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,911
It's like that movie
where the angel takes the guy

387
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:32,231
and shows him what life
would be like without him.

388
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,750
And everybody is so much worse off.

389
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:43,423
Except in my case it's the opposite.

390
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,769
I believe you, I do.

391
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,355
Adam, um...

392
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,418
Adam doesn't know...

393
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,519
what we know.

394
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,459
I'm gonna get him talking, um...

395
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:48,813
I'm gonna see what shakes out of him.

396
00:32:51,628 --> 00:32:54,148
- You have to be careful, okay?
- I will.

397
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:02,551
Does Jack or your father
know where you are?

398
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,085
No.

399
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:07,764
Don't leave this room.

400
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,332
Listen to me, Gibbs.

401
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:16,377
This is the mother of my child
that we're talking about.

402
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:19,054
She's just saying her
goodbyes. That's it.

403
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,014
You have my word. One hour.

404
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,703
Look, I have to go.

405
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:35,252
What are you doing here?
I was just on with BPD.

406
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,051
They said they've arranged
for you to bring Emily here.

407
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:39,494
Yeah, I... I just want to talk first.
Do you have a minute?

408
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:42,490
Sure. Sure. You see the CCTV?

409
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:44,980
No, they told me about it.

410
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,878
Here, sit.

411
00:33:57,178 --> 00:33:58,457
You think she did it?

412
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:00,858
It kills me but yes, I do.

413
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,253
Emily shared something with me.

414
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,122
A theory she had
back before she was taken.

415
00:34:08,737 --> 00:34:10,122
Oh, really? What's that?

416
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:13,323
That's all kind of crazy to me,
to be honest.

417
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:15,714
But it's stuck with me.

418
00:34:16,692 --> 00:34:18,628
It wouldn't stop bothering me, you know.

419
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,960
I think I know where this is going.

420
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:21,811
Is this Emily's crooked agent theory?

421
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:23,866
Yes, it is, actually.

422
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,895
I knew she suspected someone
from way back on the Semerov case.

423
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:30,181
Hell, I did too for a moment.

424
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,172
But I checked it out,
I checked everybody out.

425
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:35,241
There was no crooked agent.

426
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:38,578
Were you ever at Harlow's place?

427
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:46,465
Nick, you're a good agent...
and a friend.

428
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,821
And I understand why you have
a blindspot for your ex-wife.

429
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:52,418
Please answer the question, Adam.

430
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:57,143
Yes, I was there yesterday.

431
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:02,881
Had a question for Harlow
whether his accomplice was Emily.

432
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:04,419
It's not a secret.

433
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:13,127
What is it you think, Nick?

434
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:17,489
That I killed Harlow to frame Emily?

435
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:20,536
Or could it be that...

436
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:23,004
all the evidence against her
is just that...

437
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:25,261
Evidence.

438
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:28,298
Do you know Kelly Price?

439
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:30,698
She also went by Regina Talbot.

440
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:34,937
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this...

441
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:38,695
but I care to much about you

442
00:35:38,728 --> 00:35:41,216
to see you risk your career
or whatever else

443
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,246
on Emily's desperate theories.

444
00:35:43,698 --> 00:35:47,714
And I can only imagine...
the kind of stress you've been under.

445
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:49,845
And that is why

446
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:53,696
I'm gonna let this whole
misguided conversation slide.

447
00:35:58,018 --> 00:35:59,778
Don't you have somewhere to be?

448
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:06,937
You're right.

449
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:09,698
I haven't been thinking.

450
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:13,188
It must be the stress.

451
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:22,582
You're lucky I'm understanding, Nick.

452
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,881
This is a second chance I'm giving you.

453
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:31,714
Life doesn't give a second
chance too often.

454
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:03,392
What?

455
00:42:43,158 --> 00:42:48,158

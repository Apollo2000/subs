00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,662
<i>Previously on "Absentia"...</i>

2
00:00:02,782 --> 00:00:05,365
Robert Semerov, sex trafficker,

3
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:07,629
have had an habit of
naming his favorite girls,

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,748
after flowers.

5
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:11,282
<i>What are we doing in here when
Semerov is still out there?</i>

6
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,748
Semerov was dead for two
weeks when we found him,

7
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:15,167
so he couldn't have been your captor.

8
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:16,334
There is a witness

9
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:18,347
who puts you with Semerov weeks ago...

10
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:19,771
- arguing.
- No.

11
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:22,910
Whoever had me is Harlow's partner,

12
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,167
and that's who's behind all of this.

13
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,022
You like being a pawn?

14
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:31,527
Do you have any idea
the damage you've caused?

15
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:34,939
'Cause you're the same as you always
were, the goddamn Emily show.

16
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:37,245
You're such an asshole when
you drink, you know that?

17
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:40,593
Did you sleep with her?

18
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,565
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I can't tell you. You'd...

19
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,481
you'd have to bring me back in.

20
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:51,323
Running makes you look guilty as hell.

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,725
I'm gonna solve this.

22
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,597
You know I don't like
being kept waiting.

23
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:56,593
It was on purpose.

24
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,482
Describe the place we're looking for.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,031
It's a tree.

26
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,117
The decomp on this
body is ten years old.

27
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,194
We'll need to comb
these woods with dogs.

28
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:25,579
I'd say a five-mile
radius around that grave.

29
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:31,958
All right, circle up... circle up.

30
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,208
We're looking for a white female, 5'9".

31
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:41,611
Let me see those hands.

32
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,149
Are you the one they're looking for?

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,645
I'm innocent.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,908
Move!

35
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,270
This way.

36
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,583
You gonna shoot me

37
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,037
or you turn me in?

38
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:31,394
Who says I only got two choices?

39
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,990
You know?

40
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,380
There's only two things
in this world that I hate:

41
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:45,609
my ex...

42
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,967
and the law.

43
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,995
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

44
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:55,974
You want a friend?

45
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:02,726
I could sure use one right about now.

46
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,032
Larry Novo.

47
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,223
Got some dry clothes back there.

48
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:15,768
Go on... I won't look at you.

49
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:29,490
So, where you headed?

50
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:32,988
Boston.

51
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:35,429
Lucky you.

52
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:37,498
I'm Georgia-bound.

53
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,628
You decent?

54
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,258
Thank you.

55
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:56,628
You can get some rest back there...

56
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,925
I'll wake you when we're close.

57
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:03,988
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,828
It's your call.

59
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,828
You got ten seconds to make it though.

60
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:19,828
- Okay.
- All right.

These marks here along the orbital bone,

64
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:10,928
- they're blade marks.
- The eyelids.

65
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:12,588
Ah, the killer cut them off.

66
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,027
Sloppily.

67
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:17,099
My guess, this is one of the
first victims. Maybe the first.

68
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,988
From decomp, this body predates

69
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:21,229
the ones we like Harlow for by years.

70
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:23,398
The location ties to Emily's childhood.

71
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,798
That's what changes
everything here. Look,

72
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,673
we need to start facing some facts.

73
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:32,234
One, since Harlow told
you where to find Emily,

74
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,981
we've known he had a person

75
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,548
or persons working
with him on the outside.

76
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:38,258
Two,

77
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,496
Semerov shows up dead,

78
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:43,748
with Harlow's signature and Emily's DNA,

79
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:45,719
so we've been looking for a killer

80
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:48,636
who's a link between Harlow and Semerov.

81
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,508
That would be Emily.

82
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,809
And now,

83
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:58,191
now we have another body
with Harlow's signature,

84
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:00,980
in a grave site that
ties to Emily, a site...

85
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,443
she led us to.

86
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,361
You're saying that

87
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,167
Emily was Harlow's person
on the outside all along.

88
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,985
I'm saying,

89
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,403
it sure as hell looks that way.

90
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,417
Keep working the forest scene.

91
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:18,547
And I wanna know more about Yorick here.

92
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,907
Start with his name.

93
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,027
Roger that.

94
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:25,078
Nick,

95
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:28,878
Emily wanted that initial
case so bad. You remember that?

96
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:32,868
Maybe we need to go right
back to the very beginning...

97
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,348
What is the earliest their
two paths could have crossed?

98
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,828
When did Harlow first become a suspect?

99
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:10,249
Jack?

100
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,323
Come on, Jack, where's your password?

Hey, do you have
Gregory Nash's contact info?

127
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:32,997
- <i>Yeah, sure, why?</i>
- I'm trying to...

128
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:36,739
get a hold of the witness that
first mentioned Harlow to us, uh...

129
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,068
sorry...

130
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:40,712
Julie Carter.

131
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:45,022
And there's only Carter's
statement in the files.

132
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,752
I figure that, Nash is
running the field office.

133
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,831
<i>Yeah, I have what he left us
when he retired, so...</i>

134
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:54,291
- <i>I'll send over the info.</i>
- All right, thanks.

135
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,474
Go! Go, go, go! Get on
the left! On the left!

136
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,729
You got him. There. And the other one.

137
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:03,308
Go on, go on!

138
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,775
Come in! And again!

139
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,414
Hi, guys.

140
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:09,060
How did we go?

141
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,325
- Can I finish my level?
- No, it's time to go, Flynn.

142
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,358
Ah, see you soon, kiddo.

143
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:18,246
Come on, get your stuff.

144
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:23,754
Honey, can you, uh,
wait outside a moment?

145
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,507
I just need to talk with Grandpa.

146
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,053
Thanks for bringing him by, Alice.

147
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,405
Warren, did you talk to him about Emily?

148
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:42,180
Of course I did. He needs to
know his mother is innocent.

149
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:43,863
This mess will be cleared up soon.

150
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,020
Then everything can go back to normal.

151
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,753
We need to be careful
how we're handling Flynn.

152
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,228
I'm talking about his expectations.

153
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:54,512
Because if it turns out

154
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:56,385
- what they're saying is true...
- "They"?

155
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,028
Are you part of "they", Alice?

156
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:01,652
Warren, I'm not here to get into
this, I'm just talking about Flynn.

157
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:02,694
So am I.

158
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,391
- If you're poisoning him against...
- "Poisoning?"

159
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,736
No, Warren, I'm not.

160
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,819
I'll bring him by next week.

161
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:22,436
Good timing, Durand.

162
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,394
Good to see you, Nash.

163
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:27,966
Good to see you, buddy.

164
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,811
- Get your young blood here the bill.
- All right.

165
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:32,020
You look good, Nash.

166
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:34,098
It's amazing what not
getting the balls busted

167
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,427
'round the clock can do for you.

168
00:16:35,882 --> 00:16:39,036
You look like you've only aged
about 30 years, that's pretty good.

169
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,077
Thanks for meeting me.

170
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,106
Well, if I can help bring this thing
to a safe end, I'm happy to try.

171
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,820
I wanted to ask about Julie Carter.

172
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:47,308
Well, she's the one that first
put us onto Harlow as a suspect.

173
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:49,907
Yeah, that's right. I was
looking at the old files.

174
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:51,737
Carter was a patron at the bar,

175
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,100
where the first body, the
Smith girl, was last seen.

176
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:58,019
Carter said she saw Harlow
leave with the Smith girl.

177
00:16:58,329 --> 00:16:59,748
So wh... what's your question?

178
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,479
You ever speak with Carter?

179
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,795
Take her statement?

180
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,499
- No.
- No?

181
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,151
Well, Emily found Carter.

182
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,628
- That was a big break.
- I... I know, but...

183
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:09,986
I can't ask Radford

184
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,222
and there's no mention in his reports

185
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:12,547
of ever having spoken to Carter.

186
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:14,465
Well, that's because
he never met her either.

187
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,595
What?

188
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:20,317
Julie Carter OD'ed a few
days after talking to Emily.

189
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:21,828
Heroin.

190
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,361
Let me get this straight.

191
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:25,759
Only one person on earth

192
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:29,065
questioned the witness who
first gave us the name Harlow,

193
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,706
and that person was Emily?

194
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,186
Jesus.

195
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,794
You've got eyes on the father, right?

196
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,528
Okay.

197
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,890
Detective, take a look at this.

198
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:38,934
No, no, no...

199
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,698
Don't touch it.

200
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:44,421
Call in Judge Ramos,
for a 20-37 warrant.

201
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,222
She opened this file with these images,

202
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,088
after she saw this text exchange.

203
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,730
And we know where this Violet is, right?

204
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:28,143
Ran the number. It's a burner.

205
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:31,278
But that's not all, I found this.

206
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,188
This account was set up right
before Emily Byrne vanished.

207
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,097
Yeah, and it's not
the only bank account.

208
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:39,828
Look, he has another bank account
for his checks, bills, etc.

209
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:42,288
And this one was funded seven years ago,

210
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:43,828
with several large cash deposits,

211
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:46,042
and I can't trace the
cash to his income.

212
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,747
Where does the money come from then?

213
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:50,296
You have to do some of
the work here, Detective.

214
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,189
Yeah.

215
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:17,267
Hey, where are you doing?

216
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,445
I don't know. Ask Mom.

217
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:38,757
We're going to my sister's.

218
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:44,522
Were you... were you gonna tell me?

219
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:47,733
- I was gonna leave you a letter.
- Alice,

220
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:49,679
what is this?

221
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:52,082
I'm pregnant.

222
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:01,677
Please, don't.

223
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:03,452
I'm sorry.

224
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,544
I'm sorry.

225
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,554
We can work this out.
Let's... let's sit down, talk.

226
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,124
Our whole life together,

227
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,263
it's just a consolation, isn't it?

228
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:15,935
Admit it.

229
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,286
I'm only in the picture
because she left it.

230
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,340
This "us"

231
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,988
this was never your choice.

232
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:24,912
Not your first choice.

233
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,160
This is your settling,
and I can't be that.

234
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,300
I'm s... I was confused, I'm...

235
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:34,264
- Please, I need you to understand...
- I do, Nick.

236
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:36,868
I understand it all now.

237
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:38,696
And I should have sooner,

238
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,074
just didn't want to.

239
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,575
I thought my past was behind us.

240
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:46,916
Then it came back...

241
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:50,648
out of nowhere.

242
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:54,784
But this is what I want now.

243
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:58,678
This is my life.

244
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,051
You... you and me, and...

245
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:06,628
our children.

246
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:14,249
I'm done done with the past,
I swear to you.

247
00:22:14,254 --> 00:22:15,776
I think you wanna be,

248
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,100
but you won't be.

249
00:22:18,562 --> 00:22:21,143
Not until there's
closure. Find her, Nick.

250
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:22,520
End this,

251
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:25,042
and then we'll talk.

252
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,742
Tommy Gibbs, Boston PD,
we had an appointment.

253
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,991
I wanna talk about Jack Byrne.

254
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:58,529
- He hasn't worked here in years.
- I know.

255
00:22:58,649 --> 00:22:59,857
Why was he let go?

256
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,628
He showed up drunk to a surgery.

257
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:02,955
I think that about covers it.

258
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:05,756
Then you set in motion the
revoking of his medical license.

259
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:06,988
It was my duty.

260
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,567
I read the report you filed
for the... for the board.

261
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,027
You mentioned absences.

262
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,567
It goes with the territory.

263
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,570
The disease, alcoholism.

264
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,313
I do have compassion for him.

265
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,394
What he went through,
the sister, his father...

266
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:23,835
He'd vanish for a week at a time,

267
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:25,588
it just became untenable.

268
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,990
He came into some money,

269
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:31,655
some time prior to March 2011,
that's when he was working here.

270
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:34,329
We're certain those funds
came from another source,

271
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:35,628
not his regular income.

272
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:38,872
There was some malfeasance
that came to light,

273
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:40,430
but nothing I could ever prove.

274
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:41,491
I'm listening.

275
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,532
Someone was embezzling
from the hospital,

276
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:45,146
medical device orders.

277
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:47,431
We paid for things we'd never receive.

278
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,665
Jack is now working for a
medical device wholesaler.

279
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,803
Thank you.

280
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:03,096
I have friends inside.

281
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:16,674
- Hey.
- You're not gonna believe

282
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,952
what's in Jack Byrne's computer.

283
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:19,441
- Jack?
- <i>Yeah</i>.

284
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:21,536
He's into some sick shit, man.

285
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,442
Like bondage porn,

286
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:25,218
water torture, drowning...

287
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:28,157
- But that doesn't mean anything.
- <i>He embezzled funds from work</i>.

288
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:31,220
Built himself up a little slush fund

289
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:33,173
right before she vanished.

290
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,147
You can link that money to
the cabin, to the tank?

291
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:38,173
No. It might be a good time to think

292
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,273
that maybe she didn't break
into his apartment for help.

293
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,466
She suspects him.

294
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:43,295
<i>Well, he was the one who
sent us to that forest.</i>

295
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:45,208
That grave.

296
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:47,940
The last person she
suspected ended up dead.

297
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:50,548
We need to find Jack now.

298
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,403
What are you doing?

299
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,055
Semerov's people think you killed him.

300
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,789
- Where's Violet gone?
- Why?

301
00:27:33,828 --> 00:27:36,048
I just need a minute with her
and I need you to arrange it.

302
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:37,352
Where's she going?

303
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,815
She's in the webcam room.

304
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:47,226
Stay here, I'll handle the bouncer.

305
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:15,397
You gotta go now. Make some money.

306
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,882
No, no, no, no. You've done enough.

307
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:18,956
No. There's a camera..

308
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,419
- Okay, go. Go. Yes.
- Be careful.

309
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,885
Turn the mic off.

310
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,612
Keep dancing.

311
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,747
Keep dancing.

312
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:02,027
Is that the camera they watch you from?

313
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:04,428
Yes.

314
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,593
You know who I am?

315
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,227
Da. Yes.

316
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:17,027
Marina talked about Jack.

317
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:22,388
When'd you guys start seeing each other?

318
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:26,815
You answer quickly, you answer
truthfully and you won't get hurt.

319
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:28,340
8 years ago.

320
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:31,828
He always been violent? I saw
the show in your apartment.

321
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,414
I don't judge.

322
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:37,388
Did he ever mentioned me?

323
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,815
Sometimes.

324
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,983
Look, we didn't see each
other for a long time.

325
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,102
He only called me again a few weeks ago.

326
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:52,628
What day?

327
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:59,907
You were on the news.
They'd just found you.

328
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,267
I remember because Jack
was talking about it that night.

329
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,868
You said you guys stopped
seeing each other, for how long?

330
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:11,227
When we first met we would see
each other once a week.

331
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:15,423
That lasted for about 2 years.
Then he stopped.

332
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:16,868
I don't know why.

333
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,628
For how long did it stopped?

334
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:21,628
For about 6 years.

335
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,773
I need you to think
very clearly right now.

336
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:35,509
Did he stopped seeing you
somewhere around March 2011?

337
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:37,514
Right after I was abducted.

338
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:40,751
Yes.

339
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:44,667
Are we done here?

340
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:47,358
Did he ever take you out
to a cabin on I-95?

341
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:50,468
- Did he ever mention it?
- No!

342
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,896
Don't say any...

343
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:16,570
Keys! Keys! Car keys! Come on!

344
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,348
Move! Move! Go!

345
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,519
Emily!

346
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:39,636
Talk to me.

347
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
<i>They told me you said you wanted
to hear anything, right?</i>

348
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:43,348
Yeah, what do you got?

349
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:45,108
<i>Long shot, some guy on</i>

350
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,388
<i>a porn site webcam said he saw Byrne.</i>

351
00:32:48,118 --> 00:32:49,118
Go on.

352
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:50,497
<i>The guy said he was watching a webcam show</i>

353
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,251
<i>when Byrne crushed the party.</i>

354
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,998
<i>Sounds crazy I know, but...</i>

355
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:56,083
<i>you know, you said anything, so...</i>

356
00:32:56,188 --> 00:32:59,108
Okay. What was the website?

357
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,789
<i>I'll send it to you right now, okay?
Check your email.</i>

358
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:07,485
_

359
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:17,148
Wait.

360
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,027
It's a Semerov site.

361
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,876
All units to 429 Boardman and Eastie,
we got a Byrne sighting.

362
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:34,744
Come on, let's go people! Let's go!

363
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,536
What else did she say?

364
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,692
She asked about timing.
When we saw each other,

365
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:42,427
when we started, when we stopped,

366
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:43,722
when we started again.

367
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:44,987
<i>Things like that.</i>

368
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:48,188
- What did you tell her?
- <i>What do you think I told her, Jack?</i>

369
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,148
- I spoke with Nash.
- And?

370
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:55,428
The witness who first
gave us Harlow as a suspect,

371
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:58,468
Emily was the only agent that ever speak
with her before she OD'ed.

372
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:02,988
- You think she fabricated the statement?
- I don't know what to think.

373
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:04,558
Well, if she did, I was wrong.

374
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:06,509
She wasn't working with Harlow,
she framed him.

375
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,827
There's more.

376
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:10,009
BPD turned up a bunch of stuff on Jack.

377
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:13,229
It's all circumstantial at this stage,
but it doesn't look good.

378
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,517
Oh, Christ. We're supposed
to be narrowing things down.

379
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,476
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys. You need to see this.

380
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:18,788
Come on.

381
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:23,460
<i>...stand by, where we see
the body cam footage</i>

382
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,132
<i>in Nottingham gravesite.</i>

383
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,468
<i>We're sending up the camera.</i>

384
00:34:26,555 --> 00:34:29,024
<i>You're gonna get a live feed
in just a few seconds.</i>

385
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,828
<i>There's two more over here!</i>

386
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,468
<i>Come on, this way!</i>

387
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,708
<i>Oh, my God. Jesus.</i>

388
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,667
<i>Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

389
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:55,651
It's me.

390
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:58,389
Jack.

391
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,148
I'm with Mom.

392
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,508
_

393
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,348
<i>Maybe this is where you think I should be.</i>

394
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:13,148
<i>I don't have a lot of time. I'm hurt.</i>

395
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:21,227
<i>I just want to see you one more time.</i>

396
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:24,860
<i>I need to know why.</i>

397
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:31,235
<i>Please. Just come.</i>

398
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:29,468
<i>It's me.</i>

399
00:39:31,548 --> 00:39:32,868
<i>Jack.</i>

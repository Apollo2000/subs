1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:02,080
<i>Previously on "Absentia"...</i>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,967
Since Harlow told you
where to find Emily

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,719
we've known he had a person
working with him on the outside.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,597
Semerov shows up dead, with Emily's DNA.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,302
So we've been looking
for a killer who's a link

6
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:13,462
between Harlow and Semerov.

7
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,884
That would be Emily.

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,080
Alice!

9
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,840
My family has been taken from me.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,125
<i>Emily, I beg of you to...</i>

11
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:28,980
<i>bring my wife and our son home.</i>

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,408
<i>Please, bring them home.</i>

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,480
Where are we?

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,411
- I believe your sister is innocent.
- So what do you want?

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,799
To tell Emily's story.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,448
- What did you find out about Shen?
- Shen started experimenting on kids.

17
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:46,205
<i>One of them was a boy.
His name was Charles,</i>

18
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,234
<i>he was at my orphanage.
And the other one...</i>

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,059
was a Subject B.

20
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:51,760
What kind of experiments?

21
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,375
There were adverse effects.

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,732
We shut it down.

23
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:58,486
Charles.

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,520
Charles!

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,176
We remember you... Emily!

26
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,318
I'm Agent Nick Durand,

27
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,129
I need to speak with one of your
patients, Charles Avallone.

28
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:17,540
- Who is B?
- Please, the book!

29
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:27,727
Don't move!

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,439
Don't make me do this.

31
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:09,807
Nick, Nick, Nick.

32
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,784
Hey, man, what happened?

33
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:13,985
- OK. Go. Go get her.
- What? Who?

34
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,357
- Emily. Emily, she...
- Where?

35
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,732
There... there! Fucking go!

36
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:06,275
What the hell? Watch it!

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,456
Hey, watch where you're
going! I'm sorry.

38
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:10,095
What the hell is she doing?

39
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:18,951
Over here! Over here!

40
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,246
- Are you OK?
- Nuh!

41
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,330
Move! Move!

42
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:34,020
Fuck!

43
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:39,117
Suspect possibly
southern on the red line

44

Please, listen to me...

Don't hurt Flynn, please.
I'll do anything.

53
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:46,475
Don't you touch him, you
lunatic! Do you hear me?

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,505
You leave him alone!

for the inconvenience.</i>

59
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:43,927
Hey. You're gonna want to hold on, OK?

60
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:57,500
You OK?

61
00:09:58,274 --> 00:10:00,489
- You got her?
- No.

62
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,467
- Thanks.
- Yeah, sir.

63
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:10,662
She shot me.

64
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,104
I know.

65
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,529
Lucky you.

66
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:21,028
It's not luck...

67
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:24,188
It's mandatory for the field.

68
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:26,640
Emily knows that?

69
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,004
Uh, she... she knows we're onto her.

70
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,148
She's trying to slow us down, to...

71
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:36,354
keep us from finding Alice and Flynn.

72
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:40,034
You being dead would have
slowed us down a lot more.

73
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,558
No, no. You stopped...
You stopped to help.

74
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,680
And dead men don't need first aid.

75
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,342
Oh, Jesus.

76
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,826
She's always two steps ahead.

77
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,277
All right, we got it covered.

78
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:54,810
I'm gonna talk to Charles Avallone

79
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,274
to see why Emily came all
the way out here, all right?

80
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,165
No, no, no. I'm coming. I'm coming.

81
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,801
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with, man.

82
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,358
We never wanted...

83
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,289
We never wanted. We...

84
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:17,221
- No, no, no! Mr. Avallone is in
- No, we need...

85
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:18,963
- no condition to answer any questions.
- we need to speak to with Mr. Avallone.

86
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,787
Yeah, because clearly you sedated him.

87
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:22,996
He was extremely agitated.

88
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:26,098
That woman attacked him, and he
was far from stable to begin with.

89
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,411
This, uh, royal "we" stuff,

90
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,244
is he completely delusional, or...?

91
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,299
Charles has an adaptive fantasy,

92
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,602
- an imaginary friend.
- Yeah, well, we aren't so sure, you know.

93
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,449
Charles' friend might be real after all.

94
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:38,839
Hey, look, look. The woman...

95
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:41,347
who attacked Charles
is named Emily Byrne.

96
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,241
She's wanted for multiple homicide,

97
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,417
and she's kidnapped my wife and my son.

98
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:48,025
He may know something that
could help us find them.

99
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,570
He and Emily grew up together
in state care, at Barrett House.

100
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,888
But Charles has been here at
Edgewater, for more than 10 years,

101
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,998
- I don't know how...
- I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.

102
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:57,382
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Why else... why else

103
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:59,424
- would Emily come all this way?
- Hey, hey.

104
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,093
Relax, man.

105
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,461
Let me handle this.

106
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:04,617
Okay?

107
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,786
Sorry, it's uh... Um...

108
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,926
this guy,

109
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,874
Doctor Shen, MIT scientist,

110
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,675
ah, he was, um... experimenting
on kids at Barrett House.

111
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,275
We've listened to his tapes,
interviews with... with the subjects.

112
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,868
Um, Charles was one of
them, and there was at least,

113
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,589
one other kid.

114
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:31,598
And you think that child,

115
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:33,662
- is Charles' imaginary friend?
- Yes.

116
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,089
Subject B.

117
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:38,857
Charles was, uh, Subject A.

118
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:43,563
Okay, he needs time to recover.

119
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,545
- How much time?
- Well,

120
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,020
come back tomorrow.

121
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:48,475
We don't... we don't have a day.

122
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,513
We may not even have hours.

123
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,240
Shen ended up in a grave

124
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,246
with five other bodies,

125
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:59,156
eyelids cut off. That's the signature

126
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,037
of Conrad Harlow, a known...

127
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,553
serial killer.

128
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,748
Now, I've looked at who pays the bills

129
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:08,951
- for Charles here at Edgewater...
- That's a family trust.

130
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,649
It's been that way since the beginning.

131
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,458
Are you aware that this trust is, uh,

132
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:15,526
linked with Conrad Harlow?

133
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,208
Hmm?

134
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,303
Your Subject B,

135
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:24,084
you think it's Emily Byrne

136
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,186
and you need Charles
to confirm that, right?

137
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,824
Yes. I just...

138
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,104
I-I just wanna find my family.

139

00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:36,198
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

145
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:38,492
Hey! Stop that woman! Grab her!

146
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:39,700
Stop her!

147
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,996
Hey, stop! Ma'am!

148
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,757
She locked the door! Shit!

149
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,772
- There she is!
- Hey! Stop!

150
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,812
- <i>Oh, dios mío.</i>
- Stop!

151
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,146
Don't move! Don't move! Get up!

152
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,157
Open the door! Now, come here!

153
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:30,584
Get over there! Come on, let's go!

154
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,906
Go, go, go! Hurry up!

155
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,329
In! Now, now, move,
move. You too, honey.

156
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:45,959
Goddammit, get over here. Don't move.

157
00:20:45,997 --> 00:20:47,224
Don't move.

158
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:19,017
<i>- Em, talk to me.</i>
- Hey.

159
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:21,523
I found a company called "Tri-King".

160
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:24,449
They make, uh, tanks and aquariums.
I need you to track 'em down.

161
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:26,651
Ah, what do they have to
do with whoever has Flynn?

162
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:28,760
I think they made the tank that held me.

163
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:31,432
I need to find out who ordered
it and where it was sent.

164
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,959
Okay. Tri-King. I'm on it.

165
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:35,694
Okay.

166
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:22,702
There's a switch! Switch!

167
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,051
Let's go.

168
00:24:35,747 --> 00:24:38,747
Mom! No! Mom!

169
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:40,704
Mom!

170
00:24:44,993 --> 00:24:47,188
Maybe we should call it a night, uh?

171
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,873
You saw Captain Spaceman over there.

172
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,901
I don't think we're gonna get

173
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:54,190
anything out of him.

174
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,165
- That's Crown.
- Yeah.

175
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:01,839
- Yeah?
- <i>We got results on the bodies.</i>

176
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:03,147
<i>Two names you know:</i>

177
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,962
<i>Belson and Drummond, two of Harlow's first victims.</i>

178
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:07,919
<i>The others are in advanced decomp,</i>

179
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,744
<i>Whitman says fifteen years.</i>

180
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,075
Wait, wait, wait, where
was Harlow back then?

181
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,403
<i>That's the problem.</i>

182
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:17,427
<i>Conrad Harlow was in
Zurich from 2000 to 2005,</i>

183
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,405
<i>at least according to his passport.</i>

184
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:22,139
We need to see if he had any
known associates back then.

185
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,350
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

186
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,608
<i>Ericson tracked down an old girlfriend
of Harlow's from grad school.</i>

187
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:29,746
<i>She filed a sexual assault
charge with campus police.</i>

188
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:32,413
- <i>It mentions two attackers.</i>
- Any names?

189
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:35,188
<i>The file was buried by the DA.</i>

190
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,597
<i>I'm gonna interview the girlfriend now.</i>

191
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,414
All good. And we're waiting on Charles.

192
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,604
- This is gonna be fun.
- Actually, we're about to visit with him.

193
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,855
Call you later.

194
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,796
We wanted to talk
to you about the woman who, uh,

195
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:51,774
came visit you, today.

196
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:56,317
- No.
- Wait, wait, wait.

197
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,713
It's okay. It's okay, Charles.

198
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,502
Okay, no... no problem, no problem.

199
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:02,611
Hey, buddy, buddy. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

200
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:05,393
- Hey. Sorry, buddy. Sorry.
- It's okay.

201
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:08,399
How about we talk about
your, uh, your friend?

202
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,448
Charles,

203
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,328
sounds like you two were close.

204
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,015
Yeah, we take care of each other.

205
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,407
Did you, um...

206
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:24,841
It's okay. It's okay.

207
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,194
You keep each other's secrets?

208
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:32,471
Sometimes.

209
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,105
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

210
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,727
I have a friend like that.

211
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:40,194
A friend who I keep secrets for.

212
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,913
What kind of secrets?

213
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:47,497
Sometimes...

214
00:26:48,332 --> 00:26:50,215
my friend isn't very nice.

215
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:54,100
Sometimes, she's...

216
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:55,988
she's kind of mean.

217
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:59,544
Yeah, my friend is kind of mean too.

218
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:02,637
- Yeah.
- To other people?

219
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,511
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

220
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:05,805
To you?

221
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,053
Hey, it's okay.

222
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,446
That's hard.

223
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:18,139
It's hard when you care
about someone who's mean.

224
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:20,111
Yeah.

225
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:27,174
Did your friend ever get
angry with Dr. Shen?

226
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:30,128
We don't wanna talk about that.

227
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,541
- Did Dr. Shen hurt you?
- Yeah.

228
00:27:35,598 --> 00:27:37,045
Your friend?

229
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,259
Did your friend hurt Dr. Shen back?

230
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,931
I'm not supposed to say.

231
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:51,383
I'm not supposed to say.

232
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:55,459
Maybe we should... we could
check on him, make sure he's okay.

233
00:27:56,469 --> 00:28:00,065
I don't care if he's
hurt. He hurt us first.

234
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:02,683
Well, then, we... we should
find him and lock him up.

235
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:03,894
Yeah.

236
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,076
Yeah, well, make sure he
never hurts anyone else again.

237
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:09,194
He hurt so many...

238
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:11,048
so many children.

239
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,250
W-was... was there candy in
the air when they got hurt?

240
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:27,345
- And I said something about that.
- Yeah, yeah.

241
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,623
That's how Dr. Shen tricks you.

242
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:32,819
"The-the-the air is full-full of candy.'

243
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:35,818
And I tried to eat it.

244
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:38,708
And... and he lies.

245
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,444
He always says you can
have the candy later, but,

246
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,057
there wasn't any candy.

247
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:45,814
- There was never any candy.
- It's okay, Charles.

248
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,238
- It's okay. That's enough.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

249
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:49,825
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- No, that's enough.

250
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:51,353
It's okay. It's okay.

251
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:54,407
Thank you. Thank you. Come on.

252
00:28:58,335 --> 00:28:59,624
It's okay.

253
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,011
It's okay.

254
00:29:03,581 --> 00:29:06,178
What are you doing, man?
He was starting to talk.

255
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:07,808
I know. I know. I know. But I
think we got what we needed.

256
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,198
- Do you remember the molasses flood?
- That urban legend?

257
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:12,463
Well, it's not an urban legend.
100 years ago...

258
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:14,564
a storage tank exploded
and flooded the North End

259
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,058
with 2 million gallons of molasses.

260
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:17,853
The North End doesn't
smell like molasses.

261
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,378
No, not so much anymore.
But back in the 1990's...

262
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,963
when they ripped everything
up from the big dig, it did.

263
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:26,355
After the explosion, the factory
turned into a warehouse.

264
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,378
- Perfect for torturing kids.
- Yeah. Or holding my family.

265
00:29:33,202 --> 00:29:34,743
Hey. What did you find?

266
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,809
<i>Do you know I could go to jail
for helping her like this?</i>

267
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:38,811
Yeah, don't worry,
you'll get your exclusive.

268
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,711
<i>What I found is better than that.</i>

269
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,862
<i>Look, Jack, I do want that
interview, but I can't sit on this.</i>

270
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:47,319
<i>I mean, I can give you...
half a day maybe, but then I publish.</i>

271
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:49,336
What do you mean? Sit on what, Laurie?

272
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:50,831
What the hell did you find?

273
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,622
Hey. You find anything?

274
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:14,968
- <i>I did. But, Em...</i>
- What?

275
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:18,578
Just say it, Jack.

276
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:21,257
Tri-King made the tank 7 years ago,

277
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:23,868
- they had it delivered to the North End.
- <i>Okay, where?</i>

278
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,762
978 Commercial Street. Suite 209.

279
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:27,971
And who ordered it?

280
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:31,983
<i>Jack?</i>

281
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,189
You did, Em.

282
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:36,760
<i>It was you.</i>

283
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:40,279
No, that's not possible.

284
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:41,866
<i>I saw the invoice myself.</i>

285
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:43,377
You signed it.

286
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,975
It's forged.

287
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:47,862
I'm going there.

288
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:49,704
And I'm gonna find Flynn.

289
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:54,449
Thank you.

290
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:02,054
Some things are better left in the past.

291
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:06,353
There are lives at stake
in the present, Ms. Wheelock.

292
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:10,362
You never know what might help.

293
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,635
We were young people experimenting.

294
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:15,926
Things got out of hand.

295
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:19,336
That's not what you put
in the record you filed.

296
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:23,291
- The Harlows were a powerful family.
- Not anymore.

297
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:25,493
You can talk to me.

298
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:33,214
Conrad and I had broken
up a year before.

299
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,582
It was amicable.

300
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:40,746
Then we bumped into each
other, made plans for a drink.

301
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,113
We were back at his place,

302
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,621
he had a friend join us.

303
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,576
Then...

304
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,974
I blacked out.

305
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,068
It's only images.

306
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:06,944
This friend...

307
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:08,854
I need a name.

308
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:12,538
Harlow may have had
an accomplice in his murders.

309
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,733
He wasn't always some monster.

310
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:17,339
Conrad I knew, before that night...

311
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:20,923
he was sensitive.

312
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,331
He was in pain.

313
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:25,191
Something hurt him.

314
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:26,397
What?

315
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,998
He'd never say.

316
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,174
Something in his family.

317
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:38,758
I still need the name of the
other man who assaulted you.

318
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,064
Who said it was a man?

319
00:36:49,065 --> 00:36:50,431
Survive.

320
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,282
There's nothing here.

321
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,576
What?

322
00:37:42,974 --> 00:37:44,216
What is it?

323
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:47,951
Nick?

324
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,005
Durand!

325
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:00,788
That's the mask Emily drew.

326
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:03,254
No eyelids.

327
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:06,393
The children Shen held in those rooms
would have seen this.

328
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:08,958
It's not Harlow.

329
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:11,673
The children who saw these masks

330
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,288
had the idea way before
Harlow ever got involved.

331
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:17,265
Jesus!

332
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,293
I've had it wrong since the beginning.

333
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,559
Since he called me that night.

334
00:38:25,134 --> 00:38:27,170
Emily's not Harlow's accomplice...

335
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:30,069
but she could be his mentor.

336
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:53,640
Durand.

337
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:55,982
Nick, I'm over from the cabin. I
was sent here by whoever has them.

338
00:40:55,988 --> 00:40:57,197
They're underground.

339
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,568
- Emily, stay there.
- <i>No, Nick. Listen.</i>

340
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:04,604
<i>Whoever planned this has eyes.</i>

341
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,438
If they see an army coming
Flynn will die, Alice will die...

342
00:41:08,444 --> 00:41:10,673
I need you to come alone.

343
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,613
You can cuff me after, I don't care.

344
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,535
<i>You have my word.</i>

345
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,054
Okay.

346
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,492
I'll come alone.

347
00:41:20,498 --> 00:41:22,601
Okay, I'm about 200 meters
north of the cabin.

348
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,942
There's an open tunnel.
I'll leave you my scarf as a sign.

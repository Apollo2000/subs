00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:03,614
Alice, what is this?

3
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:04,840
I'm pregnant.

4
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,214
Our whole life together,

5
00:00:06,244 --> 00:00:07,916
it's just a consolation, isn't it?

6
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:10,497
I'm going to my sister's.

7
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:14,383
Jack, I need your help.
I had something in my hand...

8
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,508
Was it this?

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,809
Yeah. That's the key
to finding who had me.

10
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,142
Please, Jack.

11
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:23,349
They found six bodies
in those woods, Em! Six!

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,277
And you knew they were there. How?

13
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:32,549
_

14
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:35,651
<i>The only way to stop it</i>

15
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,805
<i>is to do the experiment on someone else.</i>

16
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,479
<i>No, no! Please! Please, no!</i>

17
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:42,053
<i>That means you will be in charge
of adding the water to the tank.</i>

18
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:46,127
<i>I don't want to do this, please!
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!</i>

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,043
<i>Easy. Easy, Charles.</i>

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,005
Here's what I'm trying
to understand, Jack.

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,762
You helped us track her down,

22
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,971
and you're willing to
go to jail for her?

23
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:56,918
I don't know what you're talking about.

24
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,632
<i>Jack Byrne, you're under arrest
for harboring a wanted fugitive.</i>

25
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,709
Alice?!

26
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,263
Ma'am, I'm sorry but we really
need to ask you some questions.

27
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,451
- Ma'am, please?
- Maura, you've got to talk to the cops.

28
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,456
It's the only way we
can find your sister.

29
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:32,692
- Just try to relax.
- Maura, where are you going?

30
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:38,561
How could you let this happen?

31
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:42,021
Do you finally believe
it's Emily now, uh?

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,666
Or are you still standing by her side?

33
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,389
This is all your fault.

34
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,847
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna fix this.

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,547
Mr. Durand, they're
waiting for you outside.

36
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,429
Thank you.

37
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,399
Mr. Durand, do you have a statement?

38
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,788
What happened?

39
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:39,265
_

40
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:59,233
Hey...

41
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,069
what you got there?

42
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:24,630

<i>I've stood here before...</i>

47
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:54,222
<i>as a... as an FBI agent, I've...</i>

48
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:57,426
<i>I've appealed to you for help
bringing criminals to justice.</i>

49
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,592
<i>I'm not speaking today, as an agent.</i>

50
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:07,202
<i>My family has been taken from me.</i>

51
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:13,897
<i>And I know the person
who has them, and I...</i>

52
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,594
<i>I... I know and I think

54
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,286
<i>Emily, I know you're hurting,</i>

00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,296
<i>and what you went through, no-one...</i>

<i>no-one should have to go through,</i>

out on Alice and Flynn.</i>

<i>Remember who you used to be</i>

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,752
<i>and do the right thing.</i>

60
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,566
<i>Bring my wife</i>

61
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,558
<i>and our son home.</i>

<i>Please, bring them home. Thank you.</i>

Help!

66
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:39,254
Help! Help!

67
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:57,998
Flynn! Honey! Oh, my God, Flynn! Flynn!

68
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:00,902
Wake up!

69
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,750
- Flynn!
- Mom?

70
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:08,925
Get down!

71
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:59,281
- Mom, don't go!
- It's okay.

72
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,266
- Here, drink.
- I don't wanna...

73
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:06,943
- I wanna go home.
- I know you do, honey,

74
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:08,554
but we can't do that right now.

75
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,146
Please drink the water.

76
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:21,469
Come here.

77
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:25,264
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

78
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,694
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

79
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,495
I know your father

80
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:35,501
is looking for us right now,

81
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:37,813
and he's gonna find us.

82
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,621
We just have to stay
strong 'til he gets here.

83
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,992
And then, this will all fade away,

84
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,945
just like waking up.

85
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:52,601
Can you hold 'til then, Flynn?

86
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,338
Can you stay strong for me?

87
00:07:57,838 --> 00:07:59,189
Don't worry.

88
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,912
He's looking for us right this second.

89
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:08,608
Soon, this will all be over.

90
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,861
Jack Byrne, your bail's been posted.

91
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:19,045
You're free to go.

92
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,489
Watch your back out there.

93
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,611
Jack!

94
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:34,239
Do I know you?

95
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,727
You do now. I'm the one who
bailed you out. Laurie Colson.

96
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,365
Could we go some place
and talk for a moment?

97
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,649
Uh... yeah.

98
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,719
- There's a little place up here.
- Okay.

99
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,095
So, I've been following the case.

100
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,921
- Yeah, you and the rest of the country.
- No, not like them.

101
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,654
I think there's another side to
this story and no-one's telling it.

102
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,180
See, I believe your sister is innocent.

103
00:08:58,347 --> 00:09:00,424
And I think I can help you.

104
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:06,050
Wait a second.

105
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:08,966
You're that reporter Emily stabbed,

106
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:10,599
- aren't you?
- Oh, uh... well...

107
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:12,580
What is this? Is this...
is this some kind of stunt?

108
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,554
No, wait, please, it's not a stunt.

109
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,499
Yes. Yes, I am that reporter,
but this... this was my fault.

110
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,021
- You know, I never should've been there.
- Okay.

111
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:20,396
You'll notice I never pressed charges,

112
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:22,556
- and believe me, I could have.
- So, what do you want?

113
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:25,296
To tell Emily's story.

114
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:26,588
With your help.

115
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,130
I want an exclusive with you, Jack.

116
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:31,280
I'll pay you back the bail.

117
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:32,987
No, forget about the money.

118
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,987
All I ask, is that you just take
some time to really consider it.

119
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,371
Mull it over... okay?
If it's still a no,

120
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,080
no hard feelings.

121
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:42,536
You know, if I gambled and
lost, then I can live with that.

122
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,057
But I'm betting that you
want someone to tell her side.

123
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,753
So,

124
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:53,050
anything you need,
okay? Anything at all,

125
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,249
call me.

126
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,650
_

127
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:02,713
We just got an ID on one of the bodies.

128
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:05,700
Hello?

129
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:08,336
Okay, forensics are
processing the bodies.

130
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,055
They say the remains have co-mingled,

131
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,135
but they've managed to ID the
body that Emily uncovered.

132
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,637
Doctor Lu-Fang Shen.

133
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,840
Our earliest records
show Shen working at MIT

134
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:21,333
followed by a position at Barrett House.

135
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,238
It's, er, short-term based
for foster kids, it was...

136
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:26,261
ended up functioning as an orphanage.

137
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,966
- That's Emily's orphanage.
- We need to look into it.

138
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:34,020
Well, it's defunct. Shut
down over a decade ago.

139
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:37,639
- Well, let's look for old employees.
- Dr. Shen has a brother.

140
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:39,909
Erik Shen.

141
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:12,468
<i>Emily, it's me. They... they
arrested me, I couldn't call you.</i>

142
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:15,009
<i>- I'm... I'm sorry. I couldn't call you.</i>
- Jack, Flynn's gone.

143
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,313
- They took him.
- <i>I know, Em. I know.</i>

144
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,701
And Nick thinks that I did it.

145
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,854
And now he's gonna be
wasting time looking for me...

146
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,817
- I know. Emily...
- <i>Can't even turn myself in,</i>

147
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,205
- 'cause no one's gonna believe me.
<i>- Emily, listen to me.</i>

148
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:30,169
This is why you need to find him
before it's too late, okay?

149
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:34,029
God, Jack, I'm so tired, man.

150
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,448
I'm so tired. I can't do this.

151
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:40,424
<i>Emily... Emily. You have
to stay focused. Listen to me.</i>

152
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,710
Now, tell me, what did you
find out about Shen?

153
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,159
Um...

154
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,004
Shen started experimenting on kids,

155
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,889
after he left MIT.

156
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,340
There's two of them,
from what I could find out but...

157
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,691
they were being tortured
the same way that I was.

158
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,478
<i>One of them was a boy.
His name was Charles,</i>

159
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,266
<i>he was at my orphanage.
And the other one</i>

160
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:10,274
was a subject "B".

161
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,396
I think one of them
might be holding Flynn.

162
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,228
Okay. So... is there anything
you need me to do?

163
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,040
I need to find Charles.

164
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,832
Eric Shen?

165
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,390
Yeah.

166
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:31,103
My name is Nick Durand, FBI,
this is Detective Gibbs.

167
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,613
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

168
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:36,034
I guess you guys are real thorough, huh?

169
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,808
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.

170
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,872
Was there anything in Lu-Fang's effects?

171
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:44,691
Anything to help the case?

172
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,343
We've never been here, Mr. Shen.

173
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:51,782
Not you, but the other agent.

174
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:53,567
She came the other day,

175
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:55,935
asking about my brother
and his research.

176
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,227
I gave her the key to my storage room.

177
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,231
Clear. Okay, let's get to work.

178
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:16,326
We need to find out what she was after.

179
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:31,349
Dad, Emily needs help.

180
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:35,467
Okay? I need your help.

181
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:38,774
Well...

182
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,563
Proud of you, son.

183
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,889
You are?

184
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,153
Everything you're doing for Emily,

185
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,846
everything you've done for me.

186
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,584
Of course, I'm proud of you.

187
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,110
I know you think I went hard on you.

188
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,230
- Dad...
- No, it's okay.

189
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,812
We can be honest.

190
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,604
Well, growing up, yeah, I...

191
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:09,190
I guess I felt, after Emily...

192
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,714
there was no space left
in the family for me.

193
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,971
You know, the love
and the attention went to her.

194
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:21,865
It doesn't matter now. It's in the past.

195
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:24,071
It does matter. Matters to me.

196
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:28,793
I never meant to make you feel that way.

197
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,548
You were always doing so well.

198
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:38,131
Emily, you remember how she was.

199
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,006
I guess I thought she needed it more.

200
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,631
- I need you to know how...
- Dad...

201
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,372
I know.

202
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:53,474
I know.

203
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:01,754
Okay, I got a plan.

204
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,121
- Flynn, wake up.
- What?

205
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,479
Here, take it. This one's not so moldy.

206
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:14,603
Boo!

207
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:17,075
Do you realize what a cliché you are?

208
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:19,292
At least I'm not in senior care.

209
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,371
How you doing, Irv?

210
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,846
I need a favor.

211
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,627
I'm busy, Warren.

212
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,652
Like you think the
pigeon's gonna miss you?

213
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,434
Come on, Irv. It's for Emily.

214
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,401
Heard about that.

215
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,560
You gonna help me?

216
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,098
Course, I'm gonna help you,
Warren. What do you need?

217
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:48,763
I gotta find a person. A kid actually.

218
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,572
Lost in the system?

219
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,588
Worse, sadly. You still have friends
in Family Services?

220
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:56,662
I do. If they're still alive.

221
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,260
- You gonna call 'em?
- Yeah.

222
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:04,872
- Well, when?
- When I finished feeding the bird.

223
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,919
Well, how long's that gonna take?

224
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:09,192
It's done when it's done, Warren.

225
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,317
Fuck!

226
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,424
Jack, talk to me. 'Cause I
can't do this anymore, man.

227
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,932
Everything I touch just goes wrong.
And now they got Flynn.

228
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:40,476
- Emily...
- And I just gotta sit here and hide

229
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,049
- like some kind of a fucking coward.
- Emily,

230
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,350
Dad's here. He has news.

231
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,263
Dad?

232
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,871
Emily, we have the lead
you're looking for.

233
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:59,466
- You found Charles?
- <i>We found Charles. Last name Avallone.</i>

234
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,590
He's in a mental facility.

235
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:06,131
<i>Low security. But you'll need
to break in. It won't be easy.</i>

236
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,434
I know.

237
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,297
I love you.

238
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,784
I love you too, Dad.

239
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:50,691
Help!

240
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,022
Help.

241
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:10,362
Mommy stop squeezing, it hurts.

242
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,211
Sorry. It's fine. Everything's fine

243
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,854
Please, no, no...

244
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,515
No.

245
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,789
This is not real.

246
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:51,378
This isn't real.

247
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,290
- Get some rest, Pop.
- Yeah, yeah.

248
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,981
His blood pressure's
never been this high.

249
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,476
If you want your father to stay healthy,

250
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,423
you need to keep his
stress to a minimum.

251
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:12,907
I understand. It won't happen again.

252
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:20,164
Jack, what are you doing here?

253
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:22,849
- I'm just visiting my father.
- I'm gonna tell you something, Jack.

254
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,117
Something that's gonna help us find her,

255
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,695
- because all of this is on you.
- I don't know anything.

256
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:28,164
Don't, don't, don't. Don't lie to me.

257
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:29,406
All of this is on you.

258
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:30,716
- Now, you realize that, don't you?
- Nick... I really don't know...

259
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:32,779
Stop! Stop! Stop lying to me!

260
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,796
You helped her, so she could
take my wife and my son.

261
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,888
- Her son. Her son.
- Jeez, she is sick.

262
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,403
- She's sick!
- No, she's hurt.

263
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,301
She is hurt, and you hurt
her. Don't you get that?!

264
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,256
She didn't take your family, Nick.

265
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,155
Deep down you know that's true.

266
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,357
Don't you think I want
to be on her side, Jack?

267
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:54,718
Don't you think that I want that?

268
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:57,499
But all of the evidence, all
of it, it all points to her.

269
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:00,901
So if you have some way that
is doesn't, just tell me.

270
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,581
Fine. I'll go talk to your father.

271
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,587
No. No, no. He's been
through enough. Nick! Nick!

272
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,166
Tell me where your daughter is.

273
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:12,151
You got a burner in here, uh?
You helping her?

274
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,737
You got some nerve coming in here!

275
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,849
My grandson and daughter are out there!

276
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:18,267
Why aren't you out there,
where a man should be?

277
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,372
You need to pick a side, Warren.

278
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:25,364
You need to pick a side. Your...
your daughter's or your grandson's.

279
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,261
You were never good enough for her.

280
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,511
She ran rings 'round you as an agent,

281
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:31,337
and she's running rings 'round you now.

282
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:34,134
And when she's cleared her
name and caught this killer,

283
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,331
she'll have made you
and the whole damn Bureau

284
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,404
look like the morons you are.

285
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,653
You're gonna want to hear this.

286
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:19,036
<i>Do you know what will
happen to you if you disobey me?</i>

287
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:24,194
<i>- Bad things.
- What kind of bad things?</i>

288
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,715
<i>- What kind of bad things?
- Not breathing.</i>

289
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:33,892
<i>Who shall I hurt?</i>

290
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,626
<i>Shall I hurt B?</i>

291
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:38,253
<i>No.</i>

292
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,093
<i>Shall I hurt you?</i>

293
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:41,373
<i>Yes.</i>

294
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,853
How many more of these are there?

295
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:45,544
Well, there's a whole box.

296
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,474
Most of them are damaged.
But this is the clearest one.

297
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,396
What do you make of all this?

298
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,354
You think Emily's one of those kids?

299
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,683
I mean, she's the right age, but...

300
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:56,981
I don't know. Let me...
Let me listen to that last part.

301
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,984
<i>You are a brave boy. Repeat after me.</i>

302
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:04,860
<i>I'm brave.</i>

303
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,719
<i>You are my favorite boy, Charles.</i>

304
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,881
Who shall I hurt?

305
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,404
You? Or her?

306
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:24,215
Do you want your mother to suffer?

307
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:31,051
Who will it be?

308
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,206
You... or her?

309
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:41,411
Do you want me to hurt her?

310
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:45,288
Hurt me.

311
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:32,025
<i>You got anything on
the boy from the tape?</i>

312
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:34,202
Well, the team is going
as fast as they can.

313
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,718
<i>The orphanage was demolished
and replaced with a strip mall</i>

314
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,408
<i>and the records are over 35 years old,</i>

315
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:40,540
and that's just the ones
that weren't destroyed.

316
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,244
Nick?

317
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:44,526
We're here. I'll report back.

318
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,130
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

319
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,937
We're the ones that
called about information

320
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,612
on former professor Lu-Fang Shen.

321
00:24:54,848 --> 00:24:56,128
Have a sit.

322
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,783
As I told your colleague on the phone,

323
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:06,385
we simply don't keep records
of our professors'...

324
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:08,190
personal lives.

325
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:10,520
All I can give you is in here.

326
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,536
Yeah, we're looking for more
off the record information.

327
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,029
How long have you worked here?

328
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:23,544
Bill, is it?

329
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,202
21 years this April.

330
00:25:26,888 --> 00:25:28,447
So you remember Shen.

331
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:35,788
Look, we're not looking to
get you in any trouble here.

332
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:39,939
I'm just trying to get my family back.

333
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:44,145
Your information could help save them.

334
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,065
I remember him.

335
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:52,866
He was a big problem for the university.

336
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,927
He conducted psychological
trials for research,

337
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:59,451
- and some of them are in the records.
- And some aren't.

338
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:03,884
What kind of experiments?

339
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:05,634
I don't know the details.

340
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,717
But I do recall that some students
filed complaints.

341
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,226
There were... adverse effects.

342
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:12,835
We shut it down.

343
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,733
So you swept it under the rug
to avoid a scandal?

344
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,065
Why did MIT hire him to begin with?

345
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:22,302
Hmm?

346
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,161
What did he specialize in?
What kind of work did he do?

347
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:33,928
Okay, there was...

348
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:37,811
One bit of scandal but...
Conspiracy theory if you ask me.

349
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:40,363
- What was it?
- Right.

350
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:44,028
He was rumored to be involved

351
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,553
in Government research programs.

352
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:50,444
Secret programs.

353
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:54,247
That's not uncommon with our institution.

354
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:57,799
- Yeah.
- Tell us about these rumors.

355
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,889
Flynn! Flynn!

356
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:16,513
Flynn!

357
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:18,913
Are you okay?

358
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:24,995
It's okay.

359
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,291
Why... Why are you wet?

360
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,750
Hey, it's okay.
Just tell me what happened?

361
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,789
He put me in a tank.

362
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,361
Did you see who it was?

363
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:45,417
No, but I... but I heard him.

364
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:52,353
- Was it anyone you know?
- I... I couldn't tell.

365
00:27:52,656 --> 00:27:54,696
He made me hold my breath under water.

366
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,016
And that hurt.

367
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,275
He said that if I did it,
you wouldn't have to.

368
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:04,670
It's all right. You don't have to.

369
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:43,301
I'll call Nick.

370
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:49,597
Nick, we got a solid match.

371
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,273
There was a Charles at Barret House

372
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,835
during the target time frame.
Charles Avallone.

373
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,368
Sending you the details now.

374
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:06,546
He's at Edgewater psychiatric facility.

375
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,459
It's a 15-minute-drive from here.

376
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:11,843
Let's go.

377
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:53,543
Psst!

378
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:56,553
Hey!

379
00:29:57,524 --> 00:29:58,924
Come here.

380
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,756
Hi.

381
00:30:07,468 --> 00:30:09,347
Are you real?

382
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:12,734
No.

383
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:15,750
I didn't think so.

384
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:18,995
I like your robe.

385
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:23,876
I like candy.

386
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,738
Okay.

387
00:30:54,177 --> 00:30:55,786
Hey! Hey!

388
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:58,834
Stop. Stop. Hey, you. Stop.

389
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:03,144
They didn't notice you, but I did.

390
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:04,871
You're not supposed to be here.

391
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:07,876
I have to tell everyone
we have a visitor.

392
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,148
Hey, everyone!

393
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:13,436
I'm looking for somebody...

394
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:17,602
Charles Avallone.
He's in here. Do you know him?

395
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,891
I know everyone.

396
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,421
<i>So what's your name?</i>

397
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:30,335
<i>- Nick.
- Emily.</i>

398
00:31:57,036 --> 00:31:58,916
I'm sorry, are you Jenny's roommate?

399
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,876
Yeah.

400
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:02,075
I think she's having problems
with the bouncer outside.

401
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:04,892
Oh, shit. Okay, I'll be right back.

402
00:32:18,876 --> 00:32:20,341
So, what's your name?

403
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:21,956
Nick.

404
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:23,595
Emily.

405
00:32:24,747 --> 00:32:27,628
So does her roommate really
have trouble with the bouncer...

406
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:31,183
or are you just making that up?

407
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,081
Kind of cocky, aren't you?

408
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:36,855
I made it up.

409
00:32:40,396 --> 00:32:41,595
Nice.

410
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:49,867
Do you like to dance, Nick?

411
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:53,351
- No. Really.
- No? Come on. Let's go.

412
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:06,310
We're close. Are you okay?

413
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:09,478
Yeah. I'm good, I'm fine.

414
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,426
Good. Keep sharp.

415
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,623
Finding Charles is easy.

416
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,350
He's in lock down.

417
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,250
In a dungeon. Behind the locked door
at the end of the hall.

418
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:28,695
But be careful. He hurts people.

419
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,763
He's very strong.

420
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:35,986
That guy has the key to the dungeon.

421
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:39,426
At medicine bell,
I'll make a distraction

422
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,111
and you'll steal the key.

423
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:43,215
We have to be really really quick.

424
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:23,202
I'm Agent Nick Durand,
need to speak with one of your patients,

425
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,267
Charles Avallone.

426
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:27,077
We'd also like all his records
and visitors logs.

427
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:45,837
You have approximately 8,4 minutes.

428
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:47,149
Bye!

429
00:35:02,107 --> 00:35:03,367
Thank you.

430
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:06,667
What's going on?

431
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:08,890
Don't worry. It happens a lot.

432
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:42,226
Charles.

433
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,747
Charles, wait!

434
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:51,149
Charles!

435
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,267
Thank you.

436
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:32,867
You were mean to us.
You're a bad person!

437
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,406
You made us hurt.

438
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:40,461
I remember you.

439
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,267
Emily.

440
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:56,699
I'm sorry, Charles. I'm sorry.

441
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,785
I don't want to hurt you.
I just need to know what happened.

442
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,627
Did Dr. Shen hurt you?

443
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,253
- He was a bad man.
- Yes. Yes, he was.

444
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:07,364
Did he hurt anyone else?
I need to know what happened. Please!

445
00:37:07,465 --> 00:37:10,871
We will never help you!
You are not good, you don't get help!

446
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:13,745
Did Dr. Shen hurt anyone else? Tell me!

447
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,898
Who was with you and Shen?

448
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:19,104
- B.
- Yes, B.

449
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,330
You were subject A.

450
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:21,936
The other child is subject B. Who is it?

451
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:25,515
B... B is for "Books". Give us our book.

452
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:27,827
No, stay with me!

453
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:29,867
Give me my book!

454
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:32,346
Charles, stay with me.
Who are you protecting?

455
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,586
Give us our book! We need our book!

456
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:36,408
- No.
- No!

457
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,707
Charles is out!

458
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,635
He's fighting a woman!
He's fighting a woman!

459
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:46,318
Help!

460
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,317
Help us out! He's fighting a woman!

461
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:03,255
He's fighting a woman! Help us out!

462
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:11,090
They're fighting! They're fighting!

463
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:13,592
Help! Help, they're fighting!

464
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:15,577
Charles is fighting with a woman!

465
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,998
Charles is fighting with a woman. Help.

466
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,257
Help!

467
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:25,554
Emily! Don't move!

468
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:33,874
Emily, don't make me do this.

469
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:37,679
Just tell me where they are.

470
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:46,347
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

471
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:48,356
I told you not to move.

472
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:53,731
Put your hands where I can see them.

473
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,817
Emily, put your hands

474
00:38:56,873 --> 00:38:59,754
where I can see them, and turn around...

475
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:01,661
slowly.

476
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,617
Why are you doing this?

477
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,738
Can't you see you're hurting him?

478
00:39:20,018 --> 00:39:22,018
How can you say that to me?

479
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:31,418
I am trying to save Flynn.

480
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,380
This is over.

481
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:45,403
I'm done believing you.

482
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:50,857

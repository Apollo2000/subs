1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:02,391
<i>Previously on "Absentia"...</i>

2
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:04,953
- How long?
- You've been gone 6 years.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,179
It's like that movie where
the angel takes the guy

4
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,359
and shows him what life
would be like without him.

5
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,031
And everybody is so much worse off.

6
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:13,828
Except in my case it's the opposite.

7
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:16,090
I can't be around you, or her,

8
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:18,613
without feeling like
I'm betraying someone.

9
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,578
Just as life was starting
to become bearable again...

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,511
you had to come back.

11
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,463
You're such an asshole when you drink.

12
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:30,566
<i>Emily, you and I have both
been victimized by the same person.</i>

13
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:32,387
The vision is getting worse.

14
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,504
And part of me just wants to forget it,

15
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:36,652
and then the other part
just wants to remember.

16
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,413
And I'm terrified of what
would happen if I ever do.

17
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,880
They found my DNA on Semerov's body
and now Harlow is dead?

18
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:44,950
Someone is covering the tracks, Gibbs.

19
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,583
Someone is trying to frame Emily.

20
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:48,346
Make sure your girl doesn't leave town.

21
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,786
Why do you trust me?

22
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,313
I know you.

23
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,740
Robert Semerov, sex trafficker.

24
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:56,832
Had a habit of naming
his favorite girls after flowers.

25
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:57,857
Regina Talbot.

26
00:00:57,882 --> 00:00:59,426
She's working for
one of your guys too, man.

27
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,306
It's Adam.

28
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:04,582
He's the one behind Regina Talbot.

29
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:21,900
When did you see Byrne last?

30
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:24,128
Give me a timeline, Agent...

31
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,215
In other words, you lost her.

32
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,507
We'll discuss this back at the office.

33
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:54,386
Anybody seen you?

34
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:55,536
It's him.

35
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,135
- It's him, Nick. I found proof.
- Slow down, slow down. Proof of what?

36
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:00,501
Uh, Radford... He keeps a journal.
He drew what I've been seeing.

37
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:02,712
- You broke into Radford's house?
- No, I had to. Just listen to me.

38
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:04,035
- Emily...
- He keeps a journal he has

39
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,704
when from just after I was captured.

40
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,201
There is no way that he could've known.

41
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,753
I told you to stay at the hotel.

42
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:11,606
Nick, the bleeding eye drawn in it,
over and over again.

43
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,506
- You're not making...
- Nick, he drew what's in my head!

44
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,308
Emily! Emily! Emily.

45
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,138
Listen to yourself!

46
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:19,971
I know what I saw.

47
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:23,469
Look, I get that he's corrupt...

48
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,253
but we don't have any evidence.

49
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:27,586
None... that he had you
in that cabin. None.

50
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,970
- How do you explain the bleeding eye?
- I don't know and I will look into it,

51
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:31,994
but right now I have to take you in.

52
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,101
BPD has issued a warrant for you.

53
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:39,266
No. No, I need more time.

54
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,986
Do you want Flynn
to see you get arrested?

55
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,121
Is that what you want?

56
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:47,968
You should see him, then we have to go.

57
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,704
Come on.

58
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:08,630
Hey.

59
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,747
Hi.

60
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:17,586
I told Maura and Julian
you had a work emergency.

61
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:19,465
We were supposed to have diner.

62
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,473
Sorry. I completely forgot.

63
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,946
I was taking Emily back.
We were working a case.

64
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:30,099
Figured she could...
she could took Flynn in.

65
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,360
I just wanted to check in on him...

66
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,467
after the concussion.

67
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,758
I understand, Emily, but he's asleep.

68
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,601
You can look in on him.

69
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:42,877
Ah, thank you.

70
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,465
You still believe her.

71
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:00,001
With everything that is
starring you in the face,

72
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:01,202
'cause I've seen on the news,

73
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,266
that she's a suspect in Harlow's murder.

74
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,666
She didn't kill Harlow.

75
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,146
Hey.

76

77
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:38,586
Nick, can we stop by the hotel?

78
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,906
I need to grab a few things
before we go to county.

79
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:58,506
Just make sure Flynn doesn't listen
to what people are saying.

80
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,465
I'll have the rest sent to your dad's.

81
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,580
Emily?

82
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,825
Emily!

83
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:58,065
I trusted you and now
I look like a goddamn idiot.

84
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:00,561
I should charge you
with aiding and abetting fugitive.

85
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:02,617
She was only out of my sight
for a few minutes.

86
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:05,615
Oh, yeah? What was she wearing
when you saw her last?

87
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:12,978
Let me know when you remember.

88
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:16,342
A green jacket,
black hoodie, black pants.

89
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,586
<i>You can add that to your APB.</i>

90
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,441
What's the point? Uh?

91
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:23,371
She probably changed clothes
twice by now.

92
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:40,825
Where are you?

93
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:42,346
I'm sorry, Nick.

94
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:46,146
I just couldn't face being
a captive again. I couldn't do it.

95
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,796
- Em, where are you?
- I can't tell you.

96
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:49,825
You'd have to bring me back in.

97
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,798
Running makes you look guilty as hell.

98
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:55,632
If you... come to me now,
we can probably...

99
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:58,431
No! I'm gonna solve this.

100
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,642
H-How, Emily? How do you plan to do that?

101
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,626
You'll see.

102
00:11:07,654 --> 00:11:09,814
Just don't loose faith in me.

103
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:12,106
<i>Okay?</i>

104
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:51,794
I need the batteries for this.

105
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,954
Where have you been?

106
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,075
Uh?

107
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:31,683
You know I don't like being kept waiting.

108
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,106
Yes.

109
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:39,868
It was on purpose.

110
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:50,193
Mm.

111
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:56,136
I brought you surprise.

112
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:58,456
- You did? Yeah?
- Yes.

113
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:05,545
Why don't you go upstairs?
I'll get us a drink.

114
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:24,065
Go away!

115
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,025
Mr. Byrne, it's Detective Gibbs.

116
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:29,322
Mr. Byrne!

117
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,115
What do you want?

118
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:32,804
Can you open up?

119
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:34,866
No.

120
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:38,677
- I'm looking for your sister.
- She's... she's not here.

121
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:39,946
So where is she?

122
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:43,615
I don't know. At a motel somewhere.

123
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:44,906
Which one?

124
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,963
She didn't give me the details, all right?

125
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,386
She just... I'm glad to be rid of her.

126
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:55,941
Listen up...

127
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:59,026
If she reaches out, just call me.

128
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,465
Yeah, she's not gonna reach out.

129
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,353
Should go to our dad, he's the go to.

130
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:10,666
Good luck.

131
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:22,892
You did the right thing.

132
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:30,147
She escaped.

133
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,329
What? I don't understand.

134
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:37,705
I had to stop at a light,

135
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:41,825
and she's jumped out, ran off.

136
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:44,605
You couldn't catch her?

137
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:46,087
Don't you think I tried?

138
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,685
Why are you getting angry with me?

139
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:51,505
Sorry.

140
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:00,426
I should have cuffed her.

141
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,386
I don't know why I thought
I could trust her.

142
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,065
It was stupid.

143
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:20,106
It was really stupid.

144
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,288
The Emily Byrne we knew is gone, people.

145
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:35,825
It's tragic,

146
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:39,615
but whatever happened to her
during those years, it changed her.

147
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:42,666
She's violent, dangerous.

148
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,306
The prime suspect in two murders.

149
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:48,226
So the best thing we can do
for her is to bring her in.

150
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:49,545
Safely.

151
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:52,372
I wanna turn it over to Detective Gibbs,

152
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,186
who's running point for BPD.

153
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,148
Yeah, um...

154
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,866
What's this? Uh?

155
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,025
What did I tell you last night?

156
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:21,346
The door.

157
00:17:28,242 --> 00:17:30,890
I gave you a chance
to open your eyes, Nick...

158
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,226
and you didn't.

159
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,025
I said she was playing you and she did.

160
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,860
Now you gotta pay the price.

161
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,346
Badge and gun.

162
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:44,906
You're suspended.

163
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,266
You're gonna join the hunt yourself?

164
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:07,009
See if you can do her
like you did Harlow?

165
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:12,898
She's still in your head, isn't she?

166
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:18,204
Jesus, Nick.

167
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:10,662
Hey.

168
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:13,118
Why are we up here?
Why don't you come down?

169
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:17,726
Just, uh... can we talk for second?

170
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,211
- Sure.
- Come here.

171
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:25,866
Oh, man.

172
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,934
These hands are cold, huh?

173
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,931
People are gonna be saying things about me,

174
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:38,618
and I don't care.

175
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:43,506
I just care that you know
that they're not true.

176
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:47,212
I need you to believe me, okay?

177
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:50,822
- I believe you.
- Good.

178
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:53,472
- Good.
- Mom, what's wrong?

179
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,025
Baby, it's hard to explain
and I don't have enough time.

180
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,026
So if you ever hear anything
that makes you question things,

181
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,729
you just ask your dad.

182
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:05,081
I trust him and you can too, all right?

183
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:07,173
- Okay.
- Okay. I love you.

184
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,464
Do you love me?

185
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:10,465
You do? Huh? Okay, come here.

186
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,958
Hey.

187
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:18,761
- Go sit downstairs with your friends.
- Okay.

188
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:23,108
Bye.

189
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:31,069
Have you lost your mind,
showing up here,

190
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,663
putting Flynn in danger, all these kids?

191
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,004
I have the right to see him.

192
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,378
I'm sick of trying to make
this nightmare lovable for everyone.

193
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:40,545
- Leave, or I'll call the police.
- Flynn is my son.

194
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:41,819
You don't deserve him.

195
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,688
You're hurting him.

196
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,241
You hurt everyone around you
and you don't care.

197
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,997
Yes, police.

198
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,448
Mom, please, don't do it!

199
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:53,628
Mom, what's happening?

200
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,586
<i>The police do not want the public
to approach the fugitive.</i>

201
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,506
<i>Call the hotline number
at the bottom of your screen.</i>

202
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:07,146
Shut it off, dammit!
You got it all wrong.

203
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,346
Emily is innocent. I'd bet my life on it.

204
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,340
Help me find her.

205
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:17,506
The sooner we'll bring her in,
the sooner we'll clear off the charges.

206
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,421
Myself... I like Emily.

207
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:23,061
I wanna see her get a fair shake.

208
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:25,506
Cut that crap, I know what you're up to.

209
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,798
I was making collars
when you were in diapers.

210
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:28,876
Then you know.

211
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:32,293
The longer she's out there,
the more the situation escalades...

212
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:35,106
and the less chance we have
of bringing her in safe.

213
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,833
You could help your daughter.

214
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,066
She hasn't come by.

215
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:42,476
I called a few times, didn't hear back.

216
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:49,825
Any family outside of
Boston? Old friends?

217
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:51,025
Who's gonna take her in?

218
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,657
You got the whole damn
media all worked up.

219
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,742
Making her out to be a crazed killer.

220
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,568
Nobody's gonna help my little girl.

221
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,306
- I understand how you feel.
- You understand dick!

222
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:05,705
- Hello?
- Dad.

223
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,866
Josie... how are you doing?

224
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,946
You can't talk, I get it. Um...

225
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:12,577
I'm hanging in there.

226
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,706
You ready for the polka dance contest?

227
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:17,263
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

228
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:18,514
<i>There are people that are
working against me.</i>

229
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:21,666
And I think I've figured out a way

230
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,498
out of all of this,
except it's dangerous.

231
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,376
And, um...

232
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,967
It might make things worse.

233
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:31,514
But I think it's my only chance.

234
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,626
Do it. I've always believed in you.

235
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,249
You've already got the moves,
I trust you know how to use them.

236
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,705
Thanks.

237
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:43,779
I needed to hear that.
I just... I needed...

238
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,121
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

239
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:49,666
I gotta go. Take care.

240
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,131
Who was that on the phone?

241
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:55,266
Josie.

242
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:57,766
You know...

243
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:01,153
For a guy who's little girl is on the run,

244
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:03,739
you sound damn good.

245
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,767
Anything else, Detective?

246
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:10,580
Not today.

247
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,676
Thank you.

248
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,032
Asshole.

249
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,186
- Nick...
- Just a minute.

250
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,729
- We need to talk.
- Oh, yeah? Okay.

251
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,889
I'm going for a run.

252
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,545
Why later? Why not now?

253
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,266
Because I just need to...
to clear my head.

254
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,777
You said you needed me
to get through this.

255
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,312
You're not acting like it.

256
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:58,414
Why are you shutting me out?

257
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:04,628
You're just ignoring me now?

258
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,260
I have to go, Alice.

259
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:28,545
Don't move!

260
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,742
Emily, why don't you put the knife down?

261
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,500
You reach for it and
I will slit your throat.

262
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:36,047
Hands up.

263
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:38,705
Up.

264
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:47,901
Drive.

265
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:49,790
- Where to?
- Just drive.

266
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:24,786
Where are you?

267
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:26,416
With Radford.

268
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,858
I'm taking him somewhere we can talk.

269
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,786
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say you're with Radford?

270
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:34,126
I've got him under control.

271
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,515
Listen. Listen to me, Emily.

272
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,226
<i>Very carefully, listen to me...</i>

273
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,403
<i>because your life
literally depends on it.</i>

274
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,733
You've abducted...

275
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:50,396
the special agent in charge
of the Boston field office.

276
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,266
Just like he abducted me.

277
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:55,218
No, no. No, no.
He's the dirty agent, no question.

278
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,985
<i>Do I think he killed Harlow? Maybe.</i>

279
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:01,266
<i>But the cabin...</i>

280
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:04,203
it doesn't add up.

281
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:05,746
Think about it.

282
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:08,384
He's gonna confess, you'll see.

283
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:10,946
After I do to him
a bit of what he did to me.

284
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:13,986
How could I get through you? Do you...

285
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:18,053
Do you want Flynn to see you
shot dead by SWAT on TV?

286
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:20,962
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

287
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:22,946
I just want this to end.

288
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:24,426
Enough. Enough!

289
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,397
Emily...

290
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,187
<i>turn around.</i>

291
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:30,866
<i>Come back.</i>

292
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:33,944
<i>Please, Em. I'm begging you,
this is not the way.</i>

293
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:37,929
No.

294
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:47,705
Shit. Shit.

295
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,064
<i>Your call has been forwarded to</i>

296
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,073
- <i>an automated voice messaging system.</i>
- Come on. Come on, now!

297
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:57,940
- <i>At the tone, please record your message.</i>
- Goddammit!

298
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,076
<i>- Where are you?

299

300

324
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,997
<i>Just like he abducted...</i>

325
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,825
<i>How could I get through you?</i>

326
00:27:57,935 --> 00:27:59,261
<i>...the Boston field office.</i>

327
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:01,167
<i>Just like he abducted me.</i>

328
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:04,018
<i>No, no. No, no.
He's the dirty agent, no question.</i>

329
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:06,607
<i>Do I think he killed Harlow? Maybe.
But the cabin...</i>

330
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:23,727
Adam missed a diner appointment
with the Deputy Director.

331
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:27,327
No phone call, no email apology.
Nothing. Very unlike him.

332
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:29,982
So I tried tracking him down,
came up empty.

333
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:32,063
That's when I called on Detective Gibbs.

334
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,625
We determined Radford went to
the driving range this evening...

335
00:28:36,985 --> 00:28:39,745
but his car wasn't in the lot.

336
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:41,611
Here's why.

337
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,049
That's Emily Byrne.

338
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:48,509
She tampered with a
couple of the lights.

339
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,434
She was picked up by a
traffic cam on I-93,

340
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,478
driving the junker parked
next to Radford's car.

341
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:57,578
By the time security
realised the lights were out,

342
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:01,265
she was out of there... with Radford.

343
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,742
Now we have zero leads
on where they might be headed,

344
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,023
We need to generate some and fast.

345
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:08,945
Exhaust every avenue you have.

346
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:13,494
I was in her corner too...

347
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:16,948
until she screwed me over.

348
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:39,196
Look familiar?

349
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:46,504
This is where I was abducted...

350
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,958
the night that I followed
the lead on Harlow,

351
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:51,796
the night that you didn't back me up.

352
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:58,196
You took them off, didn't you?

353
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,771
You set me up.

354
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:06,222
You're going to admit to what you did.

355
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:08,136
It's the only way
you're getting out of here.

356
00:30:14,474 --> 00:30:15,985
What do you think I did to you?

357
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:18,745
Why did you do it, Adam?
Why did you take me?

358
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:20,505
I need to know!

359
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,720
Emily, I wasn't there.

360
00:30:23,784 --> 00:30:25,293
Why did you let me go?

361
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,708
Are you framing me?
Is this some kind of a sick game?

362
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:31,958
You're the sick one here,
you're delusional.

363
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:35,995
You're not thinking straight.

364
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:43,105
This is our new game.

365
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:53,658
<i>...Boston field office.</i>

366
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:55,462

00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,145

<i>No, no. No, no. He's the dirty...</i>

<i>...Boston field office.</i>

_

376
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:25,862
- Yeah.
- Before you hang up...

377
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:29,047
What number is this?

378
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:30,958
I'm calling from a burner.
Protecting my life.

379
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,435
- What?
- <i>Never mind. I'm onto something.</i>

380
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,904
I think I know where Emily is.

381
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,271
<i>I'm supposed to believe you?</i>

382
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,536
She called me. She said she had Radford.

383
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:42,150
Any reason you're not sharing this
with your own people?

384
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,869
Yeah, um, my work situation is...

385
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:46,260
Yeah... I know.

386
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:47,746
<i>I need your help.</i>

387
00:32:48,194 --> 00:32:51,730
Gibbs, I'm the only lead you have.

388
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:54,579
Yeah...

389
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,240
We can leave anytime you want,
if you just answer my question.

390
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:06,599
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

391
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,066
You did something to me.
I know. It changed me.

392
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:21,446
You're insane. You kidnapped yourself!

393
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,745
You and Harlow were partners, admit it!

394
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:30,769
No... You were my partner.

395
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:47,666
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay...

396
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:52,546
I got Regina to lie.

397
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,625
I got her to call the cops,

398
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,508
and say you were with Semerov.

399
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,889
I didn't know what you
remembered or what you didn't.

400
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,227
You poor bastard!

401
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:06,542
The whole time that
I was working the Semerov case

402
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:08,073
you kept him one step ahead!

403
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:09,843
He cut me in.

404
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,342
Regina laundered the money.

405
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:15,053
Why did you kill him?

406
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,217
Was it 'cause he was gonna cut you out?

407
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:18,858
I didn't kill Semerov.

408
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,795
You killed him and then
you put my DNA on him!

409
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:23,464
No. No. I swear.

410
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:26,326
Then who? Who planted my DNA?

411
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:28,178
I don't know!

412
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:31,665
The lab found your DNA on his body.

413
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:34,319
I thought for sure... it was you.

414
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,261
I thought I was helping
put a murderer in jail.

415
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,305
You're the murderer.

416
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:53,625
I saw the journal!

417
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:56,481
I saw the eye with blood on it.

418
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,021
I had visions, Adam!

419
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,277
I want to know why.

420
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:03,170
Why you have my visions in your journal?

421
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,473
You wanna know why
I drew the bleeding eye?

422
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:10,444
What do you think I did
after you vanished?

423
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:12,345
I looked for you.

424
00:35:12,897 --> 00:35:14,184
Bullshit.

425
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,780
I was troubling you,
you were glad that I was gone.

426
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,810
No. No. It wasn't like that.

427
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,353
I knew Harlow was involved, somehow,

428
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:26,478
but I stayed on your case.

429
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:30,130
The bleeding eye was the only clue

430
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,139
I could never made sense of.

431
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,653
It haunted me. It still haunts me.

432
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,140
That's why it's in my journal.

433
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,260
I don't understand.

434
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:44,445
Before we arrested him,

435
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:47,580
I was trailing him. And he made a call.

436
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,710
I don't know who he was talking to...

437
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,986
but he said something
and it's stuck in my mind.

438
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:56,667
He said: "I'll meet you
at the Bleeding Eye".

439
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,969
It's not a person, Emily. It's a place.

440
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,619
A place?

441
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,487
What do you know about it?

442
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,260
I don't know.

443
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,900
I just keep seeing it
ever since I came back.

444
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,778
If you're seeing the bleeding eye,
it means you've been there.

445
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:33,176
Maybe whoever had you took you there.

446
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:35,613
Or maybe your...

447
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:38,363
your mind made it into a vision.

448
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:40,589
Think about it.

449
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,388
It wasn't you...

450
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:54,907
And it wasn't me.

451
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,894
Then, there's somebody else out there.

452
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:04,324
They know where the Bleeding Eye is.

453
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:15,316
All right.

454
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,974
Adam!

455
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,046
Adam!

456
00:37:52,457 --> 00:37:54,078
Here!

457
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:58,063
Give yourself up.

458
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:00,954
I can't.

459
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,460
Here!

460
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:10,552
Come on!

461
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:12,914
I'm here!

462
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:16,799
No, no, no. No, no.

463
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,219
- You okay, man?
- Yeah. You?

464
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,676
All right.

465
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
***.

466
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,699
Nick. Wait, Nick. Nick! Nick!

467
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,519
Emily!

468
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,940
Shots fired.

469
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,386
Agent down.

470
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,820
Yeah.

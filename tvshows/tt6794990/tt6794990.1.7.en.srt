<i>Previously on "Absentia"...</i>

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:05,631
Conrad Harlow, killed that
fed, Emily Byrne, a while back.

3
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:08,169
- You still think he had a partner?
- I think he had a partner,

4
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,600
and I think that partner
killed Semerov too.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,144
He's going to hurt you,
he's going to hurt Flynn.

6
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:14,993
Running makes you look guilty as hell.

7
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:16,929
I'm gonna solve this.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,462
I lost my license.

9
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:24,641
I'm selling medical supplies now.

10
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:28,715
It's been... two years,
two months, and...

11
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:32,622
23 days, so, I'm... I'm good.

12
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:35,944
- Alice, what is this?
- I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,920
Our whole life together,
it's just a consolation, isn't it?

14
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,907
I'm going to my sister's.

15
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:53,590
Stand by, we're
receiving body cam footage

16
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:55,795
<i>from the Nottingham Park gravesite.</i>

17
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:03,023
We need to talk about Jack.

18
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,767
- He always been violent?
- I don't judge.

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,655
Did he ever take you out
to a cabin on I95?

20
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,860
Emily Byrne is here!

21
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:22,364
Jack, I'm hurt.

22
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:25,639
<i>I just want to see you one more time.</i>

23
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,160
Jack...

24
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,260
Please.

25
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:01,094
<i>The FBI in tandem with Boston Police
and New Hampshire State Police</i>

26
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,436
<i>recovered six bodies from a
wooded area in New Hampshire.</i>

27
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:07,756
<i>Remains are in advanced
stages of decomposition.</i>

28
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:10,859
<i>The identities of the victims will
be released pending DNA results.</i>

29
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,185
<i>Is Emily Byrne connected
to these bodies?</i>

30
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:17,320
<i>No comment.</i>

31
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,863
<i>My source tells me that Emily
Byrne lead you to the mass grave.</i>

32
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:21,685
<i>Is this part of the killing spree?</i>

33
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,775
<i>Miss Byrne is wanted for the murder
of Special Agent Adam Radford.</i>

34
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:32,438
There is a $250,000 reward being offered

35
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,414
in connection with that murder.

36
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,790
- That concludes the questions. Now...
- Detective Gibbs,

37
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,791
what about the shooting last night?

38
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,520
Any truth to reports Byrne
is involved, fatally wounded?

39
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,575
- No comment.
- What's your working theory

40
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:45,352
- on why she came back to Boston?
- No comment on Emily Byrne,

41
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,160
no matter how many times you ask.

42
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,360
Thank you.

43
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:47,909
Where are we?

44
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:50,800
We're in a motel.

45
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,787
I got the bullet out.

46
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,643
Stitched you up. There's
no major internal damage.

47
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,065
I spoke to Violet.

48
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:09,416
I know you've been asking about me.

49
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:12,434
Why?

50
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:20,748
I saw some stuff on your computer.

51
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:23,056
What stuff?

52
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,461
There were videos of
women being tortured.

53
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:33,608
- My private life is none of your business.
- Water...

54
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:35,908
- drowning...
- You know, the whole world

55
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,753
- thinks you're a serial killer.
- Folders with girls' names,

56
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:40,744
all flowers.

57
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,056
What exactly are you accusing me of?

58
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:51,526
- Did you do it?
- Did I do what?

59
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,430
What? You think I had anything
to do with your kidnapping?

60
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:57,216
- I'm not sure.
- You're not sure?

61
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,951
What about the absences
when I went away?

62
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,694
I was in rehab!

63
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,096
Twice!

64
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:07,016
Trying to dig myself out of the
whole I fell in after you were taken.

65
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,894
The only way I could deal
with my life turning to shit!

66
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,095
- I didn't realize it.
- No, of course you didn't!

67
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,055
And what about some
fucking gratitude?

68
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:22,026
I could have left you to die out there,

69
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:24,056
- I could have turned you in.
- And why didn't you?

70
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:36,315
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

71
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:39,692
You broke into my apartment,
you snooped around on my computer,

72
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:42,251
you followed me, you
had people ask about me.

73
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,834
I didn't break into your
apartment just to spy on you.

74
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:45,982
- I swear.
- Then why did you?

75
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,556
- I just... I needed your help.
- With what?

76
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:53,004
I had... I had something
in my hand at the cemetery.

77
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,375
I was trying to...

78
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,355
Was it this?

79
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:03,856
- Yeah.
- A pacemaker?

80
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,352
- I found that on a dead body.
- A dead body?

81
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,422
That's what I needed your help for.

82
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,604
That's the key to finding
who had me, Jack.

83
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:12,066
I need your help, please.

84
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,130
You know?

85
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:22,245
I could go to jail for what I've
already done for you so far, Em,

86
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:24,238
so, if I'm gonna break
any more laws for you,

87
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,918
you better start telling
me the whole truth.

88
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,399
- I am telling you the whole... truth.
- Bullshit!

89
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:31,936
What about the others? Who are they?

90
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,621
- What others?
- They found six bodies

91
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,105
in those woods, Em. Six!

92
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,355
And you knew they were there. How?!

93
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,616
What did you do to them?

94
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:52,776
What's going on? Stop!

95
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:56,354
Get up. Flynn, get up. What's going on?

96
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:58,640
- Flynn!
- He said Mom's a killer!

97
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:01,175
- He said Mom's dead.
- And you're just like her, freak!

98
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,714
- Get away from me!
- The cops are gonna get her

99
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:04,895
- and put a bullet in her head!
- Get outta here!

100
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:06,658
What's going on?

101
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:08,274
- Leave me alone!
- Hey, Flynn!

102
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,278
- Hey!
- Flynn Durand, downstairs!

103
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:13,972
Kitchen, now!

104
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,416
Sit there.

105
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,806
Let me clean that scrape.

106
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:33,210
How's Mom?

107
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,883
As soon as the police hear
anything they'll tell your father.

108
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,991
In the meantime, we need to stay calm.

109
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,575
- And hope that she's okay.
- I know Mom's alive!

110
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,376
Everyone said she was dead before.

111
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:45,723
But they were wrong.

112
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:47,600
She'll come back this time too.

113
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,479
Yeah, well, that's...

114
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:54,857
- that's what we're praying for.
- You don't believe it either,

115
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:56,739
all the stuff they're saying about her.

116
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:01,923
No.

117
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,903
No, I... I know her.

118
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:06,952
She's a good person.

119
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,416
And she's a good mother.
She wouldn't do anything

120
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:13,519
that would hurt her
chances of being with you.

121
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:17,961
Okay? Come.

122
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,043
I know things are tough now, okay?

123
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:24,097
And I know they're
confusing, but, I love you.

124
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,356
We all love you.

125
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:29,292
We're gonna figure it out.

126
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,186
Okay?

127
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,730
Go change your clothes, honey.

128
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,175
Come home.

129
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:56,776
Please.

130
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,496
For Flynn's sake, for...

131
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:03,536
for my sake.

132
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,794
- We need to be together now.
- No.

133
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:12,976
I meant what I said.

134
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,747
End this, Nick...

135
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,466
and then we'll talk about the future.

136
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:32,449
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

137
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:34,869
So let's say I get all of
that, which... I don't.

138
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,062
The visions, the body, all of it...
How does the pacemaker fit in?

139
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,364
Whoever is tied to the pacemaker...

140
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:45,041
is someone who is connected to
my childhood and to my captive.

141
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,815
But, you don't have any
proof of that, Em.

142
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:50,181
That's why I needed you to track down
the name, you understand?

143
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:52,476
It's all connected.

144
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,885
- Harlow, the tree, Barrett House...
- None of this is making any sense, Em.

145
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,926
- Then help me make sense.
- I'm trying!

146
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:02,736
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

147
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,072
- Let me see.
- No.

148
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:05,456
Let me see.

149
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,056
Come on, move your arm.

150
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,989
Yeah, okay. I'm gonna
need to redress this.

151
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:14,469
You're gonna have to lay down.

152
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,779
- Okay.
- Okay?

153
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:17,096
- Yeah.
- I got you.

154
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,493
I got you.

155
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,162
All right.

156
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,682
Yeah.

157
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,151
Jack.

158
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:45,856
Thank you.

159
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,190
Em,

160
00:11:57,713 --> 00:12:00,190
I sent the cops to those woods.

161
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:05,353
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to,
it was an accident, it just...

162
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,575
It's okay.

163
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,536
I'll get you the name.

164
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,543
But first let me get you the gauze.

165
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:34,935
So, Emily's been investigating
Semerov all those years...

166
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:37,175
and now Jack is connected
to one of his girls?

167
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:39,720
I don't like it.

168
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,320
Maybe Emily doesn't like it either.

169
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:43,712
Because she thinks he's the one
who had her in the cabin.

170
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,536
The question is "do we"?

171
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,380
Two days ago I would have said "yes".

172
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:52,034
You know, it was a person of interest.

173
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,343
But now, going AWOL like this,

174
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,214
knowing that we have his laptop,

175
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:58,902
digging around his
Dungeon Porn collection...

176
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,643
I'm liking him for this.

177
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,002
Then, let's step up our game

178
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:05,024
and find him, or Emily,
either one, Tommy.

179
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,220
You saw the blood in the alleyway.

180
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,885
- She couldn't have gone far without...
- We're looking everywhere.

181
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:12,813
The FBI hotline is definitely
not helping this.

182
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,920
We got like a hundred
bogus tips an hour.

183
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:18,058
This reward, it's killing us.
She's a walking lotto.

184
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,693
But look, Tommy, I think
we're missing something here.

185
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,004
She needs medical attention.

186
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:24,930
Jack Byrne used to be a doctor.

187
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:26,126
Yeah.

188
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:30,008
Yeah!

189
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,371
Em.

190
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,208
I just got his.

191
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,747
What should I do?

192
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,727
- Call him.
- Yeah.

193
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,376
Use a burner. Keep it under 2 minutes.

194
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:53,008
And then we have
to power it off right after.

195
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:56,334
See if you can find anything out
about the bodies too.

196
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:01,952
Okay, it's ringing.

197
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:09,811
<i>Agent Durand.</i>

198
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,906
Nick. Hey, it's Jack.
Um, did you find her?

199
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,259
<i>Yeah. Um, no.</i>

200
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:17,227
<i>No, we didn't get her.</i>

201
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:19,596
<i>Thanks for calling back so fast.
What number is this?</i>

202
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,324
I got a new phone.

203
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:23,192
The damn reporters kept calling me.

204
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:25,879
Um, so what's going on? I saw the news.

205
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,341
All those bodies in the woods,
I mean... Jesus.

206
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,825
<i>Yeah. Look, um... she was shot.</i>

207
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,475
<i>She might need medical attention.</i>

208
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,358
<i>She might... she might reach out to you.</i>

209
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,874
Well, if she does I'll call you.

210
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:38,061
<i>Yeah, thanks. Are you at home now?</i>

211
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:39,823
Yeah, why?

212
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,430
<i>Gotta I swing by in a bit,</i>

213
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:43,352
<i>talk about some things that
could help with the case.</i>

214
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,730
<i>I'm headed in the direction anyway.</i>

215
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:47,936
<i>Alice took Flynn to
Mora's for a few days.</i>

216
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:52,747
Yeah, sure. But if I'm not there,
then I'm running some errands.

217
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:55,566
<i>Thanks, Jack. Wow, this is, um...</i>

218
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:58,050
- <i>it's a mess. I don't really...</i>
- Nick, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

219
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,925
<i>Yeah, well, listen, I need to...</i>

220
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:03,112
Is that okay?

221
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:05,714
Great.

222
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:12,739
<i>Sorry, he was using a burner
and the call was too short.</i>

223
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:15,496
Well, we've caught him in a lie.
He said he was home.

224
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:18,008
We've got uniforms
there now. It's empty.

225
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:20,536
<i>I'm sending you a file from our
techs, you wanna read it ASAP.</i>

226
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,842
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

227
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:27,045
You two are brothersinlaw,
you never got a vibe off Jack?

228
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:29,909
Never. He was a doctor. Ivy League.

229
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:32,461
It's not like if we went to
barbecues and ball game together.

230
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,294
He and Emily were never close.

231
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,990
Just when Jack Byrne was
starting to look like our guy.

232
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:43,050
Our techs just went through the
hard drives at Semerov's club.

233
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:44,888
Jack was listed as a customer.

234
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,378
And his payments sync up perfectly

235
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:48,394
with those withdrawals
from the secret account.

236
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,480
He never used the money
to fund the cabin setup.

237
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,391
Well, we don't know if she knows that.

238
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,666
She's with him, I'm telling you.
I could tell it by his voice.

239
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,969
She could've snatched him up
thinking he was the one.

240
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,349
We gotta find them.

241
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:11,496
- Hey.
- Hey.

242
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,736
Come and check this out. I found a name.

243
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:17,541
- Okay. You go.
- You were right, there is a connection.

244
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:26,663
Doctor LuFang Shen, MIT.
Behavioral scientist.

245
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:30,614
- The name means nothing to me.
- Here, look at the next tab. Here.

246
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:35,768
My God. Barrett House.

247
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,576
Yeah, your orphanage.

248
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:40,754
Dr. Shen was administrator there.
He started there after you left.

249
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:44,349
Went missing 16 years ago,
was declared dead after 10.

250
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:47,332
Okay, we gotta find someone
we can talk to.

251
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,157
There. He's got a brother.

252
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,692
Erik Shen.

253
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:59,625
Owns a restaurant in Chinatown and...

254
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:01,351
still open.

255
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,056
What did the hotel do with my stuff?

256
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,198
Dad didn't have room,
it's in the truck of my car.

257
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:09,664
- Can you get me a duffle bag?
- Yeah, of course.

258
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,207
Excuse me,

259
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:51,537
is Mr. Shen here?

260
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,194
- Just a moment.
- Thank you.

261
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,413
Erik Shen?

262
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,084
Yeah.

263
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,396
I'm...

264
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,505
Special Agent Parker, FBI.

265
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,123
I was hoping to discuss
your brother's disappearance.

266
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:41,995
That was many years ago.
I have no interest in discussing it.

267
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:44,059
We have a new lead.

268
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,574
No, I'm sorry.

269
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:48,949
This is behind me.
I don't need to know anything.

270
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:51,676
Somebody came forward.

271
00:19:57,903 --> 00:19:59,332
Mama!

272
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,979
I don't remember much
about LuFang's work.

273
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:17,544
Only that... it was controversial.

274
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:20,076
He said that was why MIT dismissed him.

275
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:23,396
Yeah, but the orphanage job
just seems like an odd choice.

276
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:26,516
I never understood that move.

277
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,406
But the work gave him purpose.

278
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,461
It gave him joy working
with those children.

279
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:38,405
Did he ever talk to you about his work?

280
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:41,590
No. But he was always
with those children.

281
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,532
Either there, or he would
sign them out on weekends,

282
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,120
take them to museums,
zoo, planetarium...

283
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:50,782
Was he married?

284
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:54,634
Any kind of romantic relationships?

285
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,193
He was married for a short time.

286
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:00,793
His wife died.

287
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:04,185
I never really got to know her.

288
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:11,605
LuFang was... always a bit strange.

289
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:21,424
Did you keep any of his things?

290
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:27,484
In his will he left all his research
to the Boston Athenæum.

291
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:34,334
But my wife never got around to it.

292
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:39,938
It's in storage. I can give you the key.

293
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,235
Thank you.

294
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,572
My name's Jack and I'm an alcoholic.

295
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,314
Hello, Jack.

296
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:53,281
I'm here because my...

297
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:56,373
friend had a medical emergency,

298
00:21:57,077 --> 00:22:00,164
and I needed to step up.

299
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:04,986
It's been four years
since I last operated.

300
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:09,206
But it was someone
I care about on my table.

301
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,995
I picked up the scalpel...

302
00:22:13,763 --> 00:22:15,083
all I could think was...

303
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,276
I can't do this.

304
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:22,116
I can't do this.

305
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,036
I can't do this.

306
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,596
"I need a shot", you know.

307
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:42,481
"You know, a shot will calm
my nerves and if..."

308
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,816
and if one is good, then
two's better, right?

309
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:46,536
"I'll be steady as a rock."

310
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,110
But then I remembered

311
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:57,561
why I lost my license
in the first place.

312
00:23:01,995 --> 00:23:03,774
I stepped up.

313
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:05,470
I didn't take the drink.

314
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,864
Okay.

315
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:14,872
And I saved someone I care about.

316
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:53,954
I felt like I've been given
a second chance.

317
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:09,808
This is the first day of my sobriety.

318
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:24,476
Jack Byrne.

319
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:27,476
What's this about?

320
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:29,493
I need you to come with me.

321
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,739
<i>You've been given placebos</i>

322
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,255
<i>that informed the side effects but...</i>

323
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:34,916
<i>The final phase will use
two subjects, A and B.</i>

324
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:04,114
<i>Get inside the tank.</i>

325
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:06,901
<i>No, I don't want to.</i>

326
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:10,621
<i>But one of you must do
the experiment today.</i>

327
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:13,023
<i>- Who will it be?
- Nobody.</i>

328
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:15,796
<i>Someone must.</i>

329
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:18,167
<i>You may choose.</i>

330
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:20,128
<i>Why? What did we do wrong?</i>

331
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:23,372
<i>Nothing. This is special work.</i>

332
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:26,659
<i>You are part of something very special.</i>

333
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:31,842
<i>- We wanna leave.
- Okay. Then, I will choose.</i>

334
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:35,165
<i>No, please! Don't make me!</i>

335
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,907
<i>Don't! God, don't make me! Please!</i>

336
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:39,235
<i>Don't make me!</i>

337
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:42,826
<i>Don't make me, Dr. Shen!</i>

338
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,967
We know you came to your sister's aid.

339
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,389
<i>Her blood was in your car.</i>

340
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:55,354
<i>Nice try.</i>

341
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:59,563
There's no proof when
she was in my client's car.

342
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,345
Here's what I'm trying
to understand, Jack...

343
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,237
you helped us track her down,

344
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:07,947
now you're willing to
go to jail for her?

345
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:12,236
What changed?

346
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,161
Look, I get it. I get it.

347
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:19,996
She got shot, this was life and death...

348
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:22,597
The kind of thing you put
differences aside for.

349
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:24,472
That's why you helped her.

350
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,552
Work with me here a little bit.

351
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:31,436
I don't know what you're talking about.

352
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:03,884
She almost got away from
us, thought we lost her.

353
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,310
How long do we have to hold her?

354
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,110
We have to find a cop, bring her in,

355
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:13,829
get that reward money.

356
00:30:13,894 --> 00:30:15,800
Okay. Okay.

357
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:20,549
You couldn't have done it without me.

358
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:22,596
I killed 6 people, maybe more!

359
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:29,904
- Yeah? Fuck you and your van!
- And fuck you too!

360
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,329
- What did you say?
- Nothing. Nothing.

361
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:35,529
Let's move forward.

362
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:38,997
Hey, you heard that?

363
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:41,328
- Hear what?
- Stop the car.

364
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,225
- Are you hearing...?
- Shh!

365
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:04,505
Fuck off!

366
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,502
Come on, man. Let's get our money
before she wakes up.

367
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:18,080
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!
- All right. I'm going. I'm going.

368
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:49,783
Damn it! Front light's off.!

369
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:52,286
Look at the road,
you're gonna get us killed!

370
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:54,080
I don't want to die before I get rich!

371
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,440
- Come on, let me drive.
- No fucking way, it's my ride!

372
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,618
My God. Are you all right?

373
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,953
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Hey, my car!

374
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:09,408
She stole my car!

375
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,337
She stole my car!

376
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:12,544
Shit!

377
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,653
You tied her, man!

378
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,174
If he gets us something,
he can walk out of here.

379
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:56,441
How did she contact you?

380
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,281
When did you pick her up?

381
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:06,330
Did she say anything about those woods?

382
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:09,036
Those bodies, those graves?

383
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,053
Come on.

384
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,492
We found six bodies over there, Jack.

385
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,111
She didn't do it.

386
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:23,161
Did you?

387
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,980
What?

388
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:28,276
Let's see...

389
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:35,311
Then you're fired from the
hospital, secret bank account,

390
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,551
connections to Semerov...

391
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,199
Think I don't know what
you're doing here?

392
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,940
You think I can't see through this?

393
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,738
You're trying to pump me for
information, then you are just gonna...

394
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:46,871
twist it and turn it,

395
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:49,931
and use it however you want
against her. So, no.

396
00:33:51,221 --> 00:33:53,021
I have nothing for you.

397
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,485
And I got these for you.

398
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,001
<i>Jack Byrne,</i>

399
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:15,828
<i>you're under arrest for
harboring a wanted fugitive.</i>

400
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:02,607
How is your boy?

401
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:06,510
He's confused about Emily.
I don't know what to tell him.

402
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:12,869
- They're resilient.
- Yeah.

403
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,479
Maybe all the signs were there,

404
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:17,689
and I just missed them, you know.

405
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:19,840
What signs?

406
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:22,011
The way she would get...

407
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:28,296
when she wanted something
and she didn't... get it.

408
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:31,423
She'd snap.

409
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,089
Well, now you're describing my exwife.

410
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,687
Wife number one, two or three?

411
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:39,648
Touché.

412
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,732
<i>How did it make you feel?</i>

413
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:42,594
<i>I couldn't breathe.
I was swallowing water.</i>

414
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:45,930
<i>I thought I was gonna die.
Why are you doing this to us?</i>

415
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:49,541
<i>To see how you adapt
your surroundings over time.</i>

416
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,939
<i>I hate it!</i>

417
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:53,801
<i>The only way to stop it,</i>

418
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:56,231
<i>is to do the experiment on someone else.</i>

419
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,738
<i>That means you will be in charge
of adding the water to the tank.</i>

420
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,681
<i>No, no, please! Please, no!</i>

421
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:07,961
<i>Please don't do this to me.
I don't want to do this. Please!</i>

422
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,206
<i>I don't want to do this!</i>

423
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:13,104
<i>I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!</i>

424
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:19,188
<i>Easy! Easy, Charles!</i>

425
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:21,276
<i>I hate you!</i>

426
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:29,321
<i>I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!</i>

427
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:35,232
<i>Easy! Easy, Charles!</i>

428
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,634
Cut it out, Charles!

429
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:09,113
<i>Hi, this is Alice. Leave a message.</i>

430
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:13,199
Hey... hey it's me, um...

431
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,745
Give me a call back when
you get this. It's...

432
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,388
I just wanted to give a heads
up, I'm on my way over.

433
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,148
I won't stay long.

434
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:22,877
Goodbye.

435
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:07,807
Alice!

436
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:51,325
<i>Hey, baby. It's me.</i>

437
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:55,721
<i>I just wanted to call
to tell you that, um...</i>

438
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:59,111
<i>I'm still alive and...</i>

439
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:02,492
<i>I love you.</i>

440
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:08,296
<i>And we'll be together soon, okay?</i>

1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,256
- They're double-crossing rats.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,091
- Hmm,
and what are they up to?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,134
- I don't know.

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,094
It can't be good if you
didn't okay the meeting.

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,097
- I know what is, Anttwon.
- Then put it to them.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,057
You're not handling
our business, Ty.

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,726
You're all caught up
in this crap.

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,228
- This crap is where
we're going.

9
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,938
I can do this and take care
of a couple rats.

10
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,440
Now go get busy.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,074

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,245
- What you gonna do to them?

13
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,377
- Don't worry about it.

14
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,131
- Remember when we were kids,

15
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,467
when we'd go up
and see the Nines,

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,635
talk about how we was
gonna take on the world.

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,095
- We're getting there, Cleo.

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,264
- The crew isn't feeling it.

19
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,932
You need to show them
some.

20
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,479
- I know what I have to do.

21
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:20,413
- It's against the east wall,
near the corner, here.

22
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,707
There's always at least two
guards in the room,

23
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,336
and two more
here and here.

24
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,838
- All right, then we're gonna
need at least

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,581
- Well, yesterday, I took
some doctors into a village

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,583
to vaccinate kids.

27
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,711
I was scared, but we explained
what the medicine was for,

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,339
and then the parents
gave us permission to do it.

29
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,049
It was a good day.

30
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,176
The kids were afraid...
- Was this Marilou's idea?

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,721
- No.
Tali asked. And asked.

32
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,390
- She hasn't watched those
in years.

33
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,976
- Neither have you.

34
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,437
- Mommy,
I want you to come home.

35
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,022
- I know, sweetie.

36
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,066
I'll be with you on Christmas.

37
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,110
Two whole weeks!

38
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,028
- I can't wait.

39
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,072
I've got to run.

40
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,332
I love you this much.

41
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,546
- Can you feel it?

42
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,008
- Love you, Mommy.

43
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,718
- I love you.

44
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,930
- She was so pretty.
- Yes.

45
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,267
And when I look into
your precious little face,

46
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,895
I see all her beauty in you.

47
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:14,611
- Grandma,
if she loved me so much,

48
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,113
why'd she go to a place
so dangerous?

49
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,952
- Well, I have to think
about that one.

50
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,954
In the meantime,

51
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,291
let's go see if the chickens
have any eggs for us, okay?

52
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,090
- Tyrone Derek Jackson,

53
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,635
leader of the Rolling Sixes
up in the Bronx,

54
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,970
wanted for the murder
of five gang members,

55
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,098
two of his own and three
from the Loco Diablos,

56
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,975
a rival Latin gang.

57
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,478
Gang intel says they might've
been plotting a splinter group

58
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,313
against their own people.

59
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,649
Bottom line,
Ty set off a gang war.

60
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,317
- Still, a beef between
two street gangs...

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,818
- Wait for it.

62
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,321
DEA had an undercover,
Rafael Garcia.

63
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,158
Deceased with one shot from an
AR-15 courtesy of Ty Jackson.

64
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,035
- What's the evidence
on Jackson?

65
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,995
- NYPD has him running
from the crime scene.

66
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,830
They ID'd his
"Top of the World" jacket

67
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,791
and his bike,
which was found abandoned.

68
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,834
- And Jackson,
NYPD can't find him?

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,170
- They've been rounding up his
gang members and working them,

70
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,296
but him, they haven't found.

71
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,006
- Get with gang intel,

72
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,217
sweep up whatever they have on
Jackson's communications,

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,885
start connecting the dots.

74
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,512
We have his home address,
yeah?

75
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,055
- NYPD assured me
they tore the place apart

76
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,473
but found nothing useful.

77
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,183
- Well, we'll see.

78
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,726
Let's stay on our toes.

79
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,020
He's armed with an AR
and who knows what else.

80
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,855
- Local banger.
How far could he get?

81
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,315
We'd be home before dinner.

82
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,984
- Thanks, KC.
You just jinxed it.

83
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,655
- You worked the Bronx
when you were at the NYPD,

84
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,199
you know Jackson?
- No, it's been five years.

85
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,410
A lot of faces come
and go in five years.

86
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,746
Whoever runs the Rolling Sixes
runs that hood.

87
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,083
- And he killed five gangsters
single-handedly.

88
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,168
That's ruthless and daring.

89
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,337
- Not to mention crazy.

90
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,722
They did say
they tore the place apart.

91
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,517
- So Jackson must've been very
popular with our folks in blue.

92
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,022
Check this out.

93
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,399
He was trying to give back
to his community.

94
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,360
- Trying to be Nipsey Hussle
without the credentials.

95
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,075
Oh.
- There you go.

96
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,578
Probably crushing one
of his humanitarian awards.

97
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,714
He has a child.

98
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,591
- Not according to his file.

99
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,052
- Maybe not one he wants
anybody to know about.

100
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,556
Look at the way
he's looking at that boy.

101
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,978
Like a proud dad
on the first day of school.

102
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:01,027
We find the boy,
maybe we find the daddy.

103
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,323
- Ms. Colter.
Can we talk to you?

104
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,283
- I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

105
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,785
I need to get my son to school.

106
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,079
- We'll see that
he gets to school.

107
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,623
- What is going on?
- Just move over here.

108
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,124
- We're looking
for Tyrone Jackson.

109
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,626
- I don't know any
Tyrone Jackson.

110
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,294
- The people at Trenton
Elementary ID'd him

111
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,171
as the father
of your son Anthony.

112
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,964
- Mommy?
- I know.

113
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,133
We call our son
by his middle name, Zach.

114
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,510
Can you go over
to the neighbor's house?

115
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,928
It's two doors down.

116
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,807
Zack, honey, go with these
folks over to Willie's house,

117
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,141
and play with him
for a little while.

118
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,684
- Eyes on the backside.

119
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,812
- Come on, honey.
- Negative in the basement.

120
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,313
- Oh, so sweet.
He's a good kid.

121
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,482
- I don't know where Ty is.

122
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,150
I haven't heard from him
in five days,

123
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,819
but I know he couldn't do
what they're saying.

124
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,321
- You do know he runs
the Rolling Sixes.

125
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,823
- And he's leaving that life.

126
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,658
That's why he set us up here,

127
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,160
so he could do better by his
son than his father did by him.

128
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,830
- Innocent or guilty,
we still need to find him

129
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,498
or he needs to turn himself in.

130
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,833
Where would he hide?
- I don't know.

131
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,793
I don't know his friends
from that life.

132
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,337
- How about girlfriends?

133
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,713
What's her name?

134
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,424
- She means nothing to him.

135
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,843
He's gonna be with us.

136
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,344
If he was gonna
go on the run for good,

137
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,929
he wouldn't leave without
Zach and me.

138
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,430
Now I really need
to get my boy to school.

139
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,349
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

140
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,725
- Listen,
if she means nothing to him,

141
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,435
then she should
mean nothing to you.

142
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,646
So why are you protecting her?
- She's a thug.

143
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,691
Do you know what thugs do
to snitches?

144
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,943
- You have my word, Ms. Colter.

145
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,404
She'll never know
where it came from.

146
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,327
- It's Cleo Wilkens.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,918
- I tried my best with Cleo,

148
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,880
but once she met Ty,
there was no bringing her back.

149
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,549
In high school,
they got together.

150
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,551
Still together
from what I hear.

151
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,053
- Would she hide him
if she could?

152
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,890
- Oh, you bet she would.

153
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,892
I don't know where.

154
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,228
That's what Cleo left behind.
I don't know why I kept it all.

155
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,064
Not like she's
ever coming back.

156
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,733
- Thank you.

157
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,568
- How'd you find me, anyway?

158
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,445
- Old police report on Cleo.

159
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,779
She mouthed off to a cop,

160
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,990
and you were listed
as her guardian.

161
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,368
- That girl's got a mouth.
- Did she draw this?

162
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,205
- When she was eight.

163
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,040
It broke my heart
when she showed it to me.

164
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,418
She said if she was big,
people couldn't hurt her.

165
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,253
- You raised her?

166
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,590
- My worthless son and his
worthless wife, they couldn't.

167
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,092
I mean, the fights,
drugs, booze,

168
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,594
they were in and out of
jail.

169
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,596
it was no place for a child.

170
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,266
- Julius Caesar,
Theodore Roosevelt,

171
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,809
Joan of Arc.

172
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,103
- Yeah, she was
always reading them books.

173
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,232
She said they were people
like her.

174
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,279
- This is dated five years ago.
"The Nine Bridges."

175
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,615
Mean anything to you?
- No.

176
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,951
- "Up here they can't
look down on us,

177
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,702
"standing with
the water under us.

178
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,789
"See all, be all,
right here from on top.

179
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,376
"Up here you and me
can make it all stop.

180
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,002
"From here we can see
the Nines,

181
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,255
Baby they're yours,
and baby, they're mine."

182
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,507
- A rap about a place
where they can see

183
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,801
the nine bridges of the city?

184
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,345
- Cleo wrote this
when she was in high school.

185
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,597
Probably around here somewhere.

186
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,975
Maybe on top of a building?

187
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,476
Maybe somewhere her and Ty

188
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,645
used to go to get away
from everything.

189
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,993
- There's nowhere to hide
up here.

190
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,787
- Building's clear.

191
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,290
- Tallest building
in the neighborhood, check.

192
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,208
Nice view, check.

193
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,337
- Can't see but four bridges.

194
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,509
- The lyrics say, "Standing
with the water under us."

195
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,382
All nine.

196
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,199
- It's a match,
Tyrone Jackson.

197
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,742
- As he lived and breathed.

198
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,869
- Two shots to the chest,
point blank range.

199
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,412
Maybe four, five days ago.

200
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,914
- Then he wasn't
gunning anybody down

201
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,415
two days ago, was he?

202
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,126
- Only one person could've
enticed him up there.

203
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,421
The same person who
killed those five bangers.

204
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,298
- Hello, Cleo Wilkens.

205
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,386
Take this to Jimmy,

206
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,262
tell him to post bond
for Sammy and Shorty and Jojo.

207
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,766
And tell him there's more
coming for Charisse and Anttwon

208
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,142
and whoever else they got.

209
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,602
- Why you ain't just
do it all now?

210
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,104
- Cash flow.

211
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,772
When it's cool,

212
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,816
Ty's gonna lemme know where
the rest of his stashes are.

213
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,068
- Why is he talking to you?
Why he ain't talking to us?

214
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,320
'Cause we his crew.
- You watch the news?

215
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,115
He gotta hide,
and he put me in charge.

216
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,783
So just do what you told.

217
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,955
Cleo Danielle Wilkens,
age 22,

218
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,457
is wanted for the murders
of Ty Jackson,

219
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,293
DEA Agent Rafael Garcia,
and four gang members.

220
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,795
Yes?

221
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,964
- Is it true Ty Jackson
was found dead?

222
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,134
- I can confirm that
Mr. Jackson was shot to death.

223
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,262
We believe these murders
are an attempt by Ms. Wilkens

224
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,432
to take leadership
of Mr. Jackson's gang.

225
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,392
I want to make it
crystal clear

226
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,603
Cleo Wilkens is a menace
to this community,

227
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,149
and to anyone who may be
helping her evade capture.

228
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,650
- You killed Ty?

229
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,986
- Of course I didn't, fool!

230
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,822
Diablos, po-po, who knows?

231
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,825
Why would I kill him?
Hmm?

232
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,493
They're messing with us,

233
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,163
but we gotta keep going,
don't we?

234
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,709
Let me tell you
a little secret about Ty.

235
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,842
He wasn't feeling it
anymore in here.

236
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,677
He was halfway out the door.

237
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,598
Me?
I'm in all the way.

238
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,852
So you with me or against me?

239
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,356
- I got mouths to feed,
and Ty?

240
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,858
He always took care of us.

241
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,152
- Nothing gonna change.

242
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,655
We got big money coming in,
and I got plans.

243
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,242
Jimmy, now.

244
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,505
Could've found
a better picture though.

245
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,719
- Hey Barnes,
this arrest report on Cleo

246
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,054
for assault two years ago,

247
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,555
they must've had
a rookie write the DD-5.

248
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,848
Can you can make
sense of it for me?

249
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,435
- Mm-hmm.
- So you're Barnes?

250
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,022
You worked vice out
of the 4-7?

251
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,357
Gun Hill, Pelham, right?

252
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,733
- That's right.
You?

253
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:41,904
- I was in the 4-9,
the 5-2, bounced around.

254
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,281
Wouldn't give it up
for nothing.

255
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,867
Not like you.

256
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,744
- Like me what?

257
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,913
- Couldn't handle the hustle,
huh?

258
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,541
Had to get one of these
cushy federal jobs?

259
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,417
- Yeah, it's great.

260
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,753
Straight 9-5, bad guys
who roll over like puppies.

261
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,047
it's just cocktails and bonbons
all day every day.

262
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,590
- Hey, do you wanna
wind someone up

263
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,259
or do you want us to help us
do your job for you?

264
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,718
- Hey, hey, hey.

265
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,554
We're just ragging
each other up, okay?

266
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,055
It's nothing.
Lighten up.

267
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,765
What are you doing?
- Hey, listen up.

268
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,642
I got something here.

269
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,894
Three Rolling Sixes just got
bailed out for ten grand each,

270
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,187
cash money.

271
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,564
- Cleo's keeping
the money rolling.

272
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,065
- Who's their bondsman?

273
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,942
- Jimmy's Superior Bail Bonds
on Sheridan.

274
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,403
He told the clerk at the prison
that he'd be back later

275
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,988
to spring more Rolling Sixes.

276
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,990
He also told her
not to bury them.

277
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,123
- I mean, how do you answer
a question like that?

278
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,458
- How would your wife
have answered it?

279
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,918
- Angelyne would've found
the words.

280
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,753
She always did.
But me?

281
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,089
How do you explain duty
to an eleven-year-old?

282
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,507
- Yeah, that's a hard one.

283
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,428
- He's moving.

284
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,851
- Special delivery, huh?

285
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,853
- I've got you covered.
- Yeah, right on time.

286
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,187
- Follow the gray hoodie.

287
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,939
We'll keep eyes on you.

288
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,519
'Cause I took her
for everything.

289
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,355
You know what I mean?
- Yo, you dirty, dawg.

290
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,148
- You know,
why you even doing that?

291
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,483
- It's a cold world.

292
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,984
- Cleo.
- He made us.

293
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,819
Forget him.
Hit the house.

294
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,155
- Five-oh, five-oh!
- FBI, stop!

295
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,740
- Go!
- Go, go!

296
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,409
- Stop! FBI!
- FBI, freeze!

297
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,911
- Move!

298
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,040
- Stop!
- Freeze!

299
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,249
- I said stop!

300
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,709
- You two, secure the front.

301
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,505
- Clear!
- Clear!

302
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,340
- Clear!

303
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,527
- Suspect's MIA.

304
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,570
Start taking names.

305
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,118
- Come on!
Sit down!

306
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,744
- The courier
must've texted her.

307
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,454
- I don't know no Cleo Wilkins!

308
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,123
- ID!
- Hey!

309
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,666
- Hey!

310
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,918
FBI, stop!

311
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,420
Let me go!

312
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,338
I didn't do anything!
- Stop fighting...

313
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,091
- That woman Hana's talking to.
I know her.

314
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,051
- I'm a nurse's aid
at the hospital.

315
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,428
- Five years ago
when I was undercover

316
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,138
in a drug sting,
she knows me.

317
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,514
- What's the name
of your friend?

318
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,932
- Ava.
She don't live here.

319
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,226
She justshe just
told me to meet her here.

320
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,894
- Did she know you were a cop?

321
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,771
- No, she's just someone
I met back then.

322
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,107
- What do you wanna do?

323
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,401
- She's lying.
- Obviously.

324
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,944
- She might've come here
for Cleo.

325
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,113
- So again,
what do you wanna do?

326
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,073
- Sit down. ID!

327
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,742
- I'll need to go home first.

328
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,079
- Charlotte won't like it.
I don't like it.

329
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,456
- People are dying 'cause
of Cleo.

330
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,125
This girl might get me to her.

331
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,752
It's our best shot.

332
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,464
- Hana, let her go.

333
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,137
- Get out of here.
Go to work.

334
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,060
- You promised me, Sherr,
no more undercover work.

335
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,395
- No, I didn't.

336
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,855
You just told me
not to do it again.

337
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,273
It's my job, Charlotte.

338
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,650
- This family is your job.

339
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,944
Our daughter is our job.

340
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,030
- You know the two of you
are my life.

341
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,492
- Then please, don't put
yourself at even more risk.

342
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,952
- We don't live in a bubble,
Charlotte.

343
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,207
If we can make the safer world
for Anais even a little bit...

344
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,545
You do it your way,
teaching the law.

345
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,464
I do it my way.

346
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,302
You won't be able
to reach me directly,

347
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,137
but you have
everybody's numbers.

348
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,556
Any of them will know where I
am and how to contact me.

349
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,144
- Mommy, I'm thirsty.

350
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,565
Are you going away?

351
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,903
- Just for a few days, baby.

352
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,863
Mwah.

353
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,998
- Line of sight, 200 yards.

354
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,536
- She's in place.

355
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,037
- Copy.

356
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,166
- This one.

357
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,550
- This is Agent Skye.

358
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,220
Anttwon Lane Perry,
date of birth, 9-2-96.

359
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,390
Has he been bailed out yet?

360
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,559
Hold him for us.
We're on our way.

361
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,610
- Sandra.

362
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,155
I figure I owe you
an explanation and an apology.

363
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,075
- You do.
You really do.

364
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,829
- Still have the same apartment
with a view of the park?

365
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,086
- Then you know the way.

366
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,966
- Step on up.

367
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,427
Come over here.
Have a seat.

368
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,095
- Why'd y'all bring me here,
man?

369
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,555
My bail's been posted.

370
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,098
- Not processed.
Sit down.

371
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,935
- It's about your brother,
Kendrick.

372
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,311
- Yeah?
What about him?

373
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,647
- 25 year sentence up
in Ray Brook lockup.

374
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,857
That's practically in Canada.

375
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,817
It's a long way for your mom
to go to visit.

376
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,986
- What do you want?

377
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,489
- Cleo Wilkins.

378
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,867
You know she killed Ty,
shot him twice in the heart.

379
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,619
It wasn't pretty.

380
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,669
Okay.

381
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,963
We can move you brother
Kendrick downstate,

382
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,422
closer to
the city.

383
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,007
Easy ride for you
and your mom.

384
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,927
- Your mom is in a walker,
right?

385
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,352
- You can really
get Kendrick moved?

386
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,521
- If you help us find Cleo.

387
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,486
I ain't wearing no wire
or nothing.

388
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,367
- The heat was on.

389
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,662
You were okay, straight job,
no cops looking for you.

390
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,997
I had to get out.

391
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,498
- But five years, Sherry?

392
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,333
You could've let me know
where you were.

393
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,670
- And give 'em a call to trace,
get you mixed up in my trouble?

394
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,713
- It cooled off.

395
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,172
Police put people in jail,

396
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,674
then everything
went back to normal.

397
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,718
- By then I was jammed up
in Florida.

398
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,302
I did three years.

399
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,186
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- I tried not to miss you.

400
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,064
You took such good care of me.

401
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,317
- Because I loved you.

402
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,446
I could take care of you again.

403
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,868
- I don't want your money,
okay?

404
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,911
I can earn my own,

405
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,247
but I need to get
back in the game.

406
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,875
- Is that a good idea?
- It's what I know.

407
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,585
I just need to figure out
where to start.

408
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,795
I don't know
the players anymore.

409
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,797
- Hmm.

410
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,930
- Still the same old Sherry.

411
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,269
Solid, knows her own mind.

412
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,937
Come with me tonight,

413
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,440
and I'll introduce you
to somebody who can help.

414
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,109
You have a place to stay?

415
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,402
- I got to town this morning,

416
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,322
stashed my case,
and went to find you.

417
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,158
- You can stay here.

418
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,785
- I'd like that.

419
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,082
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Here he comes!

420
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,291
Here he comes!

421
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,428
- You think you all that?

422
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,430
Huh?
You ain't nothing!

423
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,475
We the Rolling Sixes.
We got us and we got Cleo.

424
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,435
She been on the fly six days,

425
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,938
and y'all still
ain't find nothing.

426
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,107
She running your dumb ass
all over the block.

427
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,983
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

428
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,111
Cleo, Cleo, Cleo!

429
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,780
Cleo, Cleo, Cleo...

430
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,707
all: Cleo, Cleo, Cleo...

431
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,295
- So you believe him?
You think I killed Ty?

432
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,383
- Listen, they been trying
to take us down since forever.

433
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,843
This they new play.

434
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,886
Get us to turn on each other,

435
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,222
and take our own selves down.

436
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,142
So no, Cleo, I don't believe
you killed him.

437
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,436
I think they did it.
- So we got no problem.

438
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,857
- None with me.

439
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,026
Look, like Ty said,
"Cleo's the real deal."

440
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,570
You know that.

441
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,697
But we still got people
who haven't been bailed

442
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,324
out of jail yet.
- I'm on it.

443
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,994
This gets 'em out
and sets us up.

444
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,872
Y'all ready?

445
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,763
We all seen
this play before.

446
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,432
They plant evidence on us,

447
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,517
threaten to cut off
your mom's benefits

448
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,394
if she don't snitch on you,

449
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,063
chain up your baby brother
while they toss your crib,

450
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,733
and now they killed Ty.

451
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,902
Well, we're done.

452
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,112
Done hiding, done running,

453
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,449
done with being locked up
and shot for being black.

454
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,118
- We on our own...
- This girl's been to church.

455
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,537
- You think anybody's falling
for this?

456
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,956
- People paying attention,
that's what matters.

457
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,251
- Lies have consequences.

458
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,295
Hate has consequences.

459
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,088
And when they come
after one of us,

460
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,757
they coming after all of us.

461
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,717
- Amen, sister.

462
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,095
- Those biographies she read,
Joan of Arc, Julius Caesar,

463
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,972
those are instruction
manuals to her.

464
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,976
Grandiose, narcissistic,
delusional.

465
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,729
- Ty showed me how
to take on the world.

466
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,774
He said,
"Dreams aren't enough."

467
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,276
You've got to show them
the power,

468
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
and that's what I'm gonna do.

469
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,781
I'm gonna fix this.

470
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,117
Set up or step away.

471
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,496
With me or against me.

472
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,582
- Barnes is on the move.

473
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,588
- I remember this place.

474
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,757
They still have pumpkin burek?

475
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,425
- We'll eat later.
You nervous?

476
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,636
- No, but you are.

477
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,596
So who's this friend
we're meeting?

478
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,056
- Girl I know from high school,

479
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,433
and no, it wasn't like that.

480
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,435
Look, if you don't want
to do this, we don't have to.

481
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,479
- No, I'm good.
Slow feet don't eat.

482
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,398
Gotta make a living.

483
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,151
- It's her.
She's in the basement.

484
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,324
- Why the basement?

485
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,494
- There's a passageway
to the buildings next door.

486
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,787
- I'm losing her.

487
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,330
She's in the basement.

488
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,665
- I'm not letting her
fly solo.

489
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,791
Let's move.

490
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,795
- Here she is.

491
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,714
- You didn't say your friend
was famous.

492
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,383
- You want a selfie with me,
bitch?

493
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,343
- You got ten seconds
to convince me

494
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,679
why I should take you on.

495
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,391
- I can make you
ten grand a week

496
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,852
moving product in a world
you know nothing about.

497
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,187
I know ladies in penthouses,
townhouses,

498
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,856
up and down Billionaires' Row.

499
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,649
I did it then
and I can do it now.

500
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,153
All these knuckleheads can do
is work a corner.

501
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,999
- Forget it, Anttwon.

502
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,917
You got my stuff?

503
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,380
You wanna talk,
this ain't the place.

504
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,596
- Health department!

505
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,087
- This way.

506
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,119
- You killed him, Cleo!

507
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,120
You just shot him!

508
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,621
He wasn't doing nothing.

509
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,957
How could you do that?
- He was a snitch.

510
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,333
He was taking pictures.

511
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,793
You need to be like
your friend here.

512
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,461
You ain't even flinch.

513
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,713
- Not my business.

514
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,382
- I like her.

515
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,009
Gimme.

516
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,471
I'll reach out.
Be ready.

517
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,104
- You okay?

518
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,481
- No, we just left him there.
I want to call somebody.

519
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,150
- No, don't do that.

520
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,985
What's that you gave her
from the hospital?

521
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,653
- Anti-seizure meds.

522
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,280
She can't just go
to a pharmacy, right?

523
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,614
She's got epilepsy.

524
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,491
She got bullied about it
in school.

525
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,410
- You felt sorry for her.

526
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,830
You're too good, Sandy.

527
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,999
You know, maybe hooking up
with Cleo wasn't the best idea.

528
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,917
- Don't back out.
She'll take it personal.

529
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,502
- I can always ghost
out of here.

530
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,504
- Don't.

531
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,092
- You're gonna be late
for work.

532
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,305
I'll see you later, okay?

533
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,186
She was right behind me.

534
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,146
There wasn't a damn thing
I could do.

535
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,023
- This is not your fault.

536
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,317
Look,
ever since Cleo took over,

537
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,319
12 people have been gunned
down.

538
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,070
She created this chaos.
It's on her.

539
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,697
- She has epilepsy.

540
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,990
My friend Sandy sneaks her

541
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,492
anti-seizure drugs
from the hospital.

542
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,243
- Of course she has epilepsy.

543
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,370
Those books she reads,
Teddy Roosevelt, Julius Caesar,

544
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,498
they all had epilepsy
and overcame it.

545
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,209
She has a fetish for her
own condition.

546
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,836
She thinks it makes
her special, powerful,

547
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,837
but look at this.

548
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,422
Look at this.

549
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,007
The child towering over
the adults,

550
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,884
and the longer
she evades capture,

551
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,511
the bigger the child gets.

552
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,970
- Boss, take a look.

553
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,222
Anttwon's phone is missing,

554
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,723
but I found this in the Cloud.

555
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,183
Last picture he took.

556
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,809
Floor plans, looks like.

557
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,771
- The dollar sign
could be somebody's stash.

558
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,774
- Hana, put up the crime scene
photos from the shoot-out,

559
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,235
and show me that table.

560
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,410
After Cleo killed them,
she took the sketch with her.

561
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,412
That's what the meeting
was about.

562
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,081
They were planning a heist.

563
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,083
- The sketch was on
Diablos' side of the table.

564
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,210
Maybe they were planning
to rip off their own stash.

565
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,711
- That would explain
the secret meeting

566
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,213
with the Rolling Sixes.

567
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,090
- So now Cleo's
going after the stash.

568
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,300
- That would solve
her money problems.

569
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,760
- It might solve our problems
too.

570
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,554
Clinton, check with the DEA,

571
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,556
see if their Agent Garcia
got any intel

572
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,766
on where the Diablos
keep their stash.

573
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,563
And that's the toll so far

574
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,274
of the gang war instigated
by Cleo Wilkens.

575
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,615
I'd like to say a few words
about the man whose shoes

576
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,617
Ms. Wilkens
is trying to fill.

577
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,786
Tyrone Jackson.

578
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,621
Tyrone Jackson was a criminal,

579
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,582
but he also gave back
to his community.

580
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,292
He paid for funerals,

581
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,294
helped people pay
their heating bills,

582
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,254
he even helped bring
a supermarket

583
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,132
to his neighborhood
to give jobs to young people.

584
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,467
Tyrone Jackson
helped his people

585
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,138
with the tools he had
at his disposal

586
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,973
until Cleo Wilkins
cut him down.

587
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,269
- Leave it on.

588
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,646
- What has
Cleo Wilkens done?

589
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,481
She turned your streets
into a war zone.

590
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,317
By her own hand
or by her orders,

591
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,818
she killed
all these people.

592
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,653
And right now
13 of her gang members

593
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,488
are in jail because
she either can't be bothered

594
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,116
or doesn't have the money
to bail them out.

595
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,327
Maybe she just doesn't know
how to bring in the money.

596
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,538
Either way,
she's no Ty Jackson.

597
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,165
Thank you.

598
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,377
If that doesn't tweak her...

599
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,886
- Ty went soft.

600
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:14,682
Thought we could go legit.
You believe that?

601
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,686
You believe they're ever gonna
let us live like they do?

602
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,064
Ever gonna let us rise?

603
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,565
Nah.

604
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,154
What we want...

605
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,115
We gotta take.

606
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,742
Get strapped.

607
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,370
Now!

608
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,539
I need soldiers.

609
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,138
- Yeah?

610
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,059
Hey Cleo.

611
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,901
- You introduced me to her.

612
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,569
What do you think your friend
did for a living?

613
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,987
She's a thug, Sandy!

614
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,739
Thug life.
The hate you give.

615
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,075
All that bullying she got
on account of her epilepsy?

616
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,743
She's paying it back.

617
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,662
- Please, Sherry,
don't go with her.

618
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,789
I couldn't live with myself
if something happened to you.

619
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,541
- I gotta throw in with her.
I got no choice.

620
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,418
With my record, where am I
gonna get a straight job?

621
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,086
- I've got a job.
I'll take care of you.

622
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,088
- I don't want it
like that between us!

623
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,716
She called me.
If I don't show, I'm done.

624
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,926
- Where did you get that?
- Never mind.

625
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,761
I gotta go.

626
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,226
Do not follow me.

627
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,061
- I can't lose you again!

628
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,271
No, you're not going.

629
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,022
I'll talk to her,
she'll listen to me.

630
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,613
- I'm FBI.

631
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,576
I'm sorry, but just know people
have my back, okay?

632
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,244
Nothing's gonna
happen to me.

633
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,123
- You...

634
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,961
Were you FBI five years ago?

635
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,340
When you made me fall in love
with you?

636
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,136
When you pretended
to be in love with me?

637
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,305
- I wasn't pretending,

638
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,183
but I had a job to do,
and I've got one to do now.

639
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,436
Get out!

640
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,355
Get out!

641
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,914
- Barnes is on the move.

642
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,670
- She's going to a meet.

643
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,765
Van just pulled up.

644
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,683
I can't tell if Cleo's inside.

645
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,024
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Uh-oh.

646
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,734
New player on the field.

647
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,861
- Go home.
We'll talk later.

648
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,531
- I'm going with you.

649
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,659
- This is what loyalty
looks like.

650
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,598
- They turned down
an alley off St. Raymond.

651
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,183
We'll get made if we follow.

652
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,685
- Stay put.

653
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,103
If you lose the signal,
come to me.

654
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,605
- Huh?
- What?

655
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,939
- FBI!
- FBI, don't move!

656
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,775
- Get down!
Get down!

657
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,319
- Drop your weapons!
- Get down!

658
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,778
- Put down your weapon!
- Hands up, hands up!

659
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,238
Up against the wall!

660
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,783
Stand down!

661
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,328
- Let me out!

662
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,788
Let me out
or I'ma kill her!

663
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,290
- Let her go, Cleo.

664
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,126
- Why?
She brought you in!

665
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,462
You knew she was a cop.
- She didn't know.

666
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,130
She had nothing
to do with this trap.

667
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,758
- It was Anttwon.
The guy you let back in.

668
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,928
- Snitches all around.

669
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,640
I walk out
or this bitch is dead!

670
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,559
- You hurt her
and you don't come out alive.

671
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,146
- Sandra protected you.

672
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,566
She helped you when
you got sick in school.

673
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,443
She brought you meds.

674
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,987
She's a better person
than you or me,

675
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,657
and you're gonna kill her,
for real?

676
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,283
How's that gonna make you look?

677
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,534
- She's right.

678
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,495
You're already a legend, Cleo.

679
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,538
Seven days you had us
chasing our tails.

680
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,457
The whole FBI.

681
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,000
- And you never left your turf.

682
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,045
- That's right.
I outsmarted you.

683
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,463
- That you did,

684
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,006
but you hurt this
one good person,

685
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,925
all that goes out the window.

686
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,385
Those people you admire,

687
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,805
Joan of Arc, Caesar,
Alexander the Great?

688
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,683
For them, there's only one
power play that matters.

689
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,351
- And what's that?

690
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,853
- You give us permission
to take you in.

691
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,397
- Permission?

692
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,190
- You control your own destiny.

693
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,192
You'll stand tall, like all
those great men and women.

694
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,653
- Word'll get out, Cleo.

695
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,655
You called the play,

696
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:07,034
and when you get to prison,
you'll be walking on water.

697
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,845
- You better get used
to them bracelets.

698
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,725
- They'll take care of you
up North.

699
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,060
- She's crazy.
- You're gonna die in lockup.

700
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,521
- She's crazy.

701
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,402
- You good?

702
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,903
- Sure.

703
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,072
- You had us worried
when you jumped in that van.

704
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,241
- Iron Lady.

705
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,579
- Now go home.
Hug your kid.

706
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,999
- Bureau of Prisons
is on the line.

707
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,252
- This Agent LaCroix.

708
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,879
I'd to talk about
transferring a prisoner

709
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,382
down from Ray Brook,
name of Kendrick Perry.

710
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:07,428
- Why'd you get in the van?

711
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,931
- To make sure nothing
happened to you.

712
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,477
What are they gonna do to me?

713
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,606
- I don't know.
I'll see what I can do.

714
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,956
both: "Mr. McGregor
went back to his work,

715
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,126
"and Peter was alone again,

716
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,671
"but he was very frightened,

717
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:46,634
and he was very, very..."

718
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,557
- Hi, Mama.
- Hey, baby.

719
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,037
- Mommy, read more.

720
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,873
- Read more?
Okay!

721
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,166
- Yay.

722
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,335
- We can read more.

723
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:25,840
both: "Peter asked her
the way to the gate,

724
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:30,553
"but she had such a large pea
in her mouth,

725
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:34,181
she couldn't answer."

726
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,852
- Grandma said
that they were bad people,

727
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,980
and good people
had to stop them.

728
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,234
- And what do you think
about that?

729
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,406
- Why did it have to be Mom?

730
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,703
- I think it's all about love.

731
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:03,711
She loved you so much,
and your grandparents,

732
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,338
Uncle Clinton.

733
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,342
She loved her family
and friends so much

734
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,345
that she wanted
to keep everyone safe.

735
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:19,768
She felt like that was her...

736
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,646
most important responsibility.

737
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,532
Good night, Dad.

738
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,409
- Good night, sweetheart.

739
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,602
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello, gorgeous.

740
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,104
How's our baby?

741
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,565
She's excited
about turning eight.

742
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,485
You look tired today.

743
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,278
- Can't think why.

744
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,281
Maybe it's that double shift.

745
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,951
You want me to come over there
and kick some brass?

746
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,786
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:42:19,305 --> 00:43:19,784

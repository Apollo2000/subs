1
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:04,877
- No, Earl,
Mike's got it right.

2
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:07,648
It's not about money.
It's about population control.

3
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:09,650
- Yeah, I get that.
How far away are you?

4
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,285
- I'm about 20 minutes away.

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,320
- Well, let me know
when you get here.

6
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:13,688
We got to talk about this.

7
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:15,122
- I'll call you
when I'm almost there.

8
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:16,791
- Okay, I'll see you
when you get here.

9
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:18,759
- Bye.

11
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,643
- Oh, no.

12
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,678
- It's okay, man.
Just go.

13
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:39,614
- I got two DUIs.
I can't get another.

14
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:40,748
- Seriously, it's fine.

15
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:41,882
Just get out of here.

16
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,117
- That's not right.

17
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,518
I might have a few bucks.

18
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,787
- I don't want your money.

19
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:55,863
There's no problem here.

20
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:58,132
We were just working it out.

21
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:00,001
- You the driver of this car?

22
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,035
- Uh, yeah.

23
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,137
- Can I see
your driver's license?

24
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:04,171
- We were just talking.

25
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:12,113
- I smell alcohol on you, sir.

26
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:13,247
- No, please.

27
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:14,382
- I'm not arresting you, sir,

28
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:16,050
but I need you to have a seat
in the back of my car.

29
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:17,206
Come on.

30
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:20,288
- Come on, man.
- We're just gonna talk, okay?

31
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,056
- Hey, you really didn't have
to do that, man.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,224
We were working it out.

33
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,525
- We were working it out.

34
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,960
- Listen, I'll handle
everything.

35
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:27,561
Just take a moment,

36
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:29,986
wait for me to come back, and
I'll be right with you, okay?

37
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:33,834
- Cops, man.

38
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:35,102
Good for hassling drunks,

39
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,737
but never there when we need you, right?

40
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:38,606
- I'm here now, sir.

41
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,075
I need your license and registration.

42
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,543
- Hey.

43
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,046
Are you familiar with the term
"unreasonable searches"?

44
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,380
Fourth amendment, pal.

45
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:49,417
Do they even teach you that
at the academy?

46
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:52,586
Hey, that's my personal property, okay?

47
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,588
- I said I need your license
and registration.

48
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,537
- No, no, no, please!
I won't tell anybody!

49
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,238
Please! I'm sorry about your car!

Please! I'm sorry about your car!

58
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,202
- Doug Timmons in action.

59
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:44,205
Killed Officer Will Clement
of Loudonville PD,

60
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:46,907
then killed Peter Bateman,
the guy who rear-ended him,

61
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,976
and drove off in Bateman's car.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,411
- What was wrong with his?

63
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:52,246
- The trunk wouldn't close
after the accident.

64
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,981
- Threw the Loudonville cops
for a loop.

65
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,082
Took them till this morning

66
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,650
to get a BOLO out on the right car.

67
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,753
- Timmons used
armor-piercing ammo.

68
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,721
It went straight through
the officer's vest.

69
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:01,922
- He wasn't fooling around.

70
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:04,358
He was looking for a showdown
with authority.

71
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,503
- Play back the search
of the trunk.

72
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:08,462
- Good for hassling drunks,

73
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:10,197
but never there when we need you, right?

74
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,465
- I'm here now, sir.

75
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,267
I need your license and registration.

76
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,136
- Hey, are you familiar
with the term

77
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,470
"unreasonable searches"?

78
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:17,838
Fourth amendment, pal.

79
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,607
Do they even teach you that
at the academy?

80
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:22,943
Hey, that's my personal property, okay?

81
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,612
- I said I need your license
and registration.

82
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:25,814
- Freeze it.

83
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,016
"Never there when we need you."

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,885
Maybe law enforcement let him down,

85
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,053
or he thinks they did.

86
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,889
Any record he's a crime victim?

87
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:36,424
- I haven't found anything yet.

88
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,125
No criminal record, either.

89
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:41,262
He moved out of his last known
in Coblesmith eight months ago

90
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:42,696
with no forwarding address.

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,465
Social Security shows no work.

92
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,268
He has no social media presence at all.

93
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,170
He's completely off the grid.

94
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,539
- Hmm, that's not reassuring.
Any family?

95
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,707
- No marriage, no kids,

96
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:55,309
Dad died when Doug was 6,

97
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,478
Mom had a stroke when Doug was 17.

98
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,213
She moved in with her sister in Arizona.

99
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,615
We have her place and phone
on surveillance.

100
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,217
I haven't found any siblings for Doug.

101
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,292
- Something about the cop
looking in the trunk

102
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:12,693
set him off.

103
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:15,563
Hana, Kenny, and Clinton,
go over that car.

104
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,832
Let's find out what Timmons
is worried about.

105
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,801
- Loudonville cops said
they found nothing of interest.

106
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,080
- We have different interests.

107
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:25,973
- Tip just came in
off the wanted poster.

108
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:29,310
An address for Timmons in Loudonville.

109
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,111
- I can't tell if he's scared
or hurt

110
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:33,548
or just had a bad night's sleep.

111
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,927
I guess we'll ask him when we find him.

112
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,854
- I called soon as I saw
the poster,

113
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:41,956
but you just missed him.

114
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,390
So to speak.

115
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,759
He cleared out yesterday morning.

116
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:47,328
Real nice kid.

117
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,864
- How long has he been
staying here?

118
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,031
- Three months.

119
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:53,934
Always paid cash, on time.

120
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,903
He wasn't around much.

121
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,573
- Did he say why
he was moving out?

122
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:01,442
- He seemed pretty down.

123
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,712
He said he felt like
he was losing everything.

124
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:06,581
So to speak.

125
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,650
- Must have forgotten
about this.

126
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,118
- Did he have a job somewhere?

127
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:12,286
- I'm not sure.

128
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,855
He said he wanted to get a government job

129
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,508
in Albany.

130
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,459
- He wanted to work
for the government?

131
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:19,994
- In Albany, yeah.

132
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,662
He went there sometimes,

133
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:23,764
for interviews, I think.

134
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:33,874
- A guy that rants about
unreasonable searches

135
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:37,077
doesn't sound like a good fit
for a government job.

136
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:40,114
- Here's what local cops pulled
from Doug's car.

137
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:42,416
- I think Doug wants
to take apart the government,

138
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,617
not be a part of it.

139
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,753
I finally found where he's been
lurking on the internet,

140
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:46,987
on a site called Friction.

141
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,155
- Sounds like porn.

142
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:49,156
- Close.

143
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,825
It's video games.
Gamers talking about games.

144
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,594
I found Doug in a discussion group

145
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:55,062
about a defunct game,

146
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:56,463
but basically, it's just a cover-up

147
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,065
for anti-government whining.

148
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,633
- Whining or planning?

149
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,535
- No plans, they just hate
on the government

150
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,937
and talk about guns.

151
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,305
It's all about protecting your home

152
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,073
when Big Brother comes
to take it from you.

153
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:07,374
- Big Brother can have my crib,

154
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:09,076
along with the rent and the leaky toilet.

155
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,312
- Puts a different spin
on what h was doing in Albany.

156
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:12,947
Might have been scouting targets.

157
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:15,816
Government buildings, government workers.

158
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,082
- Nothing here.

159
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:19,453
Just dirty laundry, toiletries--

160
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,288
- And a can
of men's body spray.

161
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:22,790
What's the deal with this stuff, anyway?

162
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:25,225
You guys use it after a shower,
or instead of a shower?

163
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,083
- That's getting
a little too personal.

164
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:35,336
- Mass card from a funeral.

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,205
Spencer Givens, Clifton, PA.

166
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,029
The day Doug moved out of his room.

167
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:46,369
- The day he told his landlady
he was losing everything.

168
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:50,284
- My husband Spencer
passed away

169
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,653
almost two weeks ago.

170
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,054
He knew Doug from high school.

171
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:55,456
Pocono Pines?

172
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,091
They survived the shooting there.

173
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,926
- A school shooting?

174
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,562
- Yes.
They hid in a closet together.

175
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,197
Spence kept Doug from freaking out,

176
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,798
and when Spence was wounded,

177
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,101
Doug kept him from bleeding to death.

178
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,191
- So from that,
they became friends?

179
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,374
- Mom?

180
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,247
There was a bond.

181
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,250
Doug saved Spence's life,
and Spence never forgot that,

182
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:26,754
but that's all they had in common.

183
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,856
Spence wasn't self-pitying.

184
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,624
He didn't blame anyone.

185
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:31,992
- Blame them for what?

186
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,695
- He had chronic pain
from his injury.

187
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,231
He took meds.

188
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,220
He got addicted.

189
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,737
He fought it real hard, but...

190
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,439
we lost him to an overdose.

191
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:53,647
- We're very sorry.

192
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,005
What was Doug so angry about?

193
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:01,455
- He thinks the government
can stop school shootings,

194
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,890
but won't.

195
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,024
It's crazy.

196
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,859
- Did you speak to him
at the funeral?

197
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:08,722
- Yes.
I had to console him.

198
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,267
He told me

199
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:15,791
he'd make sure Spence
would be remembered.

200
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:20,340
- Did he say how?

201
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:22,176
- It was just talk.

202
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,712
I don't need Spence to be
a symbol of anything.

203
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:30,150
- That photo?

204
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:31,418
When was that taken?

205
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:33,887
- The one-year anniversary
of the shooting.

206
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,689
Everyone posing in their school colors

207
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:37,391
to show the world they're okay.

208
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,794
As if.

209
00:08:45,022 --> 00:08:46,500
- Pocono Pines High School,

210
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:49,303
a 17-year-old student with an AR-15.

211
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,171
12 students and two teachers dead,

212
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:52,606
plus the shooter himself.

213
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,441
20 people were wounded.

214
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,810
- No doubt Doug was traumatized
by the shooting,

215
00:08:56,834 --> 00:09:00,714
and Spencer's death could've
sent him over the edge.

216
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,783
He would've been on
an emotional hair-trigger.

217
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,685
- First cops on the scene
at the school

218
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,019
waited for reinforcements

219
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:07,821
before they confronted the shooter.

220
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,323
- That was the strategy
back then.

221
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,525
- Doug could harbor a grudge
against law enforcement

222
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:13,293
for not intervening sooner.

223
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:15,129
- He's hot off the funeral,
runs into a cop,

224
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:16,706
and kaboom.

225
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:19,133
- Hey, Kenny, bring up
that body-cam footage

226
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,201
from the trunk.

227
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:26,039
Can you freeze that for me?

228
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,167
Yeah, that's it.
Now blow it up just in here.

229
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,518
A school jersey. I don't remember that

230
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,086
being part of the inventory for the car.

231
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,711
- That's because
it wasn't there.

232
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,190
- He must have taken it
with him when he took off.

233
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,859
- Maybe it had
sentimental value.

234
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:48,495
- Or he didn't want anybody
to see it.

235
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,696
- Could be why he flipped

236
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,532
when the cop looked in the trunk.

237
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:52,866
- Because he didn't want
to give away

238
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,661
what he was planning next?

239
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,935
- I haven't seen Doug Timmons
in two years.

240
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,771
He used to come to the
memorials for the shootings.

241
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,140
We do an assembly.

242
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:08,577
- We're concerned he might be
a threat to your school.

243
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:10,079
- I had the same thought.

244
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:11,480
I activated our safety measures.

245
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,615
Extra guards, active shooter drill.

246
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,150
- That's good.

247
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:16,685
- Please, sit down.

248
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,153
- Thank you.

249
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:20,856
Do you know why Doug stopped
coming to your memorials?

250
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,192
- I told him he couldn't speak
at the assemblies anymore.

251
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:24,626
The stuff he was saying was offensive

252
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,828
to the victims' families.

253
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,198
- For example?

254
00:10:29,222 --> 00:10:30,365
- Doug believes the government

255
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,800
allows school shootings to happen

256
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,836
to keep America's youth in fear.

257
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,338
- Did Doug find any supporters
for his views?

258
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:37,840
- One, for sure.

259
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:40,175
After we banned Doug, one of
the alums threatened to sue us

260
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,479
for violating Doug's free speech rights.

261
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:45,347
- We'd like to talk to him.

262
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,715
- Earl Hansen.

263
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,250
Always trying to get the school district

264
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:49,852
to arm teachers.

265
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:52,485
Thankfully, he moved out
of the district last year.

266
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,257
I can pull his alumni file.

267
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,767
- That'd be great.

268
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,820
The memorials with Doug,
any videos on those?

269
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,639
- This trouble with Doug--

270
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:11,340
doesn't need to change anything.

271
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,656
Just have to move faster, that's all.

272
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,278
- I'm ready.
I'm not afraid.

273
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,513
- Well, I'm afraid.

274
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,214
Mike, what Doug did,

275
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:21,583
and I'm not saying he was wrong--

276
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:24,086
but it puts a lot of eyes on us.

277
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,455
Let's just hit pause
until the heat dies down.

278
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,357
What do you say, Mike?

279
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:31,126
- There's no pause, Earl.

280
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,928
You're in or you're out.

281
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,866
I guess...

282
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,056
I'm out, then.

283
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,686
- Hey, Earl.

284
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,975
Shoot him, Doug.
- Come on, stop kidding around.

285
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,044
- Do it, Doug!
- You're nuts!

286
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:54,550
- Come on, do it!

287
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:55,918
Shoot him dead, now!

288
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,386
Go ahead, Doug. Shoot Earl.

289
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,887
He's gonna jeopardize the plan.

290
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:10,338
- Hey.

291
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,132
Shake it off, Doug.

292
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:15,137
We're only getting started.

293
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,376
- And they could
stop the shootings

294
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,611
if they wanted to,

295
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:23,979
but they don't.

296
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:27,249
They could stop the ammo,
they could stop the guns,

297
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:30,519
but they want us to be afraid.

298
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:33,822
Our grandparents grew up
hiding under desks,

299
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:35,624
afraid of nuclear bombs,

300
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,926
and we grow up hiding in classrooms

301
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,128
afraid of gunfire,

302
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,897
because the more afraid we are,

303
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:44,266
the easier it is for them to control us.

304
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,435
- He has a point.

305
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,671
About children growing up in fear.

306
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:52,474
- You do that thing where you
hear about a school shooting,

307
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,377
then you stay up all night
reading homeschool websites?

308
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,512
- Angelyne and I used to talk
about it.

309
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:59,014
- Anais is going
into preschool,

310
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:01,683
but even that's not safe anymore.

311
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,485
- You know, they make
bulletproof backpacks

312
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,520
and hoodies for kids.

313
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:09,258
- Google that at 3 a.m.
after a school shooting?

314
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:11,193
- I almost bought one.

315
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,594
I didn't know what kind of message

316
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:14,363
I'd be sending Tali.

317
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:17,755
I don't want her to grow up scared.

318
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,737
- Just located Earl Hansen.

319
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,839
Not where you'd think.

320
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:25,507
- I don't know
what's going on.

321
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,209
The police just called.

322
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,977
Earl was found dead
in the woods in New York

323
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,712
outside Loudonville.

324
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:33,482
He went hunting yesterday.

325
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,484
- With who?

326
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,352
- I'm not sure.

327
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:38,553
Oh, God,

328
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:41,089
our daughter's gonna be
coming home from school soon.

329
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,525
- Is there anyone we can call
for you?

330
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,227
Family, or--

331
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:48,330
- My brother lives
in Allentown.

332
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:49,998
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

333
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:51,199
- That him there?

334
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:53,168
- Yeah.
- Kay.

335
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:54,970
- Loudonville PD confirmed.

336
00:13:54,994 --> 00:14:00,208
Earl Hansen, shot twice
with armor-piercing bullets.

337
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,617
- Just come as soon as you can,
Mark.

338
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,784
- Mrs. Hansen,
is there any chance

339
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:11,720
your husband could've been
with Doug Timmons today?

340
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:12,754
- Doug Timmons?

341
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,189
What does he have to do with this?

342
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:15,157
- We're not sure.

343
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,259
We thought Earl and Doug were friends.

344
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:18,660
- Well, they went hunting
together.

345
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:20,329
The two of them and this other man.

346
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:24,066
Mike something.
I don't know his last name.

347
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,556
He lives around Albany.

348
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:29,938
- Is there anything else
you remember about Mike?

349
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:32,605
Maybe something your husband said?

350
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,577
- Well, he has a foreign wife.

351
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,279
She used to cook for them
when they went hunting.

352
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,880
Earl would bring back leftovers.

353
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:43,851
Weird foreign stuff, like meat jelly.

354
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,619
- Kholodets.

355
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,421
- Yeah, that sounds right.

356
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,724
- It's a kind of Ukrainian
aspic.

357
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,793
- Oh, uh...

358
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:55,952
It's my brother. I have to take this.

359
00:14:57,956 --> 00:15:00,401
- So now you're an expert
on Ukrainian food?

360
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:02,937
- I had a friend
from the Ukraine.

361
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,939
- Another friend
you haven't told me about.

362
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:07,096
- You didn't ask.

363
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,734
- Mike from Albany
with a Ukrainian wife.

364
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,583
Let's get Hana cooking.

365
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:16,584
- We in business?

366
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,152
- Here you go.

367
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:20,421
- Kept it small.
Perfect.

368
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,477
- Uh-huh.

369
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,622
- You have enough to eat?

370
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,072
More American apple pie?

371
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:39,106
- I'm full.

372
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,840
Thanks, Lena.

373
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,267
- You are so skinny.

374
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:50,072
How is Earl?

375
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,145
- Earl Hansen?

376
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:56,731
Good.

377
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,348
- Say hello to him for me
when you see him.

378
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,132
Isn't Doug skinny?

379
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:06,834
He needs to eat more.

380
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,302
- You feed him too good.

381
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,126
He might never leave.

382
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,998
Let's go to bed.

383
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:19,447
Come on.

384
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:07,595
- And the last time I was here,
it was not done correctly.

385
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,698
It was too chunky, so I want it chopped.

386
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:13,599
Very, very fine chopped.

387
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,273
- You making kholodet?

388
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:21,542
The gelatin and your accent.

389
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:22,610
It's Ukrainian, right?

390
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,318
- Yes.

391
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,780
How do you know kholodet?

392
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,249
- A buddy of mine
turned me on to it.

393
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:30,651
- Oh.

394
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,053
- Earl--Earl Hansen?

395
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:34,677
You might know him.

396
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:42,062
- That's quite a full basket
there, Ms. Kelerman.

397
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,264
You have guests at home?

398
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,608
- FBI!
Freeze!

399
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:55,609
- On the ground!
Now!

400
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:56,644
- Hands, hands!
Raise your hands!

401
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:57,978
- I'm not resisting,
I'm complying.

402
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,280
- Face down, on the ground!

403
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:00,648
Face down!

404
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:12,293
- Clear!

405
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,416
- All clear.

406
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:20,834
This is Lima-1. Suspect Timmons is MIA.

407
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:21,869
- Jess?

408
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:37,940
- Sierra-1.
Weapons are gone.

409
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:42,647
- Dougie got away
with all the toys.

410
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:44,658
- Each of these folders
has data

411
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:46,760
on a state government building in Albany.

412
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:50,196
Number of agencies in the building...

413
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:55,002
number of employees, emergency protocols.

414
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,004
And here's a list of nearby hotels.

415
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,806
Points of entry, exit,

416
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,308
number of floors, photos.

417
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:04,578
These are target profiles.

418
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,347
Government offices,
government employees--

419
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,270
- And hotels
to shoot them from.

420
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:13,454
He's planning a mass casualty event.

421
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,544
- And now he has the firepower
to do it.

422
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:20,231
- No, I don't need a lawyer,

423
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:23,118
'cause I don't recognize
your authority to question me.

424
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:25,421
Your bureau is run by the Deep State

425
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,256
in violation of the Constitution.

426
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,526
- Actually, the FBI
is authorized under Title 28

427
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,829
of the U.S. Code, Section 533,

428
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:35,465
enacted by Congress
under authority granted

429
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,790
by Article One, Section Eight
of the Constitution.

430
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,373
- Now that we've cleared
that up,

431
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:45,842
what do you have to say
about these files?

432
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:49,178
- I am a sovereign citizen,

433
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:50,813
subject only to common law

434
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:52,715
as intended by the Founding Fathers.

435
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,984
Your government is a false government,

436
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:58,610
operating under admiralty law
to enslave its citizens.

437
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:02,525
- I don't know about plans.

438
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:05,128
I told you everything I know already.

439
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:08,364
About guns, about Doug in shed.

440
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:09,932
- You are not taking this
seriously.

441
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,935
- I--
- You helped a fugitive.

442
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,505
A murderer who might kill
a lot more people.

443
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,340
- I don't know Doug
is fugitive.

444
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:19,642
He is just a man Mike does hunting with.

445
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,453
- Like Earl Hansen?

446
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:24,380
- No, not like Earl.

447
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,983
Earl is different.

448
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,985
- What's Earl like?

449
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,720
- Earl is happy guy.

450
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,722
Is always happy.

451
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:34,490
He make me laugh.

452
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,492
And nice manners too.

453
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,394
- You care for Earl?

454
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:39,962
- I didn't say that.

455
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,519
- You don't have to.

456
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:48,371
- He's not like Doug,

457
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:50,306
and he's certainly not like your husband.

458
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,075
He do that to you?

459
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,552
He's a brute, isn't he?

460
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,329
You know who else your husband hurt?

461
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:06,957
- This isn't gonna be easy
for you.

462
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,317
- Your husband and Doug
killed him.

463
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:18,534
- Now we'd like your help
finding Doug.

464
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,236
- They don't know
each other long.

465
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,371
They meet three months ago at Big Valley.

466
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:23,573
- Big Valley, the casino?

467
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:25,274
- Yes.

468
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:27,477
And they hunt together,

469
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,067
with Earl.

470
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:36,586
- There's no evidence linking
Kelerman to Hansen's murder,

471
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,755
but the A-USA can hold him
for harboring a fugitive.

472
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:40,857
- Tell her to pile it on.

473
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,459
We don't want Kelerman
bailing himself out.

474
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,661
Same for the wife.

475
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:47,430
- Doug was barely scraping by.

476
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:49,565
He didn't have enough money
to gamble in a casino.

477
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,767
- If he didn't meet Kelerman
at the blackjack table,

478
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,137
maybe somebody at Big Valley
introduced them.

479
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:14,123
- Molly Werner?

480
00:22:14,147 --> 00:22:16,159
I'm Agent Barnes. This is Agent LaCroix.

481
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:17,627
We'd like to talk to you.

482
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,195
- Okay, sure.

483
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:20,863
- You used to work
on the casino floor

484
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,198
near the poker tables?

485
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:23,966
- Yeah, but then I went back
to school

486
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,134
so I couldn't work late nights.

487
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:26,335
Why?

488
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:29,005
- We're interested in
a customer named Mike Kelerman.

489
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:30,106
Poker player.

490
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,507
The waitresses over there tell us

491
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:33,398
that you're his favorite waitress.

492
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:37,180
- Okay.

493
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:38,814
This is about Doug, isn't it?

494
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:40,016
Doug Timmons?

495
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,739
Can we...

496
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:50,760
I was wondering when you guys
would find me.

497
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:53,062
He's my half-brother.

498
00:22:53,086 --> 00:22:54,690
We have the same mom.

499
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:57,934
- Thanks for not making us
play 20 Questions.

500
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,203
- I know I should've
reached out to the police,

501
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:02,860
but I don't keep in touch
with Doug anymore.

502
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:05,942
I can't help you.

503
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,010
- You know what he's accused
of doing?

504
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,455
- Yes.

505
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,481
I feel really bad for those people.

506
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:14,483
Doug was never violent.

507
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:16,986
After Pocono Pines, he was against guns.

508
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,955
- When somebody's traumatized
like Doug,

509
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:21,023
it can lead to paranoia.

510
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:23,192
- We saw a video of a speech
he did at the school.

511
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:24,260
- I know.

512
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:26,262
He's always spouting
these anti-government talks

513
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:27,930
to people who didn't ask to hear them.

514
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:29,131
- And some who did.

515
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:30,533
Like Mike Kelerman.

516
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:32,401
Did you introduce them?

517
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:33,603
- No.

518
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:37,240
No, they both came in a lot,
but they came in alone.

519
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:38,641
- And when Mike
wasn't playing poker,

520
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:40,676
he was hanging here at the restaurant?

521
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,113
- He came in here
for the slots.

522
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,081
They give huge payouts.

523
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:46,904
Better than the ones in the casino.

524
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:50,686
I have to get back to work.

525
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:58,094
- What if he reaches out
to you?

526
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:00,255
- He really killed
those people...

527
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:03,099
I can't help him anymore.

528
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:04,734
- Call us

529
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:07,236
if he tries to contact you.

530
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:14,561
She's lying about Kelerman.

531
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:17,613
The slot machines off the floor
pay out the lowest,

532
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:19,215
not the highest.

533
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,950
They don't want you in the restaurant

534
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:22,785
spending 35 bucks on a steak

535
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,887
when you could be out
on the floor losing a grand

536
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:26,155
at the blackjack table.

537
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,958
- So she lied 'cause she did have
a thing going on with Kelerman?

538
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:31,516
- Or maybe they have
other interests in common.

539
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:38,467
Crosby, I want surveillance
on Molly's phone

540
00:24:38,491 --> 00:24:40,569
and a full workout
on all her communications.

541
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:41,804
We're looking for a direct link

542
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:44,307
between her, Doug, and Kelerman.

543
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:45,408
- So we're thinking

544
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:47,076
Kelerman got tired of his wife's cooking?

545
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,378
- No, I don't think so.
It was not about sex.

546
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:51,580
Doug's politics are about his trauma

547
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:53,282
from the school shooting.

548
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:54,317
Kelerman's the one

549
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:56,585
spouting the mainline domestic
terrorist agenda.

550
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:59,555
I think Kelerman
might've radicalized Doug.

551
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:01,290
- The attacks
on government buildings,

552
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:02,458
mass shootings.

553
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:04,427
- Doug's reactive.

554
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:05,594
He's unstable on his own,

555
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:08,064
and he's influenced by whoever's nearby.

556
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:09,265
I think it would've been easy

557
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,567
for Kelerman to activate him to violence.

558
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,069
- And somehow
Molly's part of it.

559
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:15,338
- Well, she certainly knows
more than she says she does.

560
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,006
- It's hard to tell
from her profile.

561
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,941
She's a college student
majoring in history.

562
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:20,142
She lives on campus.

563
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,411
She has no criminal record,
not even a traffic ticket,

564
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:24,647
but there's just one tiny gap.

565
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:27,283
There's no record of her
attending high school.

566
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:28,351
- That's pretty cool.

567
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,852
If I knew high school was optional,

568
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:31,654
I would've enlisted even earlier.

569
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:33,189
- I mean, she was living
with Doug back then.

570
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:35,925
He went to high school, but she didn't.

571
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:38,361
She just fell off the radar
after eighth grade.

572
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:41,148
- Right after the shooting
at Pocono Pines.

573
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:48,471
- Molly left our school in
the middle of the eighth grade.

574
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,606
Her family decided to homeschool her.

575
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,041
I thought it was a mistake.

576
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:53,943
- Whose idea was it?

577
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,345
- Well, her mother said
that Molly was too afraid

578
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:57,480
to come back to school

579
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,715
after the shootings over at Pocono Pines,

580
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:02,351
but Doug was the one that
really frightened her into it.

581
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,620
- He convinced her school
was too dangerous?

582
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:07,189
- He convinced her that life
was too dangerous.

583
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:08,724
He stifled her.

584
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:10,226
After their mother had a stroke,

585
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,361
he had himself emancipated,

586
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:14,463
and he took custody of Molly.

587
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:17,133
She looked up to him.
She believed every word he said.

588
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:19,201
- She believed
he was protecting her.

589
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,570
He was her guardian angel.

590
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:23,148
- You got it.

591
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:32,681
- Molly.

592
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:33,883
We need to talk.

593
00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:36,585
- I have a paper due tomorrow.
I told you what I know.

594
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,921
- We don't believe you did,
not about Doug, not about Kelerman.

595
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,523
- Kelerman is a perv, okay?

596
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:42,358
And Doug, he's a baby,

597
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:44,560
and I got tired of looking after him.

598
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,061
I don't care what happens to him.

599
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,863
- You care about
your guardian angel?

600
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:49,253
Didn't you give him this?

601
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,203
- It's just a cup.

602
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:56,238
- A cup you made for your
big brother who protected you,

603
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:57,206
who kept you safe,

604
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,863
and now you think you're protecting him.

605
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:03,579
Molly, if you don't stop lying to us,

606
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:05,781
you're just gonna get him killed.

607
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:07,751
- You don't get it.

608
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:11,287
I have to take care of him.

609
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:13,240
He is so broken.

610
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,791
So helpless.

611
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,749
- I'm not trying to excuse
what Doug did.

612
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,952
I'm just asking you to remember
that he's a crime victim too.

613
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:32,283
- We know what he's been
through.

614
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,362
- You don't know.

615
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:34,986
He put his finger
in his friend's bullet hole

616
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,154
to stop him from bleeding out.

617
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:38,123
An experience like that changes you.

618
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:40,392
- It does.
It's called PTSS.

619
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,428
He experienced a trauma,
and now he's hyper-vigilant.

620
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:45,797
He sees danger where there is none,

621
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:47,432
and he reacts.

622
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:49,401
Doug's extremely dangerous.

623
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:51,636
We think he's protecting a bigger plan

624
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,138
he's cooked up with Kelerman

625
00:27:53,162 --> 00:27:55,540
and another friend, Earl Hansen.

626
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:59,477
A plan to kill
government workers in Albany.

627
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,912
What do you think of that?

628
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:02,247
Hmm?

629
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:03,448
He's out there

630
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:05,667
with guns and ammunition.

631
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:08,587
We need your help to bring him in.

632
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:11,389
- You're gonna kill him.

633
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:12,979
- Not if we can help it.

634
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:18,129
Molly, I want you to take a look around.

635
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:21,132
I brought you here so you could
see what Doug is up against.

636
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:22,967
- We have hundreds of agents,

637
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:25,170
the state police of New York
and Pennsylvania.

638
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:27,305
- High tech
Google doesn't even know about.

639
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:28,940
- Your brother could call
from Mars,

640
00:28:28,964 --> 00:28:30,141
and we'd know about it.

641
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:32,043
- And that guy right there?

642
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,144
He can put a bullet

643
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,479
in the middle of a silver dollar

644
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:35,836
from 100 yards.

645
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,852
After the shooting,

646
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:42,487
he kept you at home.

647
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:44,206
Was he afraid for you?

648
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,919
- He made me feel safe.

649
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:50,712
And loved.

650
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:53,031
- Okay.

651
00:28:53,055 --> 00:28:55,467
And you did the same for him.

652
00:28:55,491 --> 00:28:56,468
When he was hungry,

653
00:28:56,492 --> 00:28:57,969
you could've just given him a doggy bag

654
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:01,473
and sent him on his way,
but you let him hang around.

655
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,441
He needed you.

656
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:06,644
You're the only person who can
get through to him, Molly.

657
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:09,314
You're the only person
who can bring him in safely.

658
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,900
Now, will you help us?

659
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,219
- What do you want me to do?

660
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:16,187
- No more games.

661
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:17,948
That's the first thing.

662
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:20,659
- If he calls you,

663
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,218
you try to talk him
into turning himself in.

664
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:31,336
We'll be in touch with some other ideas.

665
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,571
One of the agents will see you
back to your car.

666
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:43,314
- I wouldn't give you
a donut hole

667
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,550
for that girl's cooperation.

668
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:47,619
- She didn't exactly
convince me either.

669
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:50,188
- Waste of a good dog
and pony show.

670
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,123
- She's been lying to us
from the get-go.

671
00:29:52,147 --> 00:29:55,894
Texts to and from her phone,
after we raided Kelerman's.

672
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:57,729
She gets a text, "They got Mike."

673
00:29:57,753 --> 00:30:00,365
Then a second one,
"Can't do this on my own."

674
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:03,067
She sends a text, "I'll help you."

675
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:06,204
- She's gone from enabler
to coconspirator.

676
00:30:06,228 --> 00:30:07,438
- To do what?

677
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:09,307
Doug left behind his plans for Albany

678
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:11,910
and lost his coconspirators,
Kelerman and Hansen.

679
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:13,711
- Maybe he's looking
for another target.

680
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:15,580
- Molly can't say no
to her big brother.

681
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,015
We can't change that,

682
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,416
but maybe we can get them to say yes

683
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,006
to the right targets.

684
00:30:22,277 --> 00:30:25,348
Hana, show me what's coming up
at Big Valley Casino.

685
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:27,992
- Everything is going wrong.

686
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:30,828
When I get home, I get letter
from department of tax.

687
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:31,829
- Revenue.

688
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,331
It's called the Department of Revenue.

689
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:34,399
What did they want?

690
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:36,234
- They say we owe tax.
We have to pay.

691
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:38,002
- Call the phone number
on the bill

692
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:40,572
and tell those bozos I'll get
it done when I get it done.

693
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:41,940
I got bigger things to worry about.

694
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,308
- This is all because
of gambling.

695
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:44,642
I tell you to stop,

696
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,412
but always,
you have to be at that casino.

697
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:48,613
- Again with the casino.

698
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:49,881
If I wanted to be nagged to death,

699
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:51,416
I would've married an American girl.

700
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,284
- I am your wife.

701
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,454
When you come home, I want new plan.

702
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:58,189
I want children.

703
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:00,458
I want you to promise me.

704
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:01,968
Hey.

705
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:05,396
You say it.

706
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,633
"I, Mike, promise Lena

707
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:11,636
"that we will have new plan
to have children

708
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,572
and live like real American family."

709
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:15,974
- Geez.

710
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:18,151
- Say it, or I go home
to Odessa.

711
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:22,513
- I, Mike, promise Lena
that we'll have a new plan

712
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:25,867
to have kids and live
like a real American family.

713
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:29,320
You happy now?

714
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:31,122
- Yes.

715
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:32,832
Very happy.

716
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,693
- You get what you need?

717
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,362
- Yeah, I got all
the right words.

718
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:39,864
I just have to put them in order now.

719
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:42,033
- You did well, Lena.

720
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:44,736
You have a promising career as an actor.

721
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,505
- I did this for Earl.

722
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:08,426
- It's Mike.
New plan.

723
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,161
Casino. The 8th.

724
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:11,896
Department of Revenue.

725
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,987
Tell him. Get it done.

726
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:19,704
- What's our girl up to?

727
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:20,972
- Same, same.

728
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:22,974
Serving food, clearing dishes.

729
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:24,809
- The kitchen messed up
a dessert order.

730
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,679
She spent her break eating pie
in the break room.

731
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:29,881
- The Department of Revenue
event starts in an hour,

732
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,182
and she's eating pie?

733
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:32,350
- Crosby would.

734
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:34,085
- We've had eyes on her
the last two days.

735
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:36,688
She hasn't veered one bit
from her routine.

736
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:38,289
- You sure she got
the Kelerman message?

737
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:39,257
- Positive.

738
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:42,593
She listened to it and deleted it.

739
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:44,362
- Maybe she didn't take
the bait.

740
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:45,516
- It's possible.

741
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,865
Her regular shift still ends
at, what, 7:00?

742
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:48,900
- I'll check.

743
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:51,536
Scheduling software is an easy hack.

744
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,304
Her normal shift ends at 7:00,

745
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:55,540
but she booked a double tonight
till 2:00 a.m.

746
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:56,774
- This is the college girl

747
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:58,343
who didn't want to work late nights.

748
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,911
- When did she book
this extra shift?

749
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:02,280
- She picked it up
three days ago.

750
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:04,771
- Before we sent her
the Kelerman message.

751
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:11,155
- The only government function

752
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,358
at the casino for the next two months.

753
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:16,352
If we thought of it, she thought of it.

754
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:18,329
Call casino security.

755
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:20,064
I want all the footage
for the last week cued up

756
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:22,433
and ready to go by the time we get there.

757
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:23,668
She didn't take the bait

758
00:33:23,692 --> 00:33:25,803
because her and Doug already
had this plan in the works.

759
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:27,227
They're ahead of us.

760
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:32,835
- She's in no hurry.

761
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,638
Getting dessert orders
and chatting up the kiddies.

762
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,476
- I hope we're wrong.

763
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,378
How are we doing on last week's footage?

764
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:41,836
- A week in the life
of a waitress.

765
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:44,150
It's like watching
a documentary of a former me.

766
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,865
- Okay, she's going
towards the bathrooms.

767
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,167
- We have cameras
in the bathroom?

768
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,669
- No, not the steakhouse
bathrooms.

769
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,271
I'm gonna have to open up
the fountain area.

770
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:54,339
- Not yet.

771
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:56,240
- Got something.

772
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:58,910
- Barnes, you keep a lookout
for her.

773
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:01,312
This is Saturday, 6:46 p.m.

774
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:04,048
She took a room service tray.

775
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:06,351
- Who's got the inside of
the kitchen service elevator?

776
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,020
- Yo.
- We need Saturday, 6:46 p.m.

777
00:34:09,044 --> 00:34:10,477
Which floor?

778
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:14,092
- Looks like 15.

779
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:17,061
- Okay, we need video footage,
15th floor, last Saturday.

780
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,062
- Don't have it.

781
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,832
15 and 14 are closed off
from fire damages,

782
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:21,899
pending renovations.

783
00:34:21,923 --> 00:34:23,634
The rooms haven't been occupied
for weeks,

784
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:25,759
and the cameras haven't been on
for weeks either.

785
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:31,642
- She's feeding him.

786
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,311
That's where he has to be. 15th floor.

787
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:34,879
She come back from the bathroom yet?

788
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:36,280
- I haven't seen her.

789
00:34:36,304 --> 00:34:38,605
Family of five are still
waiting for their desserts.

790
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:43,788
- 7:48 p.m.
She's not coming back.

791
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:46,190
All right, let's do it. 15th floor.

792
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:48,726
Clinton, call in the SWAT team.

793
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,595
I want the entire fountain area clear.

794
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,630
I want everybody inside.

795
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:54,465
- Got it.

796
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:04,108
- I want you to go.
I'm serious.

797
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:05,843
- I'm not leaving you.
You need me.

798
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,012
- No, I don't.
See, I'm getting ready.

799
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:09,402
I can do this on my own.

800
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,012
- I am not walking away.

801
00:35:14,776 --> 00:35:16,681
Let me help you.

802
00:35:17,446 --> 00:35:19,424
- This wasn't even supposed
to be the plan.

803
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:20,591
It was supposed to be a building

804
00:35:20,615 --> 00:35:22,660
with a bunch of federal offices.

805
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:25,106
- Government is government,
Doug.

806
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:28,232
This is still gonna send your message.

807
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:37,160
- For Spencer.

808
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:39,010
- For all the kids.

809
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,168
- Hey.

810
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:05,837
Looks like people are going
away from the fountain.

811
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,628
It looks like they're moving them inside.

812
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,211
What's going on?

813
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:14,534
- I don't know.

814
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:18,583
Here.

815
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:21,037
This window overlooks the parking lot.

816
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:23,554
There's a bunch of people down there.

817
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:31,395
Just like we planned.

818
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:37,235
Drop your weapon!

819
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:38,503
Drop your gun!
- Stop!

820
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:40,171
Don't hurt him!

821
00:36:40,195 --> 00:36:42,406
- Doug, don't do it.
Talk to me.

822
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,975
- It's what you want, right?

823
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:46,110
All the government drones
can have their party

824
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:47,245
and you save the day?

825
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,313
- What about the message?
You die, the message dies too.

826
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:51,215
- That's not true.
Don't listen to him.

827
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,383
- It is true.

828
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:55,119
The story will be "deranged man
suicides at casino."

829
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,188
That'll be it. End of story.

830
00:36:57,212 --> 00:36:58,256
- No.

831
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,024
You're totally wrong about that.

832
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:03,261
They love talking about school shootings.

833
00:37:03,285 --> 00:37:06,197
This is gonna put Spencer
and all the rest of the kids

834
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:08,721
right back in the news!

835
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:12,922
- Put your guns down.

836
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,328
Everybody, put your guns down.

837
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,877
All right, tell me about Spencer.

838
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,167
Give me the message.

839
00:37:23,438 --> 00:37:25,850
- The message is me
taking myself out!

840
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:28,352
- Doug, give me the message!

841
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:30,606
Hana, write this down.

842
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:33,257
That way we'll get it right.

843
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:35,862
- No, Doug, he's lying.

844
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:41,399
- I wanna say something

845
00:37:41,423 --> 00:37:44,035
about thoughts and prayers, for starters.

846
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,037
- Thoughts and prayers?
What about them?

847
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:49,774
- They don't work, okay?

848
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:53,978
Thoughts and prayers didn't help Spencer!

849
00:37:54,002 --> 00:37:56,382
- I'll tell them that.
What else?

850
00:37:56,972 --> 00:38:00,418
- All of the shootings
are part of a big plan, okay?

851
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,119
And you have to tell all the young people

852
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,754
about the plan!

853
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:05,590
- What's the plan?

854
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:07,525
- The plan is to beat us down

855
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,937
and turn us into slaves!

856
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:12,263
If the kids knew the truth,

857
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:14,999
they'd get off their knees
and they'd fight back!

858
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:16,834
- You need to tell them that,
Doug, not me.

859
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:18,002
- Please, Doug.

860
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:19,303
You know what you have to do.

861
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,473
- You have the passion.
You understand it!

862
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:24,368
- I have nothing.

863
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:31,000
- That's not
what Spencer thought.

864
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:33,973
He believed in you.

865
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,310
He wanted you alive.

866
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:42,293
- I needed him

867
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:44,305
to stay alive.

868
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:46,464
- I know.

869
00:38:46,488 --> 00:38:48,655
He made you feel strong,
and now it hurts like hell.

870
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,372
Doug, you've spent your entire adult life

871
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:56,629
trying to make sense
out of a senseless act.

872
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:03,447
It's a burden the human heart
is not built to carry.

873
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:07,206
Especially not the heart
of a 16-year-old kid.

874
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,500
You have a choice, Doug.

875
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:14,091
Give yourself a chance.

876
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,694
Just put the gun down.

877
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:25,102
- No.

878
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:26,470
Just do it.

879
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:28,072
Just do it!

880
00:39:28,096 --> 00:39:32,343
- Truth bomb, Doug,
just like we talked about.

881
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:35,780
If you die in that jersey,
you'll be a hero

882
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:39,485
to all the kids out there
who grew up in fear!

883
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,920
- Don't listen to her, Doug.
That's your own fear talking.

884
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:44,522
- Fear?

885
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:45,523
Doug, I love you.

886
00:39:45,547 --> 00:39:47,917
I want your life to mean something.

887
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:57,168
- No!
- No!

888
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:10,214
I'm sorry, Molly!

889
00:40:10,238 --> 00:40:13,350
- You blew it, Doug.

890
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:14,752
You totally blew it.

891
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:28,132
- You all right, boss?

892
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:30,101
- Might need a stitch or two.

893
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,163
- Cool move, bro.

894
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:35,639
- Secret Service guy
taught me that a few years ago.

895
00:40:35,663 --> 00:40:37,274
He didn't tell me
it was gonna hurt like hell.

896
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:39,143
- We'll find someone
to kiss your booboo.

897
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,671
- Thanks.

898
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:49,720
You see the look on Doug's face?

899
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:52,578
Is that what it's like to be
a kid in school these days?

900
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,679
- Just tell her to call me.

901
00:41:15,703 --> 00:41:17,281
- Okay.

902
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,451
- Okay, I gotta go find my mom.

903
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:21,452
- No, no, no.

904
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:22,820
I'll go!

905
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:24,855
- So you walking
the whole way?

906
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:28,092
- Yeah, my mom said she would
meet me at the corner.

907
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:29,894
- Yeah!

908
00:41:29,918 --> 00:41:31,328
What's so funny?

909
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:33,731
- Olivia, wait!

910
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:38,335
- Dad!

911
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:39,703
- What took you so long,
sweetie?

912
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:40,905
I thought you missed the bus.

913
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:42,573
- Well, Gavin dropped
his water bottle

914
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:44,408
and it spilled up and down the aisle,

915
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:46,010
and we had to clean it up right away.

916
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:47,511
Because you know what?
- What?

917
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,847
- He had soda in it,
and that would stick.

918
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,482
- It's sticky.

919
00:41:51,506 --> 00:41:53,484
- But you're not supposed
to drink soda on the bus,

920
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:55,853
but Gavin breaks a lot of rules.

921
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:57,154
All the time.

922
00:41:57,178 --> 00:41:58,582
Come!

923
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:02,193
So, do you wanna know
what we did on the field trip?

924
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:03,928
- I wanna know everything.

925
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,996
- Well, we learned about
all the Greek gods

926
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,298
that the planets are named after,

927
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:10,122
and do you know that
since Jupiter is the biggest--

We could use somebody with your skills.

977
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,182
Hey, Jess.

978
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:54,250
I meant what I said.

979
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:56,007
We're going to find that girl.

980
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:04,294
What did this tool do?

981
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:06,262
It's for gapping the spark plug.

982
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:08,865
The gasoline won't fire
and the engine won't start

983
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:12,502
unless that tiny little gap
is just right.

984
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:13,937
Cool.

985
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,339
Auntie Louise called me yesterday.

986
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:17,840
Lulu? Really?

987
00:41:17,864 --> 00:41:20,143
Wow. How about that?

988
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:22,812
She said that she'd pick me
up after school tomorrow

989
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:24,347
and take me for coffee.

990
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:26,316
[LAUGHS] That sounds very grown up.

991
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,818
[GIGGLES] And ice cream too.

992
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:30,587
And I told Mrs. Wilkie

993
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:33,590
that I'd apologize to Jaden
for pushing him.

994
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:35,959
Well, that sounds like
the right thing to do.

995
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:37,360
How do you feel about it?

996
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,529
[SIGHS] Okay.

997
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:42,532
[HOPEFUL MUSIC]

998
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:44,189
Hey, Tali.

999
00:41:50,364 --> 00:41:53,494
I know it's been really,
really hard without your mom.

1000
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,290
But I want you to know that...

1001
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:00,001
If you ever need me,

1002
00:42:00,877 --> 00:42:03,019
I'll stop whatever it is I'm doing,

1003
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:05,048
and I'll come find you.

1004
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:08,009
You promise?

1005
00:42:08,947 --> 00:42:10,947
I promise.

1005
00:42:11,305 --> 00:43:11,476

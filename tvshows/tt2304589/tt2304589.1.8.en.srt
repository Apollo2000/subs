1
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,784
Yeah. Hey, Joanna.

2
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,078
No, it's okay.

3
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,582
What's going on?

4
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,089
What?

5
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,801
When?

6
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,806
Laurie.

7
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,684
Honey.

8
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:23,852
What?

9
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,897
It's over.

10
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,236
-What?
-He confessed.

11
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,113
Patz.

12
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,577
-I don't...
-Joanna just called.

13
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,080
Leonard Patz hung himself last night.

14
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,083
He left a note for the Rifkins.
It's a full confession.

15
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,669
The cops just confirmed his handwriting.

16
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,214
Are you sure?

17
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,550
Yeah.

18
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,305
I know it doesn't feel real, but it is.

19
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,434
Joanna's moving for a dismissal
first thing this morning.

20
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,727
Oh, my God.

21
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,439
I was so... I thought--

22
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,732
Don't.

23
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,693
Doesn't matter now.

24
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,820
It's over.

25
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,128
Jacob.

26
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,504
Wake up, buddy.

27
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,382
We got something to tell you.

28
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,635
Court, all rise.

29
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,679
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

30
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,140
The Honorable Judge French presiding.

31
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,601
This court's now open. Please be seated.

32
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,063
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
at 8:00 a.m. this morning,

33
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,984
the Commonwealth filed a nolle prosequi
announcing its decision

34
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,945
to drop the charges
against the defendant, Jacob Barber.

35
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,908
This is a response
to recent developments in the case

36
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,910
you, no doubt,
will be learning of shortly.

37
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,828
The defendant will please rise.

38
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,918
Young man, I'm sure you're anxious
to get out of here.

39
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,628
So let me be the first to say to you

40
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:17,466
the words you and your family are,
no doubt, longing to hear.

41
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,136
Jacob Barber, you are now a free man.

42
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:34,149
Jacob Owen Barber,
in the matter of indictment 08-44-07,

43
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,069
it is ordered by the court that you be
discharged of this indictment

44
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,779
and go without day.

45
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,157
Bail posted shall be returned
to the surety. Case dismissed.

46
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,460
We're gonna conduct an internal review

47
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,004
and issue a more detailed statement
at that time.

48
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,590
Right now, I only want
to express my heartfelt regret

49
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,927
at what both the Rifkin family
and the Barber family have had to endure

50
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,180
and my hope that they both find
some solace in a just outcome.

51
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,473
Thank you. No questions.

52
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,107
Obviously,
we are thrilled with this outcome.

53
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,860
But as you can imagine,
this family has been through a lot.

54
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,737
So we're gonna ask
that you respect their privacy

55
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,991
and allow them to process this ordeal.
Thank you very much.

56
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,284
Jacob, how do you feel?

57
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,078
Great.

58
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,039
Mr. Barber, will you be taking
civil action against the department?

59
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,462
Mrs. Barber, Mrs. Barber, this way!

60
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,187
-Joanna, I don't even have the words.
-Oh, please.

61
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,398
Andy's right. We couldn't have
gotten through any of this without you.

62
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,068
The best I could've done
was a verdict of not guilty.

63
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,404
This is a thousand times better.

64
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,698
This is proof of innocence.

65
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,535
-Congratulations, young man.
-Thank you, Joanna.

66
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,037
I know that this has been rough for you.

67
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,080
But I think that someday
you're gonna realize

68
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,709
that you have experienced something
that very few people ever have.

69
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,004
Dad?

70
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,548
-I know it was you.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

71
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,635
I know it was you! I know it! I know it!

72
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,845
-Let me go!
-Are you okay?

73
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,975
What do you want me to do with this guy?
Want me to hold him for the cops or what?

74
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,268
No!

75
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,063
No.

76
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,524
Let him go.

77
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,569
Please.

78
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,614
Come on. Get outta here.

79
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,618
He didn't do it, Dan.

80
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:57,668
You okay, kid?

81
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,545
Who the hell are you?

82
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,631
I'm an old friend of your pop's.
He asked me to look out for you.

83
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,926
Congratulations, by the way.

84
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,220
I guess it was your lucky day, huh, kid?

85
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,264
Get in the car.

86
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,769
I'll call you later.

87
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,732
Thank you.

88
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,526
Anything for old Billy.

89
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,365
Make sure
you give your old man my best, okay?

90
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,901
You're a free man. Attaboy!

91
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,195
Give us a smile, Jacob. A smile.

92
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,162
We're seeing our first images
of the Barber family

93
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,915
as they return to their home
in Newton, Massachusetts

94
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,918
after a remarkable turn of events
in the courtroom.

95
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,588
A trial that has captivated
so many people.

96
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,759
As you can see, there are smiles
on their faces, and who could blame them?

97
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,845
The Barber family can finally
spend some time together

98
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,890
as they celebrate
today's courtroom decision.

99
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,187
I remember that day so clearly.

100
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,733
It all felt so unreal.

101
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,903
It was real.

102
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,489
Of course.

103
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,618
So then? What?

104
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,163
Life just went back to normal?

105
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,748
No.

106
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,960
There was no normal to go back to.

107
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,964
It was just before...

108
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,677
and after.

109
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,823
Hey, honey.
I'm gonna make some coffee. You want some?

110
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,617
Hey.

111
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,661
What's going on?

112
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,416
That day in court,

113
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,752
when Derek read the story,
I was so sure.

114
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,258
In some crazy way, I was almost relieved.

115
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,512
I thought, "At least now I know."

116
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,642
What kind of mother
would think that about her child?

117
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,147
You were under a ton of stress.
We both were.

118
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,445
That story shook me up too.
More than I let on.

119
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,533
You just gotta let it go.

120
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,578
I'm trying.

121
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,215
One thing we knew for sure was that
there was nothing left for us here.

122
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,260
We knew we wanted to start over.
We just had to figure out where.

123
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,722
Laurie got a job offer in Colorado.

124
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,936
She was intrigued.
She just wanted to take it slow.

125
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,356
We figured this story
would follow us everywhere so...

126
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,651
why not get our feet wet here...

127
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,196
where we were wanted least of all.

128
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,491
-Thank you.
-Okay, be right there.

129
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,122
So I got a call from Claudia Hoffman
today confirming our reservation.

130
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,207
For what?

131
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,628
Oh. God, I completely forgot.

132
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,672
-What?
-Mexico.

133
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,842
Wow. Felt like forever ago.

134
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,135
Should've heard how nervous
she sounded on the phone.

135
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,554
Yeah, I bet.

136
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,099
Well, it's Christmas week, so if we
wanna cancel, we need to do it now.

137
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:26,895
I say we go.

138
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,651
Please do not.

139
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,194
Don't do that.

140
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,913
Hey. Finish your dinner.

141
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,336
So, how are you?

142
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,338
Curious.

143
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:58,343
You knew we had to have
this conversation sooner or later.

144
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,430
I mean, I suppose
we could've done it on the phone, but--

145
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,806
No, no, it's...

146
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,933
I don't mind.

147
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,186
It's good to see you.

148
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,688
You too, Andy.

149
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,858
Look, I know we can't undo
what we put you through.

150
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,277
I just hope you understand
the position I was in.

151
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,571
You were doing your job.

152
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,158
Anyway, I just want you to know

153
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,661
how much I appreciate the way you've
handled yourself through all of this.

154
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,206
-I didn't do anything.
-Exactly.

155
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,125
But you could've made life very hard
for me and you didn't.

156
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,127
So, thank you.

157
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,966
The last of your stuff.

158
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,969
I kept meaning to send it to you,

159
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:45,474
but I guess I was just trying to
postpone the inevitable.

160
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,852
You know, you could just stay.

161
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,482
Is that something you would ever consider?
Coming back?

162
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,567
No. Not really.

163
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,737
If I said Neal Logiudice is thinking about
transitioning to the private sector.

164
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,155
It's not about that.

165
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,661
I just can't do it anymore.

166
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,123
Not after being on the other side.

167
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,251
You sure?

168
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,963
Yeah. Very.

169
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,757
All right. Fair enough.

170
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,008
I had to ask.

171
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,763
For what it's worth, I think you should
try and hang on to Neal.

172
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,558
Good lawyer.

173
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,894
Picked up a few bad habits,
but maybe this was a wake-up call for him.

174
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,107
Right. Well, either way,
I'm gonna keep you on the payroll

175
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,984
until you figure out your next move,

176
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,736
so you should take
however long you need.

177
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,322
I intend to.

178
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,366
All right.

179
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,828
-Well, you'll give Laurie my best?
-Of course.

180
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,957
Oh, I almost forgot. The cops finally
wrapped up the Patz investigation.

181
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,293
I thought they already had.

182
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,962
I don't know. I guess there were
a few things that didn't totally add up.

183
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,797
Some minor details.
You know how these things are.

184
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,466
But it's closed now.
I thought you'd wanna know.

185
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,261
Yeah. Thank you.

186
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,202
You don't wanna be a tough guy tonight,
believe me.

187
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,591
-Hey.
-Hey.

188
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,926
How'd it go with Lynn?

189
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,179
It's fine. She sends her best.

190
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:48,931
Yeah, right.

191
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,225
Do you like this one?

192
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,435
Yeah. Yeah, it's nice.

193
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,395
They have it at the mall in Worcester.

194
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,232
It's a drive.

195
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,318
But I was thinking I could take Jake
with me tomorrow, make a day of it.

196
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,612
He's outgrown all his swim stuff.

197
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,157
Wanna join? You could use a new suit too.

198
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:13,872
No, I actually have that Skype
with the firm in Boulder.

199
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,208
Really? That's great.

200
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,295
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see.

201
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,633
What about this one?
Not in pink. Just the style.

202
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,052
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

203
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,220
It's nice.

204
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,695
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

205
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,368
Come on.

206
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,129
Did you do it?

207
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,884
Do what?

208
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,052
Father O'Leary, your buddy.

209
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,014
O'Leary? Never heard of him.

210
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,140
Bullshit.

211
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,225
He did a bid in here with you.

212
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,855
A lot of guys come through here.

213
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,656
Just tell me.

214
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,163
I just told you.
I don't know what you're talking about--

215
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,748
Don't fucking lie to me!

216
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,584
-Hey, man, I'm trying to talk here.
-Wanna keep it down, man?

217
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:51,345
I read the police report from
the crime scene at Patz's apartment.

218
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,973
Yeah, the kiddie-raper?

219
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,559
What about him?

220
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,650
Jesus Christ.

221
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,281
You did it. Didn't you?

222
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,747
I still don't know
what you're talking about.

223
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,178
The neighbors said they saw a car
hanging out around the complex that night.

224
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,640
An old Lincoln.

225
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,767
No plates.

226
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,480
She thought it was black, but it was
too dark outside to know for sure.

227
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,404
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

228
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,906
You know exactly what it means.

229
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,533
I don't know shit.

230
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,287
Except some piece
of human fucking garbage got his.

231
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,008
I don't know
what you're so broken up about.

232
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,177
One less animal in the world.

233
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,223
We didn't need you.

234
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,225
You sure about that?

235
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,895
Kid practically confessed.

236
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:23,979
He was innocent.

237
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,230
I don't give a shit.

238
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,609
I don't care if he did it or not.

239
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,446
You want your kid to spend
the rest of his life

240
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,072
in some fucking place like this?

241
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,827
This fucking grave?

242
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,709
Now, I'm not saying I even know
what you're talking about here,

243
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:50,339
but it sounds like whatever happened...

244
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,926
was for the best.

245
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,887
And if you can't see that...

246
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,766
maybe you're not as smart
as I thought you were.

247
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,687
I can't... I can't let you--

248
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,897
Careful, boy.

249
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,332
You wanna throw him back to the wolves?

250
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,254
Tell the cops this crazy fucking story.

251
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,674
Maybe they believe you.

252
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,344
And then what?

253
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,687
You can be a good man.

254
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,234
Or you can be a good father.

255
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,197
Me, I'm neither.

256
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,907
I know that.

257
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,705
But you get to choose.

258
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,516
It's been good seeing you, son.

259
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,522
Gettin' to know you a little.

260
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,028
I know this is probably it
for you and me.

261
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,280
But...

262
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,909
tell the boy...

263
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,915
if he ever wants to meet his grandpa...

264
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,877
he knows where to find me.

265
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,691
-Oh, my God. That is so gross.
-Hey, Dad.

266
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,610
Hey. How was your Skype?

267
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,529
They had to reschedule.

268
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,240
Oh, that's annoying.
You could've come with us.

269
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,826
Hey, tell your dad
that one you just told me.

270
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,163
Why was the cannibal
disappointed by the restaurant?

271
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,248
Why?

272
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,624
It's called Five Guys.

273
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,002
You eaten?

274
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,295
No, not yet.

275
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,017
Did you try it on?

276
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,104
The swimsuit I bought you.

277
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,481
Yeah.

278
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:39,401
And?

279
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:40,777
I like it.

280
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,447
You told me you like it. Does it fit?

281
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,533
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It fits great.
Thank you.

282
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,331
Jake thought it'd be funny
if I bought you a Speedo.

283
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:00,839
You okay?

284
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,800
Yeah. Why?

285
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:08,514
I don't know. You seemed
kind of out of it tonight, even at dinner.

286
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,849
Well, I'm fine. Just...

287
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,231
Just got a lot on my mind.

288
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:18,607
Like what?

289
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,735
The move and career.

290
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,781
And what about it?

291
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:36,875
I don't know. Just part of me feels like
we should get out now, you know?

292
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,336
It doesn't have to be Colorado.
We can go anywhere.

293
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,380
I thought you like Colorado.

294
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,257
-No, I do. I like Colorado.
-We don't have to go there.

295
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,675
It's not that. I just--

296
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,135
I think I'm ready.

297
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,936
All the waiting around
is just getting to me. That's all.

298
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,772
Okay.

299
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,945
I think I'm ready too.

300
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:10,492
When we get back, we can put
the house on the market, make a plan.

301
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,035
Yeah?

302
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:13,620
Yeah.

303
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,918
I wish you'd said something sooner.

304
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,589
Well, I didn't want to rush you.

305
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,632
Doesn't mean we couldn't talk about it.

306
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,303
We agreed. This is how it's gonna be now.

307
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,305
No more secrets.

308
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,269
It's "FUNintheSUN."

309
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:21,438
What?

310
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,065
The Wi-Fi password.

311
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,067
It's "FUNintheSUN." All one word.

312
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,568
"Fun" and "sun" are in caps.

313
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,570
Thank you.

314
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,325
Can I ask?

315
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,995
Are you... Jacob Barber?

316
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,458
Yeah.

317
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,044
Wow.

318
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,713
I mean, I thought so,
but I wasn't entirely sure.

319
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:49,800
It must be kind of weird
getting recognized.

320
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,306
Andy, look.

321
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:00,894
Yeah, I bet.

322
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:06,817
All set.

323
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:08,694
Thank you.

324
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,124
So how was Mexico?

325
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,876
It was everything we hoped for.

326
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,211
It was paradise.

327
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:46,940
What?

328
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,861
Stop it. It's embarrassing.

329
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,113
You just seem so content.

330
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:54,615
I am.

331
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,703
I'm gonna grab another one of these.
You want one?

332
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,414
Seriously? It's not even noon.

333
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,171
Andy, look.

334
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,511
She seems so sweet.

335
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,263
I've always liked that name, "Hope."

336
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,934
Apparently, she's an older woman.
Sixteen.

337
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,815
You said you met the mom?

338
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,902
Yeah, at the fitness center.
They're from Toronto.

339
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:36,240
And... she knows?

340
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,618
I have to assume.

341
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,204
Seemed okay with it.

342
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,587
Sure you don't want another one?

343
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,256
Maybe later.

344
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,876
Let's talk about Hope Connors...

345
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,503
the girl that Jacob met at the hotel.

346
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,339
From what I understand,
they spent a lot of time together.

347
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,466
Some.

348
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,093
She posted a picture of the two of them.

349
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,888
Caused a lot of excitement back home.

350
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,974
I guess Jacob was something
of a celebrity.

351
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:48,770
Do you know if they spoke about his case?

352
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:50,856
I have no idea.

353
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,900
But it's possible.

354
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,153
He may have even confided in her.

355
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,405
I just said I had no idea.

356
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,159
And there was nothing to confide.

357
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,706
Tell me about New Year's Eve.

358
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,879
So it's a party?

359
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:17,174
It's more like a bonfire, I think.
It's just down the beach.

360
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:18,884
But past the hotel?

361
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,220
Yeah, but, I mean, just past.

362
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,141
Hope says it's really close.

363
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,727
Her parents are okay with it?

364
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,813
Yeah. I don't think
we'll be out that late anyways.

365
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,148
Oh, I know you won't.

366
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,776
So, then... yes?

367
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:42,282
You need to text us when you get there
and when you leave. Understand?

368
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,784
Okay.

369
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,202
I mean it.

370
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,954
Yes. Thanks.

371
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:54,503
It was...

372
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:58,423
Danny something.

373
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,925
With the big glasses. Harkaway?

374
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,386
-Harkavey.
-Harkavey! Yes!

375
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,221
-Didn't he work for DWP?
-Yeah, he did.

376
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,850
And anytime anybody asked, he'd say,
"I clean the water that you drink."

377
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,184
Oh, my God.

378
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,103
God, he was so weird.

379
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:13,564
That was such a great apartment though.

380
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:15,816
Feels like a lifetime ago.

381
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,317
It really does.

382
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,951
We're here.

383
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,203
We made it.

384
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,461
Should I order another bottle?

385
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,049
Only if we can bring it up to the room.

386
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,096
You sure that's when it was?

387
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,683
It wasn't. I know it was on our honeymoon
because I was already--

388
00:30:58,859 --> 00:30:59,860
Hi.

389
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,654
I thought you were gonna text us
before you left.

390
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,990
Yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

391
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,827
You guys have fun at the party?

392
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,247
She was more into it than me.

393
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,417
-How was dinner?
-It was really nice.

394
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,629
Didn't you have your white shirt on?

395
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,673
I left it at the beach by accident.

396
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:24,009
You guys didn't wanna hang out downstairs,
watch the fireworks?

397
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,595
No. She stayed actually.

398
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:27,763
At the beach?

399
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,224
Her parents were okay with that?

400
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,518
I guess. She said she'd text them.

401
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:34,895
Trouble in paradise?

402
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:39,566
You know, you and Hope.

403
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,612
No, not really. I just don't like parties

404
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,073
with drunk idiots
and shitty music, that's all.

405
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,038
Well, we're gonna watch the ball drop
in our room. You wanna join us?

406
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,040
It's okay. I'm good.

407
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:56,875
All right.

408
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,002
Happy New Year, sweetheart.

409
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,379
-Happy New Year, pal.
-You too.

410
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,658
-Mrs. Barber?
-Yes?

411
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,035
The police like to have a word
with your son.

412
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,667
-I'm sorry, what is this regarding?
-It's about a missing person.

413
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:41,962
Hold on, hold on.

414
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,590
They have to take your cards, ma'am.

415
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,466
-They're asking where is your husband--
-I don't understand.

416
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,177
-Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?
-Andy.

417
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,596
-Hey, hey, hey.
-It's okay. It's my family.

418
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:51,680
It's okay.

419
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:54,474
What's going on?

420
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,146
Hope Connors didn't come back last night.
The police want to talk to Jacob.

421
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,733
-We have to take him right now. I'm sorry.
-Okay.

422
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,401
-Okay, okay. Come on, Jacob.
-Please, follow me.

423
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,361
-Please, this way.
-Okay.

424
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,273
What time did Jacob say
he had last seen her?

425
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,195
It was around 8:00, 8:15.

426
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:53,575
He said that... they got in
an argument on the way to the party.

427
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:54,993
Something stupid.

428
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:58,372
She liked an actor that he didn't,
and it got awkward.

429
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:02,835
And then he just decided
he didn't want to stay.

430
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,587
And she did. So he left.

431
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,047
And did you believe him?

432
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,507
Of course.

433
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,885
-Did Laurie?
-Yes.

434
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,179
-Right away or--
-We both believed him.

435
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,473
What about the police?

436
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:23,272
They thought he was lying.
They thought we were covering for him.

437
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:28,819
They questioned us for about three hours.

438
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,157
The great white shark,
also known as the great white...

439
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,036
Took our passports,
asked us not to leave the hotel.

440
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:44,333
...which can be found in the coastal
surface waters of all the major oceans.

441
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,795
The great white shark is notable
for its size.

442
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,757
By the time we went to bed,
she had been missing for 24 hours.

443
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:57,681
I can't believe this is happening.

444
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:04,771
His shirt...

445
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,776
He said he left it at the beach.

446
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:11,612
Yeah?

447
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:16,992
Nothing.

448
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,203
It's nothing.

449
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,026
Andy.

450
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:35,779
What are you doing out here?

451
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:38,657
Hey.

452
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,667
I didn't know.

453
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,045
About what?

454
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:55,799
It's all right.

455
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,719
Whatever it is, we can talk about it.

456
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,183
Did Jacob say something to you?

457
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:10,564
Then tell me.

458
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,650
Leonard Patz.

459
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:17,863
What?

460
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,408
He didn't kill himself.

461
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,287
It was my father.

462
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,209
That's impossible.

463
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,591
How could he--

464
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:44,306
Oh, my God. The Lincoln.

465
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,893
It was that man.

466
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:50,854
He killed him?

467
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:54,399
Oh, my God.

468
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:56,485
Oh, my God.

469
00:37:57,152 --> 00:38:00,155
-Then Jacob was never really innocent.
-It doesn't mean that.

470
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,074
Of course it means that.

471
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:05,911
Of course it does.
Why else would you be telling me this?

472
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:08,705
Do the police know?

473
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,207
Nobody knows.

474
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,378
At least not yet.

475
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:18,757
You think he had something
to do with Hope.

476
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:19,883
Oh, my God.

477
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:21,426
I don't know.

478
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:33,856
Do you want me to tell the police?

479
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,118
Laurie. Laurie.

480
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:47,953
No. I need to go inside.

481
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,379
And then?

482
00:38:58,672 --> 00:38:59,798
Then they found her.

483
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:19,151
Police said she had met some guy
at the party.

484
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,861
He slipped something in her drink.

485
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:21,945
Hope!

486
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,495
Took her back to his place.

487
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,998
Luckily,
his buddy panicked and called the cops.

488
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,043
You must have been relieved.

489
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,296
Everyone was.

490
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:42,883
Even Laurie?

491
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:45,469
What do you think?

492
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,972
I think finding yourselves
in such an eerily similar situation

493
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:52,643
must have dredged up
a lot of old anxieties.

494
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,895
Lot of old fears.

495
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:59,525
You flew home the same afternoon.
Skipped the last three days of your trip.

496
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:00,442
So?

497
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,569
I'd have thought you would have had
cause to celebrate.

498
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:03,946
Jacob was exonerated.

499
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,658
We just wanted to go home.

500
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:21,713
-Do you want to talk about what happened?
-No.

501
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,801
When then?

502
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,763
I don't know. Maybe never.

503
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:48,740
He called them Job stories.

504
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:51,994
Did Job post a story
about the murder of Ben Rifkin?

505
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,413
"If Brent knew the real Jason,
he would have been scared shitless.

506
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:55,956
He curled his fingers around the grip

507
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,667
and felt a surge of power through his arm,
up into his shoulder.

508
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,795
Brent saw the knife coming for him, but
it was too late to do anything but stare.

509
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,047
It slipped in so easily,
Jason thought he was stabbing air.

510
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,675
He did it twice more, telling his brain
to remember the feeling."

511
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:10,262
What if you knew in your heart
that our son did this unforgivable thing?

512
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,181
"He went down to Brent's body
to make sure he was dead.

513
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:13,891
The smell of blood in the air
made him feel dizzy."

514
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:18,812
What if I just didn't look closely enough?
Then in a way, isn't this all my fault?

515
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:53,305
Do you understand
the cell division process?

516
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:02,606
Okay.

517
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,530
Yeah. I think so.

518
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,585
Something changed in Mexico.

519
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,921
Something happened to Laurie.

520
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,010
This is ridiculous.

521
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:34,930
You put your house on the market
less than two weeks after you got home.

522
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:36,139
That was always the plan.

523
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,350
Neither one of you had a job
waiting for you in Colorado.

524
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,102
You hadn't even decided where to live.

525
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:43,230
-So?
-So? What were you running from?

526
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:46,567
What changed?
What happened between you and Laurie?

527
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,110
Nothing. I just told you.

528
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:50,779
Then why isn't she here today, Andy?

529
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,953
Why isn't Laurie here today?

530
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:12,467
-I have to run some errands.
-Okay.

531
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,638
Hey, remember this?

532
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,019
I'll be back later.

533
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,580
Have you just been secretly honing
your Othello skills?

534
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,417
It's all about taking the corners.
You taught me that.

535
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:48,253
Yes.

536
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,426
Where'd you say Mom went again?
Kind of hungry.

537
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:57,513
She just ran out to grab a few things.
She'll be back soon.

538
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:03,560
What's going on with her?

539
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,981
What do you mean?

540
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:14,780
She just seems really...
I don't know, more quiet than usual.

541
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:19,535
Well, she's got a lot on her mind.

542
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,662
You know, packing and the move.

543
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,918
I think we just gotta give her time.

544
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:40,889
What?

545
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:45,060
It's your turn.

546
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:54,069
I can't find a move.

547
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,240
It's 'cause you don't have one.

548
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:56,275
Laurie?

549
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:09,371
I didn't know you were down here.

550
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,832
Yeah. Lot of stuff to go through.

551
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:16,253
I was gonna go to bed.

552
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:17,921
Okay.

553
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,593
Jake's overdue for a haircut.
If you want, I can take him tomorrow.

554
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:24,553
No, I can go.

555
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,472
-You sure? I don't mind doing it.
-No, I know what to tell him.

556
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,391
Okay.

557
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:34,062
I think he's worried about you.

558
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,941
So am I.

559
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,696
I don't know what you want me to say.

560
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,239
Nothing. Just...

561
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,579
It's like living with a ghost.

562
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,625
-I don't know if you're punishing me or--
-I'm not.

563
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,376
Then what is it?

564
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:06,136
The way that you look at him...

565
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:13,852
I'm just trying to figure out
how to move on from here.

566
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,483
Isn't that what we're doing?

567
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:21,902
Laurie...

568
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:32,913
If you just want to take some time...

569
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,542
by yourself, the move can wait.

570
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:42,130
Just want to get away and...

571
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:45,676
decide what you wanna do.

572
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:48,679
Maybe.

573
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:52,975
Okay.

574
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,101
Whatever you need.

575
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:56,728
I mean it.

576
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,319
I love you, Laurie.

577
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:09,366
I know that might not mean much...

578
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:11,869
but I do.

579
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,102
I don't want to go too short.

580
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:23,065
Just, like, trim around the ears
and the back, like last time.

581
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,651
Sure.

582
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:34,076
I'm trying to remember.

583
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:39,581
Last year, when it was all happening...

584
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,418
I don't think I ever just asked you.

585
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:45,212
Not directly.

586
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,383
I guess I was just scared
of what they might do to you.

587
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:52,719
But they can't hurt you now.

588
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:54,721
No one can.

589
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:38,849
Still, would you have told me the truth?

590
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:43,812
If I promised to love you no matter what,
would you tell me?

591
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:46,773
Jacob.

592
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:51,278
Did you kill Ben?

593
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,532
What?

594
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,701
No. You know I didn't.

595
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:01,246
What if I said I don't believe you?

596
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:05,000
-What?
-A man died, Jacob.

597
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,919
You don't know this,
but a man was murdered

598
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:08,670
so that you could go free.

599
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:10,422
-So I have to know.
-Know what?

600
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:12,466
Did you kill Ben? Just tell me the truth,

601
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,635
-I did tell you. What's wrong with you?
-I will love you no matter what.

602
00:52:14,718 --> 00:52:16,094
I don't believe you.

603
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:19,973
Mom, you're driving too fast.

604
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,725
Why would you write that story?

605
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,019
-Mom, slow down.
-All the details, the little things.

606
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:25,479
I made it up. Slow down.

607
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,314
I don't think you did. I'm sorry.

608
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:30,484
If I just knew the truth.

609
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,110
I made it up. Just slow down!

610
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,488
Mom, slow down!

611
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,031
If I only knew what happened.

612
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:38,408
-Fine! I killed him, okay?
-You did?

613
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:40,994
Whatever you want! Just slow down, please.

614
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,998
-I want the truth.
-Slow down. Slow down, Mom.

615
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:46,959
But I'll never know, will I?

616
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,544
-Just slow down.
-I will never know.

617
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:50,462
-Mom!
-I will never know.

618
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:51,964
Mom, you're driving too fast.

619
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:54,132
-I can't do it anymore, Jacob.
-You sound crazy!

620
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,176
-I can't do it.
-Mom, you're scaring me. Slow down.

621
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,427
Mom, please!

622
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:58,804
-I love you.
-Please!

623
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:00,430
-I love you and your father both.
-Mom!

624
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,932
Stop! Mom!

625
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,016
Mom!

626
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:01,950
I need to ask you again.

627
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,246
Why isn't Laurie here today?

628
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,211
On February 22, nearly six weeks ago,

629
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:15,881
you received a call from the Massachusetts
State Police. Is that correct?

630
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,842
You were told
that there had been an accident.

631
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:23,305
That Laurie and Jacob were in a car
that had gone off the road.

632
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:25,432
That both mother and son had been rushed

633
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:28,393
to the intensive care unit
of Newton General.

634
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:35,984
The officer explained that
there were no other cars involved.

635
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:39,821
That there were witnesses,
other drivers,

636
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:43,033
who saw your wife's car
swerve suddenly off the road.

637
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:45,869
-She was speeding.
-I'm sorry?

638
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:50,082
I said she was speeding. It was raining,
and she was driving too fast.

639
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:53,502
None of these witnesses reported
seeing any attempt by the driver

640
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,295
to right the vehicle or apply the brake.

641
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,339
She was speeding, and she lost control.

642
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,967
Did she? Lose control?

643
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:01,802
That's not what I meant.

644
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:04,638
Joanna Klein, Jacob's prior attorney...

645
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,517
told investigators that she received
two missed calls from your wife

646
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,979
between the hours of 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.
on the morning of the crash.

647
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,272
Both hang-ups.

648
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:16,108
Why do you suppose she was trying
to get in touch with Jacob's attorney?

649
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:18,151
I don't know. Joanna is a friend.

650
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:19,903
Is Elizabeth Vogel a friend?

651
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:23,365
Phone records show that there was a call
from Laurie's phone

652
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:27,077
to Dr. Vogel's office at 3:18 a.m.

653
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:30,372
This sounds to me like a woman
who was distraught.

654
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:33,542
Did she get any sleep at all that night?

655
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:37,254
Andy.

656
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:43,218
You said you wanted the truth to come out,
but you're not telling the truth.

657
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:45,053
Yes, I am. It was an accident.

658
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,014
It was not an accident.

659
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:50,017
She tried to kill her son. Your son.

660
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:55,480
I understand
why you don't want to help us.

661
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,610
But Jacob is owed justice.

662
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:05,949
Nobody here blames you, Andy.

663
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,370
You're a victim,
but you need to be strong.

664
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,583
You would do anything for your son,
I know that.

665
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,001
No matter how painful.

666
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:25,093
Help us.

667
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:31,141
Help us deliver justice.

668
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:34,645
That's all we want.

669
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,440
Justice for Jacob.

670
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:40,943
For you.

671
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,285
Andy.

672
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,168
She was speeding.

673
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:02,673
It was raining.

674
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,467
And it was an accident.

675
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:22,025
There's a decision.

676
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:43,815
Hey, pal.

677
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,277
All good.

678
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:52,634
Well?

679
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:54,595
They voted.

680
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:00,517
No bill.

681
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:03,896
What does that mean?

682
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,608
It means no indictment.

683
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,651
It means they know it was an accident.

684
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:14,865
-Really? Are they sure?
-Yeah.

685
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,174
I went to see him again today.

686
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:33,926
I read to him.

687
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:39,640
The nurse says they're optimistic.

688
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,392
-They're seeing some encouraging signs.
-Yeah.

689
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:44,228
They are.

690
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,609
When he wakes up,

691
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:53,070
what if he thinks that I...

692
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:01,912
He won't.

693
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:07,709
I keep trying to remember that day.

694
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:08,919
Don't.

695
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:12,256
It was an accident. That's all it was.

696
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,385
It was just an accident.

697
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:26,728
I just want our family back.

698
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:33,902
So do I.

699
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:43,287
Try to get some rest.

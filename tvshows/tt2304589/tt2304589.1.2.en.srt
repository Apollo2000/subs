1
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,994
So don't wanna go for my run.

2
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,585
We need to talk.

3
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,592
One.

4
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,643
Two.

5
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,219
Three!

6
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,481
What?

7
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,856
You wanna tell us what this is?

8
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,485
You were snooping in my room?

9
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,201
I was. Not your mother.
That's not the point.

10
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,485
It's just something I got.
It's not a big deal.

11
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,747
Not a big deal?

12
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,208
Then why didn't you tell us?

13
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,208
I only hid it because
I knew you'd freak out.

14
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,500
You got that part right.

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,793
Did you buy it online?

16
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,173
No, at the army-navy store in town.

17
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,684
I paid for it, by the way,
with my own money.

18
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,759
I'm just saying.

19
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,469
When was this?

20
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,644
I don't know. Couple months ago.

21
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,812
Ever bring it to school?

22
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,393
Just once, to show some people.

23
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,476
Who?

24
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,566
Derek, Dylan.
I was just like, "Hey, check this out."

25
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,703
Have you ever used it?

26
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,112
Like for what?

27
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,156
For whatever you use a knife for.

28
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,535
You read Derek's post, didn't you?

29
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,540
- Why would he write that?
- 'Cause he's an asshole. That's why.

30
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,793
You didn't answer my question.
Have you ever used it?

31
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,126
Like to stab somebody?

32
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,508
No. How could you even ask me that?

33
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,839
Because I have to.

34
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,803
Because I have to know
with absolute certainty

35
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,144
that this isn't the knife
they're looking for.

36
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,926
- Well?
- Andy, he just told you.

37
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,975
Can't believe this,
that you even think that about me.

38
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,519
- Of course we don't.
- Yeah, whatever.

39
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,563
Hey, hey.
Look, we believe every word you've said.

40
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,817
We just wanna know why
Derek wrote what he wrote.

41
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,530
We thought he was your friend.

42
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,610
He is.

43
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,196
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,740
Jake, he accused you of murder
in a public forum.

45
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,624
No one means what they say on there.

46
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,041
That's what kids do, they just talk shit
and they try to sound cool.

47
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,121
That's all it is.

48
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,754
So you're not at all bothered
by what he wrote?

49
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:17,344
I mean... Yes, I am, a little bit,
but he was just being a dick.

50
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,301
No one takes it seriously.

51
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,428
Honest.

52
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,886
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the knife, okay?

53
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,766
Can I have it back now?

54
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,978
That's not even remotely funny.

55
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,068
Well... I bought it. It's mine.

56
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,153
Not anymore.

57
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,451
I'm gonna be late for school.

58
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,827
Well, I can drive you,
if you wanna wait a few.

59
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,291
No, it's fine. I'll walk.

60
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,673
What time will you be home?

61
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,503
I don't know. I might stay for math.

62
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,002
Come here.

63
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,593
I love you, okay?

64
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,677
Love you too.

65
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,758
Hey.

66
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,852
I shouldn't have yelled.

67
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,815
God. Fucking Derek.
What kind of idiot writes that online?

68
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,200
So what do we do now?

69
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,445
Do we need to report it?

70
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,076
No. God, no. What's to report?

71
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,503
It's just he's been accused
and we know about it.

72
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,923
It's not like the police
aren't going to find out anyway.

73
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,342
- It's right there online.
- It's not a credible accusation.

74
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,051
There's no reason to bring
the whole world down on Jacob's head.

75
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,892
Trust me, it's better just to let this go.

76
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,678
What do we do with it?

77
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,475
I don't know. I'll put it somewhere.

78
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you sure?

79
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,769
Honey, it's not a crime to own a knife
or to be a stupid teenager.

80
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,197
Thank God.
We'd have to lock up half of 'em.

81
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,881
And here you go.

82
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,630
Hi.

83
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,554
- Can I help you?
- I certainly hope so.

84
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,263
And she wanted this item we didn't have.

85
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,144
So I try to explain that we don't have it.

86
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:32,603
But she was supposed to get it,
so she starts flipping out.

87
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,313
And then she started yelling at me,
throwing a tantrum.

88
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,066
I was, like, getting nervous.

89
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,778
'Cause she was coming at my neck,
so then eventually I called the security.

90
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,240
Guard came, tackled her right down.

91
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,577
Since when do we even have security?

92
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,038
Turns out we do.
And they're pretty good as well.

93
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,121
I'm sure it is.

94
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,340
Leonard Patz.

95
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,089
Detective Peterson.
Newton Police Department.

96
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,097
I'd like to ask you some questions, sir.

97
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

98
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,324
I can't stop thinking about it.

99
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,993
I have to assume that every kid in school
has seen those posts.

100
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,033
Their parents too, probably.

101
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,486
Cara gave me this look
this morning when I came in.

102
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,447
Her daughter's a sophomore
at the high school.

103
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,578
Honey, if people wanna gossip,
they're gonna gossip.

104
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,916
It doesn't mean anything.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,550
- I was thinking I should call Dina.
- Who?

106
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,258
Dina Yoo. Maybe she has some insight
into what's going on with the boys.

107
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,510
At the very least I could ask her
to talk to Derek.

108
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,972
Tell him not to post any more
of these reckless comments.

109
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,103
I think that's a mistake. My gut says
that if Jacob's not upset by it, then...

110
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,731
He says he wasn't upset.
That doesn't mean he isn't.

111
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,598
Honey, I got to jump off.
I'm at the station.

112
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,517
There may have been a break in the case.

113
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,565
- Really?
- Yeah, there's a guy we like for it.

114
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,989
The cops just picked him up,
so I got to get in there.

115
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,108
Okay.

116
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,914
I hope it's something.
You'll call me later?

117
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,532
Of course. Bye.

118
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,615
Bye.

119
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,182
Same kind of kid
you showed interest in before.

120
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,086
- Morning.
- Hey, morning.

121
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,595
How's it going?

122
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,429
Well, they got him to admit
to being in the park the morning of.

123
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,515
And that's it so far.

124
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,689
- What, you got him in the broom closet?
- It's the remodel.

125
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,186
The interrogation room is
the only room we don't use that much.

126
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,534
Is my lawyer here yet?

127
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,152
You said my lawyer was coming.

128
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,695
She's on her way.

129
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,657
Look, I never hurt anyone, okay?

130
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,918
- Just look at my file. You'll see.
- This has nothing to do with your file.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,500
We're just trying to get a clear picture
of what happened in the park.

132
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,456
You can understand why we'd be curious.

133
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,966
Same kind of kid you went after
last time. Same type.

134
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,641
I'm not feeling very well.

135
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,854
You want something from the machines?

136
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,773
No, thank you.

137
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,303
We're pissing in the wind.

138
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,933
- How long you been at him?
- Almost an hour now.

139
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,637
Good, let him sit. Get him thinking.

140
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,760
We don't have that kind of time.
His lawyer's on the way.

141
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,268
This is what I was worried about.

142
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,769
- Take another run at him.
- Andy.

143
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,981
Tell him you found the knife.
See if that gets you anything.

144
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,731
What?

145
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,566
I don't think he's our guy.

146
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,700
I can't pin it down. It's just a hunch.

147
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,993
I'm on the fence,
but I'm not feeling it either.

148
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,203
This is our only lead.

149
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,293
I'm getting pressure from my office,
from the community.

150
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,288
You don't think I'm feeling it too?
It's all I hear about.

151
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,632
- If you want us to try again...
- I do.

152
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,963
You're the boss.

153
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,016
I have a headache. Can I please go?

154
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,396
Leonard, we're trying to exclude you here.

155
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,610
We wanna rule you out.

156
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,191
Okay.

157
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,900
Well, I told you.

158
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,988
I was in the park
because I walk there every morning.

159
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,040
And I was nowhere near
where the kid got killed.

160
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,246
I never go that way. Ever.

161
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,092
I mean, I don't even know who the kid is.

162
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,628
You know, I've never seen him.
Never heard of him.

163
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,222
You know.

164
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,089
What about the knife?

165
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,555
What knife?

166
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,850
Do you own a knife?

167
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,977
I mean, yeah, I have some for cooking.

168
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,312
How many would you say?

169
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,066
- Did you say 207?
- Yeah, that's right.

170
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,318
Okay. Thank you.

171
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,780
I don't know.

172
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,783
Andy, don't tell me
this stunt was your doing.

173
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,534
Joanna. Patz is yours?

174
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,366
No. I'm just covering for a friend.

175
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,202
May I see Mr. Patz, please?

176
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,367
He's only here as a potential witness,
not a suspect.

177
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,496
Right,
and I just got drafted by the Celtics.

178
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,753
You need to come clean.

179
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,416
You got a real class act here.

180
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,383
You read his file? I tell you,
I don't know how you guys do it sometimes.

181
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,224
Now that is a shame,
because you would be good at it.

182
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,470
Trust me on this.

183
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,642
Of course, you'll switch off
the camera and the microphone.

184
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Yeah, of course.

185
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,515
We'll give you another room,
if you want one.

186
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,768
That's not necessary.
We won't be here long.

187
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,943
Besides, I trust ya.

188
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,689
Enough to let me keep questioning him?

189
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,861
No. I trust you too much for that.

190
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,399
Detectives.

191
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,784
Mr. Patz, I'm Joanna Klein.

192
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:41,993
You're my lawyer?

193
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,494
Just for today.

194
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:47,454
Ms. Cronin is stuck in court.
She asked me to fill in for her.

195
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:48,786
Okay.

196
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:04,552
The final answer is therefore 5X.

197
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,018
- Did you see what he wrote?
- I can't...

198
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,849
If you have 2X...

199
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,356
Derek is always saying shit.

200
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,321
Attention, please. This is a reminder
to those students who have signed up

201
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,406
to help the police
search Cold Spring Park.

202
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,701
We will be gathering in the lower
gymnasium at 2:45 this afternoon

203
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,746
and walking to the park as a group.

204
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,666
- Sorry, sorry. My bad.
- My fault.

205
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,052
All right, I'll see you.

206
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,218
I...

207
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,764
I think you should know
Derek's been saying some shit about you.

208
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,023
Like, really bad.

209
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,941
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I saw what he said online.

210
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,941
Not just that stuff he said online.

211
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,153
There's other things too.

212
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,570
Sarah!

213
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,124
Sarah!

214
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,949
We should maybe talk later, okay?

215
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,328
Yeah. All right.

216
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,252
Did you get the Global assignment?

217
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,714
I missed this morning
for the stupid orthodontist.

218
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,795
Yeah, sure.

219
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,181
Please report to the group leaders
you've been assigned to.

220
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,976
If you do not have an assignment,
the tables back here have volunteers.

221
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,560
They will be happy to assign
a group leader to you.

222
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,816
Again, please report to the group
you've been assigned to.

223
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,655
If you do not have an assignment,

224
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,240
the volunteers at any of these tables
can assign a group leader to you.

225
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,475
Mr. Barber.

226
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,640
Any luck so far?

227
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,898
No, not yet, but we still got
a couple hours of daylight left.

228
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,898
Okay if I hang back here?

229
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,283
Sure, wherever you want.

230
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,869
Half the town came out to the park
to search for the missing knife.

231
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,121
You didn't take part
in that search, did you?

232
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:36,826
I did not.

233
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,328
Why was that?

234
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,418
Prosecutor never takes part
in a search like that, and you know it.

235
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,005
You run the risk of becoming
a witness in your own case.

236
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,010
Or could it be that you knew that
the knife that they were searching for

237
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,804
had already been found and disposed of?

238
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:56,138
Jesus Christ, you got to be kidding me.
What is this, Perry Mason?

239
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:04,823
Did you or did you not
find a knife in your son's room?

240
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,243
You know I did.
Jacob told the detectives that himself.

241
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,699
And where is that knife now?

242
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,030
- Getting in the weeds here, Neal.
- Let me worry about the weeds, Andy.

243
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,155
Jacob's knife was never found.

244
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,826
What happened to it?

245
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,958
Andy?

246
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,920
- I threw it away.
- You mean you got rid of it.

247
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,387
No, I mean I threw it away.
The same way any parent would.

248
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,929
But you weren't just any parent.

249
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,432
I was protecting him
from his own stupidity.

250
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,523
I was being a father.

251
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:43,482
You mean to tell me that you aren't
the least bit troubled by your actions?

252
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,823
Even now,
after everything that's happened?

253
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,441
No. It was the wrong knife.

254
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,238
But how could you possibly know that?

255
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,744
You never turned it in for forensic
testing, for blood or fiber traces.

256
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,866
I didn't need testing. I knew my son.

257
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,913
That's it? That's your justification?

258
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,035
"I knew my son"?

259
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,796
I knew my son.

260
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,930
Dispatch, this is 1-Baker-1.

261
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,261
- Thanks, Dave.
- You bet.

262
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,385
We've got two units heading to the corner.

263
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,522
You want them posted up there, correct?

264
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
That's correct, 1-Baker-1.

265
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:28,438
...624. We're at Beechwood Road.

266
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,735
We've got that area covered.

267
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,156
Dan?

268
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,950
Someone told me they saw you.
What the hell are you doing here?

269
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,035
Where else would I be?

270
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,659
I told him. I said I want another DA.

271
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,367
Someone who's not just gonna
sit on his hands.

272
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,955
Dan, I don't know
what I've done to upset you.

273
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,455
It doesn't matter.
They're taking you off the case.

274
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,173
Excuse me?

275
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,717
You don't believe me?
Call your boss. Go ahead.

276
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,178
You talked to Lynn?

277
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,562
You're out, Andy.

278
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,601
Thank fucking God.

279
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,846
Dan. Dan!

280
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,985
Lynn Canavan's office.

281
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,698
- It's Andy Barber.
- Yes. Just a minute.

282
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,117
- Hello, Andy.
- Lynn, hi. Listen, I...

283
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,082
I need you to come down here right away.

284
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:25,915
Is something wrong?

285
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,959
Just come back to the office.
Okay? Please.

286
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,049
We need to talk face-to-face.

287
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,129
Yeah, okay.

288
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,532
Copy that.

289
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:21,846
Mr. Barber.

290
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,389
DA asked us to escort you in.

291
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,769
- You serious?
- Yeah.

292
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,939
Jesus Christ.

293
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:43,237
- How you doing, Kingston?
- Hanging in there, Mr. Barber. You good?

294
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,503
I don't think so, no.

295
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,642
Did you really need all this, Lynn?

296
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,142
What do you think I'm gonna do,
jump out the window?

297
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:07,555
It's simply protocol.

298
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,811
- Are you firing me?
- Nobody's getting fired.

299
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,225
You know Reiko Ishida from public affairs.

300
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,524
Mr. Barber.

301
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,687
Have a seat, Andy.

302
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,082
We have some bad news on the Rifkin case.

303
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,091
The print we lifted
from the victim's sweatshirt...

304
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,299
it's from your son.

305
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,006
Wait. What?

306
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,386
It's a match for his right forefinger.

307
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,062
From the angle,
they think maybe he reached over

308
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,021
and grabbed the victim by his sweatshirt,

309
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,272
leaving a print on the tag.

310
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,733
- There's got to be an explanation.
- I'm sure there is.

311
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,694
They go to the same school.
Jacob's in his class.

312
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:56,784
Yes, we know that.

313
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,899
- This doesn't mean anything.
- We know, Andy.

314
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,663
Have you arrested him?

315
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,544
- Lynn, have you arrested my son?
- Not yet, no.

316
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,075
But you're going to?

317
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,712
We have no choice given the circumstances.

318
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,039
- Do you have a warrant?
- We are getting it now.

319
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,415
Lynn, I give you my word,
he'll turn himself in.

320
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,712
You don't have to arrest him.

321
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,625
He doesn't belong in jail.
Not even for one night.

322
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,474
He's not a flight risk. He's my son.

323
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,844
Please, don't arrest him.

324
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:24,967
- Andy...
- Please!

325
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,013
It's not even a close call. You know that.

326
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,467
Why?
Because of a fingerprint? One fingerprint?

327
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,308
You need to get a lawyer for Jacob.

328
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,355
You're ruining his life, do you know that?

329
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,034
You're gonna destroy it.

330
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,658
I'm following the evidence. That's my job.

331
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,658
Look, I have to view him
as I would any other suspect

332
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,754
or it will reek of preferential treatment.

333
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,832
This decision has been made, Andy.

334
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,536
Wait, wait, wait. What about Leonard Patz?

335
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,247
We just started looking into him.
Talk to Pam Duffy. She can explain.

336
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,628
We did.

337
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,844
There is more going on here
than you're aware of.

338
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,425
More than what? A fingerprint?

339
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,050
Tell me, goddamn it!

340
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,854
Sorry. Hey. That was...

341
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,862
I'm asking you as a favor
to me and my family. Please don't do this.

342
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,111
We're putting you on paid leave,
effective immediately.

343
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,903
What am I supposed to tell Laurie?

344
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,777
Andy, I'm sorry.

345
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,527
I'm begging you.

346
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:33,287
Look, I need you to listen to me.

347
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,962
We all care about you. I care very much.

348
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,415
Whatever it is your son may have done,

349
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,134
I'm here to help you navigate that,
all right?

350
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:49,762
Andy?

351
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,390
Andy?

352
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:57,982
Who gets this case?

353
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:00,815
Neal.

354
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:07,777
Are we done here?

355
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,333
Jacob, it's Dad.
I need to know where you are.

356
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,997
Call me as soon as you get this.

357
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,245
Green light. Red light.

358
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,341
You go back. You go back.

359
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:36,352
Come on, Laurie.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

360
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,225
Green light. Red light.

361
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,363
Come on, Laurie. Pick up the phone.

362
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:49,867
Hi. You've reached Laurie Barber.

363
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,448
Goddamn it.

364
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,752
Green light. Red light. You all got me!

365
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,212
Okay. Go back. Go back.

366
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,126
Oh, okay.

367
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,251
Would you take over?

368
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,596
- Laurie.
- What's wrong? Is Jacob okay?

369
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,429
He's fine.
I just need you to come home right now.

370
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:15,965
I can explain everything
when you get there.

371
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,058
No, tell me now.

372
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,142
Just please come home.

373
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,937
Duffy's on her way there
and she has a search warrant.

374
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,651
- I just want to try and get there before...
- A search warrant?

375
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,821
Oh, my God.
This is about the knife, isn't it?

376
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:31,282
No. That... Just come home right now.
I can explain everything. I promise.

377
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,195
Okay.

378
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:34,617
Oh, my God.

379
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,143
Mr. Barber!

380
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,427
Sir! You know the house is frozen.

381
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,846
You got a warrant yet?
Yeah, I didn't think so.

382
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,015
It's my house.
I have a right to go inside.

383
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,403
Andy!

384
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,294
I'm really sorry, Andy.

385
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,325
Is Jacob here?

386
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,287
I don't think so.

387
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:25,588
Any idea where he would be?

388
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,053
Have you tried his phone?

389
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:32,011
He must have turned it off.
You probably know that by now.

390
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,179
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to wait outside. You know the drill.

391
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:51,151
Don't fuck this up, Pam.
I mean it. Do your job.

392
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:52,653
I won't.

393
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,376
Sir.

394
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,605
What is happening? Where's Jake?

395
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,376
I don't know who else to call.

396
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,804
He'll turn up. I'm sure he's just scared.

397
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,034
I threw it away.

398
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,146
The knife. His knife.

399
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,909
What? Why would you do that?

400
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,158
You wanted to keep it in the house?

401
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,790
Oh, my God. You knew this would happen,
didn't you? That Jacob was a suspect.

402
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,004
No. No, I was as blindsided as you were.

403
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,835
I just wanted it out of the house.
I didn't know any of this would happen.

404
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,177
Okay. I think we're all done.

405
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:05,888
Laurie.

406
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,179
Any word from Jacob?

407
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:09,941
We've called everyone.

408
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,864
We have state and local looking for him.

409
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:14,308
He must be hiding.

410
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,108
Do you know that for certain?

411
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:20,611
No. I guess he just saw
the police outside and got scared.

412
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,238
Why would he assume
that they were here for him?

413
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,123
We're not answering
any more questions tonight,

414
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,370
and that includes Jacob when he shows up.
I don't want anyone grilling him.

415
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,253
He's a minor,
he has a right to a parent present.

416
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,370
So don't try to pull anything.

417
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,536
Jeez, Andy, nobody's gonna
do anything without you there.

418
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,035
I know. I know. Just... don't.

419
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,092
It could help him.

420
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,049
Come on. Who are you talking to?

421
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,057
I really am sorry about all this.

422
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,345
I know you are.

423
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,140
Okay, well, I'm gonna go wait out front.

424
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,401
Just so you know,
they may have found the knife.

425
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,701
Really? Where?

426
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,198
Not sure. I just found out.

427
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,453
He didn't do this, Pam.

428
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,579
I know you and I aren't
gonna talk much after this,

429
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,584
so I just wanted you to hear it from me.

430
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,883
He didn't do this.

431
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,626
I'll keep you informed.

432
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,764
A lot of people are looking for you,
you know.

433
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,191
I didn't do it.

434
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,849
Do what?

435
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,444
Kill him.

436
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:05,902
I didn't...

437
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,663
I just found him.

438
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,169
He was just lying there
on the ground and...

439
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:27,933
I thought maybe he was hurt or something,
so I went to help... to pick him up.

440
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:34,182
Then... I saw the blood on him
and I saw that his eyes were open,

441
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,518
and I knew that he was dead.

442
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:41,773
So I got scared and I ran.

443
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,440
Did you tell anyone?

444
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,445
Why not?

445
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,200
Okay. Well, I'm gonna take you down
to the police station now.

446
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,119
I want my dad.

447
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,130
Please, I really want my dad.

448
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,395
What are you thinking?

449
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,652
Nothing.

450
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,735
Don't.

451
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,870
Don't you dare shut me out. Not now.

452
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,454
Whatever worst-case scenarios
you're considering,

453
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,124
I need to know
what we're dealing with here.

454
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,043
I don't know what we're dealing with yet.

455
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,708
I'm just thinking about Jacob.

456
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,339
Oh, my God.

457
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,886
Are you all right?

458
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,686
Hey.

459
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,895
They really think I killed Ben.

460
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:50,691
It's a mistake.
We're gonna figure it out. Don't worry.

461
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,571
How is this even happening?

462
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,698
I don't know. I don't know,
but we're gonna clear it up.

463
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:59,412
Sweetheart, we know you're scared.
We all are.

464
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:00,953
They said I can't go home.

465
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,542
No, not tonight. But there's gonna be
an arraignment first thing in the morning.

466
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,001
- I don't even know what that is.
- It's just a proceeding.

467
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:11,126
They're gonna read the charge,
they're gonna set the bail,

468
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:12,803
then we'll take you right home.

469
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:14,215
Are you sure?

470
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,891
Absolutely. You'll be home by dinner.
I give you my word.

471
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,015
How much is bail?

472
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,976
I don't know.
We'll find that out tomorrow.

473
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,187
What if we can't afford it?
What happens to me then?

474
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:32,113
- We'll find the money. It's okay.
- We have savings. The house...

475
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,402
- Yeah, but what if...
- Hey. Hey, let us worry about that. Okay?

476
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:50,004
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
I didn't... I didn't do it.

477
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,875
I swear. I didn't do it.

478
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:53,461
We believe you.

479
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,429
I'm not...

480
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:06,193
I know I'm not, like, the perfect kid
or anything, but I didn't do it.

481
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:07,688
You are perfect, sweetheart.

482
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,689
I didn't even know Ben.
He was just, like, this kid from school.

483
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,362
Why would I kill him? Why?
Why would they think that?

484
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,494
Is it because of what Derek said?

485
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:21,123
- I don't know.
- What do you mean? This is your case.

486
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:32,959
Jake, did you tell the arresting officer
that you found Ben's body?

487
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:34,837
Is that true?

488
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,972
And you didn't tell us?
Honey, how could you not tell us that?

489
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:40,925
I didn't tell anybody.

490
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,766
I thought, you know...

491
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,190
that I'd get blamed for it.

492
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,228
I know that was really dumb of me.

493
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,942
I know that. I wish I had. I just...

494
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,740
I got scared and now...

495
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,459
Mom, please don't cry.

496
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:15,381
Jake, I need you
to listen to me very carefully, okay?

497
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,918
Don't say anything
to anybody else about this.

498
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:22,088
Do you understand what I'm saying?
That's very important.

499
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,887
- Yes.
- I mean it. Not one word.

500
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,891
When we get home, we can talk about
all of this, but until then, you don't...

501
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,059
You're leaving?
They're not gonna let you stay?

502
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,356
We're gonna meet you at
the courthouse first thing in the morning.

503
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,730
- We'll have a lawyer. We'll have...
- Why can't you be my lawyer?

504
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,743
No, I can't.

505
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,320
Why not? I want you.

506
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,815
I can't for a number of reasons.
It's a bad idea.

507
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:52,294
Okay.

508
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,375
I...

509
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:04,604
We love you so much. You know that?
You know how much we love you?

510
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:05,928
I know.

511
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,017
Be strong, okay, buddy?

512
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:34,209
Hi, guys. So I know
I haven't posted in a while, but...

513
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,209
It's been a rough time lately,
and I just...

514
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,958
I guess I was in the mood, so...

515
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,505
This is a song my dad used to sing to me.

516
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:47,262
It's been in my head today, so...
Feel free to comment if you like it.

517
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,216
Or don't. Or whatever.

518
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,185
Everything is cool

519
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,947
Everything's okay

520
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,621
But just before last Christmas

521
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,712
My baby went away

522
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,631
Across the sea to an island

523
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,840
We have made an arrest.

524
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,514
While the bridges brightly burn

525
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:25,928
We believe the person responsible for
Ben's death is his classmate Jacob Barber.

526
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:30,929
So far away from my land
The valley of the unconcerned

527
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,885
I was walking down the road, man

528
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,770
Hello. What?

529
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:40,146
Just staring at my shoes

530
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:48,030
When God sent me an angel
Just to chase away my blues

531
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,000
Saw a hundred thousand blackbirds

532
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,918
Just flying through the sky

533
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,497
And they seemed to form a teardrop

534
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,881
From a black-haired angel's eye

535
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:09,552
That tear fell all around me

536
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,474
And it washed my sins away

537
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:21,574
Now everything is cool
Everything's okay

538
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,282
Now everything is cool

539
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:29,655
Everything's...

540
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:00,603
Laurie.

541
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:04,232
What?

542
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,124
What?

543
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:19,674
Nothing.

544
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,841
I'm sorry. My head's all over the place.

545
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,011
We should try and get some sleep.

546
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:58,576
Get you anything else?

547
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:00,831
I'm okay. Thank you.

548
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,955
Just so you know, we're closing soon.

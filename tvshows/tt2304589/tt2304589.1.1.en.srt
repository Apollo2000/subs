1
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,981
Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin,

2
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:45,648
it is my duty to remind you that
a grand jury proceeding is not a trial.

3
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,611
As you can see, there is no judge
in the room here with us,

4
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,442
no defense attorneys.

5
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,741
This is an investigatory process,
at the end of which

6
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,283
you will be asked to decide
whether or not I have provided you

7
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,747
with sufficient evidence
to grant a true bill of indictment.

8
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,750
If so,
I may take the case to superior court.

9
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,594
If not, if you return a decision
of "no bill,"

10
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,800
then this case ends here, today.

11
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,756
Could you state your name
for the record, please?

12
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,267
You were asked to state your name.

13
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,099
Andrew Stephen Barber.

14
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,321
Little louder, if you don't mind.

15
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,069
Andrew Stephen Barber.

16
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,583
Can you state your occupation, please?

17
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,329
I was an assistant district attorney
in this building for ten years.

18
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,581
"Was"?

19
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,040
So you're no longer employed
as a prosecutor

20
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,254
for Middlesex County, is that correct?

21
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,795
Yes. That's right.

22
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,384
Mr. Barber...

23
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,258
Andy.

24
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,005
I assume you're familiar
with your Fifth Amendment rights?

25
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,097
I would hope so.

26
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,231
And you've waived them, correct?

27
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,638
I'm here, aren't I?

28
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:09,186
Would you agree that it's a little
unusual, given the circumstances?

29
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,363
I don't have any tricks up my sleeve,
if that's what you're getting at.

30
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,780
- No one was implying that.
- Yes, you were. So would I.

31
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:22,331
I'm here 'cause I believe in the system
and just want the truth to come out.

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,250
Well, let's get started on the truth then.

33
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,998
I'd like to begin by reading a quote
from The Boston Globe

34
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,666
that ran a few weeks ago.

35
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,511
"They became national news,

36
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:45,556
an object of fascination for both
the NPR set and the TMZ crowd,

37
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,522
the subject of a popular podcast,

38
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,443
hundreds of editorials
and countless articles.

39
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,572
So it's easy to forget
that less than a year ago

40
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,989
their lives were as mundane and uneventful
as our own.

41
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,616
Is there such a thing
as the perfect family? Of course not.

42
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,989
But the Barber family was a happy family,

43
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:09,038
and if there was anything truly special
about them, it was this."

44
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,209
I wonder if you'd agree.

45
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,507
Is that an accurate description
of your family

46
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,303
on the morning that Ben Rifkin
was murdered?

47
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,717
"Happy"?

48
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,268
Yes.

49
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,284
Hey. Come on. Time to get up.

50
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,412
Let's go. Rise and shine.

51
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,538
Jake? Gotta see those eyes.

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,460
All right. You leave me no choice.

53
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,299
Last chance.

54
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,437
- I'm up. I'm up.
- There he is!

55
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,650
Morning, buddy.

56
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,799
Can you quiz me on vocab?
I have a test today.

57
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,514
- Oh. Good morning to you too.
- Morning, Mom.

58
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,759
You need a ride today, or are you walking?

59
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,517
No, I'll walk. Did you get new waffles?

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,020
I did if you put them on my list.
"Perspicacious."

61
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,693
"Having a keen understanding."
They're not in here.

62
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,522
- Did you put them on my list?
- Yes.

63
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,938
Then they're in there. "Cursory."

64
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,147
"Brief and lacking depth."
I don't see them.

65
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,027
Second shelf next to the peas. "Myopic."

66
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,445
I'm telling you, they're not...

67
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,829
- "Myopic."
- "Possessing a narrow view."

68
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,123
How was the run?

69
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,786
- "Recalcitrant."
- Yikes.

70
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,995
Vocab test.

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,674
Hey, would you throw one of those in there
for me, buddy?

72
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,923
"Recalcitrant." I don't know.

73
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,505
- "Defying authority."
- Are you sure? Let me see.

74
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,511
- That's what it says.
- Where'd you run?

75
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,853
Along Boylston. I got lost
in that history podcast I told you about.

76
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,600
I think you'd really like it.

77
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,771
- I'll check it out.
- No, you won't.

78
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,225
Oh, Claudia Hoffman e-mailed me again.

79
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,312
Who?

80
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,816
Lizzy's sister. The travel agent?

81
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,819
- Oh, right, right. Mexico.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,901
What about Mexico?

83
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,105
We're thinking about going there for
Christmas. Three of us. What do you think?

84
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,197
Cool.

85
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,699
- You might be a little more excited.
- I am.

86
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,155
Well, tell your face.

87
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,405
You love that line.

88
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,121
You really do.

89
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,916
Look, we need to make a decision.

90
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,419
Should we go?

91
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,251
I mean, Jake is obviously ecstatic.

92
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,546
No, he's beside himself.

93
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,009
I wouldn't wanna break his heart.

94
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,419
What kind of parents would we be?

95
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,882
Hilarious.

96
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,797
- So are we going?
- I say yes. Yes to Mexico.

97
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,386
Great. I'll call her.

98
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,471
All right, I've got an early meeting,
so I'm jumping in the shower.

99
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,427
Okay.

100
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,226
- Will you finish quizzing him?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,481
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

102
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,647
"Phlegmatic."

103
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,235
I'll see you later, okay?

104
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,901
Your Honor,
I need a couple minutes to explain.

105
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,769
You'll have that opportunity in pretrial,
Mr. Molloy.

106
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,897
The charge is distribution
of a class A substance.

107
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:46,864
Such bullshit.

108
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,864
Bail is set at $1,000 cash
or 10,000 personal recognizance.

109
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:51,988
Come on. Are you kidding me?

110
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,454
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- What the hell are you thanking her for?

111
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,245
Pretrial conference is scheduled
for May 24th.

112
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,329
Next.

113
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,172
Please.

114
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:06,131
Indictment number 17-2832,
Commonwealth versus William J. Moore.

115
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,383
Charge is one count of aggravated assault.

116
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,255
Is Mr. Moore's attorney present?

117
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,342
Good morning, Your Honor.

118
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:12,802
Commonwealth?

119
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,267
Your Honor, I'm afraid
we have to insist on a continuance

120
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:29,067
on the grounds that we've been unable
to interview a necessary witness.

121
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,032
This court already granted you
a continuance four months ago.

122
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,624
Yes, Your Honor, but this witness
has been very difficult to locate.

123
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,831
Without getting into detail,
it has to do with her choice of lifestyle.

124
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,163
She's an escort, Your Honor,

125
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,038
like her friend,
who the defendant is accused of battering.

126
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,916
Since this was an issue last time,
I had a state trooper track her down.

127
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,214
It only took a day.

128
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,469
She corroborated her friend's account
of the assault.

129
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,140
She also said the defense
had already questioned her.

130
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,969
Maybe he forgot to take notes.

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,220
- Your Honor, if I may just elaborate...
- No, you may not.

132
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:03,228
Continuance is denied.
Trial is set for three weeks from today.

133
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,312
Next.

134
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,646
All right, you're due back in
for a session in 15 minutes,

135
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,612
then meeting with Lynn, her office.

136
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,652
I think she wants an update
on the Willis case.

137
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,026
Oh. That makes two of us.
Bobby, you guys out of peach?

138
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,913
Could be. Let me check the back.

139
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,370
Thanks. How's the hip?

140
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,870
You know, worse than yesterday,
better than tomorrow.

141
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,785
You wanted a conference
with Judge French in chambers.

142
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,462
His clerk says he has a 2:30,
if you want that.

143
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,541
Thank you.

144
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,922
Hey.

145
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,835
Oh, Jesus. Okay. Where?

146
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,926
Okay. Yeah, I'll meet you over there.

147
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,349
Something wrong?

148
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,774
You're a lucky man, Mr. B.
Only got one left.

149
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,523
- Thanks.
- What is it?

150
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,939
We gotta clear the rest of my day.

151
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,911
It's looking very good. No. Doing good.

152
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,281
Be careful taking that out.
We don't wanna make a mess.

153
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,697
That's what she said.

154
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,456
What are we doing here?
What are you dipping? That is...

155
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,170
Attention. Archer is now on lockdown,
effective immediately.

156
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,132
All students are to remain
in their classrooms...

157
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,132
All right. Okay.

158
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,343
Guys, I can't hear the announcement.

159
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,354
Over here, against the wall, please.
Sit down. Stay quiet.

160
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,031
Repeat. We are now on lockdown.

161
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,293
News didn't take long.

162
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,128
- Yeah. It's gonna be a real shitstorm.
- Yeah.

163
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,683
Let's go.

164
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,519
She's the one who found the body?

165
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,944
And the kid's backpack,
which is how they managed to ID him.

166
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,823
Name's Benjamin Rifkin, 14 years old,
stabbed three times in the chest.

167
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,610
Oh, fuck.

168
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:21,576
He's Jacob's year at Archer.
Jesus Christ. His poor parents.

169
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,327
I take it you know them.

170
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,908
No, not that well.

171
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,872
Anyway, keep going.

172
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,041
ME thinks he was dead
less than an hour before he was found.

173
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,417
Stabbing probably took place
on or near the jogging trail.

174
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,375
- There's a lot of cast-off on the grounds.
- Hey, hey, hey.

175
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,675
It's okay.
Detective Duffy is with our office.

176
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,219
Let 'em through.
The fuck's wrong with you?

177
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,562
Sorry, Duff. It's been a shit morning.

178
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,386
There's nothing worse than a kid.

179
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,437
Our thinking is,
the attack took place over there,

180
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,239
then the body fell
or was pushed down the hill.

181
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,532
Doesn't look like any effort was made
to conceal it.

182
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,367
This way. Watch your step.

183
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,421
The lady who found him
said he was facedown.

184
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,172
She thought maybe he was sick,
so she rolled him over,

185
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,510
took one good look at him and freaked.

186
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,433
Crabbed away on her palms and knees,
then got up and ran.

187
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,385
Basically fucked the whole scene.

188
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,517
Excuse me. I have to take this.

189
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,688
Jacob. You okay?

190
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,651
Yeah. The school's on lockdown,
but nobody knows why.

191
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,192
I know, it's...

192
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,815
Look, I can't talk about it right now,
okay, buddy?

193
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,157
Just listen to your teachers,
do exactly what they say.

194
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,873
Yeah, but you do know why.
I mean, is there some psycho shooter?

195
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,285
No, it's nothing like that.
You're safe. I promise.

196
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,341
Jake?

197
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,802
Okay.

198
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,064
Dad?

199
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,598
Yeah.

200
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,654
What is it, buddy?

201
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,154
Nothing.

202
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:19,942
You sure?

203
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,653
Yeah.

204
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,577
Okay, I gotta go. I'll see you
back at home though, okay?

205
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,749
I love you very much.

206
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,169
- All right. I love you too.
- Bye.

207
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,393
So no one in the park heard anything,
saw anything?

208
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,679
We're still asking around.

209
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,812
If we find his cell phone,
we can probably track his movements.

210
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,849
- His phone's missing?
- Wasn't in his backpack or on his person.

211
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,524
We're thinking the perp
might have taken it.

212
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,652
What about a weapon?

213
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,648
Nothing yet.
The park's a good 65 acres though.

214
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,028
That's gonna be a haystack.

215
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,793
"Children are the living messages we send
to a time we will not see."

216
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,327
That quote from John F. Kennedy

217
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,252
speaks directly to our work
here at Children's Cottage,

218
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:19,042
where our mission has always been
to nurture those who need it most:

219
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,587
abused, neglected and traumatized youth
in the greater Boston area.

220
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,344
A residential campus provides not just
stability and safety...

221
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,346
- Please pause it a sec?
- ...but support.

222
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,216
Don't you think I sound stiff?

223
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,515
You sound great.

224
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,849
You're just self-conscious.

225
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,848
I sound like I'm reading a traffic report.

226
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,267
Sorry, guys, my phone is going crazy.

227
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,526
I just feel if we're going to start
the gala with this video,

228
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,398
then it really needs to grab people.

229
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,525
Newton schools are on lockdown.

230
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,033
Turn on the news.

231
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,622
We're reporting live
from Cold Spring Park,

232
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:58,825
where earlier today the body
of a 14-year-old boy was found.

233
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,787
- The park will remain closed...
- Oh, my God.

234
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,918
...until further notice, as detectives
continue their investigation.

235
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,125
Honey, it's Mom. Are you okay?

236
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,585
The police are going door-to-door

237
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,965
in the neighborhoods
adjacent to Cold Spring Park,

238
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,972
hoping to find anyone
who was in the park this morning

239
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,435
and may have seen the victim talking to
or having contact with someone else.

240
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,308
A source inside the investigation
has confirmed

241
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,935
that two witnesses
have come forward so far,

242
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,193
but a suspect has yet to be named.

243
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:27,235
Newton Police have set up an anonymous
hotline for anyone who frequents the park,

244
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,781
in case they have seen
any suspicious behavior

245
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,575
or have any information
about this tragedy.

246
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,039
In the meantime, this tight-knit community
is on edge tonight,

247
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,461
knowing a murderer walks among them.

248
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,968
Can't go this way, buddy.
You gotta turn around.

249
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,039
He came home with Derek, so we didn't...

250
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,094
Right.

251
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,749
How's Jennifer doing?

252
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,625
Oh, God. These poor kids.

253
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,386
I did.

254
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,434
Toby said Robin's organizing food
for the shiva, so I'm going to call her.

255
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,478
Listen, Andy just got home.

256
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,652
You too. Bye.

257
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,364
- Was that Karen?
- Yeah.

258
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,068
Where's Jake?

259
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:56,235
Upstairs. Derek's over.
They're playing video games in his room.

260
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,663
You get a chance to talk to him
about it yet?

261
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,655
Not really, with Derek here.

262
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,457
Figure we could talk to him later.

263
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,335
Just came from the Rifkins.

264
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,724
Oh, my God.

265
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,011
I can't even imagine.

266
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,095
It was...

267
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,217
That bad, huh?

268
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,520
Worse.

269
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:25,228
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

270
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,324
Not yet.

271
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,977
You said there was a fingerprint.

272
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,147
Yeah, partial. No matches so far.

273
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,661
I mean, how could this even happen?

274
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,751
I can't even get my head around it.
That park is two blocks away.

275
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,288
I'll tell you one thing, Jacob is never
walking to school that way again.

276
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,501
I need some help here!

277
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,586
What are you waiting for?

278
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,381
They're gonna kill me.

279
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
You said you got him.

280
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,585
- I do. I see him.
- Right there! That guy on the left.

281
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,716
Derek, your dad's here.

282
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,802
Oh, okay.

283
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:58,758
Get out of here!

284
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,305
Go, go, go!

285
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,101
- Later, Jake.
- See you.

286
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,148
Thanks for having me,
Mrs. Barber, Mr. Barber.

287
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,231
Anytime.

288
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,475
- You all right?
- I guess. Yeah.

289
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,277
Give our best to your parents, okay?

290
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:13,903
Yeah.

291
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,156
Hey, pal.
We wanted to talk to you for a second.

292
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,035
Sure.

293
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,963
We just want to see how you're doing,

294
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,500
how you're feeling
about what happened to Ben.

295
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,674
I'm fine. I mean, yeah, it's weird.

296
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,054
But it's not like we were close friends
or anything.

297
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,392
Well, still, it must be scary,
knowing someone that got murdered.

298
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,969
Someone your age.

299
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,814
I guess. I mean, yeah, a little bit.

300
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,980
You guys were in a class together, right?

301
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,059
Yeah, math.

302
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,645
Was he a nice kid?

303
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,108
Ben? He was all right.

304
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,243
Just all right?

305
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,950
Well, I don't wanna be mean or anything,

306
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,700
but he was kind of full of himself,
you know?

307
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,623
Like, he thought he was really cool.

308
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,502
Was he?

309
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,581
To some people, yeah. Girls were into him.

310
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:12,383
Well, we just want you to know
we're here for you, okay?

311
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,923
Whatever you're feeling, you can tell us.

312
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,927
Kinda just did.

313
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,224
Like I said,
I didn't really know him that well.

314
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,559
I'm good though. Really.

315
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,179
Okay.

316
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,981
- We love you.
- Love you too.

317
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,899
If you change your mind
and you want to talk to us...

318
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,743
I know. Thank you.

319
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,608
- Dinner in 30 minutes. Okay, pal?
- Okay.

320
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,285
Can I admit something horrible?

321
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,501
The whole time tonight
I kept thinking, "Thank God."

322
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,458
"Thank God it was their kid and not mine."

323
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,379
Believe me, everybody thought that.

324
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,720
I just don't think
I could survive the loss. I really don't.

325
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:12,106
Do you remember when Jacob was little,
your bedtime routine?

326
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,399
You'd always ask,
"How much does Daddy love Jacob?"

327
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,655
- And he'd say, "Too much."
- "Too much."

328
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,494
In four years,
he'll be going off to college.

329
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,156
- Oh, my God.
- Isn't that crazy?

330
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,288
I can't even think about it.

331
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,339
Do you ever wish you'd known your father?

332
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,472
Not really.

333
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,974
When I was younger, sometimes.

334
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,897
From what little my mom told me,
sounds like I wasn't missing much.

335
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,610
We should get some sleep.

336
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,779
I know.

337
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,735
I like talking to you.

338
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,540
I love you.

339
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,200
I love you too.

340
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,182
Look at me!

341
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:04,842
Thanks, Mom.

342
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,547
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

343
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,759
Love you.

344
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,362
I'll meet you in class.

345
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,811
Have a seat.

346
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,231
I thought that press conference
went well enough.

347
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,896
They want answers, Andy.
So do the boy's parents.

348
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,277
Yeah, so do I. You know as well as I...

349
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,829
- I asked Neal to join us.
- Andy.

350
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,408
This isn't an ambush.

351
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,583
I'm just not sure you handling this case
is still the best idea.

352
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,753
You're friendly with the parents,
your son goes to the same school...

353
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,043
We barely know the parents.

354
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,126
Let me guess,
Rasputin here offered to take over?

355
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,131
Neal has legitimate concerns
about the appearance of conflict.

356
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,554
And frankly, so do I.
Appearances matter.

357
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,433
- Yeah, to voters.
- Oh, come on now.

358
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,680
- Sorry.
- It's a question of objectivity.

359
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:31,642
Shut up, Neal.

360
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:33,222
Are you taking me off the case?
Yes or no.

361
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,807
Right now I'm merely asking
what you think.

362
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,143
I think I should stay on.

363
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,857
If I were more concerned about
my reputation, maybe I'd feel differently.

364
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,608
But unlike Mr. Logiudice here,
I'm not gunning for your job.

365
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,901
Fuck off, Andy. Okay?

366
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,404
Hey, I get it. High-profile case,
big splashy win... Be a game changer.

367
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,817
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

368
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,696
- Gentlemen.
- You're dragging your feet on this case.

369
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,872
The case is going slow
'cause that's how the case is going.

370
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,791
I'm not going to indict someone
just to make it look good.

371
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,710
You always told me
to push every case as hard as I could.

372
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:57,918
I am pushing it as hard as I can.

373
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,578
Then why haven't you interviewed
any of the kids?

374
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,166
Because it isn't Dorchester High, Neal.
It's Newton.

375
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:06,052
Every single detail has to be negotiated.
Half the parents there are lawyers.

376
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:11,181
Look, we got interviews lined up all day.
You wanna send Neal? Be my guest.

377
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,011
I have concerns, I voiced them.

378
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,176
- If you say there's no conflict...
- There isn't.

379
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,425
I don't know how you can be the one
to make that call.

380
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:21,228
Because that's the way it works, Neal.
I make the calls.

381
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:27,152
And if I'm wrong, I'll be the one to stand
in front of the jury and take the hit.

382
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:30,356
Okay.

383
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,994
- Thank you.
- Of course, Andy.

384
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,037
- I'll keep you updated.
- Please do.

385
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,707
We've gotten consent
to fingerprint most of the kids.

386
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,751
I think we start
with high-priority witnesses.

387
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:46,415
Ben's close friends, kids known to
walk to school through Cold Spring Park.

388
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,045
I'm Lieutenant Duffy.
I'm with the state police.

389
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,132
And this is Mr. Barber.

390
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,757
He's the assistant district attorney
in charge of the case.

391
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,385
You're Jacob's dad, aren't you?

392
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,852
That's right.

393
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:59,062
So how well did you know Ben?
Was he a friend?

394
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,352
Yeah, I guess.

395
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:02,018
Tell us about him.

396
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,064
He was okay.

397
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,265
Can you be a little more specific?

398
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:06,898
He was nice.

399
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:08,608
Anything else?

400
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,607
I don't know. No, not really.

401
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:13,526
Can you think of anyone that would've
had a reason to wanna hurt Ben?

402
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,985
I don't think so. No.

403
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,695
What about people Ben didn't like?

404
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,745
I don't know.
I mean, nobody likes everybody, right?

405
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,922
Wait, are you Jacob Barber's dad?

406
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,958
Can you think of anyone
who might have a reason to wanna hurt Ben?

407
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:30,473
- No.
- No.

408
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,088
No.

409
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:35,006
Did Ben say anything to you that made you
think he might be in trouble?

410
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,045
In trouble?

411
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,638
In trouble? How?

412
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:40,933
Did Ben ever say anything to you
to make you think he might be in trouble?

413
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,098
No.

414
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,556
- No.
- No.

415
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,805
No.

416
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:50,284
Was Ben acting differently at all
the week that this happened?

417
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,200
- I don't know.
- I don't think so.

418
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,449
Never said anything about anyone
following him, anyone bothering him?

419
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:59,285
- No.
- Wait, are you Jacob Barber's dad?

420
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,714
Is there anything else
you think we should know?

421
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,501
- No.
- Not really. No.

422
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,295
- About Ben?
- About anything.

423
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,052
No.

424
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,639
Well, thanks for talking with us.
This is my card.

425
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,220
It has all my information
if you need to get in touch.

426
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:20,768
- Okay.
- Okay.

427
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,729
If anything else occurs to you,
even if you think it's nothing...

428
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:26,559
Like if I heard something?

429
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,687
Exactly. Wait, did you hear something?

430
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,649
No.

431
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,784
Just, you know.

432
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:33,991
No, we don't.

433
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Can I go now?

434
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,824
- Can I go now?
- Can I go now?

435
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,834
Let me know what I miss.

436
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,552
So is there anything else
you want to tell me about Ben?

437
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,133
Yeah, send it over.

438
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,668
Okay.

439
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,795
Well, you have both our cards.

440
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,433
If you think of anything else,
please feel free to call anytime.

441
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,216
The cop who came to our class
said there was a tip line.

442
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,891
Just in case we wanted
to say something anonymously or whatever.

443
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:07,895
That's right.

444
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,782
- Is there something you want to tell us?
- No, I was just wondering.

445
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,032
I know your son, Jacob.

446
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,203
Oh, yeah? You guys friends?

447
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:27,537
I guess so. Well, not exactly.
But, I mean, we know each other.

448
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,718
Have you talked to Jacob about this?

449
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,892
About Ben?

450
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,345
Why do you ask?

451
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,227
Sarah.

452
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,233
Must have been some reason you asked that.

453
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,071
I was just asking. Really.

454
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:00,489
Well, if you think of anything else...

455
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,308
What the hell? Were you following me?

456
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,395
What did you tell them?

457
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,110
None of your business. I'm late for class.

458
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,331
We're no better off
than we were yesterday.

459
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,289
These kids are like mafiosos.

460
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,413
- What's this?
- Just came in.

461
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,498
Leonard Patz.
Indecent A&B on a minor,

462
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,875
lewd and lascivious,
indecent A&B on a minor pending.

463
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,173
He's 36 years old,

464
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,676
lives near the park in that condo,
the Windsor, or whatever they call it.

465
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,298
Why didn't we know about him before?

466
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,135
He moved to Newton in the last year.
Never registered.

467
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,100
One of the ADAs in the child abuse unit
flagged him.

468
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,100
- That's the "pending."
- What did he do?

469
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,522
Grabbed a kid's package
at the public library.

470
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,981
Kid was 15.
Only a year older than Ben Rifkin.

471
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,362
He groped a kid and got out on a personal?

472
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,069
Apparently there was some question
about the kid's testimony.

473
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:19,782
We should bring him in.

474
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,992
Keep in mind, the Rifkin kid
had no signs of sexual assault.

475
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,533
If we bring this guy in
without something tying him to the case...

476
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:26,447
Right.

477
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:28,911
He'll lawyer up.

478
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,124
I know you're under a lot of pressure,
but if you play this wrong,

479
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,287
you could lose
your one chance to talk to him.

480
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:39,924
Let me sleep on it.

481
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,852
So you're saying
there's been little to no progress?

482
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,309
That's not at all what I'm saying.

483
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,769
Look, everyone in this community
deserves answers.

484
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,730
And Assistant District Attorney Andrew
Barber is pursuing a number of leads.

485
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,862
And I can assure you,
a suspect will be apprehended soon.

486
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,820
That was Middlesex County
District Attorney Lynn...

487
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,010
Isn't that Andy Barber?

488
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,394
The district attorney...

489
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,521
I wonder if he has news.

490
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,323
- Andy.
- Ian, hi.

491
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,151
Man, how fucked up is this?

492
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,147
Very.

493
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,278
So, how's it going with the case?
What do we know so far?

494
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:52,041
Would you excuse me for one second?
I just have to find my wife.

495
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,870
- Do we have a suspect?
- Sorry. Just...

496
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:02,713
Toby.

497
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,597
She's over there. Mothering the mothers.

498
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,604
Dylan said they set up
an online community thing.

499
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,595
- Hi, Andy.
- Hi.

500
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,477
Do you know who did this yet?

501
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:19,824
Any news about the case?

502
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,688
How did the interviews at Archer go?

503
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,485
Sorry, I'm just gonna steal Laurie
for one minute.

504
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,489
- Excuse us, just a second.
- Sure.

505
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,410
What are you doing?

506
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,123
Do you have your car here?

507
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:32,619
No, I came with Toby.
I figured you'd drive Jacob and me home.

508
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,713
- Jacob's here too?
- Yeah, somewhere.

509
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,958
Okay. Listen, I think I'm gonna go.

510
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,790
- What? You just got here.
- No, I shouldn't have come to begin with.

511
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,547
It was a mistake. Trust me.

512
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:45,421
Okay. But I think
I need to stay a little longer.

513
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,467
Toby can drive me back.
You can take Jacob with you.

514
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:48,801
Okay.

515
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,426
- I'll see ya in a while.
- All right.

516
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,181
My mom made me dress up.

517
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Yeah.

518
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:58,015
Your hair looks so pretty.

519
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,773
Thank you. I wish I had my phone
to take a picture...

520
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,765
Hey. Ready to go?

521
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,402
- Yeah. Sure.
- Did you bring your coat?

522
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,154
Mom put it upstairs with hers.

523
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,657
Okay. I'll find it.
Meet me at the front door.

524
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,014
Andy?

525
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,140
Thought that was you.

526
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,642
Forgive me. I've been hiding out up here.

527
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,061
No, no, it's...

528
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,177
I don't want to intrude. I'm sorry.

529
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,186
No, no, no. Please. Come in. Sit.

530
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Sit.

531
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:55,195
Any news? Since yesterday, I mean?

532
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:57,955
We should know more soon.
Everyone's working around the clock.

533
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,705
I always loved his room.

534
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:09,507
Joan can't bring herself to come in here,
but I can't help it.

535
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,047
I'm in here all the time.

536
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,681
Where you from, Andy?

537
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,441
Me? East Hartford.

538
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,188
- Connecticut, right?
- Yeah.

539
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,440
It's a rough area, isn't it?

540
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,234
Can be.

541
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:31,858
Joan and I grew up
in a suburb of Baltimore.

542
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:33,277
High school sweethearts.

543
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,782
It was a town a lot like this one,
to be honest.

544
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:40,083
Maybe that's why we moved here.

545
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,076
Felt familiar.

546
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,383
Safe.

547
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,167
Boring but safe.

548
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,141
Listen, Dan...

549
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,519
I'm so sorry. I'm...

550
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,145
I'm fuckin' untethered here, man.

551
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,145
Hey. You have every right to be.

552
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:17,828
The thing I can't get past...

553
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:21,118
is why did this guy do it?

554
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,918
- Dan, I don't think it's a good idea...
- No. Just, please, please.

555
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,296
Ben was good.

556
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:33,798
He was so good.

557
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,885
Who could feel that kind of rage
against him?

558
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,805
I mean,
tell me what separates these people?

559
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,055
I wish I knew.

560
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,912
Your son, Jacob...
I've seen him around town.

561
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,953
Seems like a nice boy.
You and Laurie must be really proud.

562
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:01,661
We are.

563
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,713
There's nothing you wouldn't do for him,
nothing in the world, right?

564
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,092
Yeah. Right.

565
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,782
Hey, come on. We agreed,
no phone when I'm driving.

566
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,283
Makes me feel like a chauffeur.

567
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:40,116
Sorry.

568
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:43,245
So you got all your homework done?

569
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:46,208
Yeah.
Mom made me finish Catcher in the Rye.

570
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,380
Even though it's not due
till, like, next week.

571
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:49,924
What'd you think?

572
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,796
It was pretty good, I guess.

573
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:56,798
- You know the deal with his name?
- Who? J.D. Salinger?

574
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:59,804
No, Holden Caulfield.
The kid from the book.

575
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,097
Ms. Sprung says it's symbolic.

576
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:06,231
So, like, the name "Holden"
is supposed to be like, "hold in."

577
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,400
And "caul" is another name for a womb.

578
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,820
And "field" is like the field of rye
from the poem.

579
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,650
Huh. Never thought about that.

580
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,119
I don't know.
It's kind of annoying actually.

581
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,040
I feel like all the books she gives us,

582
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,999
they always have these, like,
metaphors and similes and symbols

583
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:31,501
that you're supposed to figure out,
but it's just, like, who cares?

584
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:35,085
Just tell the freaking story. Why do you
need all these layers to decode?

585
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:38,838
Just say what you mean.

586
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:43,811
You got a point.

587
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:47,099
Right? I don't know.
It just bugs me.

588
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:53,111
The book is right about one thing though.
How phony most people are.

589
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:55,978
I remember that about it.

590
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,453
It's like even tonight.

591
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,487
You thought people
were being phony tonight?

592
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,124
Some. Yeah.

593
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:05,991
Kids especially.

594
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,289
I'm not saying they're not upset,

595
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:12,503
but it's like they're acting the way
they think they're supposed to act.

596
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,634
Like they've seen in movies or whatever.

597
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,001
You know what I mean?

598
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,045
Yeah. I do, actually.

599
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:23,679
And nobody's gonna call them out on it,
'cause then you look like a jerk.

600
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,056
Did you get to eat anything back there?

601
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:36,687
Just a little.

602
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:41,988
So the doctor gives him one of those...

603
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,159
It's like a plastic cup with a lid on it.

604
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,906
- Like a canister?
- Yeah.

605
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:53,207
All right.
So the doctor gives him a canister,

606
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,592
says, "Come back tomorrow
with a semen sample."

607
00:38:56,086 --> 00:39:00,086
- Buddy.
- So the old man, he goes home,

608
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,134
comes back the next day
with an empty canister.

609
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,547
The old man says, "Listen, Doc,

610
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,136
first I tried with my right hand,
and it didn't work.

611
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:09,642
Then I tried with my left hand,
and it still didn't work.

612
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,685
Then my wife tried it with her right hand,
and it didn't work."

613
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:12,728
Seriously?

614
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,061
"She tried with her left hand,
didn't work.

615
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,936
So then she called over the neighbor,
the neighbor tried with her right hand,

616
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,444
still didn't work.

617
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:19,895
Then she tried with her left hand,

618
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:23,445
but no matter what,
we could not get this damn cap off."

619
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:29,869
- All right.
- There you go.

620
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:30,953
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

621
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,708
- That was good.
- Enjoy.

622
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,709
That was good.
That got me. I didn't see that coming.

623
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:15,539
I'm exhausted. I'm going up.

624
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:17,044
- Okay.
- You?

625
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:18,918
Yeah, a couple minutes.

626
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:24,717
- Night, honey.
- Night.

627
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:45,698
Hey, I wake you?

628
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,199
Yeah, pretty much.

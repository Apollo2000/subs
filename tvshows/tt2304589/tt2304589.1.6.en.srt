<i>Do you remember the date
you were given access to it?</i>

00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,960
<i>Andy?</i>

8
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,398
[normal] <i>Andy?</i>

9
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,499
Sorry.

10
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,577
What was
the question?

11
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,021
Need a break?

12
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:37,678
No, I was just...

13
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:41,053
[exhales] No.

14
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,569
Just wanna get this
over with.

15
00:01:46,363 --> 00:01:48,256
We were just getting
to the cell phone.

16
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,702
<i>Do you remember the date
you were given access to it?</i>

17
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,131
[Andy] <i>Yeah. It was
ten days before the trial.</i>

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,483
Hey, Mr. B.
I thought that was you.

19
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:00,092
Hey, Bobby.
How you doing?

20
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:01,250
Not too bad.

21
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:02,774
Can I get you
something off the truck?

22
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:04,584
No, I'm okay.
Just waiting for somebody.

23
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:05,897
All right.

24
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,467
Well...

25
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,835
stay strong for your family,
okay?

26
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,206
Hey, Andy.
They're ready for us.

27
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,276
[Joanna clears throat]

28
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:33,651
- [Neal] I'll let him know.
- You better.

29
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,120
Ignore him.

30
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:38,472
He can moan all he wants.
The judge already ruled on the phone.

31
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,455
Mr. Barber has every right
to be here, Neal.

32
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,165
Well, technically
I could argue that he doesn't

33
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:44,668
since he's a possible witness
in the case,

34
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:46,292
but I'm letting it slide.

35
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:47,839
What a mensch.

36
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:49,263
You're not going in there
with us,

37
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,606
if that's what you think
was gonna happen.

38
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,507
Of course not.
I already examined the cell phone.

39
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:53,759
[Joanna]
We are well aware.

40
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,706
I was up here for something else
unrelated.

41
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:57,183
I do have other cases.

42
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,591
Goodbye, Neal.

43
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:02,393
And the next time you want
to conceal evidence from us, don't.

44
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:06,831
Oh, I've been meaning
to ask.

45
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,284
How's your father, Andy?

46
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,128
What did you say?

47
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,620
I asked about your father.

48
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:17,816
How's he doing?

49
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,089
You know, I knew criminal law
was a passion of yours,

50
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:22,573
but I had no idea
it was the family business.

51
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:23,698
- Whoa!
- You think...

52
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,114
- this is a joke? Do you?
- Jesus. - Hey!

53
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:26,226
- [Joanna] Come on, Andy!
- [Duffy] Back up.

54
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,643
- Back up!
- [Neal] Jesus.

55
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:30,032
Fuck.

56
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:32,158
Don't lecture me about
concealing things.

57
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:33,854
Just let it go.

58
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,125
Hey.

59
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,925
I will say this.

60
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:39,573
It explains a lot, Andy,

61
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:42,222
about you,
about your son.

62
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:48,596
Damn it.

63
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,159
- [Joanna] Detective, are you ready for us?
- [Duffy] Yeah.

64
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,753
- You okay?
- [sighs] Sorry.

65
00:03:57,943 --> 00:03:59,284
Right this way.

66
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,552
We knew he'd find out
sooner or later.

67
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:08,722
It's fine.

68
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,706
Andy, we're already
ahead of it.

69
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,347
[Duffy] That's the passcode
his parents provided.

70
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,409
- Take all the time you need.
- [Joanna] Thank you, Detective.

71
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:24,800
[door closes]

72
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,222
- [Dr. Vogel] Sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

73
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,628
Hey.

74
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,223
Same time next week?

75
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,058
Actually,
today was our last session.

76
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:06,723
Oh. I didn't realize.
So then...

77
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:09,853
So then you and Andy are scheduled
to meet me with Joanna

78
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:12,063
at the end of next week,
the 17th, I believe.

79
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:13,857
We can go over everything
then.

80
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,542
- [Laurie] The 17th?
- That okay?

81
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:17,776
Yeah, no, it's just...

82
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:19,808
that's Jacob's birthday.

83
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,490
Oh. Um...

84
00:05:21,574 --> 00:05:22,901
Well, if you want,
we can just...

85
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:24,303
No, it's-it's fine.

86
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,729
Uh, he has his tutor that day,
actually, so...

87
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,375
We'll see you then.

88
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,081
- Ready?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,534
He's probably a little
talked out.

90
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:39,151
- I'll see you next week.
- Right.

91
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,581
Take care, Jacob.
Happy early birthday.

92
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,917
Bye.

93
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,330
[door closes]

94
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,823
You're quiet.

95
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,042
How was your session?

96
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,164
- It was fine. Annoying.
- Annoying?

97
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:14,667
She just asks me the same questions
every week,

98
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,831
or different versions
of them.

99
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:19,886
And when I call her out on it,
she just tries to play dumb,

100
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:21,862
like she didn't realize
she already asked me.

101
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:23,581
She's only trying
to help us.

102
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:26,612
If you say so.

103
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,026
[cell phone dings]

104
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:36,589
Who's that?

105
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,261
[typing]

106
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,433
Jacob, I asked you

107
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,198
- who you were texting.
- Nobody. Dylan.

108
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,362
Dylan Stone?

109
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,365
- He's at a sleepaway camp.
- [cell phone dings]

110
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,237
This kid doesn't believe
he knows me,

111
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:49,643
so he's trying
to prove it.

112
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:57,189
How's Sarah?

113
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,417
I haven't heard
her name in a while.

114
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:02,610
It's good for you

115
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,401
to have someone
your own age to talk to.

116
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:06,675
We're not talking,
so...

117
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,503
- Is that your doing, or...
- Mom, don't. Please.

118
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,417
[door opens]

119
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:42,638
[door closes]

120
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:46,740
Thanks.

121
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:51,607
Anything?

122
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:57,420
<i>About how many hours
would you say</i>

123
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:00,779
you and Ms. Klein spent
with Ben Rifkin's cell phone?

124
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:03,935
- [sighs] I don't know. Maybe five hours.
- Five hours?

125
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,748
So you went through

126
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,725
every e-mail, every text,
every photo and video?

127
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,740
- Yeah. Everything.
- Looking for what, exactly?

128
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,261
Answers.

129
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,339
The answers
you were looking for,

130
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:18,920
they weren't on that phone,
were they?

131
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,466
- Thanks, Detective.
- Yeah. You got it.

132
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:29,248
[cell phone ringing]

133
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:32,244
It's my office.
Can you give me a minute?

134
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:33,537
Yeah.

135
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,888
[Joanna] Hi.
We're just finishing up.

136
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,226
Hey.

137
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:47,849
Hey.

138
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,379
Listen,
I just want you to know,

139
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,464
I think it was fucked up,
what Logiudice did.

140
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:54,498
Nah.

141
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,146
He was being a lawyer.

142
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,388
If I was in his place,
I'd probably try to bury the phone too.

143
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,702
No, I think you would have
thought about it,

144
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,826
but you would have done
the right thing.

145
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,545
That's not what
I was referring to though.

146
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,764
You mean what he said
about my father.

147
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,873
Everybody knows,
huh?

148
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,451
Started going around
yesterday.

149
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,646
You know how people
talk around here.

150
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:25,488
[sighs]

151
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,877
What have you heard?

152
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:31,301
That he's serving life
at Northern

153
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:33,138
for rape and
murder one.

154
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:41,646
He went in
when I was a kid.

155
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,185
I take it
Laurie knows?

156
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:52,318
She does now.

157
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,138
Jacob too.

158
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:04,443
I have a brother.

159
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,693
I told you
about him.

160
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:08,053
Yeah.

161
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,821
So I know what that's like,
carrying something like that around.

162
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:18,866
Listen, my hands are mostly tied
on this case,

163
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,060
but,
you know...

164
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:24,293
if you need any more of my help,
you know how to reach me.

165
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:26,437
Thank you.

166
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:27,818
Don't underestimate him.

167
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,982
He sounds real sure
he's gonna win.

168
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:31,357
Too sure.

169
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,014
[footsteps approaching]

170
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:40,857
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

171
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,865
Thanks, Duff.

172
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,545
That was my assistant
Ellen.

173
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,680
She has a niece
Jacob's age.

174
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:51,920
They live in Needham, but you know how
all the kids know each other these days.

175
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,240
It seems Jacob
has been going online again.

176
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:01,740
Jacob!

177
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,490
- Where's Jake?
- Upstairs.

178
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:08,498
- How did it go with the phone?
- It was a bust.

179
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,255
[Andy] Jacob!

180
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,561
Are you Jay Kobbs?

181
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,646
- Answer me, damn it!
- Andy.

182
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,427
It's not that big of a deal.

183
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,348
Don't tell me
what's not a big deal!

184
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,019
Show your mother.
Show her what you've been up to.

185
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,341
[typing]

186
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:37,099
Shit.
Jacob!

187
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:38,450
It's just a dumb joke.

188
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,093
[Andy] Do you have any idea
what this looks like?

189
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,370
Joking about
being a murder suspect?

190
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:44,080
It's not like anyone
even knows who it is.

191
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:46,186
Everybody knows!
How do you think I know?

192
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,638
Andy, calm down.

193
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:50,100
This is damaging.
This is evidence,

194
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:52,895
and you're either too stupid
or too arrogant to know the difference.

195
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,264
- I'm not stupid.
- Then what's wrong with you?

196
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,177
Nothing. You're making
too big of a deal out of this.

197
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,601
Do you have any idea
what they're gonna do with this picture?

198
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,280
They're gonna wave it around
in front of the jury,

199
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:03,764
and they're gonna say
it shows consciousness of guilt.

200
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,393
That's the phrase
they're gonna use.

201
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:07,990
They're gonna say this is
how Jacob Barber sees himself,

202
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:09,146
a psycho.

203
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:10,419
And they're gonna use that word

204
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:12,302
- over and over again.
- Andy, enough.

205
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:13,801
Jesus Christ.

206
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:15,364
Do you know
what's at stake?

207
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:17,272
Do you realize
what they want to do to you?

208
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:19,366
Stop it already.
You're scaring him.

209
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,036
Good! He should be scared!
I'm scared!

210
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:27,124
It was just a joke.
I can delete it.

211
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,419
That doesn't
mean it goes away.

212
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,505
Okay. I'm sorry.

213
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,857
[Andy] You can't do things like this,
Jake. You just can't.

214
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:44,474
I said I'm sorry.

215
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:45,976
I think he should delete it
anyway.

216
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,271
You're goddamn right he's gonna delete it.
He's gonna delete it right now.

217
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,063
This can't happen again.

218
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,779
I need to know
you understand that.

219

[typing]

220
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,880
I do. There.
It's gone.

[sighs]

222
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,990
I'm sorry
I yelled.

223
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,584
I shouldn't have lost
my temper. I just...

224
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:30,287
I'm trying to look out for you,
buddy.

225
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:31,906
You gotta
understand that.

226
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,451
Just leave me alone.

227
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,341
- Jake.
- Please.

228
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,318
[softly] Okay.

229
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:48,302
Okay, so go.

230
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:55,224
There's nothing wrong
with me.

231
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:59,257
I know exactly
what they're gonna do to me.

232
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:00,843
I don't need you
to tell me that.

No. I don't think so.

Why? Who is it?

257
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,131

Where did you meet him?

You know, the pizza place.

When was this?

288
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,200
About a year ago.
Last summer.

289
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:26,886
So you were 15 at the time?

290
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,235
Yeah.

291
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,545
This morning is the first I heard

I understand.
Please continue.

293

[exhales] Anyway,
Patz comes up to me

something to eat.

295

if I'd sit with him,</i>

296
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:41,706
<i>'cause he hated eating alone.</i>

297
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:44,000
<i>So I said fine.
What do I care? It's free food.</i>

298
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:45,263
Hey.

299
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:47,087

I can't tell what a loser he is.</i>

305
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,575
<i>And after a while,</i>

306
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,340
<i>he starts talking
about his sweet apartment,</i>

307
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:03,529
<i>and how he's got
all this beer there,</i>

- Hell, no. I knew what he wanted.</i>

me over my pants.</i>

315
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,199
<i>So, I told him
I'd let him do it for a hundred.</i>

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,496
- And he agreed?
- Yeah, like, right away.

317
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:31,849
<i>So, after that we'd meet up
here and there</i>

318
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,216
<i>whenever he had
some cash,</i>

319
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,363
do the same thing,
just different places.

320
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:37,050
[Lynn] He never tried for more?

321
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,388
One time he asked if he could
reach his hand down my pants,

322
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:41,214
but I told him
I'd break his fucking arm.

323
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,488
- How'd he react?
- He backed off quick.

324
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:45,519
And these meetups,
how many were there in total?

325
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:47,773
I don't know, six.
Maybe seven.

326
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:49,732
Including the one
at the library?

327
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,193
Yeah, that was
the last time.

328
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,997
Leonard said
he didn't wanna pay me anymore.

329
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,511
I told him if he didn't,
I'd report him, so I did.

330
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:56,980
I'm sorry. I...

331
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,664
I don't see how this
relates to our case.

332
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,634
Well, you see, that was
his whole reason for dropping me.

333
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:05,542
He said there was this new kid
he was into, some kid named Ben.

334
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,085
Just Ben, or did he give a last name?

335
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,184
[Matt] No, but I know it was the same kid
'cause of the park.

336
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:12,287
That's where
Leonard met him.

337
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:15,144
[Lynn] So you're saying
Patz knew Ben Rifkin?

338
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:16,858
[Matt] I don't think
he actually knew him.

339
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:19,292
But he spoke to him
a couple times.

340
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,016
Mostly just watched him.

341
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:23,302
[Lynn] Did he say anything else
about Ben?

342
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,149
Just that he was "beautiful."

343
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:27,558
He used that word.

344
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:29,746
That's all?

345
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:32,027
Yeah.

346
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:37,027
- Oh, shit, wait. He also had a knife.
- [scoffs]

347
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:40,390
I only saw it once,
but he carried it around sometimes,

348
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:42,355
you know, in case
someone gives him shit.

349
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:44,443
Anyway, he tried to give it to me
for money one time

350
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:45,955
and I told him to fuck off.

351
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,292
What did it look like?

352
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:48,717
A knife, you know?

353
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:50,963
With those little
teeth on the side of it.

354
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,796
It was kind of badass,
actually.

355
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:58,238
Why did it take you this long
to come forward?

356
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:00,804
Well, I mean,
I got kind of a record, you know,

357
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:03,932
with the whole possession charge,
and I lied about the whole library thing.

358
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:06,403
I just... kind of wanted to stay out of it,
you know what I mean?

359
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:09,752
But... I heard that his kid
was getting blamed for it

360
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,877
- and I just kept thinking about...
- Wait a second.

361
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:14,415
Did Mr. Barber compel you
to come forward?

362
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,634
Compel me?

363
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,879
[Lynn] Did you feel pressured in any way
by Mr. Barber?

364
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:19,197
He called me with this.

365
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:20,783
Please let him answer, Andy.

366
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,978
No, I mean, he came to me first.

367
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,338
I mean, I didn't tell him anything,

368
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:28,253
and so I guess, I don't know,
it was a little bit of both.

369
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:29,276
Yes or no?

370
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:31,249
Were you coached in any way
by Mr. Barber?

371
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,484
No, what I told you is the truth.
I got no reason to lie.

372
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,315
Really? 'Cause you've
made it pretty clear

373
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,850
that you'd do a lot
of things for money.

374
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:38,156
- Oh, that's outrageous.
- The fuck?

375
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,342
- That's my kid you're talking about.
- [Lynn] Neal.

376
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:45,396
- [Matt] Can I go now?
- [Lynn] Thank you for coming in.

377
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,867
I'm sure this wasn't easy.

378
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,685
Detective Duffy will take down
your information

379
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,881
in case we need to talk with you
again.

380
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,543
[exhales]

381
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:10,956
I don't know what to make
of that boy's story

382
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,793
or how you came
to hear of it.

383
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:14,600
[Neal] I don't believe
a word of it.

384
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:16,259
It's too convenient.

385
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,163
I can't believe
we're entertaining this.

386
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,824
We'll write up a search warrant
for Patz's home.

387
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,106
See if we can turn up a knife.

388
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:37,409
Thank you.

389
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:45,830
- This good enough?
- Let me see.

390
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:48,127
The pants are too short.

391
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,822
The arms too.
Shit.

392
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:52,932
[Jacob] It's a trial,
not a fashion show.

393
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:55,822
I just want
you to look your best, okay?

394
00:22:56,495 --> 00:22:58,143
Let people see
how handsome you are.

395
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,672
These things are important.

396
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:00,757
[door opens]

397
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,252
- [Andy] Hello?
- We're in here.

398
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:03,421
[door closes]

399
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:05,572
His suit needs
altering again.

400
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:08,061
Only if there's a trial.

401
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,306
What do you mean?

402
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,533
Lynn approved
a search of Patz's house.

403
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:14,429
- So, they think it's him?
- Well, no. Not yet.

404
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:16,565
Obviously if they find the knife,
that changes everything,

405
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:19,025
but at least this puts him
back on the radar.

406
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:21,182
- Well, that's something, right?
- Yeah.

407
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,300
I know it's him.
I know it is.

408
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:25,157
[phone rings]

409
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,058
Sorry, guys.

410
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:28,487
You go change, honey.

411
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:31,955
Hello.

412
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:33,635
There he is.

413
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:36,041
How'd you get this number?

414
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:38,205
<i>- Your wife gave it to me.</i>
- Bullshit.

415
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,322
[chuckles]

416
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:40,407
No.

417
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:42,760
No. We got our own, um...

418
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,268
you know,
we call it economy in here.

419
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:50,971
Believe me, there's tougher things
to get than a phone number.

420
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,299
<i>Well, you wasted your money.</i>

421
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:55,596
Hey, don't hang up.
Come on.

422
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,143
I did what you asked,
didn't I?

423
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:02,618
<i>She's a real doll, your wife.</i>

424
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:05,251
<i>- I mean, even better-looking in person.</i>
- Don't.

425
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:07,017
What? It's a compliment.

426
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:09,670
She's my daughter-in-law.
Jesus.

427
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,704
What kind of a sick fuck
you think I am?

428
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,478
<i>I know exactly
what kind.</i>

429
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,922
Look, I appreciate
your helping us.

430
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,827
Yeah, well,
it's all right.

431
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:32,257
You see, that was on the news
the other day, how you're my kid.

432
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:34,819
<i>Yeah, I saw.</i>

433
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,046
I want you to know,
I had nothing to do with that.

434
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,827
I said nothing
to nobody.

435
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:40,639
These things get out.

436
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,418
<i>Yeah, these reporters. </i>[scoffs]
<i>They're real fucking vultures, right?</i>

437
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:45,882
Is this why you called?

438
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,193
Yeah.

439
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,858
I mean, yeah.
That and...

440
00:24:52,332 --> 00:24:53,541
[sighs]

441
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,444
I thought
we could talk some more.

442
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:57,007
Talk?

443
00:24:57,103 --> 00:25:00,024
<i>Look,
I know I'm a shit father.</i>

444
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,655
I don't have a father.

445
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:07,710
You don't have...
Huh.

446
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,580
How does that work exactly?
What are you, a fucking tree?

447
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,805
<i>I gotta go.</i>

448
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,641
Yeah, some other time,
maybe.

449
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:15,977
<i>I don't think so.</i>

450
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:17,475
Maybe, though.

451
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:42,676
[Duffy] Morning. I want two officers
stationed in front, another two out back.

452
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,577
- The rest of you follow me.
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

453
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,437
You're the super, right?
Detective Duffy. We spoke earlier.

454
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:52,428
We need to get up to
Leonard Patz's apartment.

455
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:53,650
217.

456
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:54,819
Got it.

457
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,205
<i>Becky.</i>

458
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,342
<i>Becky!</i>

459
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:12,575
<i>Becky?</i>

460
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:15,968
<i>Becky, where are you?</i>

461
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,085
[Becky] <i>I'm here, Miles.</i>

462
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,796
- [Miles] <i>You didn't go to sleep?
- I'm so tired.</i>

463
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,380
[Miles] <i>They weren't people.
It was more of them.</i>

464
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:30,384
<i>They're growing thousands of pods
in greenhouses. We've got to get away.</i>

465
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,445
Mr. Patz, I'm Detective Duffy.

466
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,947
I'm assigned
to the district attorney's office.

467
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:53,803
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

468
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,287
[TV: sound muted]

469
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:00,789
[knocking]

470
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,874
Mr. Patz, this is the police.
Open up.

471
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:10,277
Mr. Patz, open up this door
right now.

472
00:27:16,347 --> 00:27:19,374
Mr. Patz, open the door
or we will open it for you.

473
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,735
Mr. Patz?

474
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,736
We have a warrant
to search your apartment.

475
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,404
[paper rustles]

476
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:41,469
I'm gonna need you
to put some clothes on

477
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:42,742
and wait outside.

478
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:35,152
[breathing heavily]

479
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,175
[inhales cigarette]

480
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:17,933
- Andy?
- [door closes]

481
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:20,776
No knife.

482
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,173
- What?
- They didn't find the knife.

483
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:25,191
At least not one
that matches the weapon.

484
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:27,436
Doesn't mean they're gonna stop
looking at Patz though.

485
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,316
Honey?

486
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,568
I, uh...

487
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:34,668
The blue car, the Lincoln,
it was following me.

488
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:36,651
- Now?
- No, no, no. It's gone.

489
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:38,172
Did you look at the driver?

490
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:39,884
No, he was too far away.

491
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:43,425
- Sorry, honey.
- [exhales]

492
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:46,295
Someone's been watching us.
I don't know if it's a reporter

493
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:48,589
or some psycho
trying to scare us or what.

494
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:50,050
Do you wanna file a report?

495
00:30:50,144 --> 00:30:51,519
What good would that do?

496
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,147
Honestly, uh, not much.

497
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:57,058
If it happens again, call me immediately.
If I'm in the area...

498
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:58,310
Okay.

499
00:30:58,395 --> 00:30:59,563
Thanks, Duff.

500
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,292
You are gonna
stay on Patz, right?

501
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:06,651
We'll comb through
everything again,

502
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:08,013
his statement,
his movements.

503
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,464
He lied to us that day.
He said he didn't know Ben Rifkin.

504
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:12,254
According to your boy McGrath.

505
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:14,793
Look, I'm just saying,
the kid already admitted

506
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:16,586
to trying to frame Patz
on the whole library thing.

507
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,029
Yeah, I know.
I know, but I believe him on this one.

508
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:25,108
I'm begging you.
Please do not give up on Patz.

509
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,880
We're running
out of time.

510
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:30,450
I'll do my best.

511
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:37,794
[Neal] <i>Did you honestly think
that you could avoid a trial?</i>

512
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:41,419
Delay one, at least.

513
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:44,724
If you were willing to admit
that you rushed to judgment.

514
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:48,155
But you refused
to look at anyone else.

515
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,849
[Neal] <i>I wanna go
to those last few day</i>s

516
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,435
<i>right before the trial.</i>

517
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,310
Did Laurie share
your optimism

518
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:59,341
that Jacob's trial
might be avoided?

519
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:01,396
Yes and no.

520
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,279
<i>What about you?</i>

521
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:10,802
<i>As it became clear there was no
11th-hour reprieve coming...</i>

522
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:13,771
<i>how were you handling it?</i>

523
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,372
[Andy] <i>I did the only thing
I could do.</i>

524
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:20,747
<i>I accepted it.</i>

525
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:23,012
- [crash]
- Fuck.

526
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,834
Jesus. Fuck.

527
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,174
Hey, what are you doing?

528
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,440
- I know. I know what you did.
- What?

529
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:35,583
What are you talking abo...
You just...

530
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,269
- Oh, fuck, you're the father.
- I know you killed him!

531
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:41,191
Oh, Jesus, you're the father.
Okay. Um, you need to leave me alone.

532
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:43,507
My son's not gonna go away
because of you. You understand me?

533
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:45,175
- Stay away from me.
- Hey!

534
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:46,698
I know what you did.

535
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:51,346
I know it was you, Leonard!
I know it was you!

536
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:54,624
[Neal] <i>What about Jacob?</i>

537
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,056
How was
he holding up?

538
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:58,299
[Andy exhales]

539
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,963
He tried to stay busy
with schoolwork,

540
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,612
watched movies.

541
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:06,120
We were all just waiting
for the hourglass to run out.

542
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,284
He had a 15th birthday that week,
didn't he?

543
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,338
August 17th.

544
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:13,901
Four days
before the trial.

545
00:33:14,803 --> 00:33:18,174
Now, how would you go about
calculating this sum?

546
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:19,808
Uh...

547
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:23,080
- I'd add up the interior angles.
- Good.

548
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,510
We'll be back in a few hours.

549
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,565
Bye, birthday boy.

550
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:30,612
Now, don't forget
there's a trick.

551
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:45,487
I'm ready for you.
Come on in.

552
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,144
<i>As you know,
I've been evaluating Jacob</i>

553
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,742
<i>for the last several weeks
using a number of diagnostic tools:</i>

554
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:56,652
a Basic Personality Inventory,
a Problematic Traits Inventory,

555
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:58,737
and all the results,
they're in the report.

556
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:02,168
I also tested his IQ,
which is unusually high,

557
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:05,151
and his EQ,
his empathy quotient.

558
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,006
The report also
contains the results

559
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:09,216
from the genetic testing
that I conducted,

560
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,887
and it includes
the MAOA mutation,

561
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,219
what's commonly
known as

562
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:15,687
the-the warrior gene
or the murder gene.

563
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:17,559
And?

564
00:34:17,643 --> 00:34:21,949
Andy's father tested positive
for the mutation, as did Andy.

565
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:23,617
Uh, Jacob did not.

566
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:25,931
No?

567
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:27,714
The thing is, that's not, um...

568
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,469
MAOA wasn't really central
to my evaluation,

569
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:34,445
since it's actually inherited
from the mother and not the father.

570
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,868
[Andy] Well then,
what was the purpose of the testing?

571
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:38,383
Because there are
similar genes

572
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:40,742
that are passed down
from father to son.

573
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:42,070
Um...

574
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,671
For instance, GRIN-1,
which is a glutamate receptor subunit.

575
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:50,304
It's been linked to traits
like impulsivity and recklessness.

576
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:52,760
All three generations
of Barber males

577
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:57,367
tested positive for the GRIN-1 variant,
including Jacob.

578
00:34:58,345 --> 00:35:02,953
There's also a dopamine gene
linked to a limited capacity for empathy.

579
00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:07,562
Uh, again, all three generations
of Barber males tested positive.

580
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:11,195
And, uh, finally,
there's a form of testosterone receptor

581
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,658
known to induce violent behavior
in adolescents shortly after puberty...

582
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,952
And Jacob...
Jacob has that form?

583
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:21,047
Jacob does, yes,
as do Andy and Billy.

584
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:27,360
<i>But if a young person
is already capable of moral reasoning,</i>

585
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:30,416
<i>these genes won't just cause the brain
to flip a switch,</i>

586
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:33,328
<i>and I will point to Andy
as proof.</i>

587
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,720
[Joanna]
<i>Still, what Dr. Vogel is saying is,</i>

588
00:35:35,804 --> 00:35:39,975
<i>if we wind up with the worst-case scenario
where Jacob's found guilty,</i>

589
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:41,768
<i>we would have a genetic basis</i>

590
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:45,105
<i>to argue mitigation
when it goes to sentencing.</i>

591
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:50,068
<i>That's not gonna happen, but it's
important to know as much as possible.</i>

592
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:51,404
<i>Just in case.</i>

593
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:57,695
Well, now we know.

594
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:02,000
And is he
capable of moral reasoning?

595
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:05,833
There are things in here...
um, "antisocial tendencies"...

596
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:09,148
- Laurie, that's just psychobabble.
- I'm asking Dr. Vogel.

597
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,409
It's not a simple
yes or no answer.

598
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,252
I think you should read the entire report,
and then, if you want,

599
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:18,130
we can have a conversation
on how to best address Jacob's issues.

600
00:36:18,222 --> 00:36:21,558
But obviously right now
the concern isn't therapy, it's the trial.

601
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:24,770
- So there are issues?
- He's a teenager. They all have issues.

602
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,660
[Dr. Vogel]
Andy's not wrong.

603
00:36:27,345 --> 00:36:30,360
However, if there was
one area of concern,

604
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:33,111
it would be
his capacity for empathy.

605
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:35,915
Once again,
the report goes into full detail.

606
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,034
- How do you mean?
- Laurie,

607
00:36:37,118 --> 00:36:38,618
this isn't really the time
to have

608
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:40,783
- this conversation.
- I want to know what she means.

609
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:45,877
Well, for example, I brought up
Ben Rifkin in one of our sessions,

610
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:48,829
and, uh,
Jacob's response was that...

611
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:52,463
people die every day
by the millions.

612
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,715
And when I tried
to prod him,

613
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,024
to express some-some emotion
around Ben's murder...

614
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:01,470
Jacob's answers felt,
um...

615
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:03,970
practiced.

616
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:06,000
[Andy] That's because
you don't know him.

617
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:08,253
I mean,
he's not a touchy-feely kid, that's...

618
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,891
- He has empathy.
- You think he did it.

619
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:13,931
I didn't say that.

620
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,682
- You didn't have to.
- [Joanna] Laurie.

621
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,366
I have absolutely no way of knowing
if Jacob did or did not do it.

622
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,119
- And it's also not my job.
- But you think he might have done it.

623
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:24,830
- Laurie, this isn't productive.
- You do. You think it's possible.

624
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:27,831
Will you stop? Anything in there you could
say about a million other teenagers.

625
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,784
- [Dr. Vogel] Very true.
- Then why won't you answer me?

626
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:30,720
- Laurie.
- Don't.

627
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:33,111
You never see these things,
you never saw them then.

628
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:35,571
You were so desperate to be normal,
for us all to be normal.

629
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:37,072
- We are normal.
- Oh, my God, Andy,

630
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:38,964
- do you think this is normal?
- This situation?

631
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,805
Of course not, but Jacob, yes.
I know he is.

632
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:45,308
And this, this doesn't change anything.
This means nothing.

633
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:46,856
Just answer me.

634
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:53,845
Please.

635
00:37:58,659 --> 00:37:59,860
I wish I could.

636
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:14,071
Look, we can just call this off
and do something at home.

637
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:18,399
No. He's about to go through hell.
We're doing this.

- Good. Thank you.

641
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:39,112
I don't see
why you guys won't tell me.

642
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:41,423
Because it's between
us and Dr. Vogel.

643
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,321
What happened to me
being treated like an adult?

644
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:46,361
This is such bullshit.

645
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:49,189
Hey, enough with the swearing.
It's like every other word with you.

646
00:38:49,274 --> 00:38:51,500
I have a right
to know about my own brain.

647
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:53,126
I-I took
every one of her tests.

648
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,925
I answered every one
of her stupid questions.

649
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:58,465
She thought you were a good kid,
which we already knew.

650
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,407
This whole thing's a formality.

Okay?

00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,657
I don't believe you.

653
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:08,141
Honey, it's your birthday.
Let's talk about something else.

654
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,430
- What about the murder gene?
- You don't have it.

655
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,509

Thank you for tonight.

It was nice
being normal again,

even if it was just
pretending.

It was your mom's idea.

Glad you had
a good time.

670

[Jacob] I think
I'm ready for Monday.

671
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,818
[Andy] Yeah?

Yeah.

- Wait here.

- Take Jacob inside.

- [Laurie] It's all right. Come on.

I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

I'm not gonna ask you again.

Easy, tough guy.

690

You don't want to be a tough guy tonight,
believe me.

691
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:27,341
I don't want to see you
on this street again.

692
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,294
It's a public street.

So it's stolen?

All it takes
is a screwdriver.

707

So what now?

<i>Previously onBig Sky...</i>

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:04,110
<i>Dad?</i>

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:05,570
What's going on?

4
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:07,464
Danielle... she and her sister
never showed.

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,209
<i>They're not answering
their texts or calls.</i>

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,490
Something is not right.

7
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:14,405
<i>Cody Hoyt?</i>

8
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:15,406
<i>You're looking for a couple
of missing teenagers.</i>

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,755
How do I put this?

10
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,193
This isn't the first.

11
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,891
What do you think
he plans to do with us?

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,372
What's going on?

13
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,026
Are you sleeping
with my husband?

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,418
I thought you two were over.

15
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:31,727
Tell me, Cody.
Are we working on us?

16
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,294
Woman problems.

17
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,339
A man's got a woman.
Then he got problems.

18
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,604
- Let's go.
- Oh, one other thing.

19
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,651
Ronald.

20
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:43,825
You've been sloppy.

22
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,409
Any word from Cody?

23
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,976
Nothing.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,239
I'm gonna get the sheriff
involved.

25
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:50,893
What about this
Montana State Trooper?

26
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,721
I'm about to go see him.

27
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,202
He said that Cody left at
sunrise for the church cult,

28
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,855
but that he went alone.

29
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,596
Wait, what?

30
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,512
You said they were both going.

31
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,210
That's what Cody told me.

32
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,544
He could be off the grid
and out of cell range.

33
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:08,389
Or in the middle of it.

34
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:11,566
Or there's a third scenario.

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,309
The last time we spoke to him,
he was at a bar.

36
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:16,658
Not a chance.

37
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:17,876
Not a chance?

38
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,270
He's an alcoholic, Denise.

39
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,054
I haven't seen him drink.

40
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,405
Okay. I hate to ask,

41
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,277
but just how involved
were the two of you?

42
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,714
Look, I'm not...

43
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,008
This is not about your private
life with my husband...

44
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,992
-All right.
-...so much as I need
to get a sense

45
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,113
of Cody's psychological state,

46
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:40,290
whether he could be off
on some bender.

47
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:42,510
How did you two leave things
last night?

48
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,033
I told him we were over.

49
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:45,600
And how did he take that?

50
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:48,777
I'm not sure.
Not great, I think.

51
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,172
Is he in love with you?

52
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:55,435
I don't know.

53
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,883
Are you a fan of irony, Ronald?

54
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,885
Myself, I'm a big fan.

55
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,366
I like to button my day,

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,194
curl up in bed with
a warm glass of milk,

57
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,805
and read a little
Hunter Thompson.

58
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,478
In fact, that's what
I was fixing to do

59
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,070
when my ex-wife's cousin called.

60
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:25,161
I don't like irony.

61
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,598
And I don't like it
when people wax on,

62
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:30,732
be it poetic or philosophic,

63
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:34,518
or somebody just likes
the sound of his own voice.

64
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,271
The irony here...

65
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:52,275
I hand-picked you in part
because of your good judgment.

66
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,671
This was not good judgment,
Ronald.

67
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,673
Can we talk about yours?

68
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,327
Shooting an ex-cop in the head?

69
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:04,374
The idea is we take girls
who won't be missed.

70
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,811
Dirty girls.
The kind of gummy-scummy

71
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,509
we scrape off the bottom
of our boots.

72
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:13,078
But you took two
wholesome teenagers,

73
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,578
the type people...
Friends and family...

74
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,038
Go looking for.

75
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,562
That's what brought Cody Hoyt
to me, Ronald.

76
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:21,870
Kidnapping doesn't always
go easy-peasy.

77
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:26,353
Mr. Hoyt had already
tumbled to the idea

78
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:29,007
that a long-haul trucker
might be responsible.

79
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,534
That's why
I had to deal with him.

80
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,145
I had to clean up
a mess you made.

81
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:50,377
Yes, ma'am?

82
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,379
Sounds good.

83
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,599
I'll be here.

84
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:02,693
Like the little old lady
who swallowed the fly.

85
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:06,610
I had to kill the spider
that came looking for the fly,

86
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,065
and now there's a little bird
by the name of Cassie Dewell

87
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:10,571
come looking for the spider.

88
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,837
We got ourselves a predicament,
Ronald.

89
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,324
Nobody knows where
we are. I'm so scared.

90
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,763
Hey.

91
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,244
Mom has a tracker on your phone.

92
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,291
Let's just hope that works.

93
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:36,684
What?

94
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:37,965
She has a tracker on my phone?
Why?

95
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:39,208
Why do you think?

96
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,862
Well, does she have one
on your phone?

97
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,629
She doesn't have to worry
so much about me.

98
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,452
I don't suppose you have
a tracker on your phone?

99
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,349
I don't suppose.

100
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,843
This is like
my biggest nightmare.

101
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,613
I'm gonna be on <i>Dateline.</i>

102
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:53,787
Hey.

103
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,965
Hey, look, this guy...

104
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,229
He went berserk
in a fit of rage, right?

105
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,275
Maybe once that rage passes,
he'll come back to his senses.

106
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,080
I can't believe
this is happening.

107
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:07,541
Danny. Not the time to panic.

108
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,108
Oh, really, Grace?
When would be a good time?

109
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,589
If he was going to kill us,
he would have done so.

110
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,811
Probably 'cause he wants
to do something to us.

111
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,465
Oh, God.

112
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,512
He wanted to talk.

113
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,819
He didn't just zap me.
He wanted to talk first.

114
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:29,389
I think we're dealing with
a very lonely person.

115
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,913
Okay. Good.

116
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,089
So, how do we trade on that?

117
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,034
- I can't believe
you grew up in Montana

118
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:48,799
and you don't know how to rope.

119
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:50,758
I don't need a rope.

120
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:53,761
Be it animals or people,
I just call 'em over.

121
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,809
"If a man has charisma,
he don't need no rope."

122
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:03,640
Seeing I got you by my side,
I must've done something right.

123
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:33,975
All night? Really?

124
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,759
Something came up.

125
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,979
Which doesn't explain
your failure to call.

126
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,113
Mom.

127
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:44,638
I worry. Can you get that?

128
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:47,989
Once you bring a child into
this world, you'll understand.

129
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:49,381
You worry.

130
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,676
When he's a baby, you worry,

131
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,384
"Is he gonna fall victim
to SIDS?"

132
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,736
When he's going to school,
"Is he gonna make a friend?"

133
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,910
You worry!

134
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,956
Forever.

135
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,090
Even when he's a grown man,
driving a truck.

136
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:05,310
Maybe especially then.

137
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,965
I'm getting sick of you
not respecting me.

138
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,099
This country is in
supply chain crisis.

139
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:14,450
The trucker is
today's American hero.

140
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:20,064
I am a hero, whether a mother
can see that... or not.

141
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,769
Ooh.

142
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:31,946
Seem pent up.

143
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,689
You get this way,
and it does not become you.

144
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,430
Are you okay?

145
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,084
I'm fine.

146
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:41,869
Hmm.

147
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,697
I don't think you are.

148
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,264
You're pent up.

149
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,179
Go back to your room
and masturbate yourself

150
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:51,313
while I make us some lunch,

151
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:54,055
and you return with
a better attitude.

152
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,322
Ronald?

153
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,803
What happened to your neck?

154
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,691
Officer Legarski?

155
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,172
Cassie Dewell.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,655
My stars.

157
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,744
You're beautiful.

158
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:33,224
- Thanks.
- I beg your pardon,

159
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,400
but we don't get many
beautiful women in Montana.

160
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,359
And you're Black.

161
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,579
We don't get many Black people
in Montana.

162
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,320
Beautiful and Black and Montana.
What are the odds?

163
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,148
They give out odds
on that sort of thing?

164
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,543
I truly beg your pardon.

165
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,153
My wife, Merrilee, tells me that

166
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,112
there isn't a shoe size too big

167
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:53,114
which my mouth
does not accommodate.

168
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:55,943
Have a seat.
Can I offer you some coffee?

169
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,422
Uh... Uh, there's not much food.

170
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,772
The restaurant's closed down.

171
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,164
I'm good. Thank you.

172
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,905
I can never keep track

173
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,865
of all the conflicting studies
on coffee.

174
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,562
One of them says
they're good for you.

175
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,018
The other says not so much.

176
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,870
All I know is...

177
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,393
nothing beats a cup of joe.

178
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:12,612
I hear ya.

179
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,135
I'm glad of that.

180
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,572
'Cause your partner, Cody,
truth be told,

181
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,444
he wasn't too keen
on hearing me.

182
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,404
What do you mean?

183
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,208
I don't think I'm telling you
anything you don't already know,

184
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,537
but he's a bit renegade.

185
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:28,802
Oh, when I brought up
probable cause,

186
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,282
kind of in one ear,
out the other.

187
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,024
The last I spoke to him,
he was headed out

188
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,636
to the Church of Glory
and Transcendence with you.

189
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,594
That's right, but then
he started banging on

190
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,509
about searches without warrants

191
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:44,121
and conversations
in custodial settings.

192
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:47,690
My loose cannon radar started
beeping, and I told him,

193
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:51,259
"I think you're gonna need to
fly solo on this one, partner."

194
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,614
Two teenaged girls
were possibly abducted.

195
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:02,400
The police officer tells
the private citizen
to go at it alone?

196
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:03,967
Well, I take your point,

197
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,100
but the girls aren't
officially missing.

198
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:09,451
And even if they were, certain
protocols need to be observed.

199
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,061
Like what?

200
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:17,067
Cassie, uh...

201
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,547
my, you are a pretty thing...

202
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,245
I'm kind of about
safeguarding my pension

203
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,553
this time in my life.

204
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:29,123
I couldn't risk Cody leading me
down the... the rogue path.

205
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,995
You last saw him when?

206
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:36,652
5:45 a.m., driving right out
this parking lot.

207
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,610
And you weren't curious?

208
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:39,960
Beg pardon?

209
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,788
I'm assuming you haven't
heard from him.

210
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:48,142
Did you try calling him
or... go out there?

211
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,754
What... What are you implying?

212
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,974
I'm just trying to get
a sense of things.

213
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,282
Get a sense of me?

214
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,769
I am a Montana State Trooper.

215
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,729
I was off-duty when
I came out here to help.

216
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:13,341
I'm out here yet again,
helping you, a private citizen.

217
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,822
You are out of line.

218
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:18,085
Now, we could start over,

219
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,379
try to get on the same team,

220
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,914
but I could just leave you be.

221
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,108
- It's your call.
- Shall we go to the compound?

222
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,873
Glory and Transcendence?

223
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,833
Well, we could, but same thing
I told Cody...

224
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,660
We need probable cause.

225
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,943
In all likelihood, we'll be
refused entry at the gate.

226
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:33,709
You know a friendly judge?

227
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:35,102
Seems to me, you go to him,

228
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,557
you tell him about
the missing girls,

229
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,192
Cody's vanished...

230
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,415
Oh, hell. Why not?

231
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,374
Great.

232
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,419
This'll take
a few hours, though.

233
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,204
Okay, um...

234
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,182
maybe I'll... I'll drive around
for a little bit.

235
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,729
Oh, no need to hang about.

236
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,557
If I get a warrant,
I'll have no trouble

237
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,385
rounding up a small posse
to go up there.

238
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,909
Head on back to Helena.

239
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,217
Maybe I'll hit
a few truck stops.

240
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,654
Come again?

241
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,699
Last night, I did some digging

242
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,919
on the FBI Highway
Serial Killer Task Force,

243
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,573
and there's
a possible connection

244
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,662
to long-haul truckers.

245
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,466
These girls could have stopped
for gas at a truck stop.

246
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,187
Got grabbed.

247
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,188
Never know.

248
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,148
No.

249
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,368
We never do.

250
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:44,911
<i>What do you mean
"creepy"? Creepy how?</i>

251
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,478
I can't say creepy how.
Just creepy.

252
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:50,960
<i>Rick Legarski is as
harmless as they come, honey.</i>

253
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,851
Word is he doesn't even
give out speeding tickets,

254
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,703
<i>that he lets everybody off
with a warning.</i>

255
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:58,098
I don't know. I got a vibe.

256
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,592
I take it still no news
from Cody?

257
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,667
Um... no.

258
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,626
This isn't good.

259
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:08,456
Whoa, there.

260
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,979
Can I, uh, have a private word?

261
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,555
I'll call you back.

262
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:18,769
Oh.

263
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,914
Why'd you lock the door?

264
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,483
Habit.

265
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,224
Something my father taught me.

266
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:41,271
A stranger... any stranger...

267
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,404
Which includes people
you think you might know

268
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,145
but possibly you don't.

269
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,929
If I'm your daddy,

270
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:50,672
I'd have concerns with you
driving around out here,

271
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:53,588
hitting truck stops
all by yourself.

272
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,680
Carry a gun, Cassie?

273
00:14:58,854 --> 00:14:59,986
I carry a gun.

274
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,248
You ever use it?

275
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:02,423
Why do you ask?

276
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,993
Never had the opportunity
myself.

277
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,734
I hope to.

278
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
I... I suppose every
law enforcement officer

279
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,130
secretly wants to.

280
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:16,045
Mm.

281
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:21,094
We all wonder how we'll respond
when our number's called.

282
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,704
When it's all on the line.

283
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,793
Will your hand shake?

284
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,971
Will you have the guts
to pull the trigger?

285
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,843
We all want to know ourselves
in the end.

286
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:37,371
You ever wonder?

287
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,808
I trained at the academy.

288
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,418
I'd pull the trigger.

289
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,725
Good girl.

290
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,685
But my point...

291
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:51,733
Well, it can be
the Wild West out here,

292
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:55,780
and no place for a pretty girl
if she's not prepared.

293
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,305
Like I said,
I trained at the academy.

294
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,915
But you didn't graduate.

295
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,746
I do my homework.

296
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,662
What happened?

297
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,841
I know those boys
at the academy.

298
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,451
Pretty thing like you,

299
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,212
I would reckon they'd grade you
on a curve.

300
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:18,194
So, is... is the goal here
to intimidate me?

301
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,369
'Cause it's not working.

302
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,944
I think we're underground.

303
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,604
You said that he got you
at a truck stop, right?

304
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,955
What, he just grabbed you?

305
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,523
I actually made the mistake
of climbing into his rig.

306
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,657
I work in human services.

307
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,747
Human services?

308
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,055
Oh.

309
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,404
To pay the bills.

310
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,580
By trade, I'm actually a singer.

311
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:59,061
A famous one, in fact,

312
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:03,022
although the fame part
is still ahead of me.

313
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,115
Grace.

314
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,289
What?

315
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,207
I think she... is a he.

316
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:15,860
What?

317
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:16,818
She's a boy.

318
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,428
- No.
- Yes.

319
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,213
What's all the whispering?

320
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,262
Look, um...

321
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:29,570
we could be stuck in here
a long time.

322
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:32,442
Might as well
get to know each other.

323
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,811
Can I ask you
a personal question?

324
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,576
Sure.

325
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,404
Do you have a penis?

326
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,320
As a matter of fact, I do.

327
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,334
You'll have to excuse my sister.

328
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,648
- Why?
- You can't just go around and
ask people if they have a penis.

329
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,413
I'm not making a judgment,
Grace.

330
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,217
You're not gonna try to
take advantage of me now,

331
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,068
are you, Danielle?

332
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,504
What? God, no.

333
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,941
Will you please shut up?

334
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,987
Look, I'm so sorry.
Please excuse my sister.

335
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,859
What did I do?

336
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,200
Please.

337
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:35,679
You called me a loser.

338
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,333
I didn't mean it.

339
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,509
You didn't mean it?

340
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:42,512
But you repeated it twice.

341
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:43,731
Loser.

342
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,996
And then you yelled it at me.

343
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:50,694
Loser!

344
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,348
Sir.

345
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,483
How old are you?

346
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,007
17.

347
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:06,928
Cleopatra was fixing to assume
power when she was 17.

348
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,409
I forgot how empowered
girls can be at that age.

349
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,672
And entitled.

350
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,414
You probably think
it's your world,

351
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:19,158
with your pretty little face,
your pretty hair.

352
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,683
My mother would make me
wash my hair every night

353
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,075
so it would smell pretty.

354
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:28,732
Yours smells pretty.

355
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,343
Sir, please.

356
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,606
How old are you?

357
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:34,869
16.

358
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,915
16?

359
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,004
What's your name?

360
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,837
I asked what your name is.

361
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,232
Grace.

362
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,191
How's your hair smell?

363
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:57,805
You think I'm an evil person,
don't you, Grace?

364
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,808
I'm actually not.

365
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,418
Right, Michelle?

366
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:03,592
I, um...

367
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,160
Tell her!

368
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,988
He's not evil.

369
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,077
See? I'm not evil.

370
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,646
You kidnap us. You tase us.

371
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,691
You have us locked up
in some dungeon,

372
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,302
and you think
you're a good person?

373
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,651
Grace...

374
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,827
Don't play with us, okay?

375
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,264
You want to be a monster?
Go ahead.

376
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:25,006
But at least be an honest one.

377
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,139
You sick pervert.

378
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,314
You creep.

379
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,579
I'm not a monster.
Do you hear me?

380
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,276
You're hurting me.

381
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,167
I'm not a monster,
and I'm not a pervert.

382
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:36,974
Do you understand?

383
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,411
- Aah!
- Oh!

384
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,327
Ow! You stupid little bitch!

385
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:42,676
Broke my nose!

386
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,853
Hey! These girls are just kids.

387
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,376
Do what you want with me,

388
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,683
but they're kids,
for God's sake.

389
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,989
You think I won't kill you?

390
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,214
I will kill you.

391
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,540
I'll be back.

392
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,428
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

393
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,561
You here to eat this time
or just order?

394
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,085
Yeah. Um, sorry about that.

395
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:47,044
I was, uh, a little
out of sorts yesterday.

396
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,742
I didn't notice.

397
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,265
Just coffee.

398
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,377
Can I ask you a question?

399
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:58,099
Sure.

400
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:02,277
Is there a way to report
somebody missing to the police

401
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:05,759
in a way not to incriminate
that missing person,

402
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,630
if she were doing
something illegal

403
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,415
at the time she went missing?

404
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:12,809
What do you mean?

405
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,985
That woman you saw me talking to
yesterday...

406
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,726
She kind of moonlights
as a prostitute.

407
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,512
And she always
checks in with me.

408
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:23,124
Haven't heard from her.
I'm getting worried.

409
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,953
She was working last night?

410
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,434
Yes.

411
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,131
Where?

412
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:32,612
I think a-a truck stop
outside Helena.

413
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,877
It could be coincidental,
but maybe not.

414
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,835
Disappearing on the same night.

415
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,402
And you said Helena?

416
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,216
I know the stop.
I'm gonna head out there.

417
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,637
Wait, no.
Come look at this first.

418
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:44,885
It's not good.

419
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:50,847
This is the web page

420
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:52,564
for the Highway Serial Killer
Initiative.

421
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,808
All these dots.
Interstates and highways.

422
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:57,376
Some analyst in Oklahoma
detected a pattern.

423
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,073
VICAP created a national matrix.

424
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:02,381
We've had more than
500 murder victims

425
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,555
along or near highways.

426
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,471
200 suspects,

427
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:09,083
almost all long-haul truckers.

428
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,651
Excuse me?

429
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,392
Mostly women.

430
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:16,917
High-risk lifestyles,
transients, substance abuse.

431
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,573
What did this trooper
have to say?

432
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,705
Not much.
For my money, he's involved.

433
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:23,959
- The trooper?
- Oh, please.

434
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,273
Yeah. Gut feeling.

435
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,753
That and Cody was last with him

436
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,668
before falling off
the face of the earth.

437
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,279
Rick Legarski doesn't even have
the imagination to be bad.

438
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,257
Can I talk to your cousin?
The one he was married to?

439
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,065
Cassie, honey,
you're wasting your time.

440
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,434
The man strikes me
as a sociopath,

441
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,498
and an ex-wife would know.

442
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,420
Okay, fine.

443
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:42,943
I'll call her.

444
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:50,994
God, if they're in there
somewhere, it's no man's land.

445
00:23:57,566 --> 00:24:00,221
Looks pretty swollen.
Sure she didn't break it?

446
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:01,831
It ain't broken.

447
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,008
She's vicious, that little one.

448
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:08,185
Oh, my God.

449
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,622
She's also beautiful.

450
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,145
All three of them are.

451
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,539
But the little one... she's 16.

452
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,149
Probably a virgin.

453
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:16,723
I think we could get
triple for her.

454
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,587
Those girls aren't marketable.

455
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,633
Uh, the lot lizard is,
but the sisters...

456
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:21,938
Why not?

457
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,549
I told you. They're wholesome.

458
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,396
They're college-bound.
They've got families.

459
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,597
I don't think
Canada will dare take them.

460
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,651
They'll bring scrutiny,
which puts us in a bind.

461
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,738
I'm busy!

462
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:45,048
Problems at home?

463
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,747
It's my mother.

464
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,096
She's been on me.

465
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,053
About what?

466
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,490
Everything.

467
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,492
Saying that I need
to aspire more.

468
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:58,366
That driving a truck is no way
to make... a living!

469
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:04,198
Ronald.

470
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:05,982
We need to make peace
with the fact

471
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,637
that most people don't get
what we're about.

472
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,988
We're the noble soldiers.

473
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:14,382
This nation is mired in muck.
We clean that muck up.

474
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,604
I get the same thing at home,
too.

475
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:21,694
Merrilee just wants to wallow
in her menopause melancholia

476
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,268
and blame all her unhappiness
on me.

477
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:24,653
It's what women do.

478
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:28,091
Let me give some thought
on those sisters,

479
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:29,484
but in the meantime,

480
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,338
that prostitute is
a bona fide deliverable.

481
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:32,792
Get her cleaned up.

482
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:33,706
We should be able to move her
out quickly.

483
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,316
And this Cassie Dewell?

484
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,796
I'll manage her.

485
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,841
You get the deliverable
shiny and bright.

486
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,060
Yes, sir.

487
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,138
Catchy song.

488
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:17,140
And on point.

489
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:18,751
Sorry?

490
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:22,798
Bad feeling. I get them.

491
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:29,936
The day my husband...

492
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,503
I somehow knew all day
without even knowing.

493
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,725
When I heard the clank
of the car door,

494
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:40,337
it sounded like a boom.

495
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,038
I looked out the window...

496
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:48,389
I saw the soldiers
dressed in formal uniform.

497
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:51,958
I knew.

498
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,437
Bad feeling then,

499
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,310
and I got one now, about Cody.

500
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,401
And goody-goody-two-shoes Rick?

501
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,796
He's all over this.

502
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,409
Well, I certainly hope
you're wrong.

503
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,802
On both.

504
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,199
The way I figure, we need two
different plans for survival.

505
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,898
One physical,
the other emotional.

506
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,592
For physical,
I was thinking Stockholm,

507
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,336
unless one of you guys
have a better idea.

508
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,294
Stockholm?

509
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:25,924
Yeah, it's not just captives
that fall for their captors.

510
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,317
Sometimes it works
the other way around.

511
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,169
We just need to get him
to emotionally bond.

512
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,519
Danielle, you're our best shot.

513
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,868
Me?

514
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,698
You're his Cleopatra.

515
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:39,266
Yeah, he seemed more into you
until you busted up his nose.

516
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,200
You said it yourself. All the
boys fall in love with you.

517
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,462
Yeah, I don't want him to fall
in love with me, Grace.

518
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:44,924
Danny, our lives are at stake.

519
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:48,014
And as... as creepy he was,
he seemed kind of shaky.

520
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:51,452
Fragile.

521
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,497
You said that he struck you
as lonely, right?

522
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,716
Vulnerable?

523
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,239
As psychotics go.

524
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:58,589
Okay, well,
maybe you can charm him.

525
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:01,288
I'm not.

526
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,464
Look, if we can just get him
to get the chains off,

527
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:06,510
then it's not impossible.

528
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,862
He does want to be liked.
I think he's got mother issues.

529
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,276
He brought her up in the truck.

530
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:12,492
So, what?
He takes the chains off.

531
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:13,866
Then what? Hmm?

532
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,626
Then we attack as if
our life depends on it.

533
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,193
I didn't realize you had
a real plan, Grace.

534
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:18,958
Look, we either fight back
or we don't.

535
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:21,264
That's all we've got.

536
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:32,014
Anybody that might
have seen her at all?

537
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:41,894
Hey, you got a sec?

538
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,634
No.

539
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,160
Do you recognize her?

540
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:50,729
She was here the other night

541
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,924
when you were working the cash
register in the mini-mart.

542
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:55,821
Yeah, she was here. So what?

543
00:28:55,995 --> 00:29:01,000
So you just made yourself
20 bucks.

544
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,504
But now I'm gonna need the
surveillance camera photos

545
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,834
of her from the security camera.

546
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,966
- No!
- Yeah.

547
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,708
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna
report you to the ABC

548
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,666
for serving underage girls
smokes and beer.

549
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,668
The girls told me you were.

550
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,367
The franchise loses its liquor
and tobacco license,

551
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,152
and you won't be able to find
another job in Montana

552
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:24,719
or the Dakotas.

553
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,852
Come on.

554
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:32,335
So, what's the "emotional"
survival plan?

555
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,509
Any ideas on that?

556
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,164
As a matter of fact...

557
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,513
Oh, God.

558
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:37,514
You said you sing, right?

559
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:38,951
Yeah.

560
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,406
Danielle and I sing.
A little bit.

561
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,128
We used to be in choir together.

562
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,827
Figured we'd start a...
a girl band.

563
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,091
Oh, my God. Seriously?

564
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,920
Look, there are studies that
link mental health and music.

565
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:54,183
Oliver Sacks, musicophilia...

566
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:55,797
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

567
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,534
You wonder why you have
no social life.

568
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,884
Was it a church choir?

569
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:01,538
Yeah. Why?

570
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:05,107
Well, we're looking to bond
with a psychopath.

571
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:07,675
They tend to be religious.

572
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,418
Maybe we sing a little
for his soul.

573
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,753
Time to go, Michelle.

574
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,495
On your feet, please.

575
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:14,062
Time to go where?

576
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:16,369
To a much better place,
I promise.

577
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,153
That doesn't sound good.

578
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,957
We've got new clothes
for you. Shampoo.

579
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,070
It's time to clean you up.

580
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:24,463
What's going on?

581
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,292
Let's go.

582
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,989
Where are you taking her?

583
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,488
I'm taking her to
the National Republic

584
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,123
of None of Your Beeswax!

585
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,952
Look, don't make this worse,
asshole.

586
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,913
What did you just say to me?

587
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:41,872
Our uncle's a cop,

588
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:44,745
and when you scared us
on the highway,

589
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:47,095
I took a picture of your plates
and I texted it to him.

590
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,315
He ran them.

591
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,404
It's only a matter of time.

592
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:00,239
You're lying.

593
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,676
I'm actually not.

594
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,606
She was lying, right?

595
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,522
I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.

596
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,177
Whatever.

597
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:27,048
I need you to shower.

598
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:30,175
Let's go. Take off your clothes.

599
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,881
I'd rather keep my clothes on.

600
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,448
I'll look the other way.

601
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:38,146
Tell me what's going on.

602
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,673
You say you're not evil.
I believe you.

603
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,936
Please tell me what's going on.

604
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,460
I did tell you.

605
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,354
You're being sent to
another place tomorrow.

606
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,465
A better place.
Where you do what you do.

607
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,206
But it will be safer.

608
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,817
I don't want to go
to this other place.

609
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:58,511
Well, you're going.

610
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,390
And don't make me
use this again.

611
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:07,001
Take off your clothes
and get in the shower.

612
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:08,568
And you're going to
wash your hair.

613
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,484
- Please.
- Let's go.

614
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:57,530
Make sure you use the shampoo.

615
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,452
Turn around.

616
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:08,323
You can't be finished already.

617
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:10,412
I want you to look at me.

618
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,416
Look at me.

619
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,133
This is me.

620
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:14,389
Are you okay?

621
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:15,695
Yes.

622
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,176
What happened?

623
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,439
He had a plan.

624
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:23,529
Now that plan is ruined.

625
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:32,973
We need to focus
on the positive.

626
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:35,976
Which is what exactly?

627
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,977
That we're not dead.

628
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,457
Yet.

629
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,505
What was the plan
that you ruined?

630
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,685
They're into trafficking.

631
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,557
They sell us off as sex slaves.

632
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,081
Oh, my God.

633
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,344
How did you ruin it?

634
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,346
I showed him the goods.

635
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:04,483
Got me out of going there,
but... I'm still here.

636
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:08,487
Still here is better.

637
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:14,710
Hey.

638
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,887
You've got us.

639
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,237
Don't forget that.

640
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,592
I'm headed to
the trooper's ex-wife now.

641
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:29,159
When someone talks that much,
they have something to hide.

642
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:30,574
<i>She knows you're coming?</i>

643
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,381
Denise set it up. How'd you do?

644
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:34,995
She was definitely
at the truck stop.

645
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,559
I got surveillance video
that'll confirm it.

646
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,431
As for what happened to her,

647
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:42,347
I'm still thinking it has to be
connected to the Sullivan girls.

648
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,957
All three of them go missing

649
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,525
along the same highway <i>
on the same night.</i>

650
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,657
Okay, I'm pulling up now.
I'll call you after.

651
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,318
Nothing yet.

652
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,887
Why aren't the police
out looking?

653
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:03,585
It hasn't even been a day.

654
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:07,285
Plus, this particular area,
there's not a lot of manpower.

655
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:08,764
If it goes on long enough,

656
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:10,810
maybe the FBI will get involved.

657
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,202
So, we just sit and wait?

658
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:15,683
No.

659
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,207
They're counting on us.

660
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:20,646
We do not wait.

661
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,995
She didn't send any photo.

662
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,605
There's no service in that area,

663
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:26,173
and she didn't send anything
from her cell,

664
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:30,525
because I checked 'em
before I destroyed them!

665
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:35,051
Are you 100% sure that
the other one has...

666
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,792
male equipment?

667
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,925
Because sometimes,
women have been known to have

668
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,579
outward-facing thing-a-ma-goos.

669
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:42,407
I'm positive.

670
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,669
Oh, God.

671
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,412
I swear.

672
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,717
Okay.

673
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,328
A little curve ball. We adjust.

674
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,807
That's what leaders do.

675
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,853
Let's just go home, sleep on it,

676
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,551
pray on it, start with a fresh
mind-set in the morning.

677
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:57,944
I'm sorry.

678
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:00,381
This is my doing.

679
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,775
I'm sorry.

680
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:07,301
We will get through this,
Ronald.

681
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:10,565
But things are about to take
an uglier turn.

682
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:21,489
Sally.

683
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:25,058
<i>I'm not calling about alimony.</i>

684
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,582
<i>You got your nose in something?</i>

685
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,845
I'm sorry?

686
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:33,153
<i>There was
a private detective here.</i>

687
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:37,113
<i>She was asking questions
about you.</i>

688
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:39,115
I beg your pardon?

689
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:40,900
<i>Are you honest?</i>

690
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,467
<i>Are you dangerous?</i>

691
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,034
<i>Are you prurient?</i>

692
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,558
<i>Please tell me you haven't been</i>

693
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:50,126
<i>hanging around
the strip malls again.</i>

694
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,391
And what was the name of
this private detective?

695
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,437
<i>Her name is Cassie Dewell.</i>

696
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:57,960
<i>Works with my cousin Denise.</i>

697
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:01,224
<i>She's not a fan, Rick.</i>

698
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:51,057
I couldn't sleep.

699

2
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,619
Oh!

3
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,748
I love it, Jerrie.

4
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,833
But it's a little old‐fashioned
for you, isn't it?

5
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,210
I'm going for a little hope.

6
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,129
You know, in pandemic times,
people want to believe,

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,839
especially in love.

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,882
Maybe you're right.

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,259
Think she's right, Jenny?

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,343
Huh?

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,887
Folks want to believe in love?

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,098
Uh... yeah.

13
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,475
Yeah, maybe.

14
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,144
Why not?

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,189
More coffee, hon?
Sure.

16
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,570
Didn't she just order?

17
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,488
One of her moods.
I've seen her moods.

18
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,823
Not pretty.

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,863
Hey... girl.

20
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,158
Hey.

21
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,119
Is that the lyric of the day?

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,997
"It's all over now"?

23
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,582
What's going on?

24
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,043
You tell me, Cass.

25
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,627
Are you sleeping
with my husband?

26
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,089
Whoa.

27
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,883
"Whoa."

28
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,385
That's not exactly a denial,
is it?

29
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,554
You've been in my home. Jenny ‐‐

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,265
E‐Excuse me,
Denise. I'm talking to Cassie.

31
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,476
Had supper at my table.

32
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,852
First of all, you two are over.

33
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,312
That what he said?

34
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,897
What you said.

35
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,815
Where is Cody, anyway?

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,363
Separated does not mean over.

37
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,156
It means separated.

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,742
Jenny, we sat having a beer,

39
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,328
you told me you wished
he'd meet someone.

40
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,415
So you took that to
mean it should be you.

41
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,543
'Cause that's the kind
of swell friend you are.

42
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,380
It just happened.

43
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,799
I ‐‐ I didn't plan it.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,176
And...

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,011
Nothing I'm proud of.

46
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,181
Well. So long as
you're not proud of it.

47
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,432
I thought you two were over.

48
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,476
We have a kid, Cassie.

49
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,355
And you knew?

50
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,773
You know,
it's none of my business.

51
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,942
Oh, no, that's a lie, Denise!

52
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,319
'Cause you make
everything your business.

53
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,078
Tell Cody
hi for me when he shows up.

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,623
Wow.

55
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,133
Great.

56
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,759
Uh, Cody. Hey.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,469
Uh, might want to pop in.

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,139
Stuff's come up.

59
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,275
Hey,
honey. You headed back out already?

60
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,860
Dead‐headed back.

61
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,196
Got a full load going
out to Jackson Hole later.

62
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,449
You took food to
your room last night,

63
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,034
but I didn't see that the
dishes were returned.

64
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,327
We keep a clean house, Ronald.

65
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,495
Mom.

66
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,165
My house, my rules.

67
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,834
That's it? Clean my dishes?

68
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,086
I didn't come to argue.

69
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,005
Why did you come, Mom?

70
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,132
I really don't mean to be a nuisance,
honey.

71
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,050
But I guess mothers
can get that way.

72
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,927
You know,
"Don't forget to clean your room,"

73
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,971
"Don't forget to do
your homework."

74
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,431
"Don't be 38 years old

75
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,975
and not have made
something of yourself."

76
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,519
Are you serious?

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,522
I realize this is my issue,
not yours.

78
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,316
My problem.

79
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,443
It's just that when I get
together with my friends,

80
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,904
they tend to brag
about their children.

81
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,364
"My niece just
passed the bar exam,"

82
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,285
"Johnny's just been made
vice president of whatever."

83
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,079
Eventually, eyes turn to me.

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,750
And I get to say...

85
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,503
"Ronald drives
a really big truck."

86
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,925
Oh.

87
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,427
Look at you,
making your boo‐boo face.

88
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,596
We'll talk about
it later if you want.

89
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,307
I guess there are benefits
to being a 38‐year‐old man

90
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,142
who still lives with his mother.

91
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,978
Opportunities for talk time.

92
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,816
You need to aspire, boo‐boo.

93
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,513
Whoa‐oa‐oa‐oa‐oa.

94
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,610
Good morning, sir.

95
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,028
I'm an idiot.

96
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,738
I pulled over to take
a picture of some elk,

97
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,323
and now I'm stuck.

98
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,326
Trooper Rick Legarski,
Montana Highway Patrol.

99
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,495
Mitchell Banks,
California tourist.

100
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,956
Ain't this America?

101
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,375
Best tech, worst roads.

102
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,835
Yeah.

103
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,754
Which part of California you from,
sir?

104
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,881
San Francisco.

105
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,549
San Francisco?

106
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,968
Sanctuary city.

107
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,177
Yeah.

108
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,804
Are you married, Mr. Banks?

109
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,389
I am.

110
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,515
Happily?

111
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,183
Yes. That's good to hear.

112
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,768
Tell me, Mr. Banks,

113
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,813
when you and your... bride?

114
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,856
Yeah.

115
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,065
Get conjugal,

116
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,651
does she like you to hop
in the hay and just gun it

117
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,280
or maybe take it nice and slow?

118
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,782
I beg your pardon?

119
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:54,580
I want you to make love
to that fine Montana soil.

120
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,873
Easy‐peasy.

121
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,668
Like the Pointer Sisters say,
slow hand.

122
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,795
Uh, in this case, a slow foot.

123
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,672
Oh. Okay.

124
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,965
Let's ease your way.

125
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,218
Nice and soft.

126
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,763
Gentle as she goes.

127
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,473
Oh! Ah, that's the ticket.

128
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,141
Wow! And you,
sir, are good to go.

129
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,393
Well, thank you so much. Oh,
my gosh.

130
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,438
Broken roads are like
broken people sometimes.

131
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,191
They just want to be loved,
easy‐peasy.

132
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,992
I love Montana.

133
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh, it's Mom.

134
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,188
Hi, Mom! Hi, Mom!

135
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,941
And what did I say about
being on the phone while driving?

136
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,109
You called us.

137
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,194
I'm just calling to remind you.

138
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,529
"Text me
when you get there."

139
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,863
And not a minute after.

140
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,490
Call me, too.

141
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,951
Make sure to check
the fuel gauge.

142
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,452
There was one other thing.

143
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,662
Mm. You love us?

144
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,706
No,
it must have been something else.

145
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,207
Love you, Mom.

146
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,709
Call me
when you arrive in Montana.

147
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,460
Bye! Bye!

148
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,838
Still can't
believe she let me go.

149
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,882
Oh. With me, she let you go,
'cause I got the good judgment.

150
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,384
You got the boobs. And the butt.

151
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,177
True. True.

152
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,892
Pick up, Jenny.

153
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,687
You keep your phone on ring and
vibrate and God knows what else.

154
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,064
Just answer the damn phone.

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,775
Hey. I'm off to pick up Kai.

156
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,152
Cassie. I'm running late.

157
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,155
Let's cut the wounded heart crap,
can we please?

158
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,073
Really? I never misled you.

159
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,950
You were the one who said,
"Don't get attached."

160
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,745
That you "keep your feelings
in a jar inside a locked drawer."

161
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,371
Your words.

162
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,583
Seems I'm not the only
one who lies to himself.

163
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,127
I'm off to pick up Kai.

164
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,760
I imagine it goes without saying

165
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,763
that you should've seen
this train wreck coming.

166
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,769
Don't need the lecture, Denise.

167
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,858
Looks like you do.

168
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,239
Looking for some company?

169
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,783
Not today, sugar.

170
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,263
How we doin'?

171
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,431
Want to party?

172
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,519
I don't bite.

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,438
Unless you're looking for that.

174
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,420
Wow.

175
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,340
You're really ready for me,
aren't you?

176
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,968
Something wrong?

177
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,886
You're very pretty.

178
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,680
Oh, why, thank you.

179
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,015
Aren't you sweet.

180
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,143
I haven't seen you before.

181
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,062
I'd remember you.

182
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,438
Have you been here before?

183
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,816
Truth be told...

184
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,987
I'm a little new at this.

185
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,996
What's wrong?

186
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,540
Huh?

187
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,749
You're so beautiful.

188
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,169
Oh.

189
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,337
What's your name?

190
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,719
Michelle.

191
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,013
What's yours?

192
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,728
You have a face
to fall in love with.

193
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,732
Oh, sugar. I'm not the type
that people fall in love with.

194
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,817
Why not?

195
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,199
Because they don't.

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,076
I think you're
selling yourself short.

197
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,748
People sell me
short all the time.

198
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,417
Even my own mother.

199
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,921
Don't let them do that.

200
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,756
I won't.

201
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,217
Do you have a mother?

202
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,429
Why do you ask?

203
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,226
Well, no offense,
but people in your... line of work,

204
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,853
I sometimes wonder
what their parents think.

205
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,357
Well,
I haven't spoken to my parents since...

206
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,942
I don't know when.

207
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,405
Well,
they sure made a beautiful daughter.

208
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,425
That was nice.

209
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,970
So, what's it gonna be?

210
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,888
Hmm?

211
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,015
I think...

212
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,642
it will be...

213
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,851
this.

214
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,436
Aah!

215
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,071
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,806
What did we say about you
calling to check up on me?

217
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,851
Well, if not me,
then who, Ronald?

218
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,687
I'm sorry we had
words this morning.

219
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,733
Sometimes I just... worry so.

220
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,067
Understood.

221
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,944
I don't think you do. Do you?

222
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,238
Tell me, Mom,

223
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,033
is there a reason you
can't be proud of me?

224
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,160
Truckers are not low‐lifes.

225
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,786
In fact,
we're just the opposite.

226
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,372
We're the lifeblood of
the American economy,

227
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,498
now more than ever.

228
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,666
Did you know that?

229
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,334
Yes.

230
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,088
You heal the nation.
I keep forgetting.

231
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,549
I'm driving.

232
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,477
- No! No, I can't wait!
- Stop having a tantrum!

233
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,145
You just went! I know this!

234
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,106
I know, but we just stopped!

235
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,567
Hey, baby.

236
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,943
It's Justin.

237
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,904
Uh, still on I‐90.

238
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,865
I'd say three more hours.

239
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,910
Ooh! Can you
possibly wait that long?

240
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,037
Yeah? Yeah? Really?

241
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,289
What do you want to do when I get there,
huh?

242
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,667
When you first touch
down on Planet Danielle.

243
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,045
What?

244
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,255
Okay.

245
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,048
Um... yeah, that's fine.

246
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,883
Can you... just text me that?

247
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,218
Bye.

248
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,137
There's some big crash on I‐90.

249
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,764
It's closed a few miles ahead.

250
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,265
What?

251
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,017
There are other routes.
He's gonna text me.

252
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,519
No, I don't think we
should get off the interstate.

253
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,688
We'll be fine. God!

254
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,898
More adventure.

255
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,756
He told me you were split.

256
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,383
Go.

257
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,843
If I thought for a
second that you two ‐‐

258
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,386
Cassie!

259
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,930
You're not stupid.
You made a choice.

260
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,392
Now,
coming in here expecting me to believe you?

261
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,601
That's stupid.

262
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,228
You can believe whatever you want,
but ‐‐

263
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,429
Right now I believe you
should get your ass out of here.

264
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,818
Okay,
so you're really committing

265
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,778
to the "stupid" thing,
aren't you?

266
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,408
You want to take
the shot? Do it.

267
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,050
Aaah!

268
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,945
The other one's next door.

269
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,364
Hard to tell who won.

270
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,670
Oh, come on!

271
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,593
Maybe the best thing would
be for us all to go someplace

272
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,011
and talk this out. I ‐‐

273
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,596
Really? I need to be home.

274
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,306
Justin's girlfriend
is due in late tonight.

275
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,475
I need to be there
when she arrives.

276
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,393
I need to be home, too.

277
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,354
Look, we gotta try to figure out

278
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,730
how to get on the
same page here.

279
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,531
Oh,
come on! Jenny and I are on the same page.

280
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,736
Yeah.

281
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,072
Sure.

282
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,782
Oh, great.

283
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,242
What?

284
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,868
That little red light is on.

285
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,078
The engine thingy.

286
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,412
Excuse me?

287
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,122
I think it gets hot sometimes.

288
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,959
You think it gets hot?

289
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,044
Don't start with me right now.

290
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,587
When was the last time

291
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,339
someone even looked
under the hood of this thing?

292
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,216
And it's gone.

293
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,676
See?

294
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,802
God.

295
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,637
We're fine.

296
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,681
Whoa!

297
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,687
He came out of nowhere!

298
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,021
He could've killed us!

299
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,606
What a dick!

300
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,191
Danny.

301
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,276
Slow down!

302
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,152
What are you doing?!
I'm gonna pass him.

303
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,322
Right. Good luck
trying to catch up to him.

304
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,803
Oh, please.

305
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,640
Thank you, God.

306
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,309
All we needed was a little hill.

307
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,727
Don't do anything stupid,
Danielle.

308
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,811
I'm just driving.

309
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,526
You want to play with me?

310
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,743
Whoa!

311
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,791
He did that on purpose. Yeah,
he did.

312
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,834
What an asshole.

313
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,170
What are you doing?!

314
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,338
The hill's getting steeper.

315
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,673
Don't do anything
stupid. I almost got him.

316
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,013
Roll down the window!
Roll it down! Oh! Oh!

317
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,142
Dickwad!

318
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,685
Loser! Shut up!

319
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,062
Loser!

320
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,065
Danny,
put your hands back on the wheel! Stop!

321
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,193
Come on!

322
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,368
No! No, no!

323
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,498
You didn't need to do that.

324
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,916
Oh, yes, I did.

325
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,709
On the downhill,
he'll be able to catch up to us.

326
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,628
Did you think about that?

327
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,087
No.

328
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,838
'Cause there's our exit.

329
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,049
Thank God.

330
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,217
Dickwad.

331
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,979
No!

332
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,147
Hey, Dad.

333
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,440
Hey.

334
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,661
What happened?

335
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,666
I got into a
little... altercation.

336
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,668
With who?

337
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,836
Jenny Hoyt.

338
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,129
Jenny Ho‐‐

339
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,422
Cody's Jenny?

340
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,548
About what?

341
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,216
Kai still awake?

342
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,385
Shouldn't be.

343
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,324
Mm.

344
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,485
Look what
crawled into your bed somehow.

345
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,539
Grandpa said okay.

346
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,666
We'll talk
about it in the morning.

347
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,085
Back to sleep now.

348
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,516
Are you sure
we're in the right place?

349
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,135
Do you even know where we are?

350
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,596
Yankee Jim Canyon,
near Yellowstone.

351
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,437
That's the way Justin
thought it would take us.

352
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,143
Hey.

353
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,687
We're fine.

354
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,525
Damn it.

355
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,691
What?

356
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,985
I have no bars.

357
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,904
I have one bar.

358
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,405
Which is now gone.

359
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,158
Great.

360
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,249
What's that?

361
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,335
I don't know.

362
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,754
Do not tell
me. Are we out of gas?

363
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,673
We're not out of gas, Grace.

364
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,550
What's happening?

365
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,136
That red light is on again.

366
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,180
We're
overheated. What?!

367
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,557
The engine is overheated,
Danielle.

368
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,850
No. You might have a ‐‐

369
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,268
That's not gonna work.

370
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,978
You might have a busted
radiator or something.

371
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,313
When was the last time you got this
car in for a tune‐up? Do not start with me.

372
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,148
We are on a 12‐hour road trip,

373
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,709
and you didn't get the car checked?! Grace,
do not start with me!

374
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,142
Are we working on us or not?

375
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,853
Just tell me, Cody.

376
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,772
You should ice that eye.

377
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,108
The thing about Cassie ‐‐

378
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,111
she's got a thing
about being moral.

379
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,616
She had to figure that
you and I were done done.

380
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:32,578
And she could have only
got that idea from you.

381
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,665
So I ask you again ‐‐

382
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,419
are we working on us or not?

383
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,214
We tried this, Jenny.

384
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,343
We just end up
wanting to kill each other.

385
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,850
Well.

386
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,187
I certainly want
to kill you now.

387
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,489
Long day?

388
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,201
Oh, big wreck on the I‐90.

389
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,996
My, my, my, my.

390
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,581
I kept your dinner warm.

391
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,582
Thanks.

392
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,174
Mmm.

393
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:21,227
I, uh,
rescued a stranded motorist.

394
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,855
Had one of those Teslas.

395
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,025
Stuck in mud. Might still be
there if I hadn't come along.

396
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,152
Mm.

397
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,073
It's a good feeling, Mother,

398
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,243
to make a positive impact
in a person's life.

399
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,079
I told him,
"Stop spinning your wheels.

400
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,206
Make love to Mother Earth,
easy‐peasy."

401
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,751
And he easy‐peasied
that car right out of there.

402
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,752
He did.

403
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,756
I don't like it when
you call me "Mother."

404
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,800
I'm your wife.

405
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,719
It's a figure of speech,
Merrilee.

406
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,803
You raised our children.

407
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,306
They're grown now. They're gone.

408
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,601
It's just you and me,
Rick. Husband and wife.

409
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,566
You need to touch me more.

410
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,528
Like a husband touches a wife.

411
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,449
Maybe like a Tesla
easy‐peasies Mother Earth.

412
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,702
This is the menopause talking.

413
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,662
I thought we agreed we'd
have no more menopause talk

414
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,914
at the supper table.

415
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,416
Did you actually
just say that to me?

416
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,752
Merrilee,
I've had a very long day.

417
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,837
I know the feeling.

418
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,356
So,
how long should we just sit here?

419
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,607
Since you're such the expert.

420
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,818
Until it cools. Then we
can check the radiator.

421
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,236
Why can't we just check it now?

422
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,113
Because it'll blow
up in our faces.

423
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,074
Look,
we just have to wait it out.

424
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,120
We still have power. All
the electrical is working.

425
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,288
You're gonna flood it. Don't.

426
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,873
God,
we could be out here all night,

427
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,458
and we can't even text anybody.

428
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,377
Okay,
somebody will eventually come along.

429
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,337
We won't be the only
ones traveling this road,

430
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,297
especially since
the I‐90's shut down.

431
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,134
Maybe we could walk
back to that campsite.

432
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,677
It was only a few miles back.

433
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,221
At night? There
are bears around here.

434
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,890
Great. What do
you suggest we do?

435
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,018
We wait in the car.

436
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,603
Somebody's bound to come along.

437
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,275
Grace.

438
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,776
Look.

439
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,528
Look.

440
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,029
I told you! See?

441
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,447
It's a truck.

442
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,867
We're fine.

443
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,161
Danielle, it's that truck.

444
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,553
Okay, look.

445
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,180
No, i‐if it is him,
I'll just apologize and say ‐‐

446
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,432
Lock the doors.

447
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,727
Okay. Okay. I can't
believe this.

448
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,104
No, um...

449
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,397
You know what? Maybe he'll help us,
okay?

450
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,065
I mean,
everybody gets angry on the road,

451
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,734
but that doesn't mean...

452
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,819
Look at me. What did
Dad always used to tell us?

453
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,905
"Never underestimate
people's capacity to be good."

454
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:24,994
Danny!

455
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,727
Hello?

456
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,604
Dad?

457
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,021
Justin?

458
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,148
Is Mom still with you?

459
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,151
She is,
yeah. We're here talking.

460
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,653
Everything okay?

461
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,489
No. Uh,
I think I have a problem.

462
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,324
What's going on?

463
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,534
Danielle ‐‐ she and
her sister never showed.

464
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,535
What?

465
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,663
Let me talk to him.

466
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,997
Honey?

467
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,499
They were supposed
to be here long ago.

468
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,334
They're not answering
their texts or calls.

469
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,877
And now their
mother is calling me.

470
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,837
I mean,
could she have run out of gas?

471
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,091
With that girl,
anything's possible.

472
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,093
I heard that.

473
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,889
Something is not right.

474
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,724
I have a bad feeling about this.

475
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,335
Danny? Danny?!

476
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,671
Hey. Danny?

477
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,032
Danny. Come on.

478
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,095
Y‐You're going out there now?

479
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,222
Those roads are so remote,
and not a lot of people

480
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,182
travel through Yellowstone
this time of night.

481
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,767
I'm gonna need you
to go into the office.

482
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,102
Uh, Denise is already there.

483
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,645
Speaking of which.

484
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,272
Hold on a sec.
I got her calling.

485
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,690
Hey.

486
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,818
Hey, so, I checked with State
Dispatch and NPS Emergency,

487
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,737
and there are no
reports of any accidents

488
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,739
involving a car
with that description.

489
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,824
Alright, see if the police
can put out an alert. Will do.

490
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,201
I also called a State Trooper
that I know is stationed

491
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,369
between Livingston and Gardiner.

492
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,954
He used to be married
to my cousin Sally.

493
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,997
You met her once.

494
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,957
Anyway,
his name is Rick Legarski.

495
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,417
I left a message
on his voicemail

496
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,585
and gave him your cell number.

497
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,627
Alright. Thanks, Denise.

498
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,148
Uh,
start checking the local hospitals.

499
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,090
I'm driving out there.

500
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,134
You mind manning the
office in case I need you?

501
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,385
I don't mind.

502
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,806
Maybe I should go with you.

503
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,099
No. Go be with Justin.

504
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,350
And call me if they show up.

505
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,351
Cody?

506
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,521
That was really nice.

507
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,657
Danny? Hey.

508
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,076
Come on. Danny?

509
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,285
You're okay. You're okay.

510
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,328
You're okay.

511
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,621
What happened?

512
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,164
We just got kidnapped. What?!

513
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,457
Come on. Okay.

514
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,625
By that trucker?

515
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,878
Yeah. He ‐‐ He hit us
with a Taser or something.

516
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,384
You have your phone?

517
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,886
No. He took our phones.

518
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,513
He took our phones.

519
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,724
I think there's
somebody else in here.

520
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,934
What?

521
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,118
I think it's a dead person.

522
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,749
It's a woman.

523
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,543
Is she dead? I don't know.

524
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,627
Don't touch it!

525
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,881
Come on. Come on.

526
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,092
Come on. Come on.

527
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,225
Hello?

528
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,977
Cody Hoyt? Speaking.

529
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,522
This is Trooper Rick Legarski
of the Montana Highway Patrol.

530
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,900
I got your number from
Denise Brisbane in Helena.

531
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,235
Thanks for calling me.

532
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,820
Says you're a private detective

533
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,572
looking for a couple
of missing teenagers.

534
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,781
That's right.

535
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,118
Uh, last seen in a red Ford Focus,
Colorado plates.

536
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,036
Somewhere in Yankee Jim Canyon.

537
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,497
Well,
I haven't been down that road tonight.

538
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,875
So,
we're running down the usual possibilities.

539
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,751
Breakdown, accident,

540
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,004
cellphone outage,
wrong turn somewhere.

541
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,881
They might be broken
down in Yankee Jim Canyon

542
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,716
somewhere where
the cell service is bad.

543
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,843
You want me to drive down there,
have a look?

544
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,386
Would you mind?

545
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,181
A Montana state
trooper's always on call.

546
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,474
Well, I really appreciate it.

547
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,226
Um, I'm en route myself.

548
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,686
If they do check in
and we hear anything,

549
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,937
I'll be sure to give you a call.

550
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,397
Okay.

551
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,191
Um...

552
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,650
Listen.

553
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,985
One other thing.

554
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,403
What?

555
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,529
Um...

556
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,614
How do I say this?

557
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,115
Um...

558
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,533
This isn't the first.

559
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,037
What do you mean?

560
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,664
I'm gonna send you a link.

561
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,501
We've had the occasional
young female vanish around here.

562
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,478
Where are you going?

563
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,980
Some teenagers have gone
missing out on Yankee Jim.

564
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,815
It's 2:30 in the morning.

565
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,234
Merrilee ‐‐

566
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,277
You're not the only state trooper,
Rick.

567
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,196
People could be in
real danger out there.

568
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,240
Somebody's always
in danger somewhere.

569
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,202
This here? It could be my
number getting called finally.

570
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,329
Why are you
looking at me like that?

571
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,122
A person only gets one life.

572
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,500
I only get one life.

573
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,834
I'm not sure this is it.

574
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,294
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

575
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,837
Here's a hot flash for you,
Rick.

576
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,839
This isn't working for me.

577
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,759
Teenage girls missing.

578
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,220
What would you have me do?

579
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,393
I'm pulling up the link you
got from the state trooper.

580
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,019
Church of Glory
and Transcendence.

581
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,354
Yeah, here it is. Got it.

582
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,273
Rumors about it being a cult.

583
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,566
I didn't know it
was in that area.

584
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,567
A lot of articles.

585
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,406
Listen. Remember those missing
prostitutes from the truck stops?

586
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,157
Nothing ever came of that.

587
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,493
Well, they never really investigated it,
from what I'm told.

588
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,245
These girls have
been passing truck stops, right?

589
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,621
Maybe you should call Jenny.

590
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,749
I think she worked on that
some when she was a cop.

591
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,418
Just walked in. Call you back.

592
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,836
So,
I'm striking out with hospitals,

593
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,671
which I guess is a good thing.

594
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,298
Cody said you
worked on those cases

595
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,009
with the missing prostitutes?

596
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,140
I'll need the computer.

597
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,184
Uh...

598
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,728
Think you could not push me,
Jenny?

599
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,229
Do you want me to help or not?

600
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,689
Maybe you could help
without pushing me?

601
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,941
Maybe you both
could act your age?

602
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,239
It's possible they pulled into
a truck stop to get food or gas.

603
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,407
Maybe they were grabbed.

604
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,743
Prostitutes were
climbing into the cabs.

605
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,828
Nobody was ever
seen being grabbed.

606
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,539
Well,
they wouldn't be climbing into the truck.

607
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,958
Let's check the VICAP base.

608
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,252
VICAP. We don't
have access to that.

609
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,337
I do.

610
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,012
Aah!

611
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,680
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, please!

612
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,723
Aaaaaah!

613
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,919
Please!
Please let us go!

614
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,171
Please!

615
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,592
I unwrapped your little package.

616
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,304
She's dead.

617
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,434
Please. What did you do?

618
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,894
We didn't do anything.

619
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,604
Please.

620
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,356
We won't say anything.

621
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,482
I promise.

622
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,900
Get against the wall. No,
please ‐‐

623
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,027
I said get against the wall!

624
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,029
Shut up! Get against the wall!

625
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,364
Okay!

626
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,591
Aah!

627
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,188
No! No!

628
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:13,940
No!

629
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,274
Aaaaah!

630
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,404
No, no, no! Please!

631
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,077
No! Stop!

632
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,939
Hello?

633
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,567
Hello?

634
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,695
Danny?

635
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,156
Danny?

636
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,699
Grace.

637
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,294
Where are we?

638
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,977
How did he get you?

639
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,403
He got me at a truck stop.

640
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,577
What do you think
he plans to do with us?

641
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,036
Cody?

642
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,662
Rick Legarski,
Montana Highway Patrol.

643
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,830
I really appreciate this.

644
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,333
C'mon in.

645
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,668
This place shut down
'cause of the pandemic.

646
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,631
I know the owner. He gives
me the keys. I keep an eye on it.

647
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,383
If it ever reopens,
he says he'll give me a piece of it.

648
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,886
Eh, we'll see.

649
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,013
Did you see anything
on your trip down?

650
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,056
No.

651
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,390
You?

652
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,391
No.

653
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,103
Look, before we get started,
a few ground rules.

654
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,980
This is delicate, but...

655
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,151
I live here,
and I know everybody.

656
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,945
I'm involved in
civic organizations,

657
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,863
like Kiwanis, Lions' Club.

658
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,615
I see folks from this
valley every day. Yeah.

659
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,826
I can't let it get out that I
got a hate‐on for any of them.

660
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,627
Whatever you tell me
stays with me.

661
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,831
Uh‐huh.

662
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,125
I've heard a few things.

663
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,210
Like what?

664
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,419
That you can be renegade.

665
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,171
Fired from three
different departments,

666
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,547
which is why you're
working private.

667
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,758
All in the past. Uh‐huh.

668
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,843
Well, I have a couple of years

669
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,512
before I retire
with full benefits.

670
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,513
Got it.

671
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,810
Sorry. My ex.

672
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,270
Say no more. Woman problems.

673
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,606
A man's got a woman.
Then he got problems.

674
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,570
You familiar with VICAP?

675
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,572
FBI?

676
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,700
It's the Violent Crimes
Apprehension Program.

677
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,451
Basically a database
for missing persons.

678
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,245
I've heard about
it. Never used it.

679
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,621
They show 12 missing females

680
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,666
within a 100‐mile radius
of where we're sitting.

681
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,127
All in the last two years.

682
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,088
Most of them last
seen at truck stops.

683
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,799
We got a few truck
stops along the way.

684
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,551
This church, uh...

685
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,192
the membership include
long‐haul truckers?

686
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,266
There's a faction of truckers
mixed up in sex trafficking.

687
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,643
Really?

688
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,187
Well,
how do you feel about driving up there?

689
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,481
To the church? Now?

690
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,069
You got kids, Rick?

691
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,573
Say no more.

692
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,910
You are gonna cost me
my pension. I'm sure of it.

693
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,246
I promise to behave.

694
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,665
Let's take my truck.
Cops cars tend to spook.

695
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,208
That, they do.

696
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,002
I hope you got a good chassis,

697
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,962
'cause we'll be covering
some bumpy territory.

698
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,715
Man, you get good reception.

699
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,011
Hey. We're headed to the church.

700
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,346
Now? It's a long shot,
but I'm out here.

701
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,390
I got this state trooper
with me. He knows the area.

702
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,017
Even so, Cody...

703
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,602
I'll call you
when I learn more, okay?

704
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,898
Let's go.

705
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,232
It's about a half‐hour or so.

706
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,194
You need to pee or anything
before we go?

707
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,029
I'm good.

708
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,531
And, uh, just to review.

709
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,950
The likelihood is, we're gonna
come across people I know ‐‐

710
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,870
good people ‐‐ so we are gonna
keep our manners in play.

711
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,289
I promise.

712
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,503
If I may ask,
where'd you hear that

713
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,505
about long‐haul truckers
being tied to slave trade?

714
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,131
'Cause I sure as Shirley
never heard that.

715
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,802
Nothing official.
Just cop‐to‐ex‐cop grapevine.

716
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,012
That's the problem
with being a state trooper.

717
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,389
Nobody talks to us.

718
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,102
Oh, one other thing.

719
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,874
Ronald.

720
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,585
You've been sloppy.

721
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,550
My, my, my.

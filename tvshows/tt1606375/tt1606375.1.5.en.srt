2
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,885
You made me jump.

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,880
Daisy, what is the matter with you?
You're all thumbs.

4
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,357
Sorry. I hate this room.
Why?

5
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:53,800
What's the matter with it?

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,840
Daisy?

7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,000
Who's that from, Papa?
You seem very absorbed.

8
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,600
Your Aunt Rosamond.
Anything interesting?

9
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,845
Nothing to trouble you with.

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Poor Aunt Rosamond.
All alone in that big house.

11
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:38,725
I feel so sorry for her.
I don't.

12
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,160
All alone, with plenty of money,
in a house in Eaton Square?

13
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:44,325
I can't imagine anything better.

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,805
Really, Mary, I wish
you wouldn't talk like that.

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,200
There will come a day when someone
thinks you mean what you say.

16
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,097
It can't come soon enough for me.

17
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:55,925
Carson, I'll be in the library.

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,045
Will you let me know
when Her Ladyship is down?

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,360
Certainly, milord. Sybil, darling,
this one's for you.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,440
I saw another opening for
a secretary and I applied.

21
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:11,325
But you never said.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
I didn't want you
to be disappointed.

23
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,925
I thought you'd given up.

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,200
I'll never give up and nor will you.

25
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,277
Things are changing for women.

26
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:21,716
Not just the vote, but our lives.

27
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,085
But it's tomorrow! At ten o clock.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,600
Last time we waited for weeks
and weeks, and this one's tomorrow!

29
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,240
Then we must be ready by tomorrow,
mustn't we?

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,245
I thought I'd write to Edith

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,845
to settle our promised church visit.
If you want.

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,160
We can't throw her over, when she
made such effort for the last one.

33
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:42,417
It's all in your head.
I don't think so.

34
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:44,605
Then she's barking
up the wrong tree.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,165
Poor Edith. I hope there's
a right tree for her somewhere.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Ma'am, I was wondering if I might
take some time this afternoon

37
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,125
to help in the village hall.

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,280
Why? What's happening? It's the
flower show, sir, next Saturday.

39
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,400
I'll give my father a hand with
his stall, if I may. You must go.

40
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:01,040
And so, I'm afraid, must I.

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,285
Is Mr Carson about?

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,760
I don't think so.
I was just looking for him, myself.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,365
Busy?

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm just trying to sort out
the wretched flower show.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,845
I've had a letter from Rosamond.
Don't tell me:

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,160
she wants saddle of lamb and all the
fruit and vegetables we can muster.

47
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,077
She enjoys a taste of her old home.

48
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:44,960
She enjoys not paying for food.

49
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,885
There's something else.

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,800
Apparently, the word is going round
London that Evelyn Napier

51
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:51,725
has given up any thought of Mary.

52
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,580
That he's going to marry
one of the Semphill girls.

53
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:58,427
She writes as if, somehow,
it reflects badly on Mary.

54
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:02,240
Your dear sister is always
such a harbinger of joy. No...

55
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,685
as if...

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,520
as if Mary had somehow been found
wanting in her character.

57
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:11,277
Well, I don't believe Mr Napier
would have said that.

58
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:14,000
Neither do I, really, but -
She ought to be married.

59
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,205
Talk to her.

60
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,845
She never listens to me.

61
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,040
If she did, she'd marry Matthew.

62
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,165
What about Anthony Strallan?

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,165
Anthony Strallan is at least my age
and as dull as paint.

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,520
I doubt she'd want to sit next to
him at dinner, let alone marry him.

65
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:31,645
She has to marry someone, Robert.

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,440
And if this is what's being said
in London, she has to marry soon.

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,005
You shouldn't do that in here.

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,445
I don't like being in the pantry
all alone.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,720
Mr Carson won't mind.
He's gone into the village.

70
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,885
He'll mind if I tell him.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,140
That's pretty.
Do you think so?

72
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,325
She wants it put onto a new shirt,

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,880
but it's a bit old-fashioned
to my taste. Oh, no, it's lovely.

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Have you recovered, Daisy?

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
What from?
She had a bit of a turn.

76
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:07,965
When we were in Lady Mary's room.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,245
I'm fine, thank you.
What sort of a turn?

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,800
Did you see a ghost? Leave her, if
she doesn't want to talk about it.

79
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:18,080
I've often wondered if this place
is haunted. It ought to be.

80
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:21,080
By the spirits of maids and footmen
who died in slavery?

81
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,000
But not, in Thomas's case,
from over work.

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,880
Come on, Daisy. What was it?

83
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,045
I don't know. I was thinking...

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
first we had the Titanic -
Don't keep harping back to that.

85
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,497
I know it was a while ago,
but we knew 'em.

86
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:45,965
I think of how I laid the fires
for Mr Patrick,

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
but he drowned in them icy waters.
Oh, for God's sake.

88
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,085
And then there's the Turkish
gentleman.

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,720
It just seems there's been
too much death in the house.

90
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,840
What's that got to do
with Lady Mary's bedroom?

91
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,800
Nothing. Nothing at all.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,805
Afternoon, ma'am.

93
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,000
When do you put that magnificent
display of prizes on show?

94
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:19,725
Not till the day itself.

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,965
I remember a superb cup
from last year.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
The Grantham Cup. It was donated
by the late Lord Grantham.

97
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:27,760
For the Best Bloom In The Village.
And who won it?

98
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,360
I did.

99
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,280
Well done.

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,205
And the year before?

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,400
Her Ladyship won that one, too.

102
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,320
Heavens, how thrilling.

103
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:43,205
And before that?

104
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,360
You've met my father.

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,960
Good afternoon, Mr Molesley.
What are you showing this year?

106
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:52,365
Oh, this and that.

107
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Only the finest roses in the
village. Really?

108
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,125
What an achievement.

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,760
It's a wonderful area for roses.

110
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,765
We're very lucky.

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,960
We'll see some beautiful examples
across the show.

112
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:05,645
Won't we, Mr Molesley?

113
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,320
If you say so, Your Ladyship.

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
What's up with you?

115
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,085
Nothing.

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,600
His Lordship blames Mr Napier for
spreading gossip about Lady Mary,

117
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,560
but it was you, wasn't it?
Why do you say that?

118
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,485
Because Napier wasn't in on it.

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Only four people know
he was in her room that night.

120
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:39,697
You, me, Lady Mary
and possibly Daisy.

121
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:41,686
And I haven't said nothing
to nobody.

122
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,605
I didn't tell about Pamuk.
I just wrote

123
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,765
that Lady Mary was no better
than she ought to be.

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Who did you write it to? A friend
of mine. Valet to Lord Savident.

125
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,725
You know what they say
about old Savident.

126
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,800
Not so much an open mind as an open
mouth. No wonder it's round London.

127
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:56,720
You won't tell, will you?
I'm in enough trouble as it is.

128
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,605
Why? What's happened?

129
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,520
Mr Bates saw me nicking
a bottle of wine.

130
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:02,445
Has he told Mr Carson?
Not yet.

131
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,445
But he will
when he's feeling spiteful.

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,080
I wish we could be shot of him.
Then think of something quick.

133
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:09,680
Turn the tables on him, before
he has the chance to nail you.

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,480
I thought you went to bed hours ago.
I was writing a note for Lynch.

135
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,520
I need the governess cart tomorrow.

136
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:21,845
Oh?
I'm going to Malton.

137
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,725
Oh, don't risk the traffic
in Malton.

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,125
Not now every Tom, Dick and Harry
seems to have a motor.

139
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,760
Hardly. Last time, there were five
cars parked in the market place

140
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,125
and another three drove past
while I was waiting.

141
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,840
Get Branson to take you in the car.
Neither of us are using it.

142
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,480
I thought I'd pop in
on old Mrs Stuart.

143
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,960
Will you tell Mama, if I forget?

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,245
You're late this morning.

145
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,560
The library grate needed
a real going over.

146
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,725
Are any of them down yet?

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
Lady Sybil's in the dining room.
I'll start with her room, then.

148
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,405
Daisy?

149
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,080
You know when you were talking about
the feeling of death in the house?

150
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:06,045
I was just being silly.

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,485
I found myself wondering
about the connection

152
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,600
between the poor Turkish gentleman,
Mr Pamuk, and Lady Mary's room.

153
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:17,480
Only you were saying how you felt
so uncomfortable in there.

154
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,725
Well, I've...

155
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,840
I've got to get on.
I'm late enough as it is.

156
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,920
Hello.

157
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,780
Is everything all right?
Oh, hello.

158
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,920
I am about to send a telegram.
Oh.

159
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,885
Papa's sister is always nagging him
to send supplies to London

160
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,640
and then we cable her, so her butler
can be at King's Cross to meet them.

161
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:59,080
It's idiotic, really.
Is this Lady Rosamond Painswick?

162
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,005
You HAVE done your homework.

163
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,805
She wrote to welcome me
into the family,

164
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,720
which I thought pretty generous
given the circumstances.

165
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:08,600
It's easy to be generous
when you have nothing to lose.

166
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,880
So are you doing any more
church visiting with Edith?

167
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,965
My mother's trying
to set something up.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,420
Well, watch out.
I think she has big plans for you.

169
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,840
Then she's in for an equally
big disappointment.

170
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,845
Is it all right to do the fire?

171
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,245
Why are you so late?
I went back to my room

172
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,640
after I'd woken everyone, and I
just shut my eyes for a moment.

173
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,737
I've been trying
to catch up ever since.

174
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,800
Have you had any breakfast?
Not a crumb.

175
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,765
Here.

176
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,485
You can't take her biscuits.

177
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,605
She never eats them. None of them do.

178
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,360
They're just thrown away and changed
every evening. Thanks.

179
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:53,200
She won't mind anyway.
She's nice, Lady Sybil.

180
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
Ugh.

181
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,840
Gwen?

182
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,520
May I ask why you are sitting
on Lady Sybil's bed?

183
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:09,205
Well, you see, I had a turn.

184
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,680
Like a burst of sickness.
Just sudden, like.

185
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:15,165
I had to sit down.
It's true.

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,960
You'd better go and lie down.
I will tell Mrs Hughes.

187
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,845
I don't need to interrupt
her morning.

188
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,845
I'm sure I'll be fine,
if I could just put my feet up.

189
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,640
And how many bedrooms have you still
got to do? Just one. Lady Edith's.

190
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,445
And you can manage on your own?

191
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,960
Well, she's no use to man or beast
in that state. Go on.

192
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,480
Shoo.

193
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,000
Daisy, may I ask why you are holding
Lady Sybil's biscuit jar?

194
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,800
I was just polishing it
before I put it back.

195
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:49,800
See that you do.

196
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry, milady,
but I can't do more than my best.

197
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,445
Is there some difficulty,
Your Ladyship?

198
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,520
Dear Mrs Hughes, as you know
we're giving a dinner on Friday

199
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:09,805
for Sir Anthony Strallan?
Yes, milady.

200
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,320
It seems he is particularly fond
of a new pudding.

201
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:14,800
It's called Apple Charlotte.
Do you know it?

202
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,525
I'm not sure.

203
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,680
His sister, Mrs Chetwood,
sent me the receipt.

204
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm trying to persuade Mrs Patmore
to make it.

205
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,685
And I'm trying to persuade
Her Ladyship

206
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,920
that I have planned the dinner
with her and I can't change it now.

207
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,137
Why not? Because everything's
been ordered and prepared.

208
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,320
Well, there's nothing here
that looks very complicated.

209
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,245
Apples, lemons, butter...

210
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,640
I cannot work from a new receipt
at a moment's notice!

211
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:40,520
But I can read it to you,
if that's the problem.

212
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:43,045
Problem? Who mentioned a problem?

213
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,845
How dare you say such a thing
in front of Her Ladyship!

214
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,200
Very well. We'll try it another time
when you've had longer to prepare.

215
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:52,040
We'll stay
with the raspberry meringue.

216
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,200
And very nice it'll be, too.

217
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm sure.

218
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,880
Have you taken leave of your senses?

219
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:03,337
I'm so sorry about that, milady.

220
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,760
Never mind. I was asking a lot.

221
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:08,205
Do look after that girl.

222
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,085
Daisy? She's used to it.
She'll be all right.

223
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,920
I wonder. Mrs Patmore looks ready
to eat her alive.

224
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:16,925
I was only trying to help.

225
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,200
Like Judas was only trying to help,
I suppose,

226
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,440
when he brought the Roman soldiers
to the garden!

227
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,400
I had to let the skirt down
a little, but I can put it back.

228
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,405
No, it's yours.

229
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,000
What will happen if one of the maids
finds your room empty?

230
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,400
It'd only be Anna
and she wouldn't give me away.

231
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,520
She's like a sister.
She'd never betray me.

232
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:51,400
Then she's not like my sisters.

233
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,080
Walk on.

234
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,245
Shall I give you a hand?

235
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,000
Ah, would you?
It takes half the time with two.

236
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,520
I always feel a bit sorry
for Lady Edith.

237
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:11,925
Me too. Although I don't know why.

238
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,125
When you think what she's got
and we haven't.

239
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,760
Mrs Hughes said she was after
the other heir, Mr Patrick Crawley.

240
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,600
The one who drowned.
That was different.

241
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,605
She was in love with him.

242
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,660
What happened?
She never got a look-in.

243
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,645
He was all set up to marry Lady Mary.

244
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
Then he's a braver man than I am,
Gunga Din.

245
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,445
Sad to think about.

246
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,880
It's always sad when you love someone
who doesn't love you back.

247
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,840
No matter who you are.

248
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,120
No, I mean it's sad that he died.

249
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,037
Oh.

250
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,885
Yes.

251
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,040
Very sad.

252
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:51,125
He was nice.

253
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,165
Well, thank you for that.

254
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,645
Much appreciated.
My pleasure.

255
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,040
Perhaps Mr Patrick did love her
back, he just couldn't say.

256
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,645
Why ever not?

257
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Sometimes we're not at liberty
to speak.

258
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:11,160
Sometimes it wouldn't be right.

259
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,080
Take a seat.

260
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,045
The flower show?

261
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,840
Oh, I thought I was in for another
telling off about the hospital.

262
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,525
No, this time it's the flower show.

263
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,965
I've been to see
old Mr Molesley's garden

264
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,120
and his roses are the most beautiful
I've ever laid eyes on.

265
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:12,725
Go on.

266
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,725
You may not know it, but I believe
the committee feel obliged

267
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,840
to give you the cup for the Best
Bloom as a kind of local tradition.

268
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,445
No. No, I do not know that.

269
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,200
I thought I usually won the prize
for Best Bloom In The Village

270
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,920
because my gardener had grown
the best bloom in the village.

271
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:32,480
Yes, but you don't USUALLY win,
do you?

272
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,240
You always win.

273
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,165
Yes. I have been very fortunate
in that regard.

274
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,760
But, surely, when Mr Molesley's
garden is so remarkable

275
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,480
and he is so very proud
of his roses -

276
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:48,217
You talk of Mr Molesley's pride.

277
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,885
What about my gardener's pride?

278
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,480
Is he to be sacrificed on the altar
of Molesley's ambition?

279
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,760
All I'm asking is
that you release them

280
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,245
from any obligation to let you win.

281
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,120
Why not just tell them to choose
whichever flower is best?

282
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,960
But that is precisely
what they already know.

283
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:06,960
And do!

284
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,600
I'm sorry, milord.
I didn't think you'd be in here.

285
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:27,840
Are my eyes deceiving me
or is one of these missing?

286
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,880
I don't know them well enough.

287
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,885
No. Why would you?

288
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,940
But there's a very pretty
little blue one

289
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,925
with a miniature framed
in French paste.

290
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,400
It was made for a German prince.
I forget who...

291
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,480
Unless it's been moved
for some reason.

292
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,800
But why would it be?

293
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,565
Can you help.
I shall be so grateful.

294
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,080
Our horse has cast a shoe.
Is there a smithy nearby?

295
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,240
Aye, you can try old Crump
in the next village.

296
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,885
Thank you.

297
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,805
You see? Help's at hand.

298
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,680
At least it happened
on the way home.

299
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,737
Well, they'll be worried about you.

300
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:13,760
And if they check on me,
I'm finished.

301
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,000
Is Her Ladyship wearing that now?

302
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:19,805
This is for Friday night.

303
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,920
I thought I'd give it a press
while I had time.

304
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:23,925
Do you know what's happened
to Lady Sybil?

305
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,680
The others' changes are ready,
but there's no sign of her.

306
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:29,937
Don't you start. I've had Her
Majesty on at me all afternoon.

307
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:33,125
Mr Carson says he'll fetch the
police if she's not back soon.

308
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,240
Sorry, Miss, but Mr Crump's staying
over at the Skelton estate tonight.

309
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,480
He's working there all week.
Is there anyone else?

310
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:40,320
Not that I know of.

311
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,600
Come on Dragon. Come on!

312
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,800
Dragon, if you don't move now,
I'll have you boiled for glue!

313
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,245
What if she's overturned?

314
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,445
What if she's lying in a ditch
somewhere?

315
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,965
I'm sure she'll be back
in the shake of a lamb's tail.

316
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,680
The truth is they're all getting
too old for a mother's control.

317
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:20,017
They're growing up.
They've grown up.

318
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,026
They need their own establishments.

319
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm sure they'll get plenty
of offers.

320
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
No-one ever warns you about bringing
up daughters.

321
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:31,005
You think it's going
to be like Little Women.

322
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,000
Instead they're at each other's
throats from dawn till dusk.

323
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
You look done in.

324
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,160
I'll bring you some food up later
when we've finished dinner.

325
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,240
Where were you?

326
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,605
You came up, then?

327
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,720
Of course I did.
I had to change for the afternoon.

328
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:59,280
Did you cover for me?
What do you think?

329
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,080
I don't suppose this had anything
to do with Lady Sybil.

330
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:07,325
Oh, Anna, it was a nightmare.

331
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,780
I don't know how I got in
without being seen.

332
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm sure I left a trail of mud
up the stairs.

333
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:15,280
So...did you get the job?

334
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,920
Well, we'll have to wait and see.

335
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,885
Sorry to bother you, milady,

336
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,765
but your mother wanted you
to know Lady Sybil's back.

337
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,200
She's changing now, so dinner won't
be late, after all. What happened?

338
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,960
The horse went lame.

339
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,160
Is there anything else?

340
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,920
There is something
that's been troubling me.

341
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,480
You remember the Turkish gentleman,
Mr Pamuk?

342
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:56,317
The one who died all sudden, like.

343
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,120
Of course I remember.
Well...

344
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:00,080
it's Daisy, milady.

345
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,845
The kitchen maid.

346
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,565
Only she's been talking recently

347
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,360
as if she had ideas
about Mr Pamuk's death.

348
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:10,965
What sort of ideas?

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,125
Well, I've no proof
and maybe I'm wrong.

350
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,000
But I've a sense she knows
something, but won't say what.

351
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,680
Something involving Lady Mary.

352
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,540
Well, how absurd.

353
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:28,805
What could she know?

354
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,320
Whatever it is, she won't say.
Not to us, anyway.

355
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,840
Have you spoken to Lady Mary
about this?

356
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,845
I didn't like to, milady.

357
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,085
It seemed impertinent somehow.

358
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,600
But I thought someone in the family
ought to know about it.

359
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,320
Quite right.

360
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,880
Bring the girl to my room...
tomorrow. After breakfast.

361
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,640
What did she want?

362
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:04,325
Nothing.

363
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,280
Just a message from Mama to say
that Sybil had turned up alive.

364
00:22:07,315 --> 00:22:09,080
Poor darling.

365
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,445
She had to walk for miles.

366
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,920
I don't think I'd have got down,
however lame the horse.

367
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:16,325
No.

368
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,400
I don't believe you would.

369
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,725
I couldn't say, milady.

370
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,680
I don't know
what Miss O'Brien means.

371
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:35,320
I didn't see nothing.

372
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,245
Well, not much.

373
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,200
O'Brien,
I wonder if you might leave us?

374
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,480
Now...it's Daisy, isn't it?

375
00:22:55,515 --> 00:22:57,120
Yes, milady.

376
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,320
I'm sure you see O'Brien only acted
as she did because she is concerned.

377
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:04,325
I suppose so, milady.

378
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,600
She seems to think that you are
in possession of some knowledge

379
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,400
that is uncomfortable for you.

380
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Because if that is the case,
then I don't think it fair on you.

381
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,560
Why should you be burdened
with Mary's secret?

382
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,720
My dear, my heart goes out to you.
It really does.

383
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
Oh, there, there.

384
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,920
You've been carrying too heavy
a burden for too long.

385
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,480
Just tell me...

386
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,520
..and I promise you'll feel better.

387
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,445
You seem well prepared.

388
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,440
They'll add a few more flowers
before we open in the morning,

389
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,577
but I think we're nearly there.

390
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:03,680
Do look at Mr Molesley's display.

391
00:24:03,715 --> 00:24:05,360
He's worked so hard.

392
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
They're rather marvellous,
aren't they?

393
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:09,165
Lovely.

394
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,120
Well done, Mr Molesley.
Thank you, milady.

395
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:15,040
I think everyone
is to be congratulated.

396
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:17,085
It's splendid.

397
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,405
But do look at these roses.
Have you ever seen the like?

398
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,320
My dear, Mrs Crawley believes I am
profiting from an unfair advantage.

399
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:25,685
Oh?

400
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,920
She feels in the past
I have been given the cup

401
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:30,085
merely as a matter of routine
rather than merit.

402
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,520
Rather ungallant, Mother. I'm sure
when we see Cousin Violet's roses,

403
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,640
it will be hard to think
they could be bettered.

404
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,560
Hard, but not impossible.

405
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,005
You are quite wonderful

406
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,120
the way you see room for improvement
wherever you look.

407
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,040
I never knew such reforming zeal.

408
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:50,360
I take that as a compliment.

409
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,080
I must have said it wrong.

410
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,125
Poor Granny.
She's not used to being challenged.

411
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,560
Nor is Mother. I think we should
let them settle it between them.

412
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,500
So are you interested in flowers?

413
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:11,805
I'm interested in the village.

414
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,800
In fact, I'm on my way
to inspect the cottages.

415
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,300
You know what all work and no play
did for Jack.

416
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:19,640
But you think I'm a dull boy,
anyway, don't you?

417
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,360
I play, too.
I'm coming up for dinner tonight.

418
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,680
I suspect I'm there
to balance the numbers.

419
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:28,040
Is it in aid of anything?

420
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:30,045
Not that I know of.

421
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,400
Just a couple of dreary neighbours,
that's all.

422
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,400
Maybe I'll shine by comparison.

423
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:36,560
Mary, we're going.

424
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,320
Maybe you will.

425
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
Might I have a word?

426
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,680
I want to say something
before I ring the gong.

427
00:25:58,715 --> 00:26:01,165
I'm afraid it's not very pleasant.

428
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,845
His Lordship is missing
a very valuable snuff box.

429
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,440
It appears to have been taken
from the case in his room.

430
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:10,680
If one of you knows
anything about this,

431
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:13,405
will he or she please come to me?

432
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,880
Your words will be heard
in the strictest confidence.

433
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Thank you.

434
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,080
I am sorry, Mr Bates.

435
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
What an unpleasant thing
to have happened.

436
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:34,365
Why are you picking on him?

437
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,600
Because he's the only one of us
who goes in there.

438
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:38,400
But don't worry.
I'm sure it'll turn up.

439
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,600
Thank you for your concern.

440
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,160
I hate this kind of thing.

441
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:52,400
I hope to God they find it.

442
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,640
Better get a move on.

443
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm coming.

444
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,165
Does this brooch work?

445
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,400
I can't decide.
It's charming.

446
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,965
Oh, dear. Is it another scolding?

447
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,560
Of course not. You're too grown up
to scold these days.

448
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,325
Heavens.

449
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,280
Then it's really serious.

450
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,320
I'd like you to look after
Sir Anthony Strallan tonight.

451
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:35,645
He's a nice, decent man.

452
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,125
His position may not be quite
like Papa's,

453
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,920
but it would still make you a force
for good in the county.

454
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:43,497
Mama, not again.
How many times am I to be ordered

455
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:46,040
to marry the man sitting next to me
at dinner?

456
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,017
As many times as it takes.

457
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:49,925
I turned down Matthew Crawley.

458
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,720
Is it likely I'd marry Strallan
when I wouldn't marry him?

459
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,480
I am glad you've come to think
more highly of Cousin Matthew.

460
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,725
That's not the point.
No.

461
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,205
The point is
when you refused Matthew,

462
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,400
you were the daughter of an Earl
with an unsullied reputation.

463
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,960
Now you are damaged goods.

464
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:09,565
Mama...

465
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,520
Somehow, there is a rumour in
London, that you are not virtuous.

466
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,940
What? Does Papa know about this?

467
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,445
He knows it and he dismisses it

468
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,040
because, unlike you and me,
he does not know that it is true.

469
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,100
Let's hope it's just unkind gossip.

470
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:32,440
Because if anyone heard about...

471
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,125
Kemal.

472
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,440
My lover. Kemal Pamuk.

473
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:41,125
Exactly.

474
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,740
If it gets around,
and you're not already married,

475
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:46,320
every door in London
will be slammed in your face.

476
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:49,040
Mama, the world is changing.

477
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:51,125
Not that much...

478
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,360
and not fast enough for you.

479
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,560
I know you mean to help.

480
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:57,165
I know you love me.

481
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,325
But I also know what I'm capable of,

482
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,000
and forty years of boredom and duty
just isn't possible for me.

483
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,165
I'm sorry.

484
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,920
I do love you...

485
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,760
and I want to help.

486
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,565
I'm a lost cause, Mama.

487
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,200
Leave me to manage my own affairs.

488
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:16,805
Why not concentrate on Edith?

489
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,360
She needs all the help she can get.

490
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,840
You mustn't be unkind to Edith.
She has fewer advantages than you.

491
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,365
Fewer?

492
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,000
She has none at all.

493
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,240
Open the oven.

494
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,845
What's happened?
It's that bloomin' Daisy!

495
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,040
I've said she'll be the death of me,
and now my word's come true!

496
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:54,480
Come and sit down.
Get away!

497
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,405
Get back to the stables!

498
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,840
What'll you serve now?
Them, of course.

499
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,045
I haven't got anything else.

500
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,760
Daisy, give us a hand,
get that cloth.

501
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,080
What's the matter with that?
Are you sure?

502
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:16,040
Shouldn't we tell?
Certainly not.

503
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,925
Is the remove ready to go up?

504
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,880
Daisy, give him a hand
with the vegetables.

505
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
They're up in the servery
in the warmer.

506
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,400
I'm glad I don't have to eat them.
What the eye can't see,

507
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:28,000
the heart won't grieve over.

508
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,805
There's no doubt about it.

509
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,360
The next few years in farming are
going to be about mechanisation.

510
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:41,760
That's the test
and we're going to have to meet it.

511
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:44,177
Don't you agree, Lady Mary?

512
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:46,560
Yes, of course, Sir Anthony.

513
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,200
I'm sure I do.

514
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,240
Are we ever going to be allowed
to turn?

515
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,600
Sir Anthony, it must be so hard to
meet the challenge of the future,

516
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,560
and yet be fair to your employees.

517
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:04,125
That is the point precisely.

518
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,240
We can't fight progress, but we must
find ways to soften the blow.

519
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:10,640
I should love to see one
of the new harvesters,

520
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,437
if you would ever let me.

521
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:14,136
We don't have one here.

522
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:15,800
I shall be delighted.

523
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,120
I hope they find that snuff box.

524
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:25,645
What happens if they don't?

525
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,560
They'll organise a search,
won't they? I wouldn't be Mr Bates.

526
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,600
Not for all the tea in China.
Wouldn't you, Thomas?

527
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:34,280
I dare say he feels
just the same about you.

528
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,920
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

529
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,485
Just a minute!

530
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,780
I don't like to put it on earlier.

531
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:51,040
It sinks in and spoils the effect.

532
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,640
Mama has released me, thank God.

533
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,760
Sir Anthony seems nice enough.

534
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,280
If you want to talk farming
and foxes by the hour.

535
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,640
I'm rather looking forward
to the flower show tomorrow.

536
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:13,805
Where Mr Molesley's roses
will turn everybody's heads.

537
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,440
But if you tell Granny I said so,
I'll denounce you as a liar.

538
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:18,285
I wouldn't dare.

539
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,200
I'll leave that
to my fearless mother.

540
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,720
How are the cottages? Coming on
wonderfully. I'd love to show you.

541
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:28,840
Obviously,
it's an act of faith at this stage.

542
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,445
Yes.

543
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,820
Good God!

544
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,080
What on earth...?
I do apologise, Lady Grantham.

545
00:32:37,115 --> 00:32:39,040
But I had a mouthful of salt.
What?

546
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,560
Everyone! Put down your forks!

547
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,565
Carson, remove this.

548
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Bring fruit, bring cheese, bring
anything to take this taste away!

549
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,125
Sir Anthony, I am so sorry.

550
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,720
Fains I be Mrs Patmore's kitchen
maid when the news gets out.

551
00:32:57,755 --> 00:33:00,000
Poor girl. We ought to send in
a rescue party.

552
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:02,737
You must think us very disorganised.

553
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,440
No not at all. These things happen.

554
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,965
Hey, come on.

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,780
It's not that bad.

556
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:15,525
Nobody's died.

557
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,285
I don't understand it.

558
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,605
It must have been that Daisy.

559
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,520
She's muddled everything up
before now! But I never -

560
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,400
Don't worry, Daisy.
You're not in the line of fire.

561
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:28,565
I know that pudding!
I chose it cos I know it!

562
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,560
Which is why you wouldn't let Her
Ladyship have the pudding she wanted.

563
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,400
Because you didn't know it.

564
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:34,640
Exactly!

565
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,885
I don't see how it happened.

566
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,840
Come on, everyone. Let's give Mrs
Patmore some room to breathe.

567
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,765
You, too.

568
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,760
I don't think I should leave her.
Mr Carson knows what he's doing.

569
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,565
Don't do that.

570
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,040
Get William or the hall boy to
do it. It's beneath your dignity.

571
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:01,080
It won't kill me.

572
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,560
Now...

573
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
..all in your own good time.

574
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,920
I think you've got something
to tell me...

575
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:16,800
haven't you?

576
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,600
I think I know
where that snuff box is.

577
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:26,365
Where?

578
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,285
Hidden in your room.

579
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,560
You don't think -
Of Course I don't.

580
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:33,165
You silly beggar.

581
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,320
Then -? I bet Thomas would like it,
if they took you for a thief.

582
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,485
Yes. I expect he would.

583
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,725
Go upstairs now and find it.

584
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,800
And when you have, you can choose
whether to put it in Thomas's room.

585
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:48,560
Or give it to me,
and I'll slip it into Miss O'Brien's.

586
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,405
You naughty girl.

587
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,080
Fight fire with fire.
That's what my Mum says.

588
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,240
Poor Mrs Patmore. Do you think you
should go down and see her?

589
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:04,800
Tomorrow. She needs time
to recover her nerves.

590
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:07,245
I knew there was something going on.

591
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,520
It seems hard that poor Sir Anthony
had to pay the price.

592
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:11,960
Good God!

593
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,920
As for you giggling like
a schoolgirl with Cousin Matthew!

594
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:19,285
It was pathetic.

595
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,400
Poor Edith. I'm sorry Cousin Matthew
proved a disappointment to you.

596
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:24,840
Who says he has?

597
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,637
Matthew.

598
00:35:26,672 --> 00:35:28,365
He told me.

599
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,005
Oh, sorry. Wasn't I supposed to know?

600
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,960
You were very helpful, Edith,
looking after Sir Anthony.

601
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:37,680
You saved the day.

602
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:39,725
I enjoyed it.

603
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,360
We seemed to have a lot
to talk about.

604
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,640
Spare me your boasting, please.

605
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,125
Now who's jealous?
Jealous?

606
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,240
Do you think I couldn't have
him if I wanted him?

607
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:03,417
Even you can't take every prize.

608
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,560
Is that a challenge?
If you like.

609
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,725
I could almost manage
for a long time,

610
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,080
knowing the kitchen
and where everything was kept.

611
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:19,605
Even with that fool girl.

612
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,400
I think you might owe Daisy
an apology.

613
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:24,365
Maybe.

614
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,240
I've had a lot to put up with,
I can tell you.

615
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:29,885
And you've not been to a doctor?

616
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,840
I don't need a doctor
to tell me I'm going blind.

617
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,400
A blind cook, Mr Carson.

618
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:42,445
What a joke.

619
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,560
Whoever heard of such a thing?

620
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,600
A blind cook.

621
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,160
I hope our salty pudding
didn't spoil the evening for you.

622
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:59,085
On the contrary.

623
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,085
I'm glad you and Mary
are getting along.

624
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,645
There's no reason you can't be
friends. No reason at all.

625
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,320
I don't suppose there's any chance
that you could sort of start again?

626
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:09,840
Life is full of surprises.

627
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,365
Ah. I've been waiting for you.

628
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,200
I've found a book and it's just
the thing to catch your interest.

629
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:21,357
Oh, really?
I'm intrigued what could it be?

630
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:23,445
Well I was looking in the library
and I...

631
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,320
I was very taken by what you were
saying over dinner about the -

632
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,417
You're so right, Lady Mary.
How clever you are.

633
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:31,480
This is exactly
what we have to be aware of.

634
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,880
There's a section here I was rather
unsure about. I wonder if you...

635
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,040
It seems we have both been thrown
over for a bigger prize.

636
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:48,805
Heavens, is that the time?

637
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,040
You're not going?
The truth is my head's splitting.

638
00:37:52,075 --> 00:37:55,240
I don't want to spoil the party
so I'll slip away.

639
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,600
Would you make my excuses
to your parents?

640
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
Excuse me, Sir Anthony.

641
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,445
Has Mr Crawley left?
Yes, milady.

642
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,120
But what about the car? Branson can't
have brought it round so quickly.

643
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:20,960
He said he'd rather walk, milady.

644
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:22,560
Thank you.

645
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,760
Mary can be such a child.

646
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:27,560
What do you mean, darling?

647
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,605
She thinks if you put a toy down,

648
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,480
it'll still be sitting there when
you want to play with it again.

649
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,640
What are you talking about?

650
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:42,280
Never mind.

651
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,965
Mr Carson?

652
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,860
We were wondering
about that snuff box.

653
00:38:57,895 --> 00:39:00,907
Has it turned up yet?
I'm afraid not.

654
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,885
Well, I think we should have
a search.

655
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,445
What? It doesn't do to leave these
things too long.

656
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,000
Mr Carson can search the men's rooms,
Mrs Hughes the women's.

657
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:14,240
And it should be right away,
now we've talked of it.

658
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:15,960
So no-one has a chance
to hide the box.

659
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:17,765
Don't you agree, Mr Carson?

660
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,645
Well, perhaps it's for the best.

661
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
Although I'm sure
I won't find anything.

662
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,480
I'll fetch Mrs Hughes.

663
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,320
I think I'll just um...
I'd better check it's tidy.

664
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,760
The bastard's hidden it in my room
or yours.

665
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:36,240
Why did I ever listen to you
in the first place?

666
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,680
Miss O'Brien?

667
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,440
My, my. You have been busy.

668
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,440
I was expecting you later than this.

669
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:59,720
I'll tell Molesley to lock up.
Thanks.

670
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,360
Good night, Mother.

671
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,480
How was your evening?
Did you enjoy yourself?

672
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:08,445
Quite.

673
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,320
The thing is,
just for a moment I thought -

674
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,320
Never mind what I thought.
I was wrong.

675
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,120
Good night.

676
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,880
My word, Molesley, splendid roses.
Well done. Thank you, Your Lordship.

677
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:39,360
All the stalls are set out very well
this year.

678
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,445
This is enchanting.

679
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,440
Do we grow this? I doubt if you've
got that one, Your Ladyship.

680
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,845
I've only just found it, myself.

681
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,840
Is it a secret?
Or could you tell Mr Brocket?

682
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,965
I'd be glad to, milady.

683
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,840
He should come and see the rose
garden. He could give us some ideas.

684
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:56,685
Old Molseley's a champion.

685
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,840
Or he would be, in a fairer world.

686
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,045
Don't you start.

687
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,040
I'm afraid I've been annoying
Cousin Violet on that score.

688
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,760
If Molesley deserves the first prize
for his flowers

689
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:08,885
the judges will give it to him.

690
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,120
They wouldn't dare. Really, Robert.
You make me so annoyed.

691
00:41:12,155 --> 00:41:14,445
Isn't it possible
I should win the thing on merit?

692
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,240
I think the appropriate answer
to that, Mama, is 'Yes, dear.'

693
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,005
I don't know why we're bothering.

694
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,920
We'll have missed the speeches
as it is.

695
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:25,725
Don't be such a grouch.

696
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,000
You should have punished one of them
at least.

697
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,640
They know that I know.
That's worth something.

698
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,320
What do you think will happen
to Mrs Patmore?

699
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,845
She'll muddle through
with Daisy for help.

700
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,160
In the long term, we'll have to wait
for the doctor to give his opinion.

701
00:41:44,195 --> 00:41:46,160
I hope there's something they can do.

702
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:48,165
I hope so, too.

703
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,480
But if there isn't,
I hope they tell her there isn't.

704
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,920
Nothing is harder to live with
than false hope.

705
00:41:53,955 --> 00:41:56,640
I wish you'd just come out with it.

706
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,405
With what?

707
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,560
Whatever it is you're keeping secret.

708
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,320
I can't.

709
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,500
You don't deny it, then?

710
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,525
No, I don't deny it.

711
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,440
And I don't deny
you've a right to ask.

712
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:18,440
But I can't.

713
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm not a free man.

714
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,965
Are you trying to tell me
that you're married?

715
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,320
I have been married, yes,
but that's not all of it.

716
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,360
Because...

717
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,645
..because I love you, Mr Bates.

718
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,720
I know it's not ladylike to say it...

719
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,120
..but I'm not a lady and I don't
pretend to be.

720
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,045
You are a lady to me.

721
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,680
And I never knew a finer one.

722
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,280
If you want a lift,
I can take one of you, but not more.

723
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:00,285
One of the women.

724
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,720
No, you must go. Then we can all
hurry and meet you there.

725
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:04,405
Yes all right.

726
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,485
I mustn't slow you down.

727
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,240
There's been too much of that
already.

728
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,200
Have you recovered from our ordeal?

729
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,405
I got a letter this morning.

730
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,000
They must have written it as soon
as I left the office.

731
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,445
They are pleased to have met me,

732
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,820
but I do not quite fit
their requirements.

733
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:47,125
So it was all for nothing.
I don't agree.

734
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,685
Only a fool doesn't know
when they've been beaten.

735
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,320
Then I'm a fool, for I'm a long way
from being beaten yet.

736
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,285
And now...

737
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,360
When you ran off last night,
I hope you hadn't thought me rude.

738
00:44:02,395 --> 00:44:04,457
Certainly not.
I monopolised you at dinner.

739
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:06,485
I had no right
to any more of your time.

740
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,160
You see, Edith, and I had this sort
of bet - Please don't apologise.

741
00:44:10,195 --> 00:44:13,560
I had a lovely evening and
I'm glad we're on speaking terms.

742
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:16,560
Now, I should look after my mother.

743
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,080
Why was Cousin Matthew
in such a hurry to get away?

744
00:44:24,115 --> 00:44:26,085
Don't be stupid.

745
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,560
I suppose you didn't want him
when he wanted you,

746
00:44:28,595 --> 00:44:30,817
and now it's the other way round.

747
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:33,005
You have to admit it's quite funny.

748
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,420
I'll admit that
if I ever wanted to attract a man,

749
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,800
I'd steer clear of those clothes
and that hat.

750
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,160
You think yourself so superior,
don't you?

751
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:43,000
Ugh!

752
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,560
Well, I think she who laughs last
laughs longest.

753
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:56,680
Did that missing box of yours
ever turn up?

754
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:58,645
It was a fuss about nothing.

755
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,040
They must have put it back
on the wrong shelf, dusting.

756
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:02,965
Bates found it this morning.

757
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,040
Next time, have a proper look before
you start complaining.

758
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:08,240
I'm sure the servants were
frightened half to death.

759
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:10,040
Mea Culpa.

760
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,000
And now the Grantham Cup for
the Best Bloom In The Village.

761
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:25,200
And The Grantham Cup
is awarded to...

762
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,280
..Mr William Molesley...

763
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,240
..for his Comptesse Cabarousse rose.

764
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,080
Bravo! Well done!

765
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:51,800
Bravo!

766
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,080
Congratulations, Mr Molesley.

767
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:04,725
Thank you, milady.

768
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,725
Thank you for letting me have it.

769
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,480
It is the judge's who decide
these things, not me.

770
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:11,760
But very well done.

771
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,040
Congratulations.

772
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,325
Bravo, Mama.

773
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,920
That must have been a real
sacrifice. And bravely borne.

774
00:46:26,955 --> 00:46:28,680
I don't know
what everyone's on about.

775
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:31,360
But I...
All is well, my dear.

776
00:46:31,395 --> 00:46:33,160

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,840
Hurry up, girls. Come on.

3
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,045
Come on, come on!
You should be done here!

4
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,520
They'll be back from the station
any second now!

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,560
I haven't had a chance to ask.
How was London?

6
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,517
Oh, much as usual.
Dirty, noisy. Quite enjoyable.

7
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:04,276
There was no need for you
to come back a day early.

8
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,965
I'm perfectly capable of getting
the house ready.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Of course you are. But I'd like to have the heavy
luggage back and unpacked before they get here.

10
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,600
I suppose... Steady, William!

11
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,520
This isn't a race.

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,445
Poor lad.
But he did see her?

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,200
I was worried when I took him to
King's Cross.

14
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,200
Yes, he had time to say goodbye.

15
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,565
How is he now?

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,120
Well, you've only got one mother,
haven't you?

17
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:33,240
They're here, Mrs Hughes!

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,280
Hello, William.
It's good to have you back.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,925
What a relief to be home.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't listen when His Lordship
pretends not to enjoy the season!

21
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:56,405
When in Rome...
Will Lady Mary be back soon?

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,800
She's staying on with my sister
for a couple of weeks.

23
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,805
So Grantham House is closed?

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,165
It will be by the end of this week.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,280
Dear Mrs Hughes, I hope you've had
some time to yourself

26
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,645
while we've been away.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
I've tackled a few jobs that get
forgotten when the house is full.

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,005
Any local news? The main topic here

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,000
is the murder of the Austrian
Archduke.

30
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:19,205
Here and everywhere else.

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm afraid we haven't heard
the last of that.

32
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,805
How's William?
Bearing up.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
Poor chap. He has our sympathies.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,840
I think I'll wash the train off
before dinner. Very good, my lord.

35
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,365
I can unpack while you're bathing.
I'll see you up there.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,640
Mrs Hughes, have you thought about
the garden party for the hospital?

37
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:39,560
I've started on it, but there are
things we need to talk about.

38
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:43,560
Oh, dear. That sounds like trouble.
I'll take my hat off.

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,920
Sybil? You were a great success
in London, darling. Well done.

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,525
You never say that to me.
Don't I?

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,920
You were very helpful, dear.
Thank you.

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,960
I hate to spoil
Her Ladyship's homecoming,

43
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:05,720
but what are we going to do about
Mrs Patmore?

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,360
She's worse than when you left.
Much worse.

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,325
And I meant to ask,

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
is there a decision
about Mr Bates leaving?

47
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:18,640
Not yet.
His Lordship wants the facts

48
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,200
and Mr Bates won't give them.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,720
So what are you going to say
to Her Ladyship about Mrs Patmore?

50
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,125
Oh, I'm not sure.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,880
I don't want the poor woman sacked,

52
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:33,600
but...things cannot go on
as they are.

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
There's nothing like an English
summer, is there?

54
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,045
Except an English winter.

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,645
I'm sorry you haven't received
more invitations.

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,320
But then, after four seasons, one
is less a debutante than a survivor.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,080
My dear, is there anything
you're not telling me?

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,780
No.
Only, one hears stories.

59
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,200
There's nothing, Aunt Rosamund.

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,125
So, have you decided...

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,245
whether or not to marry
Cousin Matthew?

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
Oh, there's no secret Cora can keep
for more than a month.

63
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:15,485
You'd be surprised.

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,120
I've told him I'll give him
my answer the day I get back.

65
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:22,720
Well, it would be very tidy.
At least we can say that.

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,760
Fancy a smoke?
Don't mind if I do.

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,160
There they go -
Guy Fawkes and his assistant.

68
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:41,960
Which is which?
Here you are.

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,760
Surely, if His Lordship hasn't done
anything until now,

70
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,560
it means he doesn't want to take it
any further.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,360
Anna's made me an armband,
Mr Carson.

72
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,725
For my mother. Can I wear it?

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,440
I daresay.
Not when we're entertaining,

74
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,320
but otherwise...

75
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,640
Hello, Doctor.
I didn't know you were here.

76
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:18,765
No. Lady Grantham sent a message.

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
Why? She's not ill, is she?
Not...ill, exactly.

78
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,360
Would you mind waiting
in the library?

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
Pregnant?
You needn't be quite so shocked.

80
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,200
Give me a moment.

81
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,405
You haven't been pregnant
for 18 years!

82
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,365
And I'm pregnant now! I don't see
what we've done differently.

83
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,880
Stop right there! If you want to know
more, go and offer the doctor some whisky.

84
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,800
I can't take it in.

85
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
But...you're pleased?

86
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,240
Of course... Of course I'm pleased.

87
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,840
I didn't think she'd do it.

88
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,045
I told you she would.

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,125
I could see she was interested.

90
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,660
I was speaking as one lady's maid
to another. That means something!

91
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:22,160
Course, we thought we had him
before but he's a slippery devil.

92
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,660
It's unusual, obviously.

93
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:34,080
Unusual? It's Biblical!

94
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,960
Not quite.

95
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,080
You understand that women
go through a...certain change.

96
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:44,760
Thank you. I know quite as much
as I need to about all that.

97
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:48,920
Well, sometimes it can result in
a surge of...

98
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,845
fertility,
for want of a better word.

99
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,080
But the child will be healthy?
There's no reason why not.

100
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,285
How long has she...?

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Hard to be precise.
Things had become irregular, but...

102
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,960
Please... I'd say
she's about four months gone.

103
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,880
It'll begin to show soon.

104
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,880
And I don't suppose there's any way
of knowing...if it's a...

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,520
I do beg your pardon, my lord.
I thought you were alone.

106
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,680
Please come in, Mrs Hughes.

107
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:21,005
I'm just leaving.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,405
William?
Well, thank you, Doctor.

109
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,960
I'd better write some letters.
Show Dr Clarkson out.

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,480
I didn't want to bother
Her Ladyship if she's not well...

111
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:38,360
She's resting, but tell me anyway.

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,085
It's Mrs Patmore, my lord.

113
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,960
The time has come when we really
have to make a decision.

114
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,440
Hm...

115
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,600
Now do you believe me?
Careful, Thomas.

116
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:00,005
Your position is not a strong one.

117
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,480
Don't punish US, Mr Carson.
It's Mr Bates who's wanting here.

118
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:05,245
Tell me, do you think it right

119
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,720
a man like that should live and work
at Downton?

120
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,820
Mr Napier, my lady.

121
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:38,005
What a surprise!

122
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,800
I'm afraid you've just missed
my aunt.

123
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:41,720
I know.

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,365
I watched her leave.

125
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,920
How are your wedding plans going?

126
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:49,845
Not very well.

127
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,520
In fact, we've decided
to call it off.

128
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,765
Really?

129
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
It seemed quite fixed
at Sybil's ball.

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,640
What a shame... Please.

131
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,565
It'll be better in the long run.
Perhaps.

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,960
I know what high hopes you have
of the institution.

133
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,925
The thing is, Lady Mary,
I'm here today

134
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,325
because I needed to tell you
something face to face,

135
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,005
before you went to the country.
Face to face? Gracious me.

136
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,720
I've recently heard gossip about the time
when I came to Downton with Kemal Pamuk,

137
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:30,920
gossip that I believe has made life
difficult for you.

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,160
I've also heard it said that
I am the source of these stories.

139
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,360
It is very important to me that
you should know that I am not.

140
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,440
From that day to this, I have never
spoken one word on the matter.

141
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,885
Then who did?

142
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,880
It seems to have come from the
Turkish Embassy,

143
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:54,840
from the Ambassador himself,
in fact, and his wife.

144
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,720
But who told them, if not you?

145
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:02,165
This is the hard part.

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,480
When I discovered the answer,
I debated whether I should relay it,

147
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,640
but in the end,
I feel you ought to know.

148
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,480
The suspense is killing me.

149
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,360
It was your sister, Lady Edith,
who wrote to the Ambassador.

150
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,240
That is why people accept the story.

151
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,925
Edith?

152
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,040
It's very hard to believe.

153
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Harder for you than for me.

154
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,440
I love the thought of a baby in
the house, but if it's a boy...

155
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,325
It'll be very hard on Mr Crawley.

156
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,765
I know. I was no great champion
when he first arrived.

157
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,440
But it seems to me he's tried his
best and he's done the decent thing.

158
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:52,437
I can't see THAT coming off.

159
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:55,365
You don't mean the engagement?

160
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,320
But it's not an engagement yet,
is it?

161
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,520
She'd never throw him over!

162
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,240
Mr Carson, Lady Mary Crawley does
not deserve you.

163
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,920
Oh...

164
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,740
Wonderful news, of course.
You must look after yourself.

165
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,800
Don't worry. O'Brien has me
wrapped in silk and feathers.

166
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:29,965
You're lucky.

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,360
I have a horrible feeling Simmons
is about to hand in her notice.

168
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:38,085
She's looking very fidgety lately,

169
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,720
and I saw her hurrying
to meet the postman.

170
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,965
Oh, you poor thing.

171
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,440
Is there anything worse
than losing one's maid?

172
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,160
Why would she want to leave me?

173
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,680
I've been as gentle as a lamb.

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,360
Most of the time.

175
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I want to say I'll make provision
for you

176
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,200
if it's a boy and you get
pushed out.

177
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,080
Don't worry. I know you can't.

178
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,880
If any man living understands the
strength of the entail, it's me.

179
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:16,520
I can give you Crawley House
for life, if it's a help.

180
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,960
Have you heard from Mary?
No. Have you?

181
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,240
By the way, I want to ask a favour.
What's the name of your cook,

182
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:29,600
the one you brought with you
from Manchester?

183
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:31,800
Mrs Bird?

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
I'll get it, Mrs Patmore!
Don't fuss me!

185
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:39,280
Is that everything?
Yeah.

186
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,205
How are you feeling?

187
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,720
Well, most people's parents die
before them, and so they should.

188
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:48,400
Oh, give it a rest. Your mother knew
how to drag it out.

189
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,365
What?
Thomas!

190
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,525
Get up to the servery.

191
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,240
You gave me the wrong cloth!
Sit down, Mrs Patmore.

192
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,400
I can't when I've got
the luncheon to finish!

193
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,800
It was not a suggestion. Sit!

194
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
Daisy and I will finish
the luncheon.

195
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,320
So he'll give us this house
for life, will he? How generous

196
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:20,360
It IS generous. He doesn't have to.

197
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,680
But it's made me think.

198
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,805
You must stay here if you want.

199
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,120
But I wonder if it mightn't be better
all round if I went back to Manchester.

200
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,845
It may not be a boy.

201
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,440
Oh, really, Mother! You never
approved of it all anyway!

202
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,840
If it is a boy,
you should see it as a release,

203
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,937
not a disappointment.

204
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:45,000
What does Mary say?

205
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,840
Nothing yet.

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,525
You wanted to see Mrs Bird, sir.

207
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes. Mrs Bird, Lord Grantham has
rather a favour to ask of you.

208
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm surprised Lord Grantham
knows that I exist, sir.

209
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,120
Huh...

210
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Quite all right.

211
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,480
Mr Bates, it's about your
somewhat startling confession.

212
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,040
As you'll have surmised, His
Lordship has yet to make a decision.

213
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,045
His delay is generous.

214
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,760
However, it will be no surprise
to you

215
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,085
that Miss O'Brien has been unwilling
to let things drop.

216
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,680
It seems that when we were in
London, she made a new friend -

217
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,400
a lady's maid in the house of
a colonel in your former regiment.

218
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,960
Please tell me that this account
is false, at least in part.

219
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,640
I wish I could.

220
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,885
I'll have to show this
to His Lordship.

221
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,520
Of course you will. I do not like
to play the part of Pontius Pilate,

222
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:15,205
but I'm afraid I must.

223
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,840
Lord Grantham will decide
what's to be done.

224
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,420
Mr Bates, I hope you do not feel
that I treated you unjustly.

225
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:32,440
On the contrary, Mr Carson,
I am astonished at your kindness.

226
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,440
Of all of you, Sybil might find joy
in a cottage, but not you.

227
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,885
We don't know it'll be a boy.
Exactly.

228
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,280
So ask Matthew to wait
until the child is born.

229
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:56,960
If it's a girl,
you can wed him happily

230
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:58,645
and all will be as it was before.

231
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,800
But if I delay, won't he think
I'm only after him for his position?

232
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:05,800
Besides, I'm not sure
I want to put him off,

233
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:08,205
even without the title.

234
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
We get on so well, you know.
And he's terribly clever.

235
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,320
He might end up Lord Chancellor.

236
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,405
And he might not.

237
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,485
Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible.

238
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,960
Can you really see yourself
dawdling your life away

239
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,360
as the wife of a country solicitor?

240
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,000
But why would we ever want
a telephone at Downton, my lord?

241
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,005
Well, they have their uses.

242
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
You could speak to the housekeeper
in London.

243
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,525
That'd be helpful, surely?

244
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,000
I hope I have not failed in my
management of the recent move?

245
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,525
Not at all.
But the telephone is here now,

246
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,125
and the girls got used to it
when we were in London.

247
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,480
Besides, none of us know what
the next few months will bring.

248
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,725
Because of the Archduke's death?

249
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,720
Austria won't get what it wants
from Serbia.

250
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:58,965
And now Russia's starting to rumble.

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,120
Well, there's not much we can do
about that.

252
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:03,240
So, will you take care of
the telephone man?

253
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,365
Oh, about Mr Bates, my lord.

254
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
I expect you've had time to consider
the contents of that letter?

255
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes. But I find it very odd.

256
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,965
Regimental silver?

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,160
I could more easily see Bates as
an assassin than a petty pilferer.

258
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,937
I agree. And while the letter
is hard to argue with,

259
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:27,680
I wouldn't put anything past
Thomas or Miss O'Brien.

260
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,805
So, what did we miss?
Nothing much.

261
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,000
Although you'd have had
more invitations than I did.

262
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,685
Have you thought about Matthew?
Of course.

263
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,440
But Aunt Rosamund says - She's
written to me. Pay no attention.

264
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:55,160
But Granny, she has got a point.
Mary can't be completely naive.

265
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:58,977
I don't need your help, thank you.
Mary, listen to me.

266
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,760
If you take Matthew now,
when his whole future is at risk,

267
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:05,200
he will love you
to the end of his days.

268
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:07,365
Why, Granny, you're a romantic!

269
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,885
I've been called many things,
but never that.

270
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,160
And what happens if the baby is
a boy and Matthew loses everything?

271
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:16,120
Mary can always change her mind.
I can't do that to Matthew.

272
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:18,417
It's not how we are together.
Huh...

273
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:20,680
I'm going upstairs
to help Anna unpack.

274
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,600
I'll come with you.

275
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
Edith, why don't you go too?

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,240
Sir Anthony Strallan
was at Lady Wren's party.

277
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:37,920
He asked after you.

278
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,360
Is she really serious about him?
Any port in a storm...

279
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,840
By the way,
I must write about my maid.

280
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,880
She's leaving, to get married.

281
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,165
How could she be so selfish?
I do sympathise.

282
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Robert's always wanted me to get rid
of O'Brien, but I can't face it.

283
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:07,085
Anyway, she's so fond of me.

284
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Well, I thought Simmons
was fond of ME!

285
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,605
What am I to do?

286
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,485
I'll put an advertisement
in The Lady.

287
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,440
It's always the best place to start.
Oh! That's so kind.

288
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:20,245
Thank you.

289
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,325
I really must be going.

290
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,200
Now, don't let Mary wait for
the baby

291
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:28,040
before she gives Matthew her answer.

292
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:31,085
I'm sure it's another girl.

293
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,780
I know those men
of the moral high ground.

294
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:38,787
If she won't say yes
when he might be poor,

295
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:42,760
he won't want her
when he will be rich.

296
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:45,205
Maybe we should knit something.

297
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,520
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'd love
a pair of bootees knitted by you.

298
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:52,237
Or what about a Christening mug?
They can buy their own silver.

299
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:55,920
Anything in the paper? They've
arrested Princip and his gang.

300
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,325
All Serbian
and members of the Black Hand.

301
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,840
The Black Hand? I don't like
the sound of that.

302
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,525
I don't like the sound
of any of it.

303
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,220
War is on the way.
Then we'll have to face it...

304
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,880
as bravely as we can.
Thank you, Mr Cannon Fodder.

305
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,925
Don't YOU think a war's coming?

306
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Oh, there'll be a war,
and it's time to prepare for it.

307
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:15,760
The country, do you mean?
No. Me.

308
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,885
You never disappoint.

309
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,765
Daisy, run and find Mrs Patmore.

310
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,965
His Lordship wants to see her
in the library.

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,480
His Lordship wants Mrs Patmore
to go up to the library?

312
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,845
That is what I said.

313
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,680
And Anna, you're to come too.

314
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,920
And we thought the assassination
of an archduke was a surprise.

315
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,880
Mrs Patmore, my lord.

316
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,320
Your Lordship, I know things haven't
been quite right for a while,

317
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:57,320
but I can assure you -
Come in, Mrs Patmore.

318
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,640
I promise you, my lord, if I could
just be allowed a bit more time...

319
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:06,520
Mrs Patmore, I have not asked you
here to give you your notice.

320
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:09,205
Haven't you?
No.

321
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,460
I understand you've had some trouble
with your sight. That's just it!

322
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:15,680
I know I could manage better if -
Please, Mrs Patmore! Let him speak!

323
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,660
Beg pardon, my lord.
Don't apologise.

324
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,645
Now, on Dr Clarkson's
recommendation,

325
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm sending you up to London to see
an eye specialist at Moorfields.

326
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:27,840
Anna will go with you and you'll
stay with my sister Rosamund

327
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,920
in her new house in Belgrave Square.

328
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit
in your presence, my lord.

329
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,200
Of course.

330
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,880
But how will you get on here?

331
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,445
Well, Mrs Crawley is lending us
her cook - Mrs Bird.

332
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,280
She's coming over tomorrow. You will be
good enough to show her how things work.

333
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:53,480
Are the Crawleys to starve
while I'm away?

334
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:55,845
They'll eat here every evening.

335
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,445
Now, my sister's butler
will look after you.

336
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,440
He's very nice. Anna,
you won't mind a visit to London?

337
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:04,760
No, my lord. Thank you.
It'll be an adventure.

338
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,080
One with a happy ending, I hope.

339
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,800
At Sybil's ball you said you'd give
me your answer the day you got back,

340
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:24,680
and now you say you will not!
Why do we have to rush into it?

341
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:28,120
I need to be sure, that's all.
But you WERE sure.

342
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,840
I know what has altered you.
My prospects!

343
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,885
Because nothing else has changed!
No! Yes!

344
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,440
If your mother's child is a boy,
then he's the heir

345
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:37,925
and I go back to living on my wits!

346
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,520
You always make everything
so black and white!

347
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:43,685
I think this IS black and white!

348
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,840
Do you love me enough
to spend your life with me?

349
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:49,045
If not, then say no.

350
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,560
If you do, then say yes.
I want to...

351
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:55,157
Granny told me I should say yes now,

352
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:57,720
then withdraw
if you lost everything.

353
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,480
To make that work,
you'd have to be a good liar.

354
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,560
Are you a good liar?
Not good enough to try, apparently.

355
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,000
How could you not have realised
they'd discover the loss at once?

356
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,880
And to keep them in your house...

357
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,005
But you only served two years?
That's right, my lord.

358
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,680
So, clearly the judge thought
there was some mitigating factor.

359
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:31,600
I just want to know the truth.

360
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,565
I cannot speak of it, my lord.

361
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,405
You must decide whether I stay or go

362
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,440
on the basis of the evidence
before you.

363
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,320
I will respect that.

364
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,005
I'm sorry. I don't believe it.

365
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,000
How can you say that?
When I've confessed to the crime?

366
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,640
His Lordship obviously doesn't think
that's all there is to it,

367
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,485
and I don't either.

368
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,680
Anna, are you set for the nine
o'clock train tomorrow?

369
00:24:03,715 --> 00:24:05,125
All packed and ready.

370
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,640
You'll be met at King's Cross by
Lady Rosamund's chauffeur,

371
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:12,517
which I think is generous, but after
that, you're on your own.

372
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:16,360
I must get on. I'm acting referee
for Mrs Patmore and Mrs Bird.

373
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:18,280
Best of luck.

374
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,845
Will you miss me?

375
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,720
Try not to miss me.
It'll be good practice.

376
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,120
I expect it'll be hard adjusting
to this kitchen,

377
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:42,897
after the one you're used to.
Not to worry.

378
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm sure I can have it cleaned up
in no time.

379
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,565
Cleaned up?
I'm not criticising.

380
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,160
With your eyesight, it's a wonder
you could see the pots at all.

381
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:57,245
You'll have met Daisy and the
others? I have.

382
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,200
Though what they all find to do
is a mystery to me.

383
00:25:00,235 --> 00:25:03,485
Are you not used to managing
staff, Mrs Bird?

384
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,260
I'm used to getting it done with
one kitchen maid, Mrs Patmore,

385
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:13,000
but I suppose, in a house like
this, you expect to take it easy.

386
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,560
Do you think we should erect
a ring and let them fight it out?

387
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:20,885
She's all right, Mrs Bird.

388
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,600
She's more of a general
than a trooper,

389
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:25,325
but you need that in a cook.

390
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,800
Mrs Patmore's the Generalissimo.

391
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,120
Well, I'm very sad.

392
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,920
I thought Mary was made of better
stuff.

393
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:42,840
Don't speak against her.

394
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,680
of course, she's taken advice from
someone with false and greedy values.

395
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:50,737
Mother! And we don't have to go too
far to know who that is!

396
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:53,760
I've a good mind - You do not go
near Violet. That is an order.

397
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,925
Something's not right about it.
I agree.

398
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,600
Having a silver thief in the house
does not seem right at all,

399
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:03,160
even if he COULD walk.

400
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,085
But Carson isn't keen
to get rid of him either,

401
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,800
and he normally comes down on this
sort of thing very hard.

402
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:13,525
What's his reasoning?
He blames Thomas and O'Brien.

403
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,685
He says they've been working against
Bates since he got here.

404
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,520
So I should sack O'Brien instead?
You'll hear no argument from me.

405
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:23,440
This should do the trick, my lady.

406
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,000
Ten years of my life,
That's what I've given her.

407
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,925
Ten bloody years!
But did she say she'd sack you?

408
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,200
It's obviously what he wants.
So when will they tell you?

409
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:37,965
When they've found a replacement.

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,080
Heaven forefend she should have to
put a comb through her own hair!

411
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:46,160
And if I'm going, you won't be far
behind. Oh, so what? Sod 'em.

412
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:48,525
There's a war coming
and war means change.

413
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,845
We should be making plans.
What are you talking about?

414
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,560
Well, put it like this. I don't want
to be a footman any more,

415
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:57,160
but I don't intend to be killed
in battle neither.

416
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,765
I'm not saying poison them!

417
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,000
Just make sure they don't find
her food all that agreeable.

418
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:13,880
By poisoning it?
Will you stop that?

419
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:16,525
You don't want it to taste nice.

420
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,000
I want them to be glad
when I get back, that's all.

421
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,040
Huh...

422
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,020
Good afternoon, Carson.
Is Lady Edith in? I am!

423
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:53,325
I most certainly am!
I was just driving past. Yes?

424
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,720
I thought you might like to come
for a spin. If you're not too busy.

425
00:27:56,755 --> 00:28:00,480
Wait till I get my coat. Is it
all right if I make some notes?

426
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:04,840
I'm so sorry, Mr...?
This is Mr Bromidge, my lady.

427
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,685
He's here about the telephone.

428
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,445
Oh, please make your notes,
dear Mr Bromidge.

429
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,920
We're so looking forward to it.
What an exciting business to be in!

430
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:15,720
You must be expanding every day.
Oh, we are, sir.

431
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:18,165
But that brings its problems.

432
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,000
Training up men for the work,
when many have no aptitude.

433
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,600
I can't even find a secretary
who can keep pace.

434
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:27,240
What?
It's hard with a new concept.

435
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:29,605
Too old, and they can't change.

436
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,565
Too young,
and they've no experience.

437
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,245
Have you filled the post yet?
I know just the woman.

438
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,600
Well, she must hurry up.
We'll close the list tomorrow night.

439
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:39,920
You'll have her application.
I promise.

440
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,660
This isn't bad at all, is it?
I don't know.

441
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,600
No-one told me
there'd be an actual operation.

442
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:03,565
What did you think?

443
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,480
They were just going to make magic
passes over your eyes?

444
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,700
All right, Mrs...Patmore?

445
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:13,285
She'll be fine. Thank you.

446
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,440
And you've been sent to us
by the Earl of Grantham?

447
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:20,645
That's right.
Very good. You can leave now.

448
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,760
We'll keep her in for a week.
You can collect her next Friday.

449
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,160
I'll be in to visit every day.
What about the rest of the time?

450
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,120
Don't worry!

451
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,840
You'll be fine.

452
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,645
Bates, you say?
John Bates.

453
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,200
He must have left the army
about eight years ago.

454
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,480
Wait here, please.

455
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,080
Have you finished the soup?
I think so, Mrs Bird.

456
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:56,520
And the sauce for the fish?
Yes, Mrs Bird.

457
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,440
You can put them in the warmer.

458
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,640
You don't mean John Bates,
who went to prison for theft?

459
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:36,320
That's correct. Well, I know who
he is right enough.

460
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,697
That was an odd business.

461
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:43,005
Why odd?
Never mind.

462
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,080
So you're his cousin
and you'd like to be in touch?

463
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,645
Very forgiving.

464
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,605
I've got no address for him
or his wife.

465
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,320
But I have got one for his mother,
which should still be good.

466
00:31:55,355 --> 00:31:57,400
I've written it down for you.

467
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,000
Thank you for your trouble.

468
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,960
Is it true you wrote to the
Turkish Ambassador about Kemal?

469
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,440
Who told you?
Someone who knows that you did.

470
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:24,165
Then why are you asking?

471
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,960
Because I wanted to give you one
last chance to deny it.

472
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,040
And what if I did? He had a right
to know how his countryman died.

473
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,760
In the arms of a slut.

474
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,480
How's that advertisement getting on
for new maid?

475
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,085
Well, it's only just come out.

476
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,120
We can manage here now. Tell Mrs Bird
we'll have our dinner in 20 minutes.

477
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:01,640
Carson, be sure to say to Mrs Bird
the dinner was really delicious.

478
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,680
So, how was the drive?
It was lovely.

479
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,360
Only... Yes?

480
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,780
Well, he said he had a question
for me.

481
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:26,760
He told me he'd ask it
at the garden party

482
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:29,800
and he hoped I'd say yes.

483
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,400
You must think very carefully
what your answer will be.

484
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:39,880
Yes, I should think very carefully
about a lot of things.

485
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,200
Do your neighbours have one?
Yes, they do.

486
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:46,965
It seems wise to get a telephone
now.

487
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,920
If there is a war, it may be hard
to have one installed in a house.

488
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:51,720
Let me show you where
we're going to put it.

489
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:55,405
First electricity now telephones.

490
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,040
Sometimes I feel as if I were living
in an HG Wells novel.

491
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,000
But the young are all so calm about
change, aren't they?

492
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:10,120
Look at Matthew. I do admire him.

493
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:12,000
Do you?

494
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,080
What have I done wrong now?
Oh, please.

495
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:19,640
Don't pretend Mary's sudden
reluctance

496
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:21,685
can't be traced back to you.

497
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,180
Well, I shall pretend it.
I told her to take him.

498
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:28,640
Your quarrel is with my daughter
Rosamund, not me.

499
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
So put that in your pipe
and smoke it!

500
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,045
Mr Molesley. What are you after?

501
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,600
I want a word with Mr Carson.
I'm here to have my dinner.

502
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:50,800
You don't want much, do you?
What are you doing?

503
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,440
Mr Carson dropped his wallet in
the passage. I was replacing it.

504
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,880
But everything seemed so settled
between you at Sybil's ball.

505
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:12,280
Things have changed since then.

506
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:14,405
Not necessarily.

507
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,245
I don't seem to be much good
at making boys.

508
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,080
Any more than I'm much good at
building my life on shifting sands.

509
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,320
You do know I should be very proud
to have you as my son-in-law,

510
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:29,200
whatever your prospects?

511
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Unfortunately, sir, your daughter
is more practical than you.

512
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,940
Will you join us, Mrs Bird?
I don't mind if I do.

513
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,787
I'm not sure Mrs Patmore would
like that, Mr Carson.

514
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:47,600
Cook always
eats separate, that's what she says.

515
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:50,120
Not in our house.
There's only four of us.

516
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,680
Well, you're going any minute. She's
advertised for your replacement.

517
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:56,640
That filthy, ungrateful cow.

518
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,200
Let the kitchen maids have theirs
on their own. You stay with us.

519
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:05,880
Her Ladyship said to tell you
that the dinner was delicious.

520
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:10,000
She can't have!
Daisy? Does that surprise you?

521
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,480
What have you done with this,
you little beggar? I knew it!

522
00:36:31,515 --> 00:36:34,440
That's why I said it was for
upstairs.

523
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,400
Come on! Tell us what's in it!

524
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Just...water and a bit of soap.

525
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,400
And you've put something
in the fish sauce as well?

526
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,320
Only...mustard and aniseed.

527
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,640
Why, Daisy?
Why would you do such a thing?

528
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,000
Mrs Patmore was worried they'd
prefer Mrs Bird's cooking

529
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:05,560
and they wouldn't want her
to come back. Is that likely?

530
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:07,960
When they've taken such trouble
to get her well?

531
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm sorry!

532
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,405
There, there.

533
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,085
There are worse crimes on earth
than loyalty.

534
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,880
Dry your eyes, and fetch the beef
stew I was making for tomorrow.

535
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,880
You've not had a chance to spoil
that, I suppose?

536
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,440
I was going to mix in
some syrup of figs,

537
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:35,360
but I've not done it yet

538
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,760
At least we'd all have been regular.

539
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,005
Carson said you were here.

540
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,765
Just checking that everything's
being done right, my lady.

541
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,680
Only, we never heard back. That is,
Miss Dawson never heard back,

542
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:53,525
about an interview.

543
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,685
Er, yes, we got the young lady's
letter.

544
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,800
But the trouble is, she didn't have
any obvious experience of hard work.

545
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:04,677
But she's a very hard worker!
I couldn't find any proof of it.

546
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:08,520
And she gave you as a reference,
when you don't run a business,

547
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:11,325
well, not that I'm aware of.

548
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,720
Lily? Can you find Gwen and tell her
to come to the hall now?

549
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:16,445
Yes, my lady.

550
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,440
The reason Gwen didn't give
any more details

551
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:22,177
is because she works here,
as a housemaid.

552
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:24,880
Ah! And you thought
that'd put me off?

553
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:26,805
But she's taken a postal course

554
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,680
and has good speeds in typing
and Pitman shorthand. Test her!

555
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:33,800
I will, if I like the look of her.

556
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:35,765
Ah, so, young lady.

557
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,340
You thought I'd turn up my nose
at a housemaid?

558
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,880
Well, I did, sir.
Well, my mother was a housemaid.

559
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:45,045
I've got nothing against housemaids.

560
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,800
They know about hard work and
long hour, that's for sure.

561
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,725
I believe so, sir.

562
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,680
Right, well, is there somewhere
we could talk?

563
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:54,680
Gwen, take Mr Bromidge to the
library.

564
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,640
I'll see no-one disturbs you.

565
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,840
Sorry, Papa, you can't go in there.

566
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,005
Why on earth not?

567
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,280
Gwen's in there with Mr Bromidge.
She's being interviewed.

568
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:17,725
I cannot use my library

569
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,800
because one of the housemaids is in
there applying for another job?

570
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,680
That's about the size of it.

571
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,560
So, what is it you want to know?

572
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,080
I want to know the truth about
the case against him.

573
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,520
I want to know why the officer
thought it was 'odd'.

574
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,440
I want to know what Mr Bates isn't
saying.

575
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,000
Because you don't believe him
to be guilty?

576
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:53,257
No, I don't.

577
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,480
I know he's not.

578
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:57,360
Well...

579
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,000
You're right, of course.

580
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,000
Then who was it? Who was the thief?

581
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,000
His wife. Vera.

582
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,560
Who do you call?
No-one you know has got one!

583
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:17,885
But they will have. You'll see.

584
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,320
Might I enquire why my pantry
has become a common room?

585
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:24,285
Sorry, Mr Carson.

586
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,320
But...do you know how it works?

587
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:30,285
Of course I do.
Could you show us?

588
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,485
Certainly not.
A telephone is not a toy,

589
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,840
but a useful and valuable tool.
Now, get back to your work.

590
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,120
She worked at the barracks sometimes,
helping at big dinners and so on.

591
00:41:06,155 --> 00:41:09,040
That night her opportunity came
and she took it.

592
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,805
They knew it was her.

593
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,040
Someone even saw her
with a big carryall.

594
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:17,200
But why did he confess?

595
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:19,080
Well...

596
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,605
John wasn't the same man in those
days.

597
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,560
The African war had shaken him up
and made him angry.

598
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:29,565
He'd been wounded

599
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,800
and he drunk a lot more than was good
for him.

600
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,645
Was he violent?
No. No, not violent.

601
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,480
He could hard at times,
with a tongue like a razor.

602
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:47,760
He felt he'd ruined Vera's life,
Miss Smith.

603
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:50,440
Do you agree with him?

604
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,125
No.

605
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,120
I thought she was a nasty
piece of work.

606
00:41:55,155 --> 00:41:58,120
That's why he took the blame.

607
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,160
Surely, if everyone knew he was
innocent... But he confessed!

608
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:08,960
There was nothing anybody could do
once he'd confessed.

609
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,085
Could I ask you something, sir?

610
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,320
Only, I get the feeling that
a war's on the way.

611
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:21,205
I'm afraid we all do.

612
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,080
And when it comes, I want to be
really useful to my country.

613
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:25,965
How heartening.
So I've been thinking,

614
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,540
what could be more useful
than what you do?

615
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:31,080
Bringing people back to health,
back to life.

616
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,005
I see.

617
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,685
Well, erm, we are looking for
volunteers

618
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,005
to train for the
Territorial Force hospitals,

619
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,845
if that's what you mean.
It's exactly what I mean.

620
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,440
Will you not be missed here? Maybe.
But we'll all be going, won't we?

621
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,365
The younger men, anyway.

622
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,320
As you wish. I'll make enquiries.

623
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:51,200
Thank you very much, Doctor.

624
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,440
Mr Molesley walked in and there
he was, as bold as brass,

625
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,440
taking my wallet
out of my change coat.

626
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,080
Mr Molesley would have no reason
to make it up, my lord.

627
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,697
He doesn't know Thomas.
Why would he lie?

628
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:10,280
So Thomas has been caught
red-handed.

629
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:12,005
Well, we knew he was a thief.

630
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,840
And now we have unimpeachable proof.

631
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:16,885
I'm afraid he has to go.

632
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,365
Oh, I hate this sort of thing,

633
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,525
with Lady Grantham's condition
and so on.

634
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,220
Can we at least wait
until after the garden party?

635
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:28,880
Very well, my lord.
But then I think we must act.

636
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,925
How long will you wear them?
A week or so.

637
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,285
But I can see much better already,
even with them on.

638
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,120
Thank heaven. Now, we need to talk
about the garden party.

639
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:46,605
Mrs Bird and I have made some lists.
Mrs Bird?

640
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,680
I think we can manage
without any help from Mrs Bird.

641
00:43:49,715 --> 00:43:51,805
Can you?

642
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,000
Well, if you want your garden party to be
run by Blind Pugh, that's your business.

643
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,680
Mrs Patmore, there's a lot to be done
and you're only just up on your feet.

644
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:05,040
We really cannot manage
without Mrs Bird. If you say so.

645
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,605
Now, I've been checking the stores

646
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,685
and I've ordered what you'll need
for the baking.

647
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,240
That's very kind, Mrs Hughes, but
I believe WE should check the stores,

648
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:17,125
when it's convenient.

649
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,125
Mrs Bird, at Downton Abbey,

650
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,660
the housekeeper manages the store
cupboard, but -

651
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:26,125
I've never not run my own store
cupboard in my life.

652
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,000
Separate the cook from the store
cupboard? Where's the sense in that?

653
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:33,045
How long have I been saying this,
oh, Lord?

654
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,960
We're the ones who cook it.
We should be the ones to order it.

655
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:42,840
Mrs Bird, I shall be very glad of
your help with the garden party.

656
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:46,160
I'm sure we can manage it easily...
between the two of us.

657
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,805
Hello?

658
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,725
This is Downton Abbey.

659
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,720
Carson the butler speaking.

660
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,805
Hello.

661
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,200
This is Mr Carson,
the butler, of Downton Abbey.

662
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:22,560
To whom am I speaking?

663
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,120
But I'm not shouting!

664
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,740
Who are YOU?

665
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:30,765
Oh. Mrs Gaunt.

666
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,680
No, I don't want to place a call.

667
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,320
I was practising my answer.

668
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,960
Well, I daresay a lot of the things
you do sound stupid to other people!

669
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:46,845
I've written to your mother.
She's very anxious, naturally.

670
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,560
She suggested coming over. Oh, God.
Well, that's what I thought.

671
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:54,760
So I put her off. Told her to come
and admire the baby.

672
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,845
I'll just run Your Ladyship's bath.
Thank you, O'Brien.

673
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,480
Oh, have you had any answers about
the position? Quite a few.

674
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,820
So what did they sound like?
One I think has real possibilities.

675
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:16,600
She learned to do hair in Paris
while working for the Ambassadress.

676
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,920
Oh, sounds promising.

677
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,440
Carson, I've been meaning...
Your Lordship? Oh!

678
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:30,000
Anna, you're back safely, then?
Yes, thank you, my lord.

679
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,240
And Mrs Patmore's fighting fit
again. 'Fighting fit' is the phrase!

680
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:38,165
Is something the matter?

681
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,080
I wanted to see Your Lordship
because... Please.

682
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,480
While I was in London, I learned
something about Mr Bates.

683
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,600
Not bad, I hope.
No. Not bad at all.

684
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,000
I'd have told Mr Carson, but I thought
you might like to hear it from me first.

685
00:46:59,035 --> 00:47:03,280
Go on. I went to call on Mr Bates's
mother.

686
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,160
O'Brien, how long do you think it
takes a lady's maid to settle in?

687
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,400
Depends on the maid, my lady.
Of course it does.

688
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,960
Oops! Sorry.

689
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,480
The other half's under the bath.
Never mind. Thank you.

690
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,720
I'll just go and sort out
your clothes, my lady. Thank you.

691
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,440
Sarah O'Brien,
this is not who you are.

692
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,400
My lady, if you could just wait...

693
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,000
Doctor's gone, your Lordship, but
he's coming back after dinner.

694
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,400
Lady Mary is with her now.

695
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,400
Thank you.

696
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,000
I don't suppose you want to change.

697
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,800
Is there anything else
I can do to be useful?

698
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,600
It was a boy.

699
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to embarras you.

700
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm not embarrased.

701
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,000
I just wish you could've
been speared of this.

702
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,600
Thank you.

703
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
By the way, Anna's told me
what she learned to London.

704
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,600
She... She's not told me.

705
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,000
The good news is you were
believed in Downton.

706
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,000
I need some good news today.

707
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,600
That poor babe.

708
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
How is Her Ladyship doing?

709
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,600
I'll take her a cup of tea in a minute,
but I don't see she'd touched a bite.

710
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,800
What about you, Miss O'Brien?
What about me?

711
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,800
We assume it was quite a shock.

712
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,400
Yes. Yes, it was.

713
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,800
And you'll better dine with us, Mr Branson.
We can't know if you might be needed later.

714
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,800
Well, I'll go after the Doctor at 10.

715
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,800
What's a long face a lot.

716
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Kindly show some respect.

717
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,000
Come on, Mr. Carson. You should be over it.
They're not bigger than a hamster at that stage.

718
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,000
Would you shut up?!

719
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
I agree. What is
the matter with you, Thomas?

720
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,000
I mean, I'm sorry, of course I am.

721
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,600
But why must we live through them? They're just
our employers, they're not our flesh and blood.

722
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,000
Thomas, don't be so unkind.
There is nothing left on this Earth you respect?

723
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,120
'Ark at 'im...  Blimey, if he carries on like this for the
unborn baby of a woman who scarcely know his name...

724
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,600
No wonder he fell to pieces
when the old mum snuffed it.

725
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
William!

726
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Thomas! William!
Stop! That it's enough!

727
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,200
Oh, Thomas!

728
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,540
I've done as I promised. General Burke
is commanding the Division of Richmond.

729
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
I think I may have a place there for you.

730
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,400
And Colonel Cartwright...
These ar the papers.

731
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,200
When you are ready... report to the local
recruiting office and I'll take it from there.

732
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,200
As a matter of fact, I've been drafted back
as Capitain. I'll try to keep an eye on you.

733
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,600
That's very kind of you, Doctor.

734
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,600
With any luck, there may be some advantage
you having volunteered so early.

735
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,280
Oh, hang on a minute! Give me yours and
take these one at the same time.

736
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,200
William, I'm sorry I've been
so unkind to you lately.

737
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,880
That's all right.
No, it's not all right,

738
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,000
I don't know why I've said those things.

739
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,000
Well, you were under an evil spell.
I'm not under anymore.

740
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,200
I'm glad.
Friends?

741
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,800
Always friends.

742
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,600
I think we should start the Ices, now...
if you agree, Mrs Patmore.

743
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,000
Certainly, Mrs. Bird.

744
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, my Lord! Listen to that!

745
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,200
Mr. Carson's telephone is ringing.

746
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,800
There is someone who's going to answer?

747
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,800
I wouldn't touch that thing
with a ten foot pole!

748
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,200
Then I will that.

749
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,200
No, Mr. Carson is busy.
Can I take a message?

750
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,800
I've got news, my Lady.

751
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Mr. Bromidge has rung. You've done it,
Gwen. You got the job!

752
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,600
Oh... Take it! Take it!

753
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,600
Something to celebrate?

754
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,800
I've got the job, Mrs. Hughes.
I'm a secretary.

755
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,800
I'm very happy for you, Gwen. And we'll
celebrate after we'll finish today's work.

756
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,600
Of course, Mrs. Hughes.

757
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,000
I don't suppose...
Lady Sybil, Her Ladyship is asking after you.

758
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,200
Be careful, my lad, or your land up
with no job and a broken heart.

759
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,400
What do you mean?

760
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,600
I don't seem to be able to find your sister.
I wonder where she is.

761
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,000
Of course, she may have been cornered.

762
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,600
I've heard there is some old bore
she's trying to dodge.

763
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,600
Who's that?

764
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,600
I'm not sure... It's simply ghastly,
apparently.

765
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,600
But he promissed to propose today.

766
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,800
I can't tell you how funny she was when
it acted it out. Like she was on stage.

767
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,800
Really?

768
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
How amusing.

769
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,200
Well done, Mrs. Hughes.
Beautifuly executed, as always.

770
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,600
He is in the planning.

771
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,400
Mr. Carson, probably isn't the moment,
but I've just heard from Dr. Clarkson

772
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,120
that I've been accepted for a training
scheme into the Army Medical Corps.

773
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,600
Have you, indeed? Yes. I want to do it,
so I'll be handing in my notice.

774
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,600
I'll serve until the end
of the month, of course.

775
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,400
Thank you, Thomas. We can
talk about it later.

776
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,200
And you couldn't planned
that any better either!

777
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You can't be leaving yet!
I'm afraid I must.

778
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,400
Please, make my excuses to your mother.

779
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,600
I wish you'll come inside, my Lady.
No.

780
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,800
People mustn't think I'm really ill.

781
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
Don't want to cast a dampener on the party.

782
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,400
Very well. But... are you sure you have
everything you need, my Lady?

783
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:26,600
Dear, O'Brien...
How sweet you are.

784
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,200
O'Brien! O'Brien!

785
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,200
Can I have a word? I need a favor and I don't
want to bother Lady Grantham with it.

786
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,120
Certainly, my Lady.

787
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,800
She's been helping me find a new maid. And we
had quite a few answers from the advertisment.

788
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Can you find where she'd put them and get
Branson to bring'em to the Dowager House?

789
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,600
Her Ladyship was helping you
find a new lady's maid? Yes!

790
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,800
You might take a look to
the letters, if you have a minute.

791
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,200
There's one who's been trained in Paris.

792
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,400
Do you know where she might put them?

793
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,200
The answers?

794
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,600
Oh, yes, my Lady. There are only two
or three places there could be.

795
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,200
Thank you, O'Brien.
You're a treasure. Thank you.

796
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,600
I didn't know a garden party
was a spectator sport.

797
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,600
Pretty, though, isn't it?

798
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,000
It's hard to believe the clouds are
gathering on a summer day like this.

799
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,800
Mr. Bates. I know you think
I was wrong to call on your mother.

800
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,200
I don't think that.

801
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,800
She likes you, by the way.

802
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,520
I had to find out the truth.

803
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,600
You see, you don't know the whole truth.

804
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,000
Not even now.
You know my mother's truth.

805
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
But not your wife's.

806
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,200
Where is she now?
I couldn't tell you.

807
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,000
I'd better get back.

808
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,000
You're here, Mr. Molesley? I didn't know that.
Just helping out.

809
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,000
Nice girl, that Anna. It looks she's got
anyone special in her life.

810
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,000
I'd like to say she hasn't.

811
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,400
I would, surely, but I'm afraid
there is someone.

812
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,800
Do you think he's keen on her,
or is it worth a go?

813
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,200
Well, he keeps himself to himself. It's
very hard to read, at times, but...

814
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,200
I'd say he's keen...
I's say he's very keen, indeed.

815
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,880
Daisy, I've said ices, not ice cakes.

816
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,800
Now, unclog your ears and get these to
William before they turn into soup.

817
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But I've tried to understand.
Nothing is changed.

818
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,001
Everything is changed.

819
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,600
You can't be sure I was going to
refuse you even if it fad been a boy.

820
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,600
Because I'm not.
That's the point!

821
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,000
I can't be sure... Of you...
Of everything, it seems.

822
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,600
Thew last few weeks have told me that.

823
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,600
But you can't leave Downton.
I can't stay. Not now.

824
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,000
What-what you'll tell Papa?

825
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,600
That I'm grateful for what he's trying to
do... but the experiment is at an end.

826
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm not a puppet. I must take charge
of my own life again.

827
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,200
Would you have stayed...
if I'd accepted you?

828
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,000
Of course.
So, I've ruined everything?

829
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You've showed me
I've been living in a dream.

830
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,800
And it's time to return tu real life.

831
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,600
Wish me luck with it, Mary.

832
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,200
God knows I wish the best for you.

833
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,760
Well, Rosamund,
I'm afraid your medling

834
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,200
has cost Mary the only
decent offer she'll ever get.

835
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,600
I'm sorry, Mama, but you know me,
I have to say what I think.

836
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,800
Why? Nobody else does.

837
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,800
Are you quite well, my Lady?
Of course.

838
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,000
You know me, Carson.
I'm never down for long.

839
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,400
I know you have spirit, my Lady.
That's what counts.

840
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,400
That's all that counts, in the end.

841
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,400
So, Mary is to be denied her countess coronet, after all.

842
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,800
Don't crow at me. I think she was foolish
not to take Matthew when she could.

843
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And I've told her so.

844
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,800
If I'm perfectly honest, I wonder Matthew
is making the same mistake right now.

845
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,000
Are you warm enough?
I am when you're holding my hand.

846
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,000
Your Lordship? This is just arrived for you.
Thank you.

847
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,280
And I'm happy to tell you that
Thomas has just handed in his notice.

848
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,600
So, we'll be spared any
unpleasantness on that score.

849
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
What a relief!

850
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,000
Please! Would you stop, please?

851
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,600
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen.
Can I ask for silence?

852
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,200
Because I very much regret to announce

853
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that we are at war with Germany.

854
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:27,000
End of Season 1

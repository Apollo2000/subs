2
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,759
Mary, the men are arranging
the concert now

3
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,970
and they are so anxious
for us both to be in it,

4
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,472
or there'll be no girls at all.
Please say you will.

5
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,558
Do I have to? Yes, you do.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,687
Keeping their spirits up is an important
part of the cure and so very little to ask.

7
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,565
What's going on?
The men are putting on a concert.

8
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,859
Can I help?
Edith has it under control.

9
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:13,198
I do, if Mary's willing. Oh, all
right. One song, and that's your lot.

10
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:18,119
What time is Doctor Clarkson's
round? It's already happened.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,628
Without me? Why?
I'm not very late.

12
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,376
We didn't see the need to wait. Mrs
Hughes, I need to steal you for a minute.

13
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,421
I have to check the linen books.
But I went over them last week.

14
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,799
Very good, m'lady. I'll get started.
Surely I can...

15
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:36,179
Anna, can you tell Mrs Patmore it'll be easier
for me to go through the menus this afternoon?

16
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,306
Of course, Your Ladyship.

17
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,976
Cousin Cora - Please, can it wait?
I've a mountain to get through.

18
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,566
There's a parcel for you.
Thank you.

19
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,281
There's a little one for you.

20
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,368
This one looks as if it's been
opened, but it hasn't.

21
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,792
Ethel, have you nothing to do?

22
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,841
I was keeping her talking.
You mustn't blame her. I don't.

23
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,601
What a lovely day!

24
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:28,106
Are you quite sure about Lavinia?
She wasn't Sir Richard's mistress.

25
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,527
She gave him the evidence to settle
a debt of... someone she loved.

26
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,113
And this is your beau, is it?

27
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:38,658
A man who lends money, then uses it
to blackmail the recipient?

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,745
He lives in a tough world.
And will you be joining him there?

29
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,709
Richard Carlisle is powerful.
He's rich and getting richer.

30
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,671
He wants to buy a proper house,
you know - with an estate.

31
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:57,177
He says, after the war, the market will
be flooded and we can take our pick. Oh?

32
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,597
And you can dance on the grave
of a fallen family.

33
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,683
They will fall, lots of them.

34
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,936
Some won't rise again,
but I don't intend to be among them.

35
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:12,358
That leaves Matthew.
That's done now, Granny. Finished.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,527
It's time to move forward.

37
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,990
What about Sybil?
Does she have anyone in her sights?

38
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:25,622
Not that I know of. Are you sure
she has no chap in mind? How odd!

39
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:31,794
I had an endless series of crushes
at her age. I don't think so.

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,132
Not even some man she doesn't care
to mention? What do you mean?

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,094
Well, war breaks down barriers

42
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,680
and when peacetime re-erects them,

43
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:47,769
it's... very easy to find oneself
on the wrong side. Really, Granny!

44
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,606
How can you say that I'm too worldly
but Sybil's not worldly enough?

45
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,818
You cannot be so contrary.
I'm a woman, Mary.

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,946
I can be as contrary as I choose.

47
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,077
But I don't understand. The patients are
always served their luncheon at 12:30.

48
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,414
Well, today they'll be served at one.
Is this something I can help with?

49
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,961
Mrs Patmore seems to be disobeying my
instructions and I can't get to the reason why.

50
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,088
If you mean the patients' new
lunchtime,

51
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,633
Her Ladyship felt it made the staff
luncheon unreasonably early.

52
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,971
She moved it, so they could eat at noon. But
that will interfere with the nurses' shifts.

53
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,099
Oh no, she's altered those, too.
Has she, indeed?

54
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,561
Well, we'll see about that.

55
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,233
It was always a question of when.

56
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,199
May I have a word? Can it
wait? No, it cannot wait.

57
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,709
I've just come from downstairs,

58
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,082
where I learnt that my timetable
has been wantonly disregarded.

59
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,209
If you mean the new lunchtime,

60
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:59,132
the wretched servants were having to eat at 11
and then starve until their tea at six, so I...

61
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,886
You've also torn up the nurses'
timetable. I haven't torn up anything...

62
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,769
It would be foolish to accuse you
of being unprofessional,

63
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,058
as you've never had a profession
in your life. Now, just a minute!

64
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:12,145
You may think you have the right
to ordain the universe,

65
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,149
but in this field - No, not in this field.
In this house, yes, I do have the right,

66
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,194
given me by Doctor Clarkson
and by the law of the land!

67
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,655
This is my house, and I am in charge
right alongside you!

68
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,492
If you would stop your bullying.
That's enough! I will not listen to this.

69
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:31,873
If I am not appreciated here, I will seek some
other place where I will make a difference. Good.

70
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:38,671
I mean it. I cannot operate where
I am not valued. You must see that!

71
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,798
Certainly.

72
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,345
I shall go. I will.

73
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,598
Perhaps it would be best.

74
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,185
I repeat - I mean it.

75
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,271
I'm sure you do - and so do I.

76
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,321
Why did you promise Carson
not to stage any more protests,

77
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,783
when you wouldn't promise me?
I had my reasons.

78
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,204
But you won't be content to stay
at Downton forever, will you?

79
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,874
Tinkering away at an engine
instead of fighting for freedom?

80
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,711
I thought you'd join the rising
in Dublin last Easter.

81
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:23,341
I might have... if it hadn't been put
down in six short, bloody weeks.

82
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,513
But don't fret. The real fight for Ireland will
come after the war, and I'll be ready for it.

83
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:41,025
The truth is, I'll stay in Downton
until you want to run away with me.

84
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,488
Don't be ridiculous.
You're too scared to admit it...

85
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,533
but you're in love with me.

86
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,787
Branson, could you take me
into Ripon at three?

87
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,957
I'm getting some things for Mama.
Is there anything you want?

88
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,084
Nothing you can find in Ripon!

89
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:09,512
Well... it IS her house. Does that mean
she's suddenly received a medical training?

90
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,850
No - Or are you like everyone else in
thinking that, because she's a countess,

91
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,437
she has acquired universal knowledge
by divine intervention?

92
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,065
Mrs Crawley, convalescent homes
are not about medical training.

93
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,486
They are far more to do with good
food, fresh air and clean sheets.

94
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,950
Very well. I've had a letter
from a cousin in Paris

95
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,037
who is working for the Wounded
And Missing Enquiry Department.

96
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:38,291
They've opened a branch in Northern
France under the aegis of the Red Cross.

97
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,046
I shall offer them my services.
Well, that's... that's very drastic.

98
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,423
I have to go where I am useful

99
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,718
and that place, I'm afraid,
is no longer Downton Abbey.

100
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,763
You'll be missed.
By you, possibly.

101
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,892
I hope so, anyway.

102
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,103
But not, I think, by Lady Grantham.

103
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:06,486
If you were the only girl
in the world.

104
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:12,659
And I were the only boy

105
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,162
I wish we had a man.

106
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,873
Amen!
It would sound so much richer,

107
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,626
but all the volunteers
are spoken for.

108
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,712
How's it going?
All right, I suppose,

109
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,966
if you don't mind singers who can't
sing and actors who can't act!

110
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:33,012
It helps to keep their spirits up. So
they say, although I can't think why.

111
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,183
I had a letter this morning
from Sir Richard Carlisle. Oh?

112
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,478
He...

113
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,816
He tells me he proposed
when he was staying here.

114
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,320
He apologizes for not asking my
permission, but he's asking it now.

115
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,116
Have you decided?
Is that why he's written?

116
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,618
No... but I have made the decision.

117
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,538
Which is?
I think I should take him.

118
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,751
Do you really, my darling? I wish
I could believe in your motives.

119
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,880
Why? What were your motives
when you married Mama?

120
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,091
Your mother has made me very happy.

121
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,761
Perhaps Sir Richard
will make ME very happy.

122
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,891
What about Matthew?
Not you, too! Poor Matthew...

123
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,394
What must he do to persuade you
he's in love with Lavinia?

124
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,980
Open his chest and carve her name
on his heart?

125
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,820
Write to him. Tell him of your plans
with Carlisle. You owe him that.

126
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,615
I don't think I "owe" him anything,

127
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,742
but I'll write to him, if you like.

128
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,956
I'll try to send you an address,

129
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,168
but you can always get me through
the Red Cross. Very good, ma'am.

130
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,671
I'll try to contact Captain Crawley,
explain to him what's happened.

131
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,339
If he does get leave, he'll probably
come to me or stay in London,

132
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,934
but if I miss him and he turns up
here, I know you'll look after him.

133
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,059
Of course I will, ma'am. Cook him what
he likes - not what's good for him.

134
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,813
You don't know when you'll be back? I
don't think one knows anything in wartime.

135
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:12,487
I'll try to give you warning. In
the meantime, look after yourselves.

136
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,740
Now, I mustn't miss my train.

137
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,927
So, what now?

138
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,604
Ah, Anna said you were honoring us
with your presence at dinner.

139
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,731
It's easier here than the hospital.

140
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,235
I can always get changed back
into my uniform if I need to.

141
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,824
What were you talking to Branson
about when I came into the yard?

142
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,160
Nothing.

143
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,997
Then why were you there?

144
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,375
Why were YOU there?
Because I was ordering the motor.

145
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,712
That is why one talks to chauffeurs,
isn't it?

146
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,839
To plan journeys by road?

147
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,427
He is a person.
He can discuss other things.

148
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,973
I'm sure he can - but not with you.
What do you want from me?

149
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,186
Am I to see if Sir Richard Carlisle has a
younger brother - one even richer than he is?

150
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,022
Darling, what's the matter with you?
I'm on your side.

151
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,149
Then be on my side!

152
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,030
'So there we have it. I look
forward to introducing the two of you

153
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,245
just as soon as you are next
at home,

154
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,222
which naturally
I trust will be very soon indeed.

155
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:45,163
Please be glad for me,
as I will always be for you.

156
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,832
Your affectionate cousin, Mary. '

157
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:53,630
We don't need anyone with us. The Sergeant knows
what we're doing. But what are we patrolling for?

158
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,091
You've been taking those logic pills
again! This is the army, Mason.

159
00:11:57,128 --> 00:12:00,237
We're going on a patrol
because we're going on a patrol.

160
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:03,311
Has Mary set a date yet
for the wedding? She doesn't say.

161
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,856
I think she's hoping the war will be
over soon and they can set a date then.

162
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,610
She could've waited and told you when she
saw you. She doesn't know I'm due back.

163
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:15,068
Did you warn Daisy, or will it be a surprise? No,
I've told her we're coming to Downton first.

164
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:17,993
Then I'll visit my dad and go back
to see her for a day at the end.

165
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:23,284
Fresh Yorkshire air, followed by London
and Miss Swire. All right for some, sir!

166
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,205
You'd never swap, though, would you?
No, I'd never swap.

167
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,794
Bates in a pub? I can't see that.
I think your pal's mistaken.

168
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,339
He met him here twice
before the war. Listen.

169
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:42,011
I said to him, "Hello, Mr Bates," and he
walked off and wouldn't serve me after.

170
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,226
Next thing you know, we'll have Anna running across
the county and dragging him back by his stick!

171
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,442
I'm surprised he isn't here of his
own accord,

172
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,648
with His Lordship having no valet
since the loony went.

173
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:57,068
Don't speak ill of Mr Lang.
You're a funny one!

174
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,821
Talk about sweet and sour.

175
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,657
Better get back.

176
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,964
Want a cup?

177
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,050
Not really.

178
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,054
What were you doing?
Oh, let me see.

179
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,064
I've tidied the study - twice

180
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,853
and I've rearranged the coats
in the hall.

181
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,191
I might check his clothes for moth.
What about you?

182
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,407
We've cleaned everything
three times over

183
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,447
and I've sent Beth into the village
for some eggs to pickle,

184
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,746
though the Mistress
doesn't really like them.

185
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,911
Well, she never eats properly,
anyway. Not on her own.

186
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,914
A butler can't do much
with supper on a tray!

187
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,461
Beg your pardon for troubling you,
only the door was open.

188
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,214
But the front gate was not. No.

189
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,031
What do you want?
Have you got any spare food?

190
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,597
"Spare food"?
What's that, when it's at home?

191
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,603
Hang on, hang on. Wait.

192
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,949
From around here? Not far.

193
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,405
I used to work on the farms,
but er... not any more.

194
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,287
Did you get that in the war? Don't
pity me. I'm one of the lucky ones.

195
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,293
I might have something for you.

196
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,672
Come on.

197
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,032
Hello, Mr Molesley.
They told me you were up here.

198
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,417
I hope you don't mind my bothering
you. Not a bit. What can I do for you?

199
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:59,083
Well, actually, Mr Carson, I've been thinking
there might be something I can do for YOU. Hm?

200
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,794
That brushing, for instance.

201
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,843
I don't like having nothing to do,

202
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:14,682
what with Captain Crawley away at the war
and his mother in France alongside him.

203
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:19,437
And then, His Lordship's without a valet
and... and your plate is piled so high!

204
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,940
I am quite occupied, it's true.

205
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,692
So I thought I'd look in
and give you a hand,

206
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,447
brushing, mending, cleaning shoes -
whatever's needed.

207
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,288
That's kind of you, Mr Molesley.

208
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:38,498
We shall have to watch ourselves, or else His
Lordship will want to pinch you off Captain Crawley.

209
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,888
But he said he'd be here by now and he's
not. You mustn't worry about him, Daisy.

210
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:53,555
I'm not "worried" like that, exactly, but this is William.
I think we should all be worried.

211
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:56,646
Anything might have happened.
Maybe his leave was canceled.

212
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,854
At times like these, people vanish and
turn up again in the strangest places.

213
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,939
Like Mr Bates in that pub.

214
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,988
Working in a public house? That's what
he said. I thought they'd have told you.

215
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:13,116
It doesn't seem likely
that a trained valet like Mr Bates

216
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:15,999
would be content to work
in a public house!

217
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,539
Well, that's what he said.
Have you mentioned this to Anna?

218
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,465
I haven't said anything to anyone.
I thought you all knew.

219
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:28,506
Perhaps you should ask Thomas. Oh, I will ask Thomas.
Don't you worry about that, my girl.

220
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,642
Didn't it occur to you that we might be
interested to hear it? Not particularly.

221
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:38,558
As far as I knew, Mr Bates had left your employment.
You didn't think to tell Carson?

222
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,936
I am not under Mr Carson's command
now, Your Lordship.

223
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,198
Shoo! Daisy, go to bed
before you strain your eyes!

224
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,334
Thank you, Daisy, for telling Mr
Carson all about my private letter!

225
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,545
I didn't know it was a secret.
Sorry if I was wrong.

226
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:09,631
There's no "if" about it.

227
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,260
Why answer His Lordship at all?

228
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,389
What did you want me to do?
Tell him to get knotted?

229
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,268
He doesn't pay your wages.
I see.

230
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,647
Well, I won't put you down
for a career in diplomacy, then!

231
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:28,608
What's he after? To get Bates back?

232
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,655
If Mr Bates wanted his job back,
he'd have written for it himself.

233
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,367
Why would he want his job back?
He's like you. He got away.

234
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,209
He's not very like me, thank you.
But you're both free

235
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,832
of all the bowing and scraping
and "Yes, m'lord," and "No, m'lord."

236
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,627
I envy him. I envy you.

237
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,215
Cos I'm ready for a new adventure
and I don't care who hears me.

238
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,719
"Be careful what you wish for."

239
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:18,783
'The truth is, I'll stay in Downton
until you want to run away with me. '

240
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,336
Ah. Good morning, Anna.
You sent for me, m'lord?

241
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,422
I did. Come in.

242
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,843
I have something to tell you,
but I hope I'm right.

243
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,221
Carson didn't want you
to be troubled with it.

244
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,266
Is this about Mr Bates, m'lord?
Yes, it is.

245
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:48,980
I have no wish to upset you, but it seems he may
be back in Yorkshire working in a public house.

246
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,904
We don't yet know where.

247
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,026
The Red Lion in Kirby Moorside.

248
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,863
Oh.

249
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,911
You've seen him, then?
I have, yes, m'lord.

250
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,664
And he's well? He is.

251
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,669
He's not been back to Downton
for two reasons.

252
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:17,967
He's hoping to settle certain matters
first... with Mrs Bates.

253
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,888
And does he think he can?
He believes so, m'lord.

254
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,432
Very good.

255
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,852
And what is his second reason
for avoiding us?

256
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,189
He says he parted with Your Lordship
on bad terms.

257
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,902
He felt it might be embarrassing.
Yeah...

258
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:37,987
It is for me to feel embarrassed.

259
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:45,078
I had to get out of that kitchen, if
I'm not to be found dead under the table!

260
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:48,044
It's like cooking a banquet
three times a day.

261
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,292
It is a lot of extra work, whatever
they say - even with the helpers.

262
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:53,378
Don't think they lighten the load!

263
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,596
Mrs Bird? What's going on?

264
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:03,555
I knew I'd be found out,
sooner or later. At least it's you.

265
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,976
Found out doing what?
What does it look like?

266
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:13,106
I don't know what it looks like,
except some kind of soup kitchen.

267
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,859
You'd better come inside.

268
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,114
One at a time.

269
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,496
Now, take a piece of bread.

270
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,995
Right. Daisy, stand there.
Give them a bowl and a spoon.

271
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,832
When did all this start?

272
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,085
That fella turned up asking for food.

273
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,505
Then he came back next day
with a friend, and here we are.

274
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:40,341
What does Mrs Crawley say?
She doesn't know yet.

275
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,262
I suppose she'll put a stop to it when
she gets back from France. I hope not.

276
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:48,263
To be honest, Mrs Patmore, I'm not
sure I can manage much longer.

277
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,228
How often do you do it? I planned
to get it down to once a week

278
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:54,194
and give them only the cheapest cuts,

279
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,775
but it is my money, and I don't know
how much - Now, hold it right there!

280
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:00,533
If we can't feed a few soldiers in
our own village,

281
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,200
them that have taken a bullet or worse for
king and country, then I don't know what!

282
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,705
Sorry about this, m'lady, only
there's no footman to do it now.

283
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,667
I don't mind, but you'd better run
before Mrs Hughes sees you.

284
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:21,508
M'lady... could I ask something?

285
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:26,638
Only William, who was in service
here - I know William.

286
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,141
Well, he's missing.

287
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,084
That is, he was supposed to be back
on leave but he never turned up.

288
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,858
He wrote he was coming home for a few
days with Captain Crawley...

289
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,278
Is William your beau?
I won't say that, no, m'lady.

290
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:46,491
We're all very fond of William
downstairs. Of course you are.

291
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,663
Well, I'm sure it's nothing, but
I'll see what I can find out.

292
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,249
Thank you.

293
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:05,134
How do you know they didn't change
their plans? Well, of course I don't,

294
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:07,512
but the poor girl
seemed quite certain.

295
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:12,063
Just when Isobel's away and none of
us know where she is. Typical!

296
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,522
I suppose Matthew might have heard from Cousin
Isobel and decided to meet up in France, instead.

297
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,817
But that wouldn't explain
why William isn't here.

298
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,946
I'll do what I can.

299
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,910
No, don't stop stirring,
the bottom will burn!

300
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,122
You can leave those to Daisy.

301
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:38,293
That's it, Daisy. Put them
in the special storage area.

302
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,028
What do you want?
Can I borrow some baking soda?

303
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:47,218
"Borrow"? Why?
Are you planning to give it back?

304
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:58,000
I might go over to Malton tomorrow. Agatha
Spenlow is madly promoting her charity fair.

305
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:02,901
Do you need the motor? I'm afraid I do. Can
you get Pratt to take you in the other car?

306
00:24:02,937 --> 00:24:05,492
It doesn't matter.
I can go on Monday. But why?

307
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:09,449
I'm told Bates is working
at a public house in Kirby Moorside.

308
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:11,539
I want to investigate.

309
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:15,038
I can't decide which part of that
speech is the most extraordinary!

310
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:18,583
Why can't someone else go?
Because I want to go myself.

311
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,505
So, Sybil, what are you up to, dear?

312
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:28,468
Nothing much. Working. I don't have
time to get up to anything else.

313
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,222
Only Mary and I were talking
about you the other day.

314
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,813
Oh?

315
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,982
Yes, you see, sometimes, in war,

316
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,647
one can make friendships
that aren't quite... appropriate

317
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,608
and it can be awkward, you know,
later on.

318
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,820
I mean, we've all done it. I just
want you to be on your guard.

319
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,784
"Appropriate" for whom? Well,
don't jump down my throat, dear.

320
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,162
I'm only offering friendly advice.
Why do you want to see Bates?

321
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:58,795
To give him his old job back?
Not entirely.

322
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,423
I mainly want to see him
because we parted badly.

323
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:05,338
Telephone call for you, m'lord.
If you did, I'm sure it's his fault.

324
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:07,423
No, it was mine.

325
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,854
Oh, really! It's like living
in a second-rate hotel

326
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,688
where the guests keep arriving
and no-one seems to leave!

327
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,906
I see.

328
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:30,321
Yes... Thank you
for letting me know.

329
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,035
Are you all right, Papa?

330
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,584
That was the War Office.

331
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:48,882
Matthew and William went out on a patrol a few
days ago and they haven't been seen since.

332
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:51,718
Oh, my God.
Let's not fall to pieces quite yet.

333
00:25:51,754 --> 00:25:53,975
It happens all the time, apparently,

334
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,978
and the men turn up
in one field hospital or another.

335
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,768
But they are treating them as missing
in action? It's too early for that.

336
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:03,068
There could be lots of things
to explain it.

337
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,566
You mean they could have been taken
prisoner? It's possible.

338
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,868
Don't say anything to Mary...
or your mother,

339
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:15,533
or anyone, in fact - not yet.
I shouldn't really have told you.

340
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:19,287
What about Cousin Isobel?
I don't know how to contact her.

341
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,415
Anyway, she's in France.
She may hear before we do.

342
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,846
I'm not accusing her of anything,

343
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:35,094
but I did wonder if you were aware
of this "special storage area"?

344
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:38,806
I daresay Mrs Patmore has her own
system, like we all do.

345
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,436
Right. Well, I'll say good night.
Good night.

346
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,946
Ah, Mr Molesley. You're very late.

347
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,824
I was doing some invisible mending
on one of his coats.

348
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,114
I got a bit carried away, but I'm... I'm
quite pleased with the way it turned out.

349
00:26:56,241 --> 00:27:00,182
I don't see why you can't dress him
until there's a new valet.

350
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:04,123
It'd be a blessing to Mr Carson.
I'd be happy to, if it'd help.

351
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,961
Keep this up, and we won't be able
to do without you at all.

352
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:10,046
There's no reason why you should.

353
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,430
Oh, er, I may be wrong,

354
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:19,138
but I thought I saw one of the officers
by the maids' staircase just now.

355
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:22,600
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

356
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:24,686
Let's hope so.

357
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,938
Good night.

358
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,978
What the bloody... Ethel!

359
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,940
We were only... I know precisely
what you were doing, Major.

360
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:15,695
I may not be a woman of the world,
but I don't live in a sack!

361
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:19,490
Now, if you would kindly
take your things and go downstairs.

362
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:29,730
Ethel, you are dismissed without
notice and without a character.

363
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:33,963
You will please leave before
breakfast. I didn't think I was...

364
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,257
No. And that's the problem.

365
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,093
You never do.

366
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,561
And you're not nervous?

367
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,190
Well, I gather His Lordship
knows his own mind,

368
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:54,531
but I've no difficulty with that.

369
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,758
You'll enjoy working
in a big household.

370
00:28:57,794 --> 00:29:00,949
Better than staring at me
night after night!

371
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,661
What would you say
if they ask you to stay?

372
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,457
It would be a big step up for me.
There's no point in denying it.

373
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:11,543
Because I think they might.

374
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,004
Do you really, Mrs Bird?

375
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:20,385
There goes Mr Molesley,
valet to the Earl of Grantham.

376
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:22,595
Stop it!

377
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,357
But why?

378
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:32,522
What could you have possibly done
that's so terrible?

379
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,358
Have I taken everything of mine
from there?

380
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:41,197
Would you like me to speak to her?
Because I can.

381
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,783
No. She wouldn't listen.

382
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,495
She's not a bad person, Mrs Hughes.

383
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,124
I know she can be strict, but she's
not - She wouldn't listen.

384
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,060
We're closed.

385
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,701
I know Ethel could be difficult,
Mrs Hughes,

386
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,991
but she was very sorry for
her mistake, whatever it was.

387
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:28,208
I'm sure. It's cost her her job.
But surely it can't...

388
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:32,165
Never mind why she's gone, she's
gone - and there's an end to it.

389
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:38,630
By the way, I hear
Mr Bates is back in the county.

390
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,299
Mr Carson says
you know all about it.

391
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,555
I gather His Lordship
has gone to see him.

392
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:50,266
I know. He told me he was going.

393
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:55,230
Why in heaven's name
didn't you mention any of it to me?

394
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,441
It wasn't my secret to tell.

395
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:04,447
I'm glad to hear it, but Carson said
your wife made all sorts of threats.

396
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,909
She won't carry them out - not now.

397
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,957
Since I left Downton, I've discovered
that she was... untrue to me.

398
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:19,045
I may have been as bad in my heart, m'lord,
but I've done nothing to be ashamed of.

399
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,569
The point is, I can divorce her now,
whether she likes it or not.

400
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:25,934
But what's to stop her blurting out
her stories to the press?

401
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:29,264
If she agrees to keep silent, I will
give her whatever she wants.

402
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,268
She can't hold me now, so her choice
is between poverty and plenty.

403
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,397
And what was the tale she was going
to tell? Carson never made it clear.

404
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:41,651
Some silly nonsense, m'lord.
I wouldn't waste your time with it.

405
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,196
What's the news from Downton?

406
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,784
Daisy, you're not to worry
about William.

407
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,167
I spoke to His Lordship earlier.

408
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:56,124
He says you're not to be concerned
until we know more. But he is missing.

409
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,299
I mean, they don't know where he is,
or Captain Crawley, do they?

410
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:04,007
There could be a hundred explanations. Yes.
And one of them is that they're dead!

411
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,393
Don't mistake me,
I hope very much they're not,

412
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,017
but we ought to face the truth.
What may be the truth.

413
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:16,102
And what very well may not!

414
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:23,193
Anna, do you think that Mr Bates
will come back?

415
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,279
That's for him to say.
I hope he does.

416
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,407
He always seems
a romantic figure to me.

417
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:32,123
Does he? How do you define "romantic"?

418
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,831
It's no good him thinking he can turn up here
without a moment's notice and be cock of the walk!

419
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:40,126
Why is that, Thomas?
Because the place is already taken?

420
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:50,887
I hate the word "missing". It seems
to leave so little room for optimism.

421
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,058
I tell myself
it's too early to despair,

422
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,860
but to be honest, Bates,
I don't think I can bear it.

423
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:04,567
Losing Patrick was bad enough,
but now the thought of Matthew gone

424
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,321
and the future
once again destroyed...

425
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,408
More than all that,
I loved him like a son.

426
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:19,874
No, I LOVE him. Let's stay in the
present tense, while we still can.

427
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,803
So, will you come back with me...

428
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,133
and help me through
the Vale of Shadow?

429
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:35,431
It's not what I expected, m'lord,
but... I will, if you want me to.

430
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:41,938
I misjudged you, Bates,
and I abused you when we parted.

431
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,315
I should have had more faith.
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,736
God knows, you've shown more faith
in me than I had any right to.

433
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:56,411
There we are. Get this basket
off my arm. It weighs a ton!

434
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,225
Sybil?

435
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,983
I never said anything to Granny,
honestly.

436
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,029
Then why did she start talking about
"inappropriate friendships" out of nowhere?

437
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:31,029
She thinks you must have a beau and if we don't know
about him, then you have to be keeping him secret.

438
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:33,995
It's just Granny being Granny.
Don't make such a thing of it.

439
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:37,785
I don't deserve to be told off - not
by her or by you. Nothing's happened.

440
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:43,838
Why? What might have happened?
I mean it.

441
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,050
We haven't kissed, or anything.
I don't think we've shaken hands!

442
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,882
I'm not even sure if I like him like
that. He says I do, but I'm still not sure.

443
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:53,264
We are talking about...
Branson, yes.

444
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,810
The chauffeur, Branson?
Oh, how disappointing of you!

445
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:00,146
I'm just trying to get it straight
you and the chauffeur...

446
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:04,145
You know I don't care about all of
that. Darling, don't be such a baby.

447
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,773
This isn't fairyland.
What did you think?

448
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,735
You'd marry the chauffeur and we'd
all come to tea? Don't be silly.

449
00:35:10,772 --> 00:35:14,280
I told you, I don't even think I like
him. What has he said to you?

450
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,160
That he loves me and wants me to run
away with him. Good God in heaven!

451
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,455
He's frightfully full of himself.
You don't say!

452
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:26,584
But I haven't encouraged him.
I haven't said anything, really.

453
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,546
You haven't given him away, though.
Will you?

454
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,841
Well, I won't betray him
on one condition:

455
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,307
You must promise
not to do anything stupid.

456
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:38,346
You must promise now,
or I'll tell Papa tonight.

457
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,725
I promise.

458
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:11,379
Mr Bates!
You're a sight for sore eyes.

459
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,340
Welcome home.
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

460
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:19,470
I thought it was you. Hello.

461
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:25,602
Come away in and give some substance
to the gossip of your return.

462
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:34,944
You'll find things a bit different
from when you left, Mr Bates.

463
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:37,030
Downton at war. Precisely.

464
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,992
There's some extra help
in the kitchen, all very nice people

465
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:44,537
and the nurses, of course,
but they live down at the hospital.

466
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:48,124
Except for Lady Sybil.
Nurse Crawley, please!

467
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:56,758
So we've both returned, you and I.
A couple of bad pennies.

468
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:01,137
I haven't. Thomas means
he's not here as a servant.

469
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:04,098
He manages the house.
He's a sergeant now.

470
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,643
I take orders from Major Clarkson.

471
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:11,147
He runs this place on behalf
of the Army Medical Corps.

472
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:14,234
Yet another reason
to pray for peace!

473
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:18,947
I heard about William from His
Lordship. And Captain Crawley.

474
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,742
I'm sure they're all right.

475
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,789
Sorry I'm late!
Has the dressing gong rung yet?

476
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,046
You're not late, Mr Molesley,
but er...

477
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:34,045
Mr Bates is back, and you reminded
me. I'd better ring it now.

478
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:39,801
Are you staying... for good? I'd need a crystal
ball to answer that, but I'll stay for now.

479
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:44,472
Have you been standing in for me? I
was going to, starting tonight, yeah.

480
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:47,934
Then you'll be relieved to see me.
Oh, tremendously.

481
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,645
What's that?

482
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:54,440
It's a new kind of shoehorn.
I bought it for His Lordship.

483
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:56,818
That's very kind of you,
Mr Molesley. Thank you.

484
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,742
Daisy, fetch me some more tea.
Thomas, I've got dinner...

485
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,620
Hot, this time,
and it's Sergeant Barrow to you.

486
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:18,803
Watch yourself, Mr Bates.
Thomas is in charge now.

487
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,052
It won't do to get on the wrong side
of him. Is there a right side?

488
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,474
I don't believe it.
Why would she sell food to Mrs Bird?

489
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:30,357
It makes no sense.

490
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:34,606
Well, I can't confirm
the details of the arrangement.

491
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:37,901
Maybe they both sell it
and divide the proceeds.

492
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,158
Either way, I felt you should know.

493
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:43,948
Have you said anything to Mrs Hughes
or Carson? I've tried with her,

494
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:46,701
but there's none so blind
as them that will not see.

495
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,538
I'm curious.
Next time, come and fetch me.

496
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,878
So Bates is back.
Papa must be pleased.

497
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,963
And Mr Carson won't be sorry.

498
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,427
Branson, there's something
you ought to know.

499
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,348
I've told Mary.

500
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,935
I see.

501
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,481
Well, that's me finished, then -
and without a reference.

502
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:18,905
No, she's not like that.
You don't know her.

503
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,694
She wouldn't give us away.
But she won't encourage us.

504
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:24,781
No.

505
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:29,160
Why are you smiling?
I thought you'd be angry.

506
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:34,666
Because that's the first time
you've ever spoken about "us".

507
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:41,130
If you didn't care,
you would have told them months ago.

508
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:44,306
Oh, I see. Because I don't want you
to lose your job,

509
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:47,679
it must mean I'm madly in love
with you. Well, doesn't it?

510
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,813
You say I'm a free spirit,
and I hope I am,

511
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,353
but you're asking me to give up
my whole world and everyone in it.

512
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,565
And that's too high a price to pay?
It IS a high price!

513
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,568
I love my parents - you don't know them...

514
00:40:01,604 --> 00:40:03,658
and I love my sisters, my friends...

515
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,197
I'm not asking you
to give them up for ever.

516
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:09,534
When they come around,
I will welcome them with open arms.

517
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,453
And what about your people?
Would they accept ME?

518
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:17,500
And what about my work? What work? Bringing
hot drinks to a lot of randy officers?

519
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:21,880
Look - it comes down to whether
or not you love me. That's all.

520
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:25,258
That's it. The rest is detail.

521
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:31,431
I've written to Vera, spelling out
the case and how she cannot win it.

522
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:34,976
Then I've told her I will be
generous, if she will co-operate.

523
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,646
Are you ready to give her everything?
Because I am.

524
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:43,818
Whatever it takes. I want a clean
break and not an open wound.

525
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:47,030
If we can just be patient
a little while longer.

526
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,869
We shouldn't be outside. It's cold.

527
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:59,000
I'll be patient and bear anything,

528
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:06,925
except for you to go away again.
No. That's done.

529
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:12,472
You're stuck with me now...
for good and proper.

530
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,148
There's something you ought to know.

531
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:27,237
Papa said not to tell you, but I
don't think he's right. Go on.

532
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,783
Matthew's missing.

533
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:35,703
He was on patrol
and he's just sort of... vanished.

534
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:40,583
Papa hasn't told anyone.
Not even Mama.

535
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:45,004
I only know because I was there
when he found out.

536
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,258
It didn't seem right
to keep you in the dark.

537
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,177
I'm not trying to upset you, truly.

538
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,430
For once in my life, I believe you.

539
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:13,241
They've told you, then?
Do they all know downstairs?

540
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,996
William's missing, too. I think
everyone knows except Her Ladyship.

541
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,046
I wish Edith had left it
till the morning.

542
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:24,210
I could have faced it all
with one more night of sleep.

543
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,768
Mind out, this is hot.
Daisy! Spoons!

544
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:37,682
Unless they're to drink
directly from the bowl!

545
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,811
Do you think there's enough?
You could feed about 50, I reckon.

546
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:46,482
Go for the vegetable one.
The vegetable...

547
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:53,114
May we come in?
Your Ladyship... What a surprise.

548
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:58,620
O'Brien seemed to think that you and Mrs Bird were
engaged in a commercial venture of some sort,

549
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:02,165
so I came to see for myself.
We are not, Your Ladyship!

550
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:04,464
I agree
that's not what it looks like.

551
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,254
We feed these men once a week
and I'm not ashamed of it.

552
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:12,634
I'll be back before luncheon
at the big house. I'm sure.

553
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:16,262
But is it true
they are fed from our kitchens?

554
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:20,897
Only the stuff the army gives.
They ARE soldiers.

555
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:25,563
What did I tell you? Daisy's right.
We only use the food the army pay for,

556
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,107
and all the men
have served their country.

557
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:40,161
In future, I would prefer it if you
would use food paid for by the house.

558
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:44,123
I don't want the army
to accuse us of mismanagement.

559
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:48,169
You're going to let them get away
with it? Oh, more than that.

560
00:43:48,206 --> 00:43:50,468
I'm going to help them -
and so are you.

561
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:55,218
Molesley. Ma'am. If you bring that
table over, I suggest we divide the food.

562
00:43:55,254 --> 00:43:57,762
Then we can form two lines
and it will go faster.

563
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:00,640
O'Brien, you can manage the bread.

564
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,768
Daisy? Of course, m'lady.

565
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:06,563
Mmm... What is it?
Beef stew, m'lady.

566
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:09,357
Stand in a line.

567
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:23,288
Sergeant, one moment.

568
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:30,211
I hear you're becoming mighty imperious
in your manner with the staff here.

569
00:44:30,248 --> 00:44:32,297
Er, Daisy in particular.

570
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,427
Just because you're a poacher turned gamekeeper,
there's no need for rudeness. No, sir.

571
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:40,305
So mind what I say.

572
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:43,266
Carry on.

573
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:50,023
I've done as you asked, Mrs Hughes.

574
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:52,650
I think Barrow's taken it on board.

575
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:56,654
He's getting grander than Lady Mary,
and that's saying something!

576
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,993
Lady Grantham.
Hello, Doctor Clarkson.

577
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,968
It was Bates.
I saw him watching you.

578
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:24,933
He must have gone straight to the Major and
sneaked on you the moment your back was turned.

579
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:27,727
Oh, well. Some things never change.

580
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:32,023
Don't worry. He's more vulnerable
than when he was last here.

581
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:37,737
Why?
Because we know more, that's why.

582
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:42,659
Why haven't you told me till now?
I'm not sure.

583
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:45,578
Perhaps I envied your ignorance.

584
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,040
I'm not giving up hope. Not yet.

585
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:54,337
Nor me, of course, but I think
we should start to prepare.

586
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:58,091
Isobel doesn't know?

587
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:00,718
I haven't been able to reach her.

588
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:04,889
Have you said anything to Mary?
Edith's already told me.

589
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:10,478
Has she? Well, I suppose
it was too tempting to resist.

590
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:14,649
Oddly enough, I don't think
she was trying to make trouble.

591
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,112
We ought to go down.
It's time for the concert.

592
00:46:19,148 --> 00:46:21,406
Who cares about the stupid concert?

593
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:24,033
The men do, and we should, too...

594
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:27,787
because we have to keep going,
whatever happens.

595
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:29,873
We have to help each other
to keep going.

596
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:06,451
Cora tells me Matthew's gone
missing. Is that true?

597
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,418
There's no proof of anything yet.
I see.

598
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:13,166
Well, I need more than that
to make me anxious.

599
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,296
I'm glad you would be anxious.
Of course I would be.

600
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:24,385
We're used to Matthew now.
God knows who the next heir will be.

601
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:29,307
Probably a chimneysweep
from Solihull! Huh!

602
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:47,706
Most of you won't know
how rare it is

603
00:47:47,742 --> 00:47:50,870
to see my sister Edith and I
pulling together in a double act...

604
00:47:50,907 --> 00:47:53,003
A unicorn, if ever there was one.

605
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,502
But in wartime we, like all of you, have
more important things to worry about.

606
00:47:58,002 --> 00:48:01,798
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... the Crawley Sisters.

607
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:05,635
Well, now I've seen everything!

608
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:11,850
Sometimes when I feel bad.

609
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:16,271
And things look blue

610
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:22,881
I wish a pal I had.

611
00:48:22,918 --> 00:48:28,157
Say one like you.

612
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,329
Someone within my heart.

613
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:38,376
To build a throne.

614
00:48:39,627 --> 00:48:44,340
Someone who'd never part.

615
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:49,596
To call my own.

616
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,477
If you were the only girl
in the world.

617
00:48:56,514 --> 00:49:01,274
And I were the only boy.

618
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:07,655
Nothing else would matter
in the world today.

619
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:12,952
We could go on loving
in the same old way...

620
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:32,347
Thank God...

621
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,434
My dear boy. My very dear boy!

622
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:45,109
Come on, don't stop for me.

623
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:52,492
I would say
such wonderful things to you.

624
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:59,082
There would be
such wonderful things to do.

625
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:05,129
If you were the only girl
in the world.

626
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:11,427
And I were the only boy.

627
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:25,613
Somehow, we got lost

628
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,034
and then we were trapped behind some
Germans for three days.

629
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,365
When we got out of that, we stumbled
into a field dressing station,

630
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:34,456
where we were immediately admitted.

631
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:37,208
We weren't in any danger,
so they didn't inform our unit.

632
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:40,290
They should have jolly well told us
when you got back to base.

633
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:43,168
I hope you weren't really worried.
Oh, you know us.

634
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:45,425
We like to be sure of our hero
at the front.

635
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:49,674
I beg your pardon, m'lord, but
the Dowager Countess is leaving. Ah.

636
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:57,103
What will you do
with the rest of your leave?

637
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,602
Well, since Mother isn't here, I'll
run up to London and see Lavinia.

638
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,775
I got your letter about Carlisle.
I hope you'll approve.

639
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:11,201
I know you don't like him much now -
I hardly know him,

640
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:15,200
but I'm sure I'll like him when I do.
That's if he's good to you.

641
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:18,286
If he's not,
he'll have me to answer to.

642
00:51:25,835 --> 00:51:29,547
Who'd have thought an amateur concert
could be the summit of all joy?

643
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:32,467
I've lived in such a fog of misery
since I left you,

644
00:51:33,092 --> 00:51:36,012
I think I'd forgotten what happiness
is. Me, too.

645
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,974
But now we must get used to feeling
happy... and trust it.

646
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:42,519
God, I want to.

647
00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:50,902
Love's young dream?
I don't think!

648
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,947
I'm not sure I care much.

649
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:56,658
Are you going soft in your old age?

650
00:51:56,991 --> 00:52:00,703
I don't like him - he's a patronizing
bastard who sneaks behind my back,

651
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,373
but I've got other things to worry
about. Really?

652
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:05,964
That's interesting. Why?

653
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,711
Because obviously,
I hold a grudge longer than you.

654
00:52:10,338 --> 00:52:13,883
I knew nothing bad had happened.
I felt it in my waters!

655
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:17,846
What about you?
Did you have me boxed up and buried?

656
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,057
I am glad you're all right, honest.
You should be.

657
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,185
It's the thought of you
that keeps me going.

658
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:41,953
Hello? Hello?

659
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:56,509
Ethel? What on earth
are you doing here?

660
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:58,887
I had to come, Mrs Hughes.

661
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:04,517
I'm sorry to push in, but I was sitting
alone until I couldn't stand it no more.

662
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:08,062
You've got to help me.
I haven't "got to" do anything!

663
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,065
But what do you mean?
Help with what?

664
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:14,402
Is this about Major Bryant?

665
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,535
I blame myself for not stepping in
earlier - that I will admit.

666
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,539
How long had it been going on?

667
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,878
Long enough to get me pregnant.

668
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:35,673
Mrs Hughes, I'm going to have a baby.

669
00:53:36,305 --> 00:54:36,383

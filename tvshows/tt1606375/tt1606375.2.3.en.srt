2
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,204
Should we give them
some more space between the beds?

3
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,289
Well, we could give them...
Not much.

4
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,917
I'm determined to defend the library
as a recreation room.

5
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,502
Where are we to sit?

6
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,504
We can screen off the small library.

7
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,005
- Is that all?
- I suppose...

8
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,967
Or we could leave you the boudoir. I
wanted to put the intermediaries in there,

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,677
but we don't have to.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,803
How kind.

11
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,306
Why will we only have officers?

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,475
Surely all wounded men need to convalesce.

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,143
The hospital is for officers

14
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,146
and the whole idea is to have
a complementary convalescent home.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,900
Of course. But I don't know
if we can make that an absolute rule.

16
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,862
If the world were logical,
I would rather agree with you.

17
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,572
Which comes as no surprise.

18
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,657
You would not, I imagine.

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,701
You imagine right.

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,745
What these men will need
is rest and relaxation.

21
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:23,750
Will that be achieved by mixing ranks
and putting everyone on edge?

22
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,965
- Granny.
- Mmm...

23
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,968
Different ranks can relax together.
It has been known.

24
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,762
Well, don't look at me.
I'm very good at mixing.

25
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,933
We always danced the first waltz
at the Servants' Ball, didn't we, Carson?

26
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,143
It was an honor, milady.

27
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,605
It's a lot to ask
when people aren't at their best.

28
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,152
I'm searching for Lady Mary, Carson.
Will you tell her I'm in the library?

29
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,906
Don't loiter, Edith
. There's plenty to be done.

30
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,993
- Of course, but I'm not quite sure what...
- Sybil, I wanted to have a quick word...

31
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,626
I'm going down to the village
this afternoon if anyone wants anything.

32
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,379
Some stamps would be kind,
I'll get you the money.

33
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,007
I'd like to thank you all
for your work this morning.

34
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,344
It's so strange to see the rooms
converted into dormitories.

35
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,138
But good.
It was wrong for our life to chug along

36
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,057
as if the war
were only happening to other people.

37
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,268
How will it be, though?
Are we all working for Mrs Crawley now?

38
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,686
We are not!

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,482
I'm sure the chain of command
will be sorted out soon.

40
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,150
Or there'll be blood on the stairs.

41
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,069
Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

42
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,909
But what do you think it meant?

43
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,912
Really, Granny,
Lavinia Swire knows Richard Carlisle.

44
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,706
So what?
One knows lots of people in London.

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,085
I don't know many people
who'd threaten me behind the laurels.

46
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,797
Aunt Rosamund said herself
she didn't know what to make of it.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,425
I still think it's a peculiar way
for a gentleman to speak to a lady.

48
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,469
At least you think him a gentleman.

49
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,681
The point is, do you
think he's a gentleman?

50
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,934
I'm not sure it matters much to me.

51
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,647
Well, I'm going up to London
to stay with Rosamund for a day or two.

52
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,649
I think we'll have Lavinia for tea.

53
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,193
You sound as if
you're going to gobble her up.

54
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,529
If only we could.

55
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,741
But where are they going to eat?

56
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,203
I understand from Mrs Crawley
that they'll share the dining room

57
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,205
with the officers who are almost well.

58
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,417
So am I running a canteen now?

59
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,752
William says he's got time off

60
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,046
between the end of his training
and going overseas.

61
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,174
He'll be with his father, surely?

62
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,010
He's going home first, but he wants
to come here for his last night.

63
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,221
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, Mr Carson?

64
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,683
Certainly not.
I'd be glad to wish him well on his way.

65
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,059
Oh, for you, Mr Branson.

66
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,649
Why do you think he's coming here?

67
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,611
To see us all and say goodbye.
What's wrong with that?

68
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,613
But suppose it's something more.

69
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,281
Suppose he's got plans.

70
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,992
Well, you have to deal with that
when it happens.

71
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,328
And mind you deal fair.

72
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,539
Now go and grate that suet
before I grow old and die.

73
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,453
Who will be in charge?

74
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,288
Cousin Isobel thinks it'll be her.

75
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,458
All I know is that
she'll drive us mad before the end...

76
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,962
- I'm going up to change.
- I just want to finish this.

77
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,842
Aren't you going to the hospital?
Not yet.

78
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,928
I'm on a night shift.
I'll walk down after dinner.

79
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,474
- And please don't start lecturing me.
- I won't.

80
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,060
The truth is I envy you.

81
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,273
Do you ever miss helping out
on the Drakes' farm?

82
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,024
That's a funny question.

83
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,069
- Why?
- NO reason.

84
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,780
It's just you seemed
to have such a purpose there.

85
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,408
It suited you.

86
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,034
It did suit me.

87
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,497
I enjoyed it, but now I
feel like a spare part.

88
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,165
Trust me.

89
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,209
You have a talent
that none of the rest of us have.

90
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,130
Just find out what it is and use it.

91
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,048
It's doing nothing that's the enemy.

92
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,725
The truth is, milady, Mrs Crawley
has forgotten this is your house.

93
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,021
And we need a friend in charge
of the day-to-day management.

94
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,357
Because if Mrs Crawley
gets one of her toadies in to run things,

95
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,235
she'll have her nose in every pie
before you can say Jack Robinson.

96
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,361
But who?

97
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,740
What about Thomas, milady?

98
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,244
He's hospital trained and he's
always had a soft spot for Downton.

99
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,164
Thomas, the footman?

100
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,208
Managing Downton Abbey?

101
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,335
But he's not a footman, now, is he?

102
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,672
He's a Corporal,
with real battle experience as a medic.

103
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,341
Could Doctor Clarkson spare him?

104
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,053
Well, I suppose
he'll have to spare somebody...

105
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,562
Are you all right?

106
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,606
You seem a bit preoccupied.

107
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,944
I had a... No, never mind.

108
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,904
What?

109
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,243
It was this afternoon, in the village.

110
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,038
I thought I saw Mr Bates.

111
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,249
Bates? Isn't he in London?

112
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,335
I might have been wrong.

113
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,963
I walked over to where he was standing
and there was no sign of him.

114
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,048
Do you know his address in London?

115
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,509
As long as he's still there. Why?

116
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,887
I'll telephone Sir Richard
and ask him to look into it.

117
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,305
But what would he know?

118
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,140
He works in newspapers,

119
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,853
a world of spies, tip-offs
and private investigators.

120
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,856
I promise you,
he can find out whatever he likes.

121
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,317
All right, then. If you think he can help.

122
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,986
Good.

123
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,446
I'll ring him tonight.

124
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,159
Not bad. Try to fit in a bit of practice.

125
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:35,163
We've plenty of time to get it right before
there's anyone to see me who matters.

126
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,962
I only know Sir Richard because he is...

127
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:47,050
Or was, a friend of my father's
and of my uncle, Jonathan Swire.

128
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,887
The Liberal minister?
That's it.

129
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,349
- But I'm afraid they've fallen out.
- Oh.

130
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,813
This room is so pretty.

131
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,690
Has the house always been
the Painswicks' London home?

132
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,610
There's no "always"
about the Painswicks, my dear.

133
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,238
They were invented from scratch
by my son-in-law's grandfather.

134
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,282
We bought the house when we were married.

135
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,161
You make Mr Painswick sound
rather a rough diamond, Lady Grantham.

136
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,289
Marmaduke wasn't a rough diamond,
was he, Mama?

137
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,542
No. He was just out and polished
comparatively recently.

138
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,467
Carson's told Papa you've been called up.

139
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,136
There's no need to look so serious.

140
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,472
You'd think me rather
heartless if I didn't.

141
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,390
I'm not going to fight.

142
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,644
- You'll have to.
- I will not.

143
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,562
I'm going to be a "conscientious objector".

144
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,606
They'll put you in prison.

145
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,067
I'd rather prison than the Dardanelles.

146
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,487
- When will you tell them?
- In my own good time.

147
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,533
I don't understand.

148
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:58,455
I'll go to the medical, I'll report
for duty and when on parade,

149
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,208
I'll march out front
and I'll shout it loud and clear.

150
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,545
And if that doesn't make the newspapers,
then I'm a monkey's uncle.

151
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,006
But you'll have a record
for the rest of your life.

152
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,760
At least I'll have a life.

153
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,769
I know the popular fantasy
is that you can feed six strong men from

154
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,481
...a single seed cake,
but you and I know better.

155
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,233
Have we got the flour for any more?

156
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,026
Go and check now. Right.

157
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,701
Cheer up. It's not as bad as that.

158
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,954
What's the matter, Mr Lang?

159
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,623
Tell me. I won't bite.

160
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:48,005
I sometimes feel I'm the only one
who knows what's going on over there.

161
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,843
You all wander around ironing clothes
and cleaning boots

162
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,305
and choosing what's for dinner,
while, over the Channel,

163
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,224
men are killed and maimed

164
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,518
and blown to pieces.

165
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,312
We know more than you think.

166
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,983
The war hasn't left us alone, it hasn't
left me alone, however it may look.

167
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,861
Have you any idea

168
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,614
how scared they are?

169
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,284
How scared they all are?

170
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,872
I lost my nephew,

171
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,957
my sister's boy.

172
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,251
He was shot...

173
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,463
for cowardice.

174
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,758
That's what they said.

175
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:37,137
But I knew him
and he'd never have done such a thing

176
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,807
if he hadn't been
half out of his mind with fear.

177
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,852
Don't blame him.

178
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,272
It was him, but it could have been me.

179
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,736
It could have been any of us.

180
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,535
Suppose
I don't want to come back?

181
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,579
To be in charge?
Telling Mr Carson what to do?

182
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,832
Why? What's in it for you?

183
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,962
All right. It's to stop Mrs Crawley
bossing Her Ladyship about.

184
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,798
She behaves as if she owns the place.

185
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,383
You've changed your tune.

186
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,176
When I were last here,

187
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,262
you'd have given money
to see Her Ladyship eat dirt.

188
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,890
Well, like you say,
I've changed me tune. People do.

189
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,226
Not without a reason.

190
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,520
I've got me reasons.

191
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,565
You've also got Her Ladyship
wrapped round your little finger.

192
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,900
Maybe. That's my business.

193
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,027
But I'll not hurt her,

194
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,739
and I'll not let anyone
else hurt her, neither.

195
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,449
That's all I've got to say.

196
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,744
You're a queer one and no mistake.

197
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,747
So will you come if I can fix it?

198
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,334
Why not?

199
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,796
I like the idea of giving
orders to old Carson.

200
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,720
I go away for five minutes
and everything's settled.

201
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,305
Nothing's settled.

202
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,350
For a start, which rooms will we live in?

203
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,477
The small library and the boudoir.

204
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,565
If Cousin Isobel can find somewhere else
for the "intermediaries".

205
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,818
There's always the boot room.
I'm sure you'll have use of that!

206
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,487
And where are we supposed to eat?

207
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,615
You can share the dining room
with those officers...

208
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,741
No.

209
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,410
- We all have to make sacrifices...
- No.

210
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,121
Then we'll have tables
set up in the great hall

211
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,415
for the mobile officers and for the nurses.

212
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,960
And, Lady Grantham,
I know you'll be happy about one decision.

213
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,422
Lady Grantham asked
that the house management

214
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,549
might be put into the hands
of Corporal Barrow.

215
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,511
Your former footman, Thomas.

216
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,097
Thomas? In charge of Downton?

217
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:48,268
No, that's what I thought at first.
But he isn't a footman now. He's a soldier.

218
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,978
He's worked in medicine.

219
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,856
The point is, someone has to run the place
who's had medical training.

220
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,191
But I really feel...

221
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,401
The men won't accept
the authority of a corporal.

222
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,861
I've thought of that.

223
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,238
I told my Commanding Officer

224
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,990
that Lady Grantham
had asked for Corporal Barrow

225
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,077
and he's prepared to have him raised
to the rank of Acting Sergeant.

226
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,120
- But can you spare him?
- We can.

227
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,332
I've gone to some trouble to do so.

228
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,918
Sergeant Barrow will manage
the daily running of Downton

229
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,920
and I shall be in overall charge.

230
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,381
But you have the hospital.
Aren't we missing a tier?

231
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,841
Surely there should be
someone here permanently

232
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,384
who is under you but over Thomas?

233
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,220
That's correct,
and I will make a decision before long.

234
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,933
Until then, I do assure you,
Corporal Barrow is very efficient.

235
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,686
I say good.

236
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,731
If someone's to manage things,
let it be our creature.

237
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,359
Why? Are you planning
to divide his loyalties?

238
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,737
I wouldn't say I was planning it.

239
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,784
William has asked
to stay here, milord, just for a night.

240
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,371
On his way to active duty in France.
Good. I should like to see him.

241
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,709
I don't suppose there's any way
we can keep him from harm?

242
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,878
Him being an only child and all.

243
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,339
We'd hate for anything to happen.

244
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,341
Thank you, Lang. I can do the rest.

245
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,428
Very sorry, milord.

246
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,229
To get back to the notion of Thomas
as the manager of Downton.

247
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:18,775
He won't be a manager in that sense.
But Her Ladyship fixed it all with Clarkson

248
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,528
and she was so pleased
I didn't know what to say.

249
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,282
"I cannot have him working here
because he is a thief."

250
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:30,078
You know she's ignorant of Thomas' crimes.
We agreed at the time that would be best.

251
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:35,501
And anyway, is it honorable in us
to hold Thomas' sins against him

252
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,086
when he has been wounded
in the service of the King?

253
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,631
And who is to be in charge over Thomas?

254
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,926
You mean under Dr Clarkson?

255
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,803
Well, we asked today,
but he hasn't decided.

256
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,847
So we just make it up as we go along?

257
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,100
Unless you've got a better idea.

258
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,815
Are you still here, Mr Branson?

259
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,901
Why don't you stay
and have something to eat?

260
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,570
Mr Branson's been telling us
the news from Russia.

261
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,030
What news is that?

262
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:09,117
Kerensky's been made Prime Minister,
but he won't go far enough for me.

263
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,954
Lenin denounces the bourgeoisie
along with the Tsar.

264
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,332
He wants a people's revolution
and that's what I'm waiting for.

265
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,044
- It won't be long now.
- And what's happened to the Tsar?

266
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,840
Imprisoned in the Alexander Palace
with all his family.

267
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,508
What a dreadful thing.

268
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,969
They won't hurt them. Why would they?

269
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,012
To make an example?

270
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:33,892
Give them some credit. This is a
new dawn, a new age of government.

271
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,646
No one wants to start it
with the murder of a bunch of young girls.

272
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,356
You don't know that.

273
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,734
Nobody knows who'll get killed
when these things start.

274
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,612
Look at her nephew. Shot for cowardice.

275
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,074
Who'd have guessed that
when he was saying hello to the neighbors?

276
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,618
Or kissing his mother goodnight?

277
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,412
Can you look at the crumble?

278
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,123
I think it should come out, but it's
five minutes earlier than you said...

279
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,548
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,926
- I never thought...
- Then you should think, Mr Lang.

281
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,346
You're not the only member
of the walking wounded in this house.

282
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:41,043
- Why are you coming in this way?
- I'm the manager here now, Mr Carson.

283
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,128
Or had you forgotten?

284
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,923
No. I had not forgotten.

285
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:50,719
And will you be moving into your old room
or should we prepare a guest bedroom?

286
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,222
I'll sleep in my old room, thanks.

287
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:59,311
So, are we ready for the big invasion?

288
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:03,565
- 'Cause they'll be here at tea time.
- We'll have to be ready, won't we, Thomas?

289
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:08,654
We will, Mr Carson.
And it's Sergeant Barrow, now.

290
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,198
"“Acting" Sergeant, I believe.

291
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,636
Quick as you can, gentlemen.

292
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:22,144
Driver, when you've finished unloading
here, go straight back to the hospital

293
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,271
and find Orderly Wainwright...
This way, please, gentlemen.

294
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,823
Don't worry. We'll get you seen to quickly.

295
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,373
Major Bryant, you're in the Armada Bedroom.

296
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,710
- Do you mind the stairs?
- It depends what I find at the top.

297
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,061
- He's handsome.
- Handsome and off limits.

298
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,396
It'll be nice
to have the house full of men.

299
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:10,484
Full of officers. Officers aren't men.
Not where we're concerned.

300
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,152
Oh, speak for yourself.

301
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,988
I speak for you, too,
if you know what's good for you.

302
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,493
I'm very sorry but I...

303
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,581
Matthew!
What in the world are you doing here?

304
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,917
We start our tour of Yorkshire
and Lancashire tomorrow

305
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,837
and General Strutt knew you lived up here,
so he's given me a few hours off.

306
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,255
What a lovely...

307
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,257
lovely surprise.

308
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:37,719
Mrs Crawley, how can we separate
the hospital's linen from our own?

309
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,597
You go. We'll talk later.

310
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,268
As soon as I've done this,
I'll take your orders for books.

311
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,944
I hadn't cast you as Florence Nightingale.

312
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,197
We can't leave
all the moral high ground to Sybil.

313
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,866
She might get lonely there.

314
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,830
How are you?
I know I mustn't ask you what you're doing.

315
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,832
You can ask what I'm doing in Downton.

316
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,584
We've finished in the Midlands

317
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,586
and tomorrow we start on the camps
in the northern counties.

318
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,005
Ah. Will we see something of you?

319
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,673
I think my general ought to come here.

320
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,050
It's exactly the sort of thing
people like to read about.

321
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,635
Sybil...

322
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,304
Come. Edith can do that.

323
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,974
Dear Mother. She does
love a bit of authority.

324
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,102
I suppose she's driving Cousin Cora mad?

325
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,146
No names, no pack drill.

326
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,024
Breathe in.

327
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,986
And out.

328
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,908
I'm surprised
they didn't get to you before now.

329
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,327
Some people have all the luck, sir.

330
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,287
You can get dressed.

331
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,249
Shall I report for duty in Richmond?

332
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,335
You'll be told what to do.

333
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,883
But I must supervise the medical staff.

334
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,468
Overseen by me.

335
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,929
And, Carson, I'm relying on you
to make sure that that is so.

336
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,514
What is going on?

337
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,017
I was arranging the household duties.

338
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,353
Where they overlap
with the duties of the nursing staff.

339
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,772
Shall we continue this upstairs?

340
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,358
Well, I've made some charts and...

341
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,403
Of course.

342
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,828
Did you say you were the manager?
Or the referee?

343
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,582
- You can see what we're up against-
- Don't worry. We'll find a solution.

344
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,299
You take over every room in the house,
you bark at me like a sergeant major

345
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:41,677
- and you give orders to my servants!
- Cora, I'm sure...

346
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,720
I'm sorry.
Are you in the middle of something?

347
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,348
We're discussing the arrangements.

348
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,518
Oh, good. Because we've had a letter
from Evelyn Napier.

349
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,311
He's in a hospital in Middlesbrough

350
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,480
and he's heard
that we're a convalescent home now,

351
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,149
and wonders if he can come here
once he's released.

352
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,693
Of course he can come here.

353
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,279
- Well, now, just a minute.
- There's no question of him coming here.

354
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,281
What? The Middlesbrough General

355
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,825
will have their own arrangements
for where their patients convalesce.

356
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,410
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley is right.

357
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,996
Downton must function
as part of the official system

358
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,664
or it cannot function at all.

359
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,292
Now, I think perhaps
I should make one thing clear.

360
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,211
Downton is our house and our home

361
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:19,631
and we will welcome in it
any friends or relations we choose.

362
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,675
And if you do not care
to accept that condition,

363
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,094
then I suggest you give orders
for the nurses and the patients

364
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:27,598
and the beds and the rest of it
to be packed up and shipped out at once!

365
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:34,980
Thank you, Lord Grantham,
for making your position so clear.

366
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,610
Oh, just one more thing. The dog.

367
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:44,281
What should we do to stop
Isis getting into the patients' rooms?

368
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,866
I can answer that...

369
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,868
Absolutely nothing!

370
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,620
Ah.

371
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,044
Anna, there you are.
Ethel, could you leave us for a moment?

372
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,802
That was Sir Richard on the telephone.

373
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,888
It might have been Bates
you saw in the village.

374
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,265
Really?

375
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,769
He's working up here at a pub.
The Red Lion in Kirkbymoorside.

376
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:16,980
That's odd.

377
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,483
Mr Bates in a pub?

378
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,694
The question's what'll you do
with the information now you've got it?

379
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,430
Could you take this
into the hall for me?

380
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,307
Of course.

381
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,894
Are you waiting for Papa?
Do you want me to go and find him?

382
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,480
They turned me down.

383
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,732
The army.

384
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,779
- Why?
- Apparently, I have a heart murmur.

385
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,657
Or to be more precise,

386
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:14,580
"A mitral valve prolapse
is causing a pansystolic murmur."

387
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,294
I don't know what to say. Is it dangerous?

388
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,547
Only if you're planning
to humiliate the British Army.

389
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,800
I suppose you're glad.

390
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,261
You're not going to be killed
and you're not going to go to prison.

391
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,762
Of course I'm glad.

392
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,931
Don't count your chickens.

393
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,725
If I don't get them one way,
I'll get them another.

394
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,728
Why do you have to be
so angry all the time?

395
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,189
I know we weren't exactly
at our best in Ireland...

396
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,732
"Not at your best"?

397
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,610
"Not at your best"?

398
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,656
I lost a cousin in the
Easter Rising last year.

399
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,910
- You never said.
- Well, I'm saying it now.

400
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,329
He was walking down
North King Street one day

401
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,165
and an English soldier saw him
and shot him dead.

402
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,126
When they asked why he was killed,
the officer said,

403
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,504
"Because he was probably a rebel."

404
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,673
So don't say you were "not at your best"!

405
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:10,260
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
but we're going to have to step on it.

406
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:38,497
I'm not sure about Marryat.
I know we've got lots of G. A. Henty.

407
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,459
And I haven't forgotten
about your tobacco, Captain Ames.

408
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,795
Just as soon as I can get into the village.

409
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:53,011
I'm not sure at all.
I think a bit of it might have come loose.

410
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:58,141
- Is that better?
- Much.

411
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,352
But I may need some more tucking very soon.

412
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,730
Well, no one tucks better than I do.

413
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,566
Ethel!

414
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:09,319
Go back inside, please.
There are still more bedrooms to be done.

415
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,334
Rosamund's going to find out.

416
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,337
She knows
some of those feeble-minded idiots

417
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,922
on the Liberal front bench.

418
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,091
Poor Lavinia. I feel sorry for her.

419
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:36,180
She's an obstacle to your happiness, dear,
and must be removed.

420
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,766
When it's done,
you can feel as sorry as you wish.

421
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,645
But even if Matthew does break it off with
her, why should he propose to me again?

422
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,274
With your permission, dear,
I will take my fences one at a time.

423
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,948
Any plans for your afternoon off?

424
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,372
Major Bryant wants me to go to the pictures
in York with him when he's allowed out.

425
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,209
But you'll say that's stupid.

426
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,795
Not stupid. Insane.

427
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,381
Oh, he really likes me though.

428
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,051
He says he wants to get to know me better.

429
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,054
Has he told you
how he's planning to achieve it?

430
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,389
Spoilsport.

431
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:22,809
What are you up to?

432
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,689
Just practicing with these for Lady Mary.
I promised her I would.

433
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,611
That's one and eight, altogether.
There you go.

434
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,405
Might I have a glass of cider?

435
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,618
Thank you.

436
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,963
I don't know if I've dreaded this moment
or longed for it.

437
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,427
Well, either way, it's happened.

438
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,311
I'm glad I'm in time
for tomorrow's state visit.

439
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:48,812
I gather Lavinia will be there.

440
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:51,481
We must seize the opportunity
to challenge her.

441
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,567
I don't really see on what basis.

442
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,695
She stole secrets from her uncle,
Jonathan Swire,

443
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,114
and gave them to Carlisle to publish.
Swire told me.

444
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,909
And the papers showed that half the
Cabinet were trying to get rich

445
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:05,078
by buying shares before
a government contract was announced.

446
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,497
Would you rather we were kept in ignorance?

447
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,666
It wasn't Lavinia's
business to make it public.

448
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,753
Without her, the Marconi scandal
would never have happened.

449
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:16,507
The politicians broke the law.
Lavinia did nothing wrong.

450
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:20,427
She drags the Chancellor of the Exchequer's
honor through the mud

451
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:21,553
and you say it's nothing!

452
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,180
It was only Lloyd George.

453
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,892
But why did she betray her uncle
to Sir Richard in the first place?

454
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,353
Because they were lovers. Ooh.

455
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,855
Exactly.

456
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,191
And now it is down to you
to save Matthew

457
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,693
from the clutches of a scheming harlot!

458
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:40,697
Really, Rosamund,
there's no need to be so gleeful.

459
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:44,451
You sound like Robespierre
lopping off the head of Marie-Antoinette.

460
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,374
It was me.

461
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,294
I knew you used to go into the village
on a Wednesday.

462
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,548
I so longed for a glimpse of you.

463
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,301
But why are you up here at all?

464
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,720
And why didn't you tell me?

465
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,014
Because I want to get things settled first.

466
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:10,185
You see, I've discovered that Vera
has been unfaithful to me.

467
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,770
I've got proof.

468
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,064
We can't criticize her for that.

469
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:16,108
No. But it means I can divorce her.

470
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,319
I've had to leave the house
to prove that it has broken the marriage.

471
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,739
So I came up here to be nearer you.

472
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,576
- But what if she fights it?
- She can't.

473
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,746
For her to divorce me,
she needs something beyond adultery,

474
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,833
cruelty or suchlike.

475
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,835
For a husband, adultery is enough.

476
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,423
- That's not very fair to women.
- I don't care about fairness, I care about you.

477
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,760
The point is, I can get rid of her.

478
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,347
If she goes quietly,
I will give her money and plenty of it.

479
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,474
If not, she leaves empty-handed.

480
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,727
And when will this be?

481
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,521
I need to get her to accept it first.

482
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,318
She's made threats
about selling stuff to the papers.

483
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:04,489
- What stuff?
- Don't worry. They won't offer what I will.

484
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,535
You've changed your hair.

485
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:12,956
I was trying out Lady
Mary's new curling iron.

486
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,669
What do you think?

487
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:23,217
I think I would love you,
however, whatever, whenever.

488
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:28,305
We don't have to wait, you know.

489
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:33,852
If you want me to throw up everything
and come with you, I will. Gladly.

490
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:38,106
I can't marry you yet, not legally,
and I won't break the law.

491
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,152
It's not against the law
to take a mistress, Mr Bates.

492
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,624
I know you, Anna Smith, and I love you,
and that is not the right path for you.

493
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,795
It won't be long now.

494
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,643
So, you're not going to war then?

495
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,937
Apparently not.

496
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:22,025
Is it true about Mr Crawley
bringing a famous general here?

497
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:25,195
Captain Crawley, but yes. Why?

498
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,866
No reason.

499
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,745
If they arrive at 5:00,
we'll walk him round the wards,

500
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,123
then show him the recovering men at play

501
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,168
and after that a fairly grand dinner.
I'll tell them to bring mess kit.

502
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,336
That is my challenge, milord.

503
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,965
How to make the dinner sufficiently grand
with no footmen in the house.

504
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,092
Plenty of people give dinners
without footmen.

505
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,638
Not people who entertain Sir
Herbert Strutt, hero of the Somme.

506
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,142
I'm sure he'll have seen
worse things at the front

507
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,060
than a dinner with no footmen.

508
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,605
Carson only wants to show the general
proper respect.

509
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:02,858
We will not criticize him for that.
Indeed we will not.

510
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,319
But I think Lord Grantham's plan
is a good one,

511
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,196
with or without footmen.

512
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,824
Matthew writes Miss Swire
is coming down from London for it.

513
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,702
Really? He never said so to me.

514
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,871
Does he need your permission?

515
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,959
I think I should go round with him.

516
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,879
You and Lady Grantham
will both come with us.

517
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,465
But won't he want to talk about treatments?

518
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,426
The treatments and the house.

519
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,608
Miss?

520
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,655
It's Captain Smiley, isn't it?

521
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:53,825
We haven't met yet, but I'm Edith Crawley,

522
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:56,078
and tomorrow I can show you
where everything is.

523
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,623
It's just that I'd like to write a letter
to my parents.

524
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:03,627
Of course.
There's paper and envelopes in the library.

525
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:08,298
No. You see, I've not written before
because I didn't want to worry my mother

526
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:09,675
with the different handwriting.

527
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,726
I'm left-handed. How's that for luck?

528
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,731
I'm surprised your school
didn't force you to use the right.

529
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,694
My mother wouldn't let them,
but now I wish they had.

530
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,240
I've asked the others
and they say you're the one to help me.

531
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:36,493
Of course I will. I'd be happy to.

532
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,162
That's what they said.

533
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:44,418
If you can just find a way to tell her?

534
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,172
We'll both find a way.

535
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,424
Together. I promise.

536
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,347
Mr Carson, might I have a word?

537
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,601
I'm busy with this dinner
for tomorrow night.

538
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,936
Well, that's just it.

539
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,522
I don't expect you'll be using Mr Lang.
Not after last time.

540
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,318
- I will not.
- So I wondered if I might be any help.

541
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,695
I've waited at table before.

542
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:16,074
Do you mean it? I know I've no
right to ask it of a chauffeur.

543
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,203
We have to keep up the honor of Downton,
don't we?

544
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:24,333
I'm very grateful, Mr Branson.
I'll not hide it. Very grateful, indeed.

545
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,793
- You know where to find a livery?
- I do.

546
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:30,380
And I gather you won't be leaving us,
after all?

547
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,718
Who knows what the future will bring?

548
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,188
Mrs Hughes? What is it?

549
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,481
Who's shouting?

550
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,233
What's going on?
I'm about to find out.

551
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,692
It's Mr Lang.

552
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,612
What in heaven's name's happening?

553
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,281
No! No, I can't do it!

554
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,742
Mr Lang. Mr Lang wake up...
I can't do it!

555
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,577
You're having a bad dream, Mr Lang!

556
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,663
- You're having a dream.
- It's the soldiers, Mr Carson.

557
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:06,583
It's the soldiers, but I can't.
I can't go back, no matter what...

558
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:10,128
- No one's asking you to go back, Mr Lang.
- No. Just to put a sock in it.

559
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:12,673
Don't worry, Mr Lang.
You've had a bad dream, that's all.

560
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,761
Is it a dream?

561
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,641
Thank God.

562
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,437
Oh, thank God.

563
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,149
- Thank God.
- You're all right.

564
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:33,277
Let's get you back into bed.

565
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,779
You're all right.

566
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:40,284
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Mr Lang.

567
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,287
- I'm sorry.
- You're all right.

568
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,958
Is it any wonder
when he's been to hell and back?

569
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,137
Up.

570
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,556
UP...

571
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:21,658
My cousin, Lord Grantham.

572
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,368
This is very kind of you, Lord Grantham.

573
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,120
- Welcome.
- Lady Grantham.

574
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:29,750
And this is Major Clarkson,
who runs our hospital here.

575
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,962
And I am Captain Crawley's mother,
and will accompany you on your tour

576
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:37,007
and explain the different levels
of care we practice here.

577
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:41,178
Lady Grantham and Mrs Crawley
will both accompany us as we go round, sir.

578
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:44,014
Makes a nice change
from the craggy-faced warriors

579
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,307
I'm usually surrounded by.

580
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,100
I'd like to think that were true.

581
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:50,145
Please, come this way.
There's a large recreational...

582
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,855
I don't believe
you've ever been to Downton before...

583
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,483
Poor Mother.
How she longs to hold all the reins.

584
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,318
Crawley!

585
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,739
I should go, if only to keep
our respective mothers apart.

586
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:06,161
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley's none too pleased
to play second fiddle, sir.

587
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:08,038
Well, I hope she doesn't spoil things.

588
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:11,124
Well, that's just what I've been
meaning to talk to you about, sir.

589
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,335
You see, I'm trying to run a tight ship...

590
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,302
What's the matter with your aunt?

591
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:25,848
We should follow them in
or Mama will say we're unsupportive.

592
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,891
Tell me what it is, please.

593
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:30,894
All right.

594
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,563
I know he's going to propose.

595
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:36,567
Well, then you're going to accept.
Did you get that picture taken?

596
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,777
- I did, yeah, but...
- Then fetch it.

597
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,445
Because if you think I'm gonna stand by

598
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,656
and watch that boy's dreams
stamped in the dust,

599
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,616
you've got another think coming.

600
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,745
You can take back your promise
when the war's over and not before!

601
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:50,831
But it's a lie!

602
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:54,251
Don't make him give up
when he's off to face the guns.

603
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:57,087
You'd never forgive yourself
if aught happened.

604
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,091
Do you remember when Aunt Rosamund

605
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:04,011
found you and Richard Carlisle
together in the garden?

606
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,430
I knew I'd hear more about that.

607
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,682
She thought he was threatening you.

608
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:14,104
And now she's decided that you were behind
the Marconi share scandal in 1912.

609
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:18,275
The Chancellor and other ministers
were involved, including your uncle.

610
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:20,611
I remember the Marconi scandal.

611
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:23,197
No. Let's forget it. It's absurd.

612
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,199
But Lady Rosamund is right.

613
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,453
I did steal the evidence
for Sir Richard to print.

614
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,206
I did start the scandal.

615
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:34,875
The trouble is.

616
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,794
Aunt Rosamund can't understand
why you would do such a thing

617
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,048
unless you and Sir Richard were...

618
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,800
Were lovers.
Mary, you must come.

619
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,392
The ground-floor rooms are for those men
who need the most care, sir.

620
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:53,727
Yes, of course.

621
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,062
General Strutt, sir.

622
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,566
Oh, right. Yes.

623
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:01,735
Tell me about this officer.

624
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:05,489
Who is that man?
I hope he's not complaining.

625
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:10,285
Oh, no. That's Captain Smiley.
He hasn't an unkind bone in his body.

626
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,412
How do you know?

627
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:14,790
Matthew, listen to this.

628
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:16,667
Everything all right, sir?

629
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,335
What on earth is that about?

630
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,838
Oh, don't worry.
Major Holmes can be a little waspish,

631
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:23,465
but he wouldn't want to
get us into trouble.

632
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:28,095
How do you know so much
about a pack of strangers?

633
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,597
They're not strangers to me.

634
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,268
This is all very impressive, Lady Grantham.

635
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,187
The nurses and your own staff
are to be congratulated.

636
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,274
I believe they are.

637
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:46,947
I wouldn't say I was scared. I'm nervous.
Of course I am...

638
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:51,410
But not scared. I think I'm ready.

639
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:54,079
Don't mind me.

640
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,999
Only I'm thinking
of what your dear mother would say.

641
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,127
Well, I wish she was here to see me off.

642
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,504
Oh, she'd be so proud.

643
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:07,384
Why, when we waved off our Archie,
I remember...

644
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:13,849
What do you remember, Mrs Patmore?
I'll tell you.

645
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:19,229
You remember a fine young man,
who enlisted before he had to,

646
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,607
and who gave his life for his country.

647
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:25,861
Because he'd be alive and well today
if he hadn't chosen to go to war.

648
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:27,821
She's right.

649
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:29,823
Happen she is.

650
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:33,160
Come on, Daisy. Back to the grindstone.

651
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,830
- What is it?
- I just want a word with Daisy.

652
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,208
I'm needed in the kitchen.

653
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,836
There's plenty of time later on.

654
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:50,260
Let's see what my aim is like.

655
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:51,929
- And again.
- Oh.

656
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,515
You must be enjoying
your respite from the front.

657
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,225
Actually, I'm struggling a bit.

658
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:58,936
I've just lost my soldier servant
and I haven't managed to replace him yet.

659
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,606
So when will you tell Matthew?

660
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:05,484
Dinner is served, milady.

661
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,528
Don't waste the opportunity.

662
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,869
Why must she be so savage?
It's my broken heart.

663
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:18,247
And it was her advice
that wrecked it in the first place.

664
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,414
It's classic Rosamund.

665
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:22,459
She's never more righteous
than when she's in the wrong.

666
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:23,919
Come on.

667
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:29,049
- Everything all right, Mr Branson?
- I think so, Mrs Hughes.

668
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,363
- Where's Mr Branson?
- He's just taken up the soup. Why?

669
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,823
Read that!

670
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:38,911
"They'll have arrested me by now,
but I'm not sorry."

671
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:41,830
"The bastard had it coming to him."

672
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:45,334
Oh!

673
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:51,924
What in God's name!

674
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,175
Read this!

675
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,222
Where is he now?

676
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,348
Oh, my God!

677
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:14,279
I'm sorry to hear about your servant.

678
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:18,116
Yes, pneumonia, not a bullet.

679
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,368
No.

680
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:20,577
Yes.

681
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,416
I don't envy you.
A decent servant can change your war.

682
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,098
Get downstairs! Now!

683
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,981
All right, all right!
There's no need to be so rough.

684
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:52,359
There's every need!
To stop a murder!

685
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,027
Murder! What do you mean "murder"?

686
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,113
You were going to assassinate the general!

687
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:58,782
Kill the general? I was not!

688
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:02,119
I was going to throw that lot all over him.

689
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,037
- What is it?
- Oil and ink,

690
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:06,623
and a bit of a cowpat,
all mixed with sour milk.

691
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:09,877
He'd have needed a bath right enough,
but not a coffin.

692
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,964
I thought you'd taken the soup up,
but you left it in the pantry.

693
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:18,427
We'll use this. It's not been
heated, but the hell with that!

694
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,429
And we'll decide what happens to you later!

695
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:24,433
Never mind later! What about now?
How do we keep this dinner going?

696
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,310
I'll serve, Mr Carson. I don't mind.

697
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:30,355
Who knows when I'll have the chance again?

698
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,278
What was going on with the soup?
It came, it went...

699
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,905
Nothing to worry about, milord.

700
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,323
Branson was taken ill,

701
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,659
so William volunteered
to be footman one last time.

702
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,703
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, not a bit.

703
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,371
It's very kind of him.

704
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:50,042
Our footman, William, is leaving
us tomorrow to join his regiment.

705
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,585
That's why he's not in livery.

706
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:54,254
You are a credit to this house
and this country, young man.

707
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,425
There is no livery so
becoming as a uniform.

708
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,177
Sir.

709
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:05,849
Lady Rosamund, Mary, all of you,
have been so kind to Lavinia.

710
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:10,687
Well, naturally. We're all curious
to know more of Miss Swire...

711
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:13,899
if she is to reign over Downton as queen.

712
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:18,195
Dear me. I hope you haven't
unearthed anything too fearful.

713
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,239
You must ask Mary.

714
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,327
One thing I am still not quite clear about.

715
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,539
Who precisely is in charge of Downton
when you're not here?

716
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,292
Uh, I've given it some thought, sir,
and it seems to be only fair

717
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:38,006
that Mrs Crawley and Lady Grantham
should share that responsibility.

718
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:40,050
Capital. Well said.

719
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:45,639
The fact is, I have been
more than gratified by my visit here today,

720
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:47,891
and I thank Captain
Crawley for arranging it.

721
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,226
Hear, hear.

722
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:53,897
You are all to be praised
for your response to our national crisis.

723
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,733
But I've been talking and
I've been listening,

724
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,820
and I feel there is one among you

725
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:03,866
whose generosity is in danger
of going unremarked.

726
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:08,579
It seems the daily cares and needs
of the patients are being dealt with

727
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:10,956
quietly and efficiently

728
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,916
by Lady Edith.

729
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,964
Or that's what the officers tell me.

730
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:23,886
So, let us raise our glasses
and drink her health.

731
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,429
Edith. Darling.

732
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:26,680
Lady Edith!

733
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:27,806
Edith, dear.

734
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:34,771
We were never lovers. Not ever.

735
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:37,649
You don't have to explain anything.
Not to me.

736
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,484
But I want to.

737
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,944
You see,

738
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:46,533
my father owed Sir Richard Carlisle
a lot of money.

739
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:48,160
Enough to bankrupt him.

740
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,663
And Sir Richard offered to waive the debt

741
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,458
if you gave him
the evidence of the ministers' guilt?

742
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,835
Papa was terrified,

743
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,506
and I knew I could get into my
uncle's office and find the proof.

744
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,344
What is it?

745
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:11,183
He threatened to tell you all about it
and now I've told you anyway.

746
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:16,146
My uncle was guilty. They all were.

747
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,024
Sir Richard didn't make it up.

748
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:20,776
I believe you.

749
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,986
But that's not why I did it.

750
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,614
It was entirely to save Papa from ruin.

751
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:37,501
- Have you got that picture for me?
- I might have.

752
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:50,347
Because you know
what I'm going to ask you, so, will you?

753
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:55,352
William, you're not sure.
You can't be sure.

754
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:56,770
I am sure.

755
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,021
So is she.

756
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:01,942
Aren't you, Daisy? Isn't it just what
you told me you hoped would happen?

757
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:04,194
It's like a fairy story.

758
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:11,618
Is she right, Daisy? Are we engaged?

759
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,206
Because if we are,
I know I can tackle whatever may come!

760
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,297
Go on, then.

761
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:30,470
William?

762
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:32,890
Do you want to go up top?

763
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:36,476
The general's leaving
and Mr Carson likes a full complement.

764
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,981
No, Daisy. Not you.
The war has not changed everything.

765
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,654
The general is just about to leave.

766
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,740
I'm afraid he doesn't have time
to come in here.

767
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:53,035
I hope it's all been a success.

768
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,664
Cousin Violet said you had something
to say to me about Lavinia.

769
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,083
What is it?

770
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,085
I haven't the slightest idea.

771
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,087
Oh. What a relief.

772
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:07,883
She was hinting
you'd uncovered some horrid stain.

773
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:12,930
The only evidence I've uncovered
is that she's a charming person.

774
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:15,098
What a testimonial.

775
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:19,603
The truth is, we're very much alike,
so naturally I think she's perfect.

776
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:24,483
We all do. Don't we, Aunt Rosamund?

777
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:26,860
Quite perfect.

778
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:41,708
Is there any chance you might take
our footman, William, for your servant?

779
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:44,711
I can pull some strings,
get him transferred to your lot.

780
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:47,840
If you'd like me to, of course.
I can't promise to keep him safe.

781
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:51,260
I know.
But he'd have someone looking out for him.

782
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,471
Oh, my God.

783
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,683
Lang, are you all right, old chap?

784
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:01,520
Come, come, man.
Things can't be as bad as all that.

785
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:04,314
- Carson?
- Mr Lang, what's happened?

786
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:08,151
Sir. The general and all these officers...

787
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,446
I don't have to go back with them, do I?

788
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,907
- Because I can't, sir.
- No.

789
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:15,784
The general's looking for you, milord.

790
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,202
Excuse me.

791
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:18,328
It's been a great pleasure.

792
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:21,790
If I don't see you again
before I have to go back, be safe.

793
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,836
You, too.

794
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:31,800
Come inside.

795
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,391
UP!

796
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,903
Here.

797
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,447
We've earned it.

798
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,823
Ah.

799
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,119
So, what will you do with him?

800
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:02,623
- Branson or Lang?
- Not Mr Lang.

801
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,792
He isn't well, but he's not a bad man.

802
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:09,963
Oh, not at all.
But he doesn't belong at Downton.

803
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,425
I meant Mr Branson.

804
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:16,136
Hmm, it's a delicate business, Mrs Hughes.

805
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:19,056
Would we really be right to tell the police

806
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:23,060
and cause a furore
and bring riot down on our heads?

807
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:27,272
And all because he wanted to pour
a pot of slop over a man's head?

808
00:52:29,191 --> 00:52:32,861
From your phrasing, I gather the
answer you want from me is "no"?

809
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:37,282
Well, would it help, Mrs Hughes?
That's all I'm asking.

810
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:38,742
Would it help?

811
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:39,952
Where's Mr Branson?

812
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:43,372
Mr Carson sent him back to his cottage
to stew in his own juice.

813
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:47,376
Will we see you in the morning, William,
to wish you luck?

814
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:51,880
Oh, yes.
But I've got something I'd like to say now.

815
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:54,341
- If you don't mind.
- Don't. Not yet.

816
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,427
They must know sooner or later.

817
00:52:58,387 --> 00:53:01,306
Daisy and I are going to be married.

818
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:04,643
Oh! You never are! When?

819
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:06,645
After the war.

820
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:08,564
I'm not sure I can wait that long.

821
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:26,498
I see what I had planned to say
is already superfluous, Mr Lang.

822
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:28,876
You got there before me.

823
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:34,298
I've let you down, Mr Carson,
for that I'm sorry.

824
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,674
We let you down.

825
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:39,845
You weren't suited for work,
and I should have spotted that.

826
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:44,474
You'll have two months' wages,
and please tell us how you get on.

827
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:49,563
And when you're ready for work again,
you may rely on a good report from me.

828
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:53,525
That's kind. Thank you.

829
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,996
It was nice of William to serve tonight.
He didn't have to.

830
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:09,833
I'm going to arrange for him
to be Matthew's servant.

831
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:12,211
With any luck, it'll
keep him out of trouble.

832
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:17,257
Matthew and Mary looked so natural together.
Did you notice?

833
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:20,511
Talking and laughing.

834
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:24,264
But I suppose Lavinia is a nice girl.

835
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:27,518
We've dreamed a dream, my dear,
but now it's over.

836
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:33,815
The world was in a dream before the war, but
now it's woken up and said goodbye to it.

837
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:36,401
And so must we.

837
00:54:37,305 --> 00:55:37,740

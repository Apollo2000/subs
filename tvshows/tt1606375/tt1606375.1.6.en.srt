00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:37,787
Last June saw Emily Davison
crushed to death

3
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,956
beneath the hooves of the King's horse!

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,668
Will the summer of 1914

5
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:47,630
prove as fatal for the hopes of women?
It cannot!

6
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:52,635
This historic by-election

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,306
had been a first step of the journey
to women's equality.

8
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,144
If you're so keen on women's rights,
let a woman speak!

9
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,731
Why stop there? Let's get the dogs up
and listen to them bark!

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,659
- Are you all right, my lady?
- Isn't it exciting?

11
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,914
You're an idiot!

12
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,917
Sybil, I think it's time for Branson
to take you home.

13
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,003
- Not yet.
- I think so.

14
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:31,424
I applaud your spirit in coming, and I will
applaud your discretion when you leave.

15
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,968
- But you agree with everything he says?
- I do, my dear.

16
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:39,098
But I also know if anything happens to you,
Branson will lose his place.

17
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,184
Better safe than sorry, my lady.

18
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:46,063
...is an act of mercy? I disagree!

19
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,816
The car's just here.

20
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,527
Women must get the vote,
mustn't they, Branson?

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,739
Why does the Prime Minister
resist the inevitable?

22
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:59,118
Politicians can't often recognise the changes
that are inevitable.

23
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,499
I hope you do go into politics.
It's a fine ambition.

24
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,044
Ambition or dream?

25
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,173
If I do, it's not all about women
and the vote for me,

26
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,342
nor even freedom for Ireland.

27
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,804
It's the gap between the aristocracy
and the poor, and...

28
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,347
And what?

29
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,477
I'm sorry. I don't mean to speak
against his lordship.

30
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,854
Why not?
You obviously don't approve of him.

31
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,817
Not as a representative
of an oppressive class.

32
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,362
But he's a good man and a decent employer.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,615
Spoken like a true politician.

34
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,872
What do I look like?
Could you sneak me round the back?

35
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,500
I should hate for Papa to see me like this.

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,590
Where?
I'm not a mind-reader.

37
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,100
Mrs Patmore is very cruel to that poor girl.

38
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,310
Mrs Patmore is frightened.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,437
Is she right to be?

40
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,149
Well, Doctor Clarkson has confirmed
she has cataracts.

41
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,652
What can be done about it?

42
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,738
There are treatments,
but even the best are uncertain.

43
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,284
And she doesn't want to risk losing
what sight she still has.

44
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,162
I don't blame her. But it can't go on forever.

45
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,332
No.

46
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,378
Oh, dear. Have you had bad news?

47
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,841
- I shouldn't have bothered you.
- No. You weren't to know.

48
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,269
Blimey! Excuse me, my lady.

49
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,105
William, will you find Anna and tell her
I've gone upstairs?

50
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,149
Very good, my lady.

51
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,486
- You clumsy clodhopper.
- Sorry.

52
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,488
You will be sorry
when I've finished with you. Look at this!

53
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,908
- Leave him alone.
- Anna, Lady Sybil's back from Ripon.

54
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,869
- She's gone up to her room.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,496
Why does she waste her precious time
on politics?

56
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,706
Hear, hear.

57
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,250
Oh, don't you believe in
rights for women, Thomas?

58
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,501
What's it to you?

59
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,671
Well, I know you don't believe in
rights of property.

60
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,549
I think some people
might find that interesting.

61
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,052
Who's going to tell them? You?

62
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,854
Mr Carson, are you all right?

63
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,105
Why shouldn't I be?

64
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,191
You've never rung the dressing gong,

65
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,443
and Mrs Patmore's doing a souffle
for the first course.

66
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,111
Oh, my God.

67
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,368
Rather unlike Carson.
We'd better go straight in to dinner.

68
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,120
I shall tell Miss O'Brien and Anna.

69
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,458
Any more news of the by-election?
Mr Crawley was here earlier.

70
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,544
He said his mother had gone
to the Liberal rally in Ripon.

71
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,713
I heard it was quite lively.

72
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,134
I dare say the townies will make the usual
stink when the Tory candidate's returned.

73
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,555
I'm not sure. I heard the Liberal
was given a hard time today.

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,642
Mr Branson said it was getting out of hand
when they left.

75
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,477
Typical Branson to be there.

76
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,064
I hope he squared it with Carson.
Who went with him?

77
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:20,569
Uh... I'm not sure
anyone went with him, my lord.

78
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,572
You just said "they". Who was with him?

79
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,158
I'd rather not say.

80
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,744
Bates, who was with him?

81
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,373
Lady Sybil.

82
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,710
Lady Sybil? Why?

83
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,964
I should never have mentioned it, my lord.
I thought you knew.

84
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,800
No, I did not know.

85
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,888
I gather you went to hear
the Liberal candidate today.

86
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,684
There were several speakers, actually.
He was the last.

87
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,061
Did he speak well?

88
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,397
I thought so.

89
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,774
But there was quite a brouhaha.

90
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,901
You know what these things can be like.

91
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,863
I do. Which is why I am astonished

92
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,283
you should not feel it necessary
to ask my permission to attend.

93
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,119
- I assume this was Branson's scheme.
- No.

94
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,330
I confess I was amused at the idea
of an Irish radical for a chauffeur,

95
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,915
but I see now I've been naive.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,585
I told Branson to take Sybil.

97
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,086
What are you saying?

98
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,798
Sybil needed to go to Ripon.
I asked Branson to drive her.

99
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,801
I thought it would be sensible.
In case there was trouble.

100
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,013
I want to do some canvassing.
The by-election isn't far off...

101
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,181
Canvassing?

102
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,392
Oh, it's quite safe. You're in a group
and you knock on doors.

103
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,853
Yes, I know what canvassing is.

104
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,732
- I think that Sybil is...
- What? Are you canvassing, too?

105
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,817
Or would you rather take in washing?

106
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,862
I was only going to say
that Sybil is entitled to her opinions.

107
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,740
No, she isn't until she is married,

108
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,160
then her husband will tell her
what her opinions are.

109
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,163
- Oh, Granny.
- I knew you wouldn't approve.

110
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,000
Which, presumably, is why
you all hid your plans from me.

111
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,799
Her ladyship will have a smacked bottom
if she's not careful.

112
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,676
Hurry up. I don't want anything else
to go wrong tonight.

113
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,096
Where's the sauce?
Doesn't this have Hollandaise?

114
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,890
- I'll get it. I won't be ajiffy.
- Would you do that for me?

115
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,059
I'd do anything for you.

116
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,900
Does this mean you won't be
presented next month?

117
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,569
Certainly not. Why should it?

118
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,949
Well, I doubt I'd expect to curtsy
to Their Majesties in June

119
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,743
when I'd been arrested at a riot in May.

120
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,830
But then I'm old.
Things may be different now.

121
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,707
She hasn't been arrested and it wasn't a riot.

122
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,711
- But it might be next time.
- There will not be a next time.

123
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,094
Her ladyship's not best pleased
at being told off in public.

124
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,762
William said she was looking daggers.

125
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,849
- I'm sorry I started all this.
- Oh, it's not your fault.

126
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,518
Anyway, he ought to be glad
he's got a daughter who cares.

127
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,062
Her ladyship's ready to leave.

128
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,731
I'll bring the car around.

129
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,695
Are you pleased with yourself?

130
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,575
Silly chump.

131
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:19,081
He's nervous. He thinks
I'm planning to tell Mr Carson about the wine.

132
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,251
Well, he shouldn't have stolen it then,
should he?

133
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,419
No.

134
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,256
But I don't want anyone to lose theirjob
because of me.

135
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,010
Even Thomas?
Even after what they tried to do to you?

136
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,221
Even then.

137
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,020
- Your ladyship, do you have a moment?
- Of course.

138
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,024
I've received a letter, my lady,
from a friend of mine.

139
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,109
He's valet to the Marquess of Flintshire.

140
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,360
I don't envy him.

141
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,447
Lord Flintshire is a minister
at the Foreign Office.

142
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,450
As you know,
Lady Flintshire is his lordship's cousin.

143
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,203
Oh, of course, of course. The point is,

144
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,414
he has dealings with
the Turkish Ambassador.

145
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,794
It seems His Excellency has made him privy
to a scurrilous story

146
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,257
concerning Lady Mary
and the late Mr Pamuk.

147
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,843
May I read this letter?

148
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,108
Is there anything you want me to do about it?

149
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,278
No, thank you.

150
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:39,286
Sometimes, even to deny these things
is only to throw paraffin onto the flames.

151
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,164
- I did try to inform his lordship...
- What?

152
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,877
But I couldn't seem to find the right moment.

153
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,632
Quite right. Please leave his lordship to me.

154
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,343
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,931
The only sure way to get rid of a servant
is to have him or her suspected of stealing.

156
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,058
Aren't you forgetting we've tried that
and it didn't work?

157
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,185
But last time we invented a theft.

158
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,022
What we need to do is to make him a suspect
when something's really been stolen.

159
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,732
How do we know anything's been stolen?

160
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,485
Because you stole it, you noodle.

161
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,487
- Oh. You mean the wine.
- Yeah, the wine.

162
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,447
But that's the whole point.
Bates knows I took it.

163
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,949
He was threatening to tell Mr Carson.

164
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,619
Well, he can't, can he?
Not if we get to him first.

165
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,917
Are you telling me you saw him
take the cellar key?

166
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,794
Not exactly. But I saw him in here

167
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,880
and I thought the key was swinging
on its hook.

168
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,759
I just wondered if you'd noticed
if any of the wine was missing?

169
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,895
I think I owe you an apology
after the way I spoke at dinner.

170
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,649
Next time you want to treat me
like a naughty schoolgirl

171
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,777
you might do it in private,
not in front of the servants.

172
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,279
You're right. I'm sorry.

173
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,491
Of course, it gave your mother
her best evening since Christmas.

174
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,245
Even so, we must try to keep control of Sybil.

175
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,083
Robert, believe me,
Sybil is not your problem.

176
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,880
We've got to support Mary this year,
when we get to London.

177
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:17,092
But it's Sybil's first season.
We can't have Mary stealing her thunder.

178
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:21,055
Sybil will do well enough.
It's time Mary was settled.

179
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,599
High time.

180
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,479
Poor old Edith.
We never seem to talk about her.

181
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:33,108
I'm afraid Edith will be the one
to care for us in our old age.

182
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,070
What a ghastly prospect.

183
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,366
Mama? Anna said you wanted me.

184
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,201
Look who's paid us a visit.

185
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,162
Sir Anthony. How nice.

186
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,874
We all thought we'd driven you away
with that horrible salty pudding.

187
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,169
No, indeed.
But I have been away.

188
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,589
He's been in Austria and Germany.

189
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,134
- How interesting.
- Interesting. And worrying.

190
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,472
Sir Anthony is here to show you his new car.

191
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,974
- Oh.
- I've rather taken to driving myself,

192
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,812
and I have to keep finding destinations
to justify it.

193
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,480
What kind of car is it?

194
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:16,151
It's an open Rolls-Royce and I wondered
if you might like a spin in it.

195
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,321
Oh, how kind. But alas, not today.

196
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,408
I've had Diamond saddled
and he's waiting for me.

197
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,493
You could ride this afternoon.

198
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,497
But it's arranged now.
But thank you, Sir Anthony.

199
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,917
Do ask me again.

200
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,508
I don't suppose you'd take me.

201
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,013
Of course. I should be delighted.

202
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,519
What is it that I am accused of?

203
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,398
Oh. Nobody is accusing you of anything.

204
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:59,570
But there has been a suggestion
that you were handling the cellar key,

205
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,905
and before I take it any further

206
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,409
I want to find if there's a simple explanation.

207
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,245
Because some wine is missing.

208
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,247
How do you know that?

209
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,547
Right. Well, we'll leave it there for now.

210
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,435
The Kaiser is such a mercurial figure,

211
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,647
one minute the warlord,
the next a lovelorn poet.

212
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,234
But a poet in need of an empire.

213
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:44,031
That's very good.
"A poet in need of an empire. " Yes.

214
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,744
My late wife used to say that...

215
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,956
- What did Lady Strallan used to say?
- Oh, never mind.

216
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,419
- But I should like to hear it.
- Really? Would you, really?

217
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,967
She used to say that Kaiser Bill
loved uniforms and medals

218
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,970
but he never really connected them
with fighting.

219
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,269
- What was she like?
- Maud? Oh, she was awfully funny.

220
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,357
Some people couldn't see it, but she was.

221
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,250
- Is Lynch anywhere about?
- Oh, I haven't seen him, my lady.

222
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,503
- My horse is lame.
- I could have a look at him.

223
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,547
Do you know about horses?

224
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,132
I looked after the horses
on me father's farm.

225
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,135
- It was the bestjob in the world.
- Then why did you leave it?

226
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,180
Me mother wanted me to have a chance
of bettering myself.

227
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,848
As a second footman?

228
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,643
It's a good place for me, my lady.

229
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,229
Of course it is. I'm sorry.

230
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:03,026
She hopes, one day,
that I might be first footman,

231
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,154
- or even get to be...
- Carson had better watch out.

232
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,865
Stranger things happen at sea.

233
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,912
I've seen Mr Bates with a bottle
from time to time.

234
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,831
I must have thought he was helping you.

235
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,500
Why would I order a valet
to help with the wine?

236
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,670
Well, when you put it like that,
of course you wouldn't.

237
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:26,883
So, Mr Bates is taking wine.
And why would this be?

238
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,177
To drink it?

239
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,179
It's not to clean his boots.

240
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,056
Thank you, Thomas.

241
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:39,813
Daisy? Thomas says you have something
to add to this.

242
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,607
- Well...
- You are not in any trouble,

243
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,900
or any danger of trouble.

244
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,529
You remember what you saw.

245
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,450
I may have seen him
coming out of the cellar.

246
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,703
"May". Did you or didn't you?

247
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,293
It's very hard for the girl, Mr Carson.
You're frightening her.

248
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,299
I'm sorry. Thank you. You may go.

249
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,648
Thank you, O'Brien.

250
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,651
How is everything downstairs?

251
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,571
All right, I think, my lady.
Though Mr Carson's a bit cast down.

252
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,907
Oh? Why? What's the matter with him?

253
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,910
He's found out something about...

254
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,623
Well, a person he admires,
and it isn't very nice.

255
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,294
Has he said who this person is?

256
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,547
Who's proved a disappointment.

257
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,008
I don't like to say, my lady.

258
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,969
- Please do, if you know.
- Oh, I know.

259
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,515
It's Mr Bates.

260
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,726
Oh, Bates. Why? What's he done?

261
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,897
You should ask Mr Carson, my lady.
It's not my place to tell.

262
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,278
Papa?

263
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,576
Can Branson drive me into Ripon
on Friday evening?

264
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,247
I don't think so, no. Not after the last time.

265
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,252
Oh, please.
There's a meeting of my borstal charity.

266
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,839
I've missed two and I simply must be there.

267
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,426
You'd have to take Mary or Edith with you.

268
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,972
Don't make me. Those meetings are deadly
at the best of times,

269
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,725
and you know what they're like
when they're bored.

270
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,894
Why are all your causes
so steeped in gloom?

271
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,648
Because it's the gloomy things
that need our help.

272
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,068
If everything in the garden's sunny,
why meddle?

273
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,696
Well, I agree with that.

274
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,949
Talking of sunny, are you looking forward
to your coming season?

275
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,492
I am, rather.

276
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,166
Hello. What are you doing here?

277
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,836
I'm in search of your father.
Carson thought he was outside.

278
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,172
- He's in the library.
- Oh.

279
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,219
What is it?

280
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,722
Nothing much.
I've had an enquiry about one of the farms.

281
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,015
Oh.

282
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,443
So, what's new at the big house?

283
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,279
Sybil, mainly.

284
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,408
She's discovered politics,
which of course makes Papa see red.

285
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,286
I admire Sybil's passion, though.

286
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,874
Of course. But then I like a good argument.

287
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,293
Papa does not.

288
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,088
If you really like an argument...

289
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,675
- Yes?
- We should see more of each other.

290
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,435
So, it's all right? I can go?

291
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,191
- Will you be late?
- I think I'll miss dinner.

292
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,445
Well, remember to tell Branson
to take a sandwich for himself.

293
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,915
But who's it from?
Susan Flintshire.

294
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,460
- What does she say?
- Well, prepare for the worst.

295
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,295
Not the first page.

296
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,966
My poor niece never uses one word
when 20 will do.

297
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,177
Start there. "I'm sorry... "

298
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:43,098
"I'm sorry to have to tell you that Hugh
has heard a vile story

299
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,934
"about your granddaughter Mary... "

300
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,938
Sorry? She's thrilled.

301
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,277
Now, first I must ask,

302
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,531
and I want you to think carefully
before you answer.

303
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,783
Is any of this true?

304
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,080
I see.

305
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,460
Some of it is true. How much?

306
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,549
Oh, dear.

307
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,467
She didn't drag him.

308
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,635
I wondered about that.

309
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,180
I mean, obviously Susan's
forgotten the distance

310
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,726
between the girls' rooms
and the bachelors' corridor.

311
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,603
She couldn't manage it alone.

312
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,730
So how did she do it?

313
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:37,277
I helped her.
She woke me up and I helped her.

314
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,867
Well. I always thought

315
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,871
this family might be
approaching dissolution.

316
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:52,167
I didn't know dissolution
was already upon us.

317
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,629
Does Robert know?

318
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,006
No. And he isn't going to.

319
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,467
Oh.

320
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,887
Of course it was terribly wrong.
It was all terribly wrong.

321
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,180
But I didn't see what else...

322
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,810
Please! I can't listen to your attempts
to try and justify yourself.

323
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,106
I know this is hard for you to hear.

324
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,693
God knows it was hard for me
to live through.

325
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,906
But if you expect me to disown my daughter,

326
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm afraid you will be disappointed.

327
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,998
Good day.

328
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,257
I thought you must be out here.

329
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,134
And you'd be right.

330
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,599
- I know you're upset.
- Yes. I'm upset.

331
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,894
I have been working here two years,

332
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,231
and yet Mr Carson has no difficulty
believing the worst of me.

333
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,275
I think he has a great deal of difficulty,

334
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,654
which is why he hasn't told his lordship yet.

335
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,282
- Can't you just explain about Thomas?
- Not now.

336
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,244
It would sound like a false accusation.

337
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,205
You can't take it lying down.

338
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,791
Because you're not guilty of any wrong,

339
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,544
and before it's over
I'm going to tell the world.

340
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:22,424
Are you? I'm not sure the world is listening.

341
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,680
Sorry. I'm a bit late tonight.

342
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,182
Not to worry. How are you?

343
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,769
Bearing up.

344
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,064
This isn't the end. You mustn't give up.

345
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,108
We'll get there.

346
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,778
Forgive me, my lady,
but, well, you don't get it.

347
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,240
You're brought up to think
it's all within your grasp,

348
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,119
that if you want something enough,
it will come to you.

349
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,621
But we're not like that.

350
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,960
We don't think our dreams
are bound to come true because...

351
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,254
Because they almost never do.

352
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,299
Then that's why we must stick together.

353
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,803
Your dream is my dream now.
And I'll make it come true.

354
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,770
Why hasn't he done anything?

355
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,189
He's had the story and the witnesses.

356
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,443
"The witnesses"?
What do you think this is, a murder mystery?

357
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,488
Well, Mr Bates can't accuse me now.

358
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,656
It'll sound as if
he's trying to get his own back.

359
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:32,911
If I lose my job over this,
I swear to God I'll swing for you.

360
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,255
Is there any stale bread
you're throwing out, and some salt?

361
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,590
Why?

362
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,259
Well, I thought I'd make a last
hot poultice for Diamond.

363
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,677
It'll give him a better night.

364
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:53,098
You big softie. What'll Mr Lynch say?

365
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,100
Why, he doesn't mind.

366
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,477
He says I've got the touch.

367
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,188
He thinks I should pack this in
and be a groom.

368
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,981
Why don't you?

369
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:06,861
My mum.
She was so excited when I came here.

370
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:11,074
They're proud of me
and I'd hate to spoil that.

371
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,493
Do you miss them?

372
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,748
I never had that in my childhood,

373
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,209
someone you could always trust.

374
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,797
I trust them. They trust me.
There are no lies in our house.

375
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,551
Thanks. That's enough.

376
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,727
I'm glad to catch you.

377
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:43,523
We have a conundrum at the hospital,
and I would value your opinion.

378
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,691
Of course.

379
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:48,403
We've been treating the mother
of your footman, William Mason.

380
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,779
What's the matter with her?

381
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:54,450
Heart, I'm afraid. She's forbidden us
to say anything to her son.

382
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,952
That's ridiculous.

383
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,538
She's gone home now,
but she's still very ill.

384
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,166
Clearly the boy should go and see her.

385
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,750
And I assume you would have
no objections?

386
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,877
Of course not.

387
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:08,798
So, do we break a patient's confidence

388
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,218
and disobey her orders? Or not?

389
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,888
We can't. If she's forbidden it.

390
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,266
- I must say I agree with you.
- Well, I'll tell him.

391
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,478
No, you will not. She has rights, too.
And there are rules.

392
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,106
I don't care a fig about rules.

393
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,155
- Where to from here, my lady?
What do you mean? We've arrived.

394
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,781
The meeting's in one of
these buildings here?

395
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,160
This is the meeting.
We're here for the counting of the votes.

396
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,495
I don't understand. I thought that...

397
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,955
Don't be silly, Branson.

398
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,208
You didn't think
I'd miss my very first by-election?

399
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,294
- I don't think his lordship would approve.
- Let me worry about him.

400
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,046
I have to park the car! Don't move.
Stay where you are!

401
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,341
Really, Branson. I thought I gave the orders.

402
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,011
Well, I said to...

403
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,304
Sir Anthony Strallan.

404
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,805
- Sir Anthony?
- Don't worry, Lady Grantham.

405
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,641
I haven't got the date wrong.

406
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,727
What a relief. I could hear Cora wondering
if the dinner would stretch.

407
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,688
No. I'm not really here at all.

408
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,399
But I was driving past your gates
on the way to the Callender-Becketts,

409
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,609
and I thought I'd take a chance.

410
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:14,113
See, the thing is, I've got two tickets
for a concert in York next Friday...

411
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,158
How nice. Although, I can't...

412
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:21,162
No. I was hoping that Lady Edith
might like to accompany me.

413
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,414
But I'd love to.

414
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,875
Shouldn't you ask
what sort of concert it is?

415
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,461
Just Hungry Hundreds stuff, mostly,
you know.

416
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,340
Bellini, Puccini, Rossini.
I'm not up to anything complicated.

417
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,883
I'd like that very much.

418
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:38,471
Excellent. Well, it's quite a hike,
so I'll pick you up around 6:00.

419
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,807
Lady Jervas has asked us
for a bite to eat afterwards.

420
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,101
- If that's all right with your mother?
- By all means.

421
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,813
Well, I must run.
I hope I haven't spoiled your dinner.

422
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,857
We may have to hire a nurse, after all.

423
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,281
Oh, for heaven's sake,
hold it steady

424
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,867
if you don't want to start again
from the beginning.

425
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,495
Do these biscuits go up?

426
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,498
- No, I put them out for the fairies.
- Oh.

427
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,042
Of course they're going up.

428
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,460
What's wrong with you?

429
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:13,965
You're always dozy, but tonight
you'd make Sleeping Beauty look alert.

430
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,133
I was just thinking.

431
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,844
Oh, blimey! Batten down the hatches.

432
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:22,390
- I think I've let myself down.
- It can't be a new sensation.

433
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:41,242
The Honourable Joseph Gerald Ansty,
for the Conservative and Unionist Party,

434
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:45,413
6,363 votes.

435
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,832
Martin James Dillon,

436
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:52,587
the Socialist Party, 2,741 votes.

437
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,297
Can we call it a day, my lady?

438
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,342
Don't be silly.
This is the moment we've come for.

439
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,220
Trevor Andrew Morgan, the Liberal Party...

440
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,432
This lot aren't interested in politics.
They're spoiling for a fight.

441
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,269
...5,894 votes.

442
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,190
I hereby declare that
the Honourable Joseph Ansty...

443
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,656
Out you get, lads!

444
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,660
We'll soon wipe the smile off their Tory,
bloody faces.

445
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:29,082
...is duly elected... Is duly elected

446
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:33,086
to serve as a member of Parliament...
A member of Parliament...

447
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,339
- Sybil!
... for the Ripon constituency.

448
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,257
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I couldn't miss this.

449
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,468
Couldn't you? I could.

450
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,763
I don't like the look of this,
my lady.

451
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,934
Look, I'm on your side.
Don't cause any trouble.

452
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,061
You have to believe me!

453
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,313
What's your problem then, Mr La-di-da?

454
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,148
- My problem is you.
- Oh, aye?

455
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,537
Oh, no. Oh, please God, no!

456
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,668
This way.

457
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,802
I've fetched a coat.

458
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,013
- Why? What do I need a coat for?
- I've come to fetch you, my lady.

459
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,307
We've taken Lady Sybil to Crawley House
in the village.

460
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,934
What's happened?

461
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,437
I took her to Ripon for the count.

462
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,772
She got injured in a fight.

463
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,732
Take me there at once.

464
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,413
My God! Oh, my darling...

465
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,249
I didn't know what to do,
so I had Branson bring her here.

466
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,375
Quite right.

467
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,628
Mama would have fainted
if she'd seen her like this. As for Papa...

468
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:01,632
This will sting a bit.
But it's stopped bleeding.

469
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,096
Did you know she was planning this?

470
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,849
- Of course not.
- Well, what were you doing there?

471
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,184
I was working late.

472
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,853
I'd forgotten it was election night
or I wouldn't have stayed.

473
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,313
I'm so grateful you did.

474
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,648
Oh, I could wring Branson's neck.

475
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,526
What was he thinking?
I'm afraid it'll cost him his job.

476
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:24,906
No. I told him he was taking me
to a committee meeting.

477
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,909
When he realised what it was,
he wanted to come straight back.

478
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:32,121
You'll have to stick up for him,
because Papa will skin him alive.

479
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,832
Are you feeling strong enough to go home?

480
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,710
I think so. If you'll take me.

481
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,263
Here, wear my coat to cover the blood.

482
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,933
You'll look more normal.

483
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,727
Lean on me.

484
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,111
Thank you so much for this.

485
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,450
By the way, what happened
to William's mother?

486
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,160
Not good, I'm afraid.

487
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,371
She's home but she's still very weak.

488
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,540
Another attack should finish her.

489
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:16,999
And he still doesn't know?

490
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:21,796
She's adamant. I've tried to explain
how hard it'll be on him,

491
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,381
but she won't have him disturbed.

492
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,134
To hear her talk,
you'd think he was a cabinet minister.

493
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,387
He's made her proud.

494
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,806
There are plenty of children
in grander circumstances

495
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,141
who'd love to say the same.

496
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,360
I wish you'd tell me what's troubling you.

497
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,655
If it's this business with Mr Bates...

498
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,783
Oh, it's not that. I'll get to the bottom of that.

499
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,743
Well, I hope you'll do it soon.

500
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,663
If there's one thing I hate,
it's an atmosphere.

501
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,208
And we've got a real atmosphere going now.

502
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,670
It's an unfair rumour
which needs to be scotched.

503
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:07,717
It's very hard to hear the names of
people you love dragged in the mud.

504
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,720
You feel so powerless.

505
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:15,933
Well, I respect Mr Bates,
but I'm not sure that I love him.

506
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,519
I wasn't thinking of Mr Bates.

507
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,814
Mr Carson, have you got a minute?

508
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,567
What is it, Daisy?
Mr Carson's a very busy man.

509
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:28,070
I know he is.
But I think he'll want to hear this.

510
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,365
I told you something that wasn't true.

511
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,492
Why would you do that?

512
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,996
I did it as a favour for a friend.

513
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,041
But I know now he was wrong to ask it of me.

514
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,348
She's not badly hurt, is she?

515
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,391
I don't think so, no.

516
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,602
Thank God.

517
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:05,399
Better be prepared.
I'm afraid Lord Grantham will hit the roof.

518
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,403
I never would have taken her there.

519
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,281
I may be a Socialist but I'm not a lunatic.

520
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,201
I'm not sure Papa knows the difference.

521
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,039
You'll let me know how she gets on?

522
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,376
Please.

523
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,295
If you wish.

524
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,057
How dare you?

525
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,434
How dare you disobey me in this way?

526
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,769
Robert, I'm sure...

527
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,938
Are you so knowledgeable
about the great world

528
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,066
that my instructions are to be set
as nothing?

529
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,610
Papa, I'm sorry I disobeyed you.

530
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,488
But I'm interested!
I'm political! I have opinions!

531
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,949
- Of course, I blame Branson.
- I don't think that's fair.

532
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,953
We had none of this, none of it,
until he set foot in our house!

533
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,956
I suppose I should give thanks he hasn't
burnt the place down over our heads!

534
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,625
Branson didn't know anything about it
until we arrived there.

535
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,544
He leaves tonight!

536
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,964
If you punish Branson,
I'll never speak to you again. Never!

537
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,883
I don't believe this is Branson's fault.
Truly, Papa.

538
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,969
- Blame me.
- I do blame you!

539
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,806
Robert, can we do this in the morning?
Sybil needs rest.

540
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:23,310
If I find tomorrow that Branson is missing,
I'll run away. I warn you.

541
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,064
Oh? And where would you go?

542
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,983
Well, I can't think now.

543
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,777
But I will go, and you'll be sorry.

544
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,783
I should be sorry. Very sorry, indeed.

545
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,538
How is she?

546
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,123
She'll be perfectly fine.

547
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,625
I gather you're the shining knight in all this.

548
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,878
Not really. But I'm glad I was there.

549
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:52,757
So am I, by heaven. If it had been
left to that bloody fool Branson...

550
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,008
You should see what he reads.

551
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,428
It's all Marx and Ruskin and John Stuart Mill,
I ask you.

552
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,932
Papa prefers the servants to read the Bible
and letters from home.

553
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:05,060
There are sandwiches for Mr Crawley
in the dining room, Lady Mary.

554
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,229
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

555
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,524
- We couldn't let you starve.
- You really didn't have to.

556
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,695
Mary, look after Matthew,
I'll go up and revive your mother.

557
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,742
Do you stand by your story?

558
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,076
I don't have a story.

559
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,079
You saw Mr Bates in here alone,
hanging up the cellar key.

560
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,748
To me, that is a story.

561
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,084
I only said I might have seen him.
I suppose I was wrong.

562
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,128
And Miss O'Brien, were you then wrong

563
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,590
when you thought you saw Mr Bates
carrying a bottle?

564
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,425
- You wicked creature...
- Anna.

565
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,720
You are here to watch,
not to participate.

566
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,264
I don't think I was wrong, no.

567
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:45,059
What do you say to that, Mr Bates?

568
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,854
I know this to be untrue
because I have no need of it.

569
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,273
Since I arrived at Downton,

570
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,318
you have never seen me drink
one drop of alcohol.

571
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,988
Let us say, then,
that Miss O'Brien was mistaken.

572
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,782
Mistaken, my eye.

573
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,618
And, Daisy, we all know the value
of your contribution.

574
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,328
Yes, Mr Carson.

575
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:07,873
But I must ask one thing, Mr Bates,

576
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:11,001
how did you know the wine had been taken?

577
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,923
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.

578
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,176
We can drink to Sybil's safe return.

579
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,845
Why not?

580
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,181
- I'll ring for a glass.
- Never mind that. Here.

581
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,480
You're not very fastidious about
doing things properly, are you?

582
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,940
Are you?

583
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,609
Less than you might think.

584
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,869
Are you at all political?

585
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,496
Yes.

586
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,792
But with a hung Parliament,
it's hard to get excited about a by-election.

587
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,170
You know nothing will change,
whoever gets in.

588
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,720
If I might keep you
for a minute more, Mr Carson.

589
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,471
If you'd like me to leave...

590
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:08,809
No. I would like you to stay, please,
Mrs Hughes. And you, Anna.

591
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:13,772
You have decided not to take action
over the allegations

592
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:17,568
Thomas has made against me
because you believe them to be untrue?

593
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:22,156
- That is correct.
- And you are right. There's no truth in them.

594
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:27,995
But if you were to proceed with the matter,
you would find them to be proven.

595
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:32,708
Thomas has tried to convince you
that I'm a drunkard and a thief.

596
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,376
Which we never believed.

597
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,879
Because you know no different.

598
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,133
Until a couple of years ago, I was a drunkard.

599
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,346
And I was imprisoned as a thief.

600
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:55,522
I have repaid your kindness very poorly.

601
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,612
I masqueraded as a man
of honour and integrity,

602
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,367
but by any moral code, I am disgraced.

603
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,371
That can't be the whole story.

604
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:17,711
Perhaps not. But it's enough of it
to demand my resignation.

605
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,799
Do you want to leave, Mr Bates?

606
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,551
No. But I feel I have no choice.

607
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,389
You owe me a say in the matter, surely?

608
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,057
If you wish.

609
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,227
Then I will consider the case
and give you my decision

610
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,271
when I have discussed it with his lordship.

611
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,400
Until then,
I hope you will remain in your post.

612
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,202
Thank you for coming to Sybil's rescue.

613
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:54,456
You were very brave.
She told me you knocked a man down.

614
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,210
I hope did my duty.

615
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,171
Are you a creature of duty?

616
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,174
Not entirely.

617
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:09,263
When you laugh with me, or flirt with me,
is that a duty?

618
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,600
Are you conforming to the fitness of things?

619
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,728
Doing what's expected?

620
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,149
Don't play with me.

621
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,653
I don't deserve it. Not from you.

622
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,950
You must be careful
not to break Sybil's heart.

623
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,661
I think she has a crush on you.

624
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,581
That's something
no one could accuse you of.

625
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,541
Oh, I don't know.

626
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,837
I assume you speak in a spirit of mockery.

627
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,507
You should have more faith.

628
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,471
Shall I remind you
of some of the choicest remarks

629
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,348
you made about me when I arrived here?

630
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,310
Because they live in my memory

631
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,272
as fresh as the day they were spoken.

632
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,400
Oh, Matthew. What am I always telling you?

633
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:07,404
You must pay no attention
to the things I say.

634
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,219
- Mr Bates.
- Anna.

635
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,182
Will you really leave?

636
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,353
I doubt his lordship wants a thief
in the house.

637
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:46,193
- Now go to sleep and dream of a better man.
- I can't.

638
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,364
Because there isn't one.

639
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,059
Has Matthew gone?

640
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,271
- Yes.
- Thank the Lord he was there.

641
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,986
I hope you thanked Matthew properly.

642
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,197
I got them to make him some sandwiches.

643
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,075
It's not quite what I meant.

644
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,245
And he asked me to marry him.

645
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,914
Heavens. What did they put in them?

646
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,084
I'm serious. He proposed to me.

647
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,046
Oh, my dear.

648
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,509
Have you given him an answer?

649
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,262
Only that I'd think about it.

650
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:59,725
Well, that's an advance on
what it would have been a year ago.

651
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,105
- Do you want to marry him?
- I know you want me to marry him.

652
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,608
What we want doesn't matter.

653
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,779
At least, it's not all that matters.

654
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,534
Do you love Matthew?

655
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,121
Yes.

656
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,375
I think perhaps I do.

657
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,838
I think I may have loved him
for much longer than I knew.

658
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,506
Oh, my darling.

659
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:38,347
Let's not pretend this isn't the answer
to every one of our prayers.

660
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,184
I'd have to tell him.

661
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,478
Oh...

662
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,023
Is it absolutely necessary?

663
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,943
If I didn't, I'd feel as if
I'd caught him with a lie.

664
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:59,117
I hope you know that really smart people
sleep in separate rooms.

665
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,203
I always keep the bed made up
in the dressing room,

666
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,164
so at least I pretend we sleep apart.
Isn't that enough?

667
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:07,376
No. Never mind. Good night.

668
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,298
Mmm.

669
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,634
Haven't you gone up yet?

670
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,136
Blow this out. You're the last.

671
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,639
- Good night.
- Good night.

672
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,391
Good night.

673
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,646
I'm going to bloody get him.
I don't care what you say.

674
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,147
What would I say?

675
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,108
Everything comes to him who waits.

676
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,527
Well, I've waited long enough.

677
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,950
Does Carson know you're here?

678
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,828
I heard you were going out
and I wanted to see how he was walking.

679
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,705
Lynch is happy for me to ride him.

680
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,248
Oh, yes. He's better.

681
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,793
But I'll wait and see what he's like
when you're up.

682
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,547
William, are you planning to go home soon?

683
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,924
Well, it's a bit far for my halfday,

684
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,095
but I can maybe get the time to go in July
when the family's in London.

685
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,848
That's if I don't go with you, of course.

686
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,684
I think you should take a few days off
and go now.

687
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:10,147
I'll fix it. I'll speak to father and to Carson.
No one will mind.

688
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,982
But why, my lady?

689
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,444
Your mother's not been well.

690
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:17,988
How do you know?

691
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,241
I heard someone mention it in the village.
I forget who.

692
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:26,538
- I had a letter and she never said.
- Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

693
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,541
But I know it would cheer her to see you.

694
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,918
Well, if it wouldn't be a bother.

695
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,756
It won't. I'll arrange it as soon as I get back.

696
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,884
Thank you very much, my lady.

697
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:44,139
She ought to spend some time
with the people she loves.

698
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,438
The Dowager Countess, my lady.

699
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,317
Good afternoon, my dear.

700
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,278
Good afternoon.

701
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,656
There's no need to be so prim.
I come in peace.

702
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,951
Shall I sit here?

703
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,376
Now, I've been thinking...

704
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,756
I confess I do not know if I would have had
the strength, mentally or physically,

705
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,803
to carry a corpse the length of this house.

706
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,307
But I hope I would have done.

707
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,395
You were quite right.

708
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,230
When something bad happens,

709
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,650
there's no point in wishing
it had not happened.

710
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,487
The only option is to minimise the damage.

711
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:45,909
Or try to.
But if the Flintshires have got hold of it...

712
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,911
I've written to Susan.

713
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:54,292
I said it was a story made up
by Mr Pamuk's enemies to discredit him.

714
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,295
Even if she doesn't believe me,

715
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,882
she won't tell,
in case it reflects badly on her.

716
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:05,095
The Ambassador is dangerous.

717
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,266
But then, how many people really go
to the Turkish Embassy?

718
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,268
It only takes one.

719
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,855
Well... I mean, thatjust can't be helped.

720
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,233
We can't have him assassinated,

721
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,402
I suppose.

722
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,572
Robert still doesn't suspect.

723
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:24,739
Oh, I should hope not.

724
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:29,953
No, our only way forward
is to get Mary settled as soon as possible.

725
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:34,416
I have news on that score.
Matthew has proposed.

726
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,002
My, my. Has she said yes?

727
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:41,965
She hasn't said anything yet, except that
she's going to have to tell him about Pamuk.

728
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,259
For heaven's sake, why?

729
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,679
She thinks to keep it secret
would be dishonourable.

730
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,474
She reads too many novels.

731
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:54,227
I mean, one way or another,
everyone goes down the aisle

732
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,563
with half the story hidden.

733
00:46:56,689 --> 00:47:00,609
The question is, will she accept Matthew?

734
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,236
I'm not sure.

735
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:07,616
Well, if she doesn't,
we'll just have to take her abroad.

736
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:13,622
In these moments, you can normally
find an Italian who isn't too picky.

737
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,709
We'll give her till the start of the grouse.

738
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:23,131
Very well. If she turns Matthew down,
we'll take her to Rome in the autumn.

739
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,799
It's official.

740
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:29,554
Thank you for not turning against her.

741
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:30,847
I know that you have rules,

742
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:34,142
and when people break them
you find it hard to forgive.

743
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,021
I understand that and I respect it.

744
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,609
In this case Mary has the trump card.

745
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,985
What?

746
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,446
Mary is family.

747
00:47:47,305 --> 00:48:47,402

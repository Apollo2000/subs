00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,208

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,064
(explosions, soldiers yelling)

4
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,819
Sergeant Stephens?
Sir.

5
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,521
I want every wounded man
taken down the line

6
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,356
before it starts to get dark.

7
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,458
We've bloody well lost enough
of them for one day.

8
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,233
When did this arrive?

9
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,267
Sir.

10
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,536
Ah, good news.

11
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,770
(commotion outside)

12
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,205
We're to be relieved today
by the Devons.

13
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,573
The men can finally
get some rest

14
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,209
and I've got a few days'
leave coming to me.

15
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,445
What will you do
with them, sir?

16
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,147
London first.

17
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,848
To remind myself what real food
tastes like.

18
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,150
Then north for a couple of days,
I suppose.

19
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:27,188
Naturally, there's a girl
I want to see while I'm there.

20
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,323
So I should hope, sir.

21
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:30,791
It's strange, isn't it?

22
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,593
To think about our lives
just going on as before?

23
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,428
While we're here,
in this.

24
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:37,298
It's more than strange.

25
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,766
When I think of my life
at Downton,

26
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,568
it seems like another world.

27
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,242
ANNA:
We normally have everything
done before the family wakes up

28
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,378
but it's all
at sixes and sevens today.

29
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:27,215
I'll go through it
with you tomorrow
when we're back to normal.

30
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,349
I do know how to run a house.

31
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,886
Come along.

32
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,559
It goes under the epaulette.

33
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,294
I'm sorry, m'lord.

34
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,429
If I'd known, I'd have asked
Mr. Bates about it

35
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,331
before he left for London.

36
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:48,236
Because I'll be in uniform
a lot of the time, in future.

37
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,503
Does being Lord Lieutenant
mean you're back in the army?

38
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:50,938
No, not exactly.

39
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,874
The Lord Lieut is responsible
for the army in the county

40
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,908
while the war's on.

41
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,844
But no.

42
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,946
I'm not back in the army.

43
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,514
It appears they don't want me.

44
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,492
(dog barking)

45
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,996
Morning.

46
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,499
I don't suppose there's
any news of Bates?

47
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,468
We expect him back
any day, m'lord.

48
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,536
He wrote to Anna that they had
the funeral last Monday.

49
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,937
William's a good chap,

50
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,640
but he's not Bates
when it comes to uniforms.

51
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,376
I may not be a real soldier,

52
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,010
but I think I ought
to look like one.

53
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,745
Quite, m'lord.

54
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,382
ROBERT:
We don't often see you
in here for breakfast.

55
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,618
Isobel said she was
coming up to help

56
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,320
and your mother threatened
to look in.

57
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,655
No doubt they would love it

58
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,658
if they found me
still in bed.

59
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,295
I don't believe it.

60
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,830
Please say
it's something nice.

61
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,832
General Robertson's invited me

62
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,000
to be Colonel of the North
Riding Volunteers.

63
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,404
Well, this is the best bit:
"It may please you to know

64
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,373
that the idea was given to me
by General Haig."

65
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,309
Well, if Haig's involved,

66
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,310
it means I'm back
in the army properly.

67
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,744
How can that be?

68
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:04,912
You were told you weren't wanted
for active service.

69
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,747
You can't jump
in and out of the army

70
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,848
like a jack-in-a-box.

71
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,683
ROBERT:
I don't see why not.

72
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,952
Churchill went back to the front
after the Gallipoli business.

73
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,588
If he can do it,
why shouldn't I?

74
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,623
Sybil, are you all right?

75
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,658
Sybil, darling?

76
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,760
Would you excuse me?

77
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,996
I think I'll just...

78
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,466
She's had more bad news.

79
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,606
I do think I'm getting
better, don't you?

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,475
Up to a point, m'lady.

81
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,344
If you could just get the clutch
right down to the floor.

82
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,478
But I am.

83
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,512
Not quite, m'lady.

84
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,047
It doesn't seem to want to go.

85
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,083
I think it wants to,
if you ask it properly.

86
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,519
That's better.

87
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,887
You'll be putting me
out of a job.

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,423
Won't the call-up put you
all out of your jobs?

89
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,993
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

90
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,495
(horn honking)

91
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,830
What are you giving them to eat?

92
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:57,765
Not much.

93
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,633
They know the money's
for the hospital,

94
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,101
so they can't expect
Belshazzar's Feast.

95
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,837
I'll make some cheese straws.

96
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,673
What's the matter with you?

97
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,007
Nothing much.

98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,976
Me Dad still won't
let me enlist.

99
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,079
Your father has no one but you.

100
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,614
Of course he doesn't want you
to enlist.

101
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,683
Who can argue with him?

102
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,485
So I stand by

103
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,620
while the lads on the farms
and in the gardens go to war.

104
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,889
Even Thomas is at the front
in the medical corps.

105
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,692
Well, that'll have come
as a nasty shock.

106
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,093
Oh, you can make fun of him,
Mrs. Patmore.

107
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,128
But he's fighting for his king
and country and I'm not.

108
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,098
Well, I dare say you won't
have long to wait.

109
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,400
Well, I hope you're right.

110
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,867
Do you?

111
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,903
Because I don't.

112
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,406
I hope very much
that I am wrong.

113
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,075
It's kind of you
to let us have it here.

114
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,144
They'll enjoy it so much more.

115
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,479
And you can charge so much more
for the tickets.

116
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,981
ROBERT:
Good morning, Mama.

117
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,082
This is very early for you
to be up and about.

118
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:52,786
War makes early risers
of us all.

119
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,422
I thought I would help
with the flowers.

120
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,427
Bassett has plenty,
but... thank you.

121
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,100
You don't mind my taking over
the flowers, do you?

122
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,969
Cora's flowers
always look more suited

123
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,540
to a first communion
in southern Italy.

124
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,946
Well, what else have you planned
for tonight's revels?

125
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,481
Anything we can think of
that will raise money.

126
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,884
Hot buttered toast
with a countess,

127
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,486
at tuppence a slice?

128
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,723
You drop the cushions
on the floor to plump them up.

129
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,593
I know.

130
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,194
Ethel, are you settling in?

131
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,730
I would be.

132
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,532
If Anna'd stop teaching me
how to suck eggs.

133
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:42,035
I was head housemaid
in my last position.

134
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,706
You were senior housemaid out
of two in a much smaller house.

135
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,208
Are they to come
in here tonight?

136
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,210
Only at the interval.

137
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,712
And keep them out
of the drawing room.

138
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,080
I thought Mr. Bates
would've been back by now,

139
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,915
or he could've stood guard.

140
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,218
Who is this Mr. Bates?

141
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,589
His lordship's valet.

142
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,891
He's been in London
because his mother died.

143
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,993
Only everyone talks about him
as if he were a king.

144
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,160
Do they?

145
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,762
That's nice to hear.

146
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,930
Anna.

147
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:14,835
Help me do battle
with this monstrosity.

148
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,573
It looks like a creature
from The Lost World.

149
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:29,950
You should let
William do that.

150
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,953
He's got enough
on his hands,

151
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,823
getting the uniforms
out of mothballs.

152
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,859
I must remember to put Anna
on alert for dinner tonight.

153
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,228
You have to
ease up a bit

154
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,630
or you'll give yourself
a heart attack.

155
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,065
There's a war on.

156
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,534
Things cannot be the same

157
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,535
when there's a war on.

158
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,036
I do not agree.

159
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,971
Keeping up standards is the only
way to show the Germans

160
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,541
that they will not beat us
in the end.

161
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,208
Well, give me some warning

162
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,244
the next time we're expecting
Germans at Downton

163
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,846
and I'll see what I can do.

164
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,553
Thank you.

165
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,722
Oh, we thought we'd come
in here for a little talk.

166
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,691
Oh, well, I'm sure
we won't be disturbed.

167
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,965
Please.

168
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:22,302
Well the thing is,
I've had a letter from Matthew.

169
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,305
Of course he doesn't tell me
what he's actually doing.

170
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,074
No, he wouldn't.

171
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,308
But I'm glad he's all right.

172
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,743
I miss him.

173
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,211
ISOBEL:
Well, that's the point.

174
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,180
You must know he's been
down here a few times

175
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,648
since the war started.

176
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,884
CORA:
We had heard.

177
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:37,951
Downton is hardly
a metropolis.

178
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,720
ROBERT:
Is he still determined

179
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,656
to go back to Manchester
when it's all over?

180
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,725
He doesn't talk much
about life after the war.

181
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,059
None of them do.

182
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,928
I suppose they don't want
to tempt fate.

183
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,164
Until now, that is.

184
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,601
He writes that he is engaged
to be married,

185
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,903
to a Miss Lavinia Swire.

186
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,142
Well, I...

187
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,045
I suppose we all knew
it would happen one day.

188
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,279
Do you know her?

189
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,181
Not yet.

190
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,252
Apparently, they met when he was
in England last time.

191
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,954
It all seems rather hurried.

192
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,057
You can't blame them for wanting
to live in the present.

193
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,626
Anyway, he's been in London
on leave

194
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,360
and now he's bringing her here
to meet me.

195
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,363
He'll be here tonight
and tomorrow,

196
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,365
then he leaves on Thursday
while she stays for a bit.

197
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,234
So will you miss the concert?

198
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,770
Well, that's up to you.

199
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,004
We'd all hoped that he and Mary

200
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,206
would sort things out
between them.

201
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,142
But if that's not to be,

202
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,644
then shouldn't we try
to get back to normal?

203
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,379
Even if he's not keen
to live in the village,

204
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,649
he's still the heir.

205
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,352
And you're still
his family.

206
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,755
I quite agree.

207
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,723
We can't know if Matthew
will come through it.

208
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,759
Either way,
I would like to see him

209
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,260
and I want to wish him luck.

210
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,729
The trouble is Mary's back
from London today, as well.

211
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,030
She gets in at 5:00.

212
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,298
ISOBEL:
Matthew's driving down

213
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,833
in Lavinia's car.

214
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,870
They won't meet on the train.

215
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,071
Oh, that's a relief.

216
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:08,041
I hate Greek drama, you know,

217
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,778
when everything happens
off stage.

218
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,345
CORA:
But should we tell her
not to come?

219
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,114
We might still catch her.

220
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,783
Isobel's right.

221
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,285
We must use this engagement
as a new beginning.

222
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,289
You bring our Lieutenant Crawley
to the concert,

223
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,791
and stay for dinner
afterwards.

224
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,293
I was hoping you'd say that.

225
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,101
ISOBEL:
Oh, there you are.

226
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,103
I'm just going home,
but I'll be back at 4:00...

227
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,137
Sybil?

228
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,239
My dear,
what's the matter?

229
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,714
Tom Bellasis has been killed.

230
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,150
What a terrible thing.

231
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,319
I remember him at Imogen's ball.

232
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,354
He made me laugh out loud

233
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,090
just as her uncle
was giving a speech.

234
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:04,732
Sometimes it feels as if all the
men I ever danced with are dead.

235
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,903
I just feel so useless,

236
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,973
wasting my life
while they sacrifice theirs.

237
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,842
You've been a tremendous help
with the concert.

238
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,311
No, I... I don't mean
selling programs

239
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,080
or finding prizes
for the Tombola.

240
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,815
I want to do a real job.

241
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,151
Real work.

242
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,753
Well...

243
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,124
If you're serious, what about
being an auxiliary nurse?

244
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,960
There's a training
college in York.

245
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,095
I know I could get you
on to a course.

246
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,830
It may be something
of a rough awakening.

247
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,100
Are you ready for that?

248
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,268
I mean, have you ever made
your own bed, for example?

249
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,471
Or scrubbed a floor?

250
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,840
O'Brien, what is it?

251
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,109
Mr. Platt is taking her ladyship
and Lady Grantham

252
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,343
down to the village.

253
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,079
She wondered if you'd like
to go with them.

254
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,947
That's very kind.

255
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,416
Thank you.

256
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,986
Go on.
What else would I need?

257
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,089
Well, if you're serious,
what about cooking?

258
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,858
Why don't you ask Mrs. Patmore
if she could give you

259
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:08,095
one or two basic tips?

260
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,262
When you get to York,

261
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,398
it might be useful to know
a little more than nothing.

262
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,938
They want to use her as a maid
of all work at the hospital.

263
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,273
I suppose it's cheaper when Lady
Sybil can live here for nothing.

264
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:24,945
But it doesn't seem quite right,
somehow, to take advantage.

265
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,814
No, it does not.

266
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,949
I hear the young men that
are being brought in now

267
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,483
are very disfigured.

268
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,020
How terrible.

269
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,288
Limbs missing
and faces blown apart

270
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:40,193
and Lady Sybil's been
nurtured so very gently.

271
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:44,031
And what types would
she be working with?

272
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:47,367
Still, you'll know
what's best to do.

273
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,270
Yes.

274
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,539
I certainly will.

275
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,248
Where's the batter
for the pancakes?

276
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,416
It's in the cold larder.
Are we having
pancakes tonight?

277
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,185
Are we 'eck as like.

278
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,553
Upstairs dinner.

279
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,388
Crêpes Suzettes.
(Ethel gasps)

280
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,522
I've always wanted
to try those.

281
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,490
Could you save me some?

282
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,860
If they don't
finish them all.

283
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,095
Save you some Crêpes Suzettes?

284
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,397
ETHEL:
If you don't mind.

285
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,531
What are we having?

286
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,300
Lamb stew and semolina.

287
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,135
Do you eat a lot of stews?

288
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,370
Don't you fancy that, dear?

289
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,605
ETHEL:
Not all the time.

290
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,974
Oh, I see.

291
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,876
Um, would you like to sleep

292
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,310
in her ladyship's bedroom
while you're at it?

293
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,579
I wouldn't mind.

294
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,181
I hate sharing a room.

295
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,348
I didn't in my last place.

296
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,117
There were only two maids
and a cook.

297
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,887
I'm just saying.

298
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,890
And I'll "just say"
if you don't look out!

299
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,028
You've got a cheek,
on your first day.

300
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,363
I don't see why.

301
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,299
I want the best,
and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

302
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,401
And you think we don't?

303
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,905
I think it's hard to change
at your age.

304
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,942
I don't blame you,
but I suppose, in the end,

305
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,576
I want to be more
than just a servant.

306
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,452
I'm sorry, but if Dr. Clarkson
needs free labor,

307
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,956
I'd prefer him not to find it
in my nursery.

308
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,390
But Sybil isn't
in the nursery.

309
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,926
No, and in case
you hadn't noticed,

310
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,627
she hasn't been there
for some time.

311
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,995
You know what I mean.

312
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,230
Well, no, not really.

313
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,633
You can't pretend
it's not respectable,

314
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,936
when every day we're treated

315
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,973
to pictures of queens and
princesses in Red Cross uniform,

316
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,208
ladling soup down the throat
of some unfortunate.

317
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,278
CORA:
But Sybil won't be ladling soup.

318
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,247
She'll have to witness
unimaginable horrors.

319
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,581
When she's an innocent.

320
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,616
Her innocence
will protect her.

321
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,586
For once, I agree
with Cousin Isobel.

322
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,556
VIOLET:
Sybil must be allowed to do
her bit like everyone else.

323
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,963
CORA:
What about you, Molesley?

324
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,965
Are you ready for the call,
if it comes?

325
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:58,798
It won't be coming for me,
m'lady.

326
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,134
I had a letter
from the War Office

327
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:03,203
to say I'm not suitable
for service.

328
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,504
Why not?

329
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,374
I... I really couldn't say,
m'lady.

330
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,641
As you can imagine,

331
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,477
Molesley's father is beside
himself with joy.

332
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,512
VIOLET:
God moves in
a mysterious way,

333
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,547
His wonders to perform.

334
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,740
Bates!

335
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,044
No one told me you
were on this train.

336
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,079
They didn't know, m'lady.

337
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,447
We'll give you a lift
to the house.

338
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,743
Why didn't you say
you were coming?

339
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,645
I didn't know until today.

340
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,756
Anna, I borrowed a case
from Lady Rosamund.

341
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,658
I bought some things
while I was in London.

342
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,426
Very good, m'lady.

343
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,129
Well, it would be
our secret.

344
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,564
A surprise.

345
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,431
You don't mind, do you?

346
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,767
Oh, it's not that I mind,
m'lady...

347
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,502
And I only need
the basics.

348
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,071
How to boil an egg,
how to make tea.

349
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,473
Don't you know
how to make tea?

350
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,575
Not really.

351
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,609
(giggling)

352
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,710
SYBIL:
You're right.

353
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,645
It is a joke.

354
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,747
But when I start my course,
I don't want to be a joke.

355
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:55,782
Will you help me?

356
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,085
'Course we will.
Won't we?

357
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,087
If you say so.

358
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,422
Let's get started.

359
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,490
Do you know how to fill
a kettle?

360
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,492
Everyone knows that.

361
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,697
(gasping)

362
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,101
Not everyone, apparently.

363
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,746
When can I talk to you?

364
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,616
After the concert.

365
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,451
Outside in the courtyard.

366
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,353
There's bound to be a gap
before they start dinner.

367
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,623
Are you going up
for the concert?

368
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,825
Maybe.
Can I sit with you?

369
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,260
Don't be daft.

370
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,361
We've got a dinner
to make.

371
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,695
I've not got time
for concerts.

372
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,131
I've had a letter
from me dad.

373
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,232
He won't change his mind.

374
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,134
He says he can live with it

375
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,801
if I get called up,
as there's nothing we can do,

376
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,570
but if I enlist
and anything happens,

377
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,571
he'll never get over it.

378
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,573
He loves you.

379
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,742
He may love me,
but he doesn't own me,

380
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,677
and he's not being fair.

381
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,413
Glad to be back?

382
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,750
I'm never sure.

383
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,752
When I'm in London,
I long for Yorkshire,

384
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,254
and when I'm here,

385
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,422
I ache to hear my heels
clicking on the pavement.

386
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,857
I'd forgotten
about this nightmare concert.

387
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,360
Why didn't you warn me?

388
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,761
I'd have come back tomorrow.

389
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,863
But you'd have missed Matthew.

390
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,468
I was going to tell you.

391
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,704
Matthew's on leave
and he's in the village,

392
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,640
so Papa and I thought
it would be a good time
to mend our fences.

393
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,576
He's coming tonight,
with Isobel.

394
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,212
And his fiancée.

395
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,815
What?

396
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,218
Edith, I don't know
how helpful you're being.

397
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,188
Matthew's engaged.

398
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,323
He's brought her to Downton
to meet his mother.

399
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:47,694
Well, how marvelous.

400
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,762
You don't mind?

401
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,898
Why should I?

402
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,201
We're not going to marry,

403
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,636
but I don't want him to spend
the rest of his life in a cave.

404
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,904
Exactly what Papa
and I feel.

405
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:01,408
Please try to be
happy for him.

406
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,576
Of course I'm happy.

407
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,212
Good luck to him.

408
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,714
Anyway, there's someone
I want you all to meet.

409
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,351
Have you ever come across
Richard Carlisle?

410
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,753
Sir Richard Carlisle?

411
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,655
The one with all those
horrid newspapers?

412
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,224
We met at Cliveden.

413
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,692
But how old is he?

414
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,695
Old enough not to ask
stupid questions.

415
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,232
Anyway, I can't wait
for you to know him.

416
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,833
If only Papa hadn't
closed down the shoot.

417
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,769
CORA:
Most people have stopped
shooting now that the war's on.

418
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:34,507
But I'm sure Papa
would be happy

419
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,775
to have Sir Richard
come and stay.

420
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,344
Are you?

421
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,246
I shouldn't have thought
he was Papa's type at all.

422
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,647
Are you coming?

423
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,881
I'll be down in a minute.

424
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,630
Are you all right, m'lady?

425
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,801
Oh, Anna...

426
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,569
It's awfully grand.

427
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,005
You'd better
get used to it.

428
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,342
It'll be your home one day.

429
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,910
I'm not sure "home"
would ever be quite the word

430
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:44,944
to describe it.

431
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,480
My dear fellow,
welcome back.

432
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,416
It's so very good
to see you.

433
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,551
May I present
Miss Lavinia Swire?

434
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,685
LAVINIA:
How do you do, Lord Grantham.

435
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,522
ROBERT:
How do you do, Miss Swire.

436
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,789
So, that's Mary's
replacement.

437
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,625
Well.

438
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,728
I suppose looks
aren't everything.

439
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,064
I think she seems
rather sweet.

440
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,599
CORA:
I'm afraid
meeting us all together

441
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,900
must be very intimidating.

442
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,570
I do hope so.

443
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,022
Now, please
come this way.
Thank you.

444
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:33,760
It's good to see you.

445
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,395
Hello, Miss Swire.

446
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:35,962
I'm Mary Crawley.

447
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,564
Of course you are.

448
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,032
I mean, I've been
longing to meet you

449
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,801
because I've heard so much
about you from Matthew.

450
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,770
Oh, that is...

451
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,871
Nice things, I hope.

452
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,773
What else would
she hear from me?

453
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,008
ROBERT:
Please.

454
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,979
I can't say.

455
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,747
It's been such
a long time.

456
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,549
Who knows what you think
of me now?

457
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,785
I think...

458
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,653
I'm very glad to see you
looking so well.

459
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,724
All right, you win.

460
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,893
We are at peace again.

461
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,695
(music starts)

462
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,415
(music continues in distance)

463
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,790
Have you found
something nice?

464
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,091
Why, particularly?

465
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,995
As a welcome home,
for Mr. Matthew.

466
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,431
(grunts)

467
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,765
Oh, what's the matter?

468
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,667
I thought you'd come
round to him.

469
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,636
Well, last time he was here he
hadn't broken Lady Mary's heart.

470
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:52,572
Lady Mary broke her own heart.

471
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:55,908
That's if she has
a heart to break.

472
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,044
I don't think we're ever

473
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,780
going to see eye-to-eye
on this, Mrs. Hughes.

474
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,582
She refused him when she
thought he'd have nothing.

475
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:06,018
And when he was heir again,
she wanted him back.

476
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,854
I thought caution
was a virtue.

477
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,656
Caution may be.

478
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:12,091
Self-interest is not.

479
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,760
Perhaps Miss Swire

480
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,127
is a gentler person.

481
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,698
If you ask me,
this "Miss Swire,"

482
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,032
who, it may interest you
to know, is not to be found

483
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,803
in Burke's Peerage
or Burke's Landed Gentry,

484
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,472
has an eye to the main chance.

485
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:28,040
That's not snobbish, I suppose?

486
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,611
I like to see things done
properly, Mrs. Hughes,

487
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,680
and I won't apologize for that.

488
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,582
Now, if you'll excuse me.

489
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,862
What is it?

490
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,764
A white feather, of course.

491
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,566
Coward.

492
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,103
ROBERT:
Stop this at once!

493
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,204
This is neither the time
nor the place!

494
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,506
These people
should be aware

495
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,540
that there are cowards
among them.

496
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,075
ROBERT:
Will you please leave!

497
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,578
You are the cowards here,
not they!

498
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:18,891
You are the cowards here,
not they!

499
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:19,759
ROBERT:
Leader,

500
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,061
will you continue?

501
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,130
(music starts)

502
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,640
I'm in a uniform.

503
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,807
Wrong kind.

504
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,179
That was horrid, William.

505
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,915
I hope you won't
let it upset you.

506
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,684
WILLIAM:
No, your ladyship.

507
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,553
Why are these women
so unkind?

508
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:47,854
Of course it is horrid.

509
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,690
When heroes are giving
their lives every day,

510
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,191
it's hard to watch
healthy young men do nothing.

511
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:56,763
By the way, Sybil,
very good news:

512
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,230
they do have a vacancy.

513
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:01,167
It's very short notice,
because someone dropped out.

514
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,803
You'd have to be ready
to start on Friday.

515
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,838
May I ask
what this is about?

516
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,840
SYBIL:
Cousin Isobel
has got me a place

517
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,175
on a nursing course
in York.

518
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,181
I want to work
at the hospital.

519
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,217
We don't have
to talk about it now.

520
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,691
She just turned up
at my mother's house.

521
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,759
Not long before she died.

522
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:31,698
So, what does it mean?

523
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:37,203
I think it means, at long last,
I'm able to get a divorce.

524
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:42,909
Mr. Bates...

525
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,077
Is this a proposal?

526
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:48,815
If that's what you want
to call it.

527
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:53,620
And you might start
calling me John.

528
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,088
Well, why are you sure
she'll do it now

529
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,791
when she's refused
for so long?

530
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:01,193
Mother left me some money,
much more than I thought.

531
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,328
Vera's a greedy woman.

532
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,830
She won't refuse
what I can offer her.

533
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,999
Will we have
to leave Downton?

534
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,836
Not until we want to.

535
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,237
I've spoken to his lordship

536
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,972
and he will find a cottage
for us near the house.

537
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,374
You told him you want
to marry me?

538
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,976
I did.

539
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,310
Before you spoke to me?

540
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,279
You don't mind, do you?

541
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,115
Of course I mind!

542
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,216
In fact, I'd give you a smack

543
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,654
if I didn't want to kiss you
so much I could burst!

544
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,911
Branson says I'm ready
for the road.

545
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,146
That's not what he told me.

546
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,381
How delicious.

547
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,415
I love these.

548
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,685
How did you
and Matthew meet?

549
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:00,887
Oh, in London.

550
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,989
My father works in London
so I've always lived there.

551
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:04,256
But I love the country, too.

552
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,025
Of course you do.

553
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,127
Daddy's a solicitor,
like Matthew.

554
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,428
My, my.

555
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,830
You're very well placed

556
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,264
if you're ever in trouble
with the law.

557
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,333
ROBERT:
Did I tell you I've
been given a Colonelcy

558
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:18,805
in the North Riding
Volunteers?

559
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,940
So I'm properly
in the army again.

560
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,775
Congratulations.

561
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,876
He won't go
with them, will he?

562
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,879
When they're called
to the front?

563
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:31,117
MARY:
I hope not,
but he seems to think so.

564
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,720
What's it been like?

565
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,762
Do you know,
the thing is...

566
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,332
I just can't talk about it.

567
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,739
Have you missed us?

568
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:53,806
What do you think?

569
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,915
You don't mind my
bringing Lavinia?

570
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:05,484
On the contrary,

571
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,154
I'm glad,
glad to see you happy.

572
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,859
What about you?

573
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,761
Are you happy?

574
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,162
I think I'm about
to be happy.

575
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,997
Does that count?

576
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,932
It does if you mean it.

577
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:23,202
You'll be the first to know.

578
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,311
What are you reading?

579
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,481
Photoplay,
about Mabel Normand.

580
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,950
She was nothing
when she started, you know.

581
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:39,952
Her father was a carpenter
and they'd no money.

582
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:42,254
And now she's
a shining film star.

583
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:46,425
Ethel, I've a message
for you from her ladyship.

584
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,494
You're to go up
and see her now.

585
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,396
What?
Where?

586
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,497
In the drawing room,
of course.

587
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,065
They're all
in the drawing room.

588
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,133
What have I done wrong?

589
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:57,036
Nothing.
Quite the reverse.

590
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,470
She's very pleased
with the way you've begun

591
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,839
and she wants
to thank you.

592
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,073
Now?

593
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,075
Yes, now.

594
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,443
She's asked for you.

595
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,045
How much longer are you
going to keep her waiting?

596
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,152
(giggling)

597
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,090
I don't know much
about life in the country.

598
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,826
But I do understand
how the law works,

599
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,527
so I believe I can be
helpful to Matthew there.

600
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,063
But you'll be
immensely helpful.

601
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,032
Don't you think so, Mary?

602
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,499
Of course.

603
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,035
(door opens)

604
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:33,505
Beg pardon, m'lady,
for keeping you waiting.

605
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,174
What?

606
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,509
I'm ever so grateful
for your appreciation

607
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,011
and I want you to know that
it's a privilege to work here.

608
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,351
Ethel,

609
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,587
what are you doing
in here?

610
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,890
Her...
her ladyship sent for me.

611
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,091
And who gave you
this message?

612
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,226
Miss O'Brien.

613
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,062
She said I wasn't to keep
her ladyship waiting.

614
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,965
CARSON:
You may go back downstairs
now, thank you, Ethel.

615
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,366
ETHEL:
Right.

616
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,334
Thank you, m'lady.

617
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,604
VIOLET:
Well.

618
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:10,142
Do we think she's mad, ill,
or working for the Russians?

619
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,410
(giggling)

620
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,949
MATTHEW:
She has plenty of time
to learn.

621
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,185
Cousin Robert will be in
charge here for many years.

622
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:21,287
Lavinia will be
a lawyer's wife

623
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,521
far longer than
she'll be a countess.

624
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,391
That's if I get through
the war in one piece.

625
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,226
Of course you will.

626
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,329
Don't even think like that.

627
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,331
How long are you staying
in the village?

628
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,933
Just tomorrow.

629
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,902
I take the 6:00 train
on Thursday.

630
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,036
And then you'll be
in France.

631
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,972
Wherever I'm going,

632
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,908
I'm so pleased that
we're friends again.

633
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,250
I still don't understand
why it was funny to make me
look a fool.

634
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:54,887
You weren't even there
to enjoy it.

635
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,322
Oh, don't worry.

636
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,457
We enjoyed it all
right from down here.

637
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,258
Miss O'Brien,
her ladyship has asked me

638
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,627
to take the incident
no further.

639
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,096
Don't tempt me to disobey.

640
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,099
Did I see Lady Sybil
in the kitchen yesterday?

641
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,068
She wants to learn
some cooking.

642
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,536
She says she's going
to train to be a nurse,

643
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,072
so she needs to know how to cook
and clean and everything.

644
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,106
Has she told her ladyship
about this?

645
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,476
It's supposed to be
a surprise.

646
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,577
Mr. Carson,
it speaks well of Lady Sybil

647
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,612
that she wants to help
the wounded.

648
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,481
Let's not give her away.

649
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,450
ETHEL:
Why shouldn't she learn
how to cook and scrub?

650
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,086
She may need it
when the war's over.

651
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,021
Things are changing.

652
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:32,024
For her lot and us,
and when they do,

653
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:32,959
I mean to make
the most of it.

654
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:35,427
(scoffs)

655
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,496
I take it they ate all the
pancakes last night, then?

656
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,631
They did.

657
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,536
(service bell rings)

658
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,572
(whistles)

659
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,341
Here you are.

660
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:54,013
ISOBEL:
What are we aiming at?

661
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:57,383
They'd like us to take
100 wounded men.

662
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,152
Three times the number
the hospital was built for.

663
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:03,022
Well, that settles it.
We'll have to convert

664
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,423
the second Day Room.

665
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,491
So there's to be no
convalescence at all?

666
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:08,260
I'm afraid not.

667
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,996
Once they can stand,
they must go.

668
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:13,665
If only there were somewhere
nearer than Farley Hall.

669
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:18,670
I can't get there more than
twice a week at the most.

670
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,640
Ah, should he
be doing that?

671
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,209
Why not?

672
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,743
I only meant
with his condition.

673
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,577
ISOBEL:
What condition is that?

674
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,046
CLARKSON:
His lungs.

675
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,447
Old Lady Grantham told me

676
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,050
he's had a lot of trouble
with his lungs.

677
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,419
And why did she tell you that,
particularly?

678
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,355
She wanted me to write
to the War Office.

679
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,324
She was anxious to spare him
the humiliation

680
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,159
of being refused
on medical grounds.

681
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,428
And who else did she wish you
to take under your protection?

682
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,629
William Mason,

683
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,165
the footman
at the big house.

684
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,367
He has a bad skin
condition apparently,

685
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,036
and hates people to know.

686
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,107
She wanted to spare him
the physical examination.

687
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,410
I'm sure she did.

688
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,749
What in Wonderland
do you call that?

689
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,652
I mean, I do not
fully understand

690
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,120
what you are
trying to do, m'lady.

691
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,356
I knew it wasn't supposed
to look like this.

692
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,224
No, m'lady.

693
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,126
I would go so far as to say
there is no food on the earth

694
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,096
that is supposed to look
like that.

695
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,734
Why does everything
go so lumpy?

696
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,071
Tell you what,

697
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,472
chuck it out
and we'll start again.

698
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,813
I don't think we should sell
your mother's house.

699
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,548
Not yet.

700
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:38,217
We could rent it out.

701
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,386
Then we can save.

702
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:44,190
When I've some time off, I'll go
up to London and get it ready.

703
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:49,395
Maybe I can come with you.

704
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,130
We could do it together.

705
00:33:54,666 --> 00:34:00,106
I've got an idea that a bit
later on, if we want to...

706
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,541
If we want to start a family.

707
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:06,678
I thought, when the time is
right, we might sell.

708
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:11,717
And we could buy
a small hotel,

709
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,220
just... just a little one,

710
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,287
maybe near here.

711
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:19,191
Then we could
work together

712
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,560
and have the children
with us.

713
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,462
What is it?

714
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,430
Nothing.

715
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:28,234
It's just... in my whole life,

716
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,502
I never thought I could be
as happy as I am at this moment.

717
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,571
(footsteps approaching)

718
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,477
Don't worry.

719
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,314
I haven't come to undo your
good work of the other night.

720
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,183
You must have been up
before the servants.

721
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:19,551
They were rather
surprised to see me.

722
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,587
I wanted to give you this.

723
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,224
It's my lucky charm.

724
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:28,394
I've had it always.

725
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,796
So you must promise to bring
it back, without a scratch.

726
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,898
Won't you need it?

727
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,767
Not as much as you.

728
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,337
So look after it.

729
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,371
Please.

730
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:42,241
I'll try not to be a hero,

731
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,209
if that's what
you're afraid of.

732
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:44,876
Just come back
safe and sound.

733
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:49,381
Did you have a happy
time yesterday?

734
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,919
I showed Lavinia the places
I like most.

735
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,788
To give her a few memories.

736
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,325
Mary, if I don't come back...

737
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,492
But...
No.

738
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,961
If I don't...

739
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,396
then do remember
how very glad I am

740
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,466
that we made up
when we had the chance.

741
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,534
I mean it.

742
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,836
You send me off to war
a happy man.

743
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,974
Will you do
something for me?

744
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,809
Will you...

745
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,379
will you look after Mother,

746
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:21,880
if anything happens?

747
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,616
Of course we will,
but it won't.

748
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,485
And Lavinia?

749
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,919
She's young, she'll find
someone else--

750
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,456
I hope she does, anyway--

751
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,259
but until she does.

752
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:36,395
(trainman whistles)

753
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,963
Good-bye, then.

754
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,768
And such good luck.

755
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,871
Good-bye, Mary.

756
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,739
And God bless you.

757
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:33,685
Lady Mary was very much part
of the story, I can assure you.

758
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,321
ETHEL:
But how do you know?

759
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,723
VERA:
Well, you see, I worked
for Lady Flintshire...

760
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,391
Ethel.

761
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:43,362
I hope you've offered
our visitor some tea?

762
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,497
I'll go and ask Daisy.

763
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,437
What is the first law
of service?

764
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,539
We do not discuss the business
of this house with strangers.

765
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,607
But she's not a stranger.

766
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:56,675
She's Mr. Bates's wife.

767
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,510
Has anyone told him
she's here?

768
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,692
So you're Anna.

769
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,060
I am.

770
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,599
You're the one
who went to call

771
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,800
on my late lamented
mother-in-law.

772
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,868
Yes, I did.

773
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,004
I know you did.

774
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,944
Sorry to keep you waiting, Vera.

775
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,749
I was up in the attic,
sorting out some cupboards.

776
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,618
Don't worry.

777
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,052
I've been having
a nice time here with Ethel

778
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,588
and Miss Smith.

779
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,025
Mr. Bates, Ethel told me
about your visitor,

780
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:50,128
so I've had the tea
put in my sitting room.

781
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,698
I thought you might take
Mrs. Bates in there.

782
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:55,100
That's very thoughtful.

783
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,502
It is.

784
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:00,138
But then, you're all so kind.

785
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,908
I'm beginning to understand
why my Batesy's got so spoiled.

786
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,083
I'm sorry to trouble you,
my lady.

787
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,620
What is it, Carson?

788
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,723
Something has been going on,
and I don't feel quite easy

789
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,658
that you've not been
made aware of it.

790
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,892
Goodness.

791
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:22,861
What is this dark secret?

792
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:26,498
Lady Sybil has spent the last
two days in the kitchens.

793
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,833
What?!

794
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,801
She asked Mrs. Patmore
for some cooking lessons.

795
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:32,804
MRS. PATMORE:
Now steady.

796
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:34,039
Even the most
experienced cook

797
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,073
can burn themself
if they're not careful.

798
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,643
Do you think it's ready?

799
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:38,944
I know it's ready.

800
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,846
Go on, you don't
want to spoil it.

801
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,483
It seems she's made a cake for
your ladyship, as a surprise.

802
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,453
But I'm uneasy with surprises

803
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:48,987
at the best of times.

804
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,123
And I wonder
if the whole exercise
is entirely appropriate.

805
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,460
Ta-da!

806
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:58,764
No, I'm not comfortable
with this, my lady.

807
00:39:58,797 --> 00:39:59,698
I'm not comfortable at all.

808
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:04,603
CORA:
I was worried
about Lady Sybil,

809
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,438
but I'm not
worried anymore.

810
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,707
So you don't mind, my lady?

811
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,143
No.

812
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:15,581
I do not mind.

813
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:18,617
And I'm very grateful to you.

814
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,854
And Carson, the cake
will be a surprise

815
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:23,822
whether you approve or not,

816
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,857
so please don't give me away.

817
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:37,669
Sit down.

818
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,738
I don't want to sit down.

819
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,039
Suit yourself.

820
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,912
Look, I'm not saying
it's all your fault

821
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,647
for how things were
between us,

822
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,082
but I couldn't
go back to that.

823
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,618
I'll take the blame.

824
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:57,155
I'll go to some hotel
in Malton with a tart.

825
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,724
So why hold on?

826
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:03,729
Because I tried it on my own
and I don't like it.

827
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,196
You've got money now.

828
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,533
We'll be comfortable.

829
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,702
You're out of your mind.

830
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:13,572
What makes you think that
I would allow that to happen?

831
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,606
You went to prison
for me once.

832
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:22,013
I must say, this is very good.

833
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:23,181
Does Lord Grantham
have his own blend?

834
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,249
Is that all?

835
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,618
Not quite.

836
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,588
You see, if you don't
come back to me,

837
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:32,658
I'm going to the newspapers
with a cracking story.

838
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:33,959
And I'd like to bet the
Granthams won't survive it.

839
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,961
Oh?

840
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,729
And what nonsense is this?

841
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:40,832
The nonsense I heard
when I used your name

842
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:42,000
to get a job
with Lady Flintshire.

843
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,101
His lordship's cousin...

844
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,136
I know who Lady Flintshire is.

845
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,705
Well, when I arrived,
her maid asked me if it was true

846
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:49,107
about Lady Mary Crawley
and the Turkish diplomat.

847
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,109
They thought I'd know, you see.

848
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:52,611
Being your wife.

849
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:53,979
I hope you told them you knew
nothing about it.

850
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,147
(laughs)

851
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,050
Oh, as if.

852
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:03,955
I said, "Why don't you tell
me what you think you know,

853
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,791
and I'll tell you
if it's true?"

854
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:11,129
Goodness me, wasn't
my patience rewarded?

855
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:12,831
The public's bored
with the war, you see.

856
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,734
They like gossip,

857
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,268
and a diplomat dying

858
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,605
in the bed of an earl's
unmarried daughter?

859
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:21,940
Well, that takes the ticket
for the Tale of the Year.

860
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,742
It's a pack of lies!

861
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:27,078
I assume that's loyalty
and not ignorance?

862
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,147
Because you see, I heard
that Lady Mary needed her maid

863
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,882
to help her carry him.

864
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,018
And, yes, you've guessed it.

865
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,820
Your precious Anna's going
to figure in the story, too.

866
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:35,954
Not to worry too much.

867
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,289
It's not a criminal
offense, is it?

868
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,158
Just a social one.

869
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:44,329
You bitch!

870
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:47,332
Please.

871
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:48,900
Be my guest.

872
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:49,968
But then you must excuse me

873
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,703
while I run into town
and have it photographed.

874
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,382
What do you want from me?

875
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,652
Firstly, you'll hand
in your notice.

876
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,819
Tonight.

877
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:10,255
I'll put up at the pub
in the village.

878
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,790
And what reason do I give?

879
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,024
You don't need a reason.

880
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:14,693
Just tell them
that you're going.

881
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:17,729
Then tomorrow we
head back to London.

882
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,330
We'll stay in your mother's
house for the time being

883
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,667
'til we get ourselves sorted.

884
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,301
And in case you're wondering,

885
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:29,274
whatever my future plans
may be, they will involve you.

886
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:48,059
Bates, when you first came here,
I fought to keep you!

887
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,361
Everyone was
against me, everyone,
from her ladyship to Carson!

888
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:53,799
They thought I was mad!
But I said to them,

889
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,266
"After all that we've been
through together, Bates and I,

890
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,067
I owe him my loyalty!"

891
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:58,136
I appreciate that,
m'lord, but...

892
00:43:58,169 --> 00:43:59,404
But what?

893
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,206
But loyalty doesn't
matter to you?

894
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,808
It does matter, m'lord.

895
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,342
Not enough to make you
change your mind!

896
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,777
Not even enough
to make you stay

897
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:06,945
until I've found
a replacement!
I can't.

898
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,714
You won't take any
more money off me.

899
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:10,048
You leave empty-handed!

900
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,818
I don't want money, m'lord.

901
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:14,352
I'm sorry, Bates.

902
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,054
That was a low shot.

903
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,956
Of course you can have
whatever is owing to you.

904
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,928
I thought we were friends,
that's all.

905
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:27,365
I thought we'd crossed
the great divide successfully.

906
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,167
Well, well.

907
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,836
I've had my say.

908
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:31,970
It's your life.

909
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,371
But you've
disappointed me, Bates.

910
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,807
I cannot remember being more
disappointed in any man.

911
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:41,046
ANNA:
I don't believe it.

912
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,014
You say my life is over

913
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:44,382
and your wife will collect you
first thing and that's it?

914
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,819
Have you mentioned this
to anyone else?

915
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,055
Only Mr. Carson
and Mrs. Hughes.

916
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:52,758
The others can find out
when I've gone.

917
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:54,425
I know you've not told me
the real reason.

918
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:55,861
You're wrong.

919
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:57,896
Vera has reminded me
that I'm a married man,

920
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,798
that I must give my vows
another chance.

921
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,332
I had no right
to involve you in my life.

922
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,468
Yes, but you see, that's
just what I don't agree with.
You had every right.

923
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,770
I know you.

924
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,171
You're doing
something gallant here.

925
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,173
Making a sacrifice
for my honor.

926
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,809
But I don't want you to.

927
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,443
I don't care.
Don't you understand?

928
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:15,013
I don't care what people say.

929
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,883
I'd live in sin with you.

930
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,484
Look, if she's threatening
to ruin me, then let her.

931
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:20,618
It's nothing to me.

932
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,921
The only ruin that I recognize
is to be without you!

933
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:24,790
Forget me and be happy, please.

934
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,157
I couldn't.

935
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:29,427
Not ever.

936
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,799
You should and you must.

937
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,803
I am nothing.

938
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:52,417
DAISY:
William?

939
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,053
I thought everyone
had gone up.

940
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,922
I'm just looking for that
magazine Ethel were reading.

941
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,962
I hope you've noticed I'm not
scared of electricity anymore.

942
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,496
Well, not much.

943
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,565
I couldn't touch a switch
when it were only upstairs,

944
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,566
but I've got used to it now.

945
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:13,104
I hate to see you
like this.

946
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:15,073
Even though I'm
a dirty coward?

947
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,074
You're not.

948
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:16,908
Not to me.

949
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,209
But why don't I enlist?

950
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:20,145
I could.

951
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:22,480
I know I promised my Dad

952
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,516
but he's not my owner,
he's not the law.

953
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,286
Am I frightened?

954
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,889
Is that it?
Honestly?

955
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,924
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

956
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,862
No one wants to go to war.

957
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:38,563
Oh, I wish you'd cheer up.

958
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:40,999
Please?

959
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:42,868
I'd do anything
to cheer you up.

960
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:44,402
Like what?

961
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:47,238
Like this.

962
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,150
You just feel sorry for me.

963
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:00,986
William, I've kissed you.

964
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,220
You've wanted me to
long enough.

965
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:06,291
Well, now I have.
Enjoy it.

966
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,559
Does this mean
you'll be my girl?

967
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,228
Daisy, because
if you were my girl,

968
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,396
I know I could
tackle anything.

969
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:18,369
(rumbling and explosions nearby)

970
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:31,249
But we were supposed to be
at rest for ten days at least.

971
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:33,484
The orders arrived
this morning, sir.

972
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:38,423
The King's Own were hit bad,
so they're out and we're in.

973
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:39,958
They've been shelling the
trench since we got here.

974
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:41,359
Anybody hurt?

975
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:43,161
Rankin's dead,
and Kent,

976
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,130
and Corporal Wright
was hit.

977
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:48,233
Thank God the stretcher
bearers were there.

978
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:51,102
Let's see
what the damage is now.

979
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,377
All right?

980
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,479
Morning, sir.

981
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,414
(heavy shelling continues)

982
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,454
Look out!

983
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:10,521
(explosion)

984
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:20,031
Thomas?

985
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:22,633
It is Thomas, isn't it?

986
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,435
Corporal Barrow now,
Mr. Crawley.

987
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:29,107
You'll never guess
where I've just been.

988
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:51,229
VIOLET:
Where's Anna?

989
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,331
She's not feeling very well
today, your ladyship.

990
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:56,201
I've taken over
for the time being.

991
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,136
Oh, that's so kind of you.

992
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,670
Just make sure Lady Sybil

993
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:01,572
packs things she can get
in and out of

994
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,374
without a maid.

995
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:05,143
Oh, I don't need that.

996
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,011
I'd never wear it.

997
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:07,245
But you must have
something decent.

998
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,481
Suppose you're invited
to dinner?

999
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:12,317
I know this is hard
for you to grasp,

1000
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,451
but I'm not there
to go out to dinner.

1001
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:14,552
I'm there to learn.

1002
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,554
Take one.
Just in case.

1003
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:19,490
We'll miss you.

1004
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:22,327
Don't be silly.
It's only two months,

1005
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,195
and I'll come
home if I can.

1006
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:26,331
EDITH:
Why don't I drive you?

1007
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:28,066
She's taking enough chance
with her life as it is.

1008
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:30,701
Oh, Granny.

1009
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:32,270
What is this driving mania?

1010
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,172
EDITH:
It'll be useful.

1011
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:37,508
They won't let a healthy man
drive us around for much longer.

1012
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:40,378
And if Sybil can be a nurse,
why can't I be a chauffeur?

1013
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,513
VIOLET:
Well, I shall leave you.

1014
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:47,452
I have been summoned
by Cousin Isobel for tea.

1015
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,353
Good-bye, Sybil,

1016
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:50,688
and good luck with it all.

1017
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,124
Thank you for being
such a sport.

1018
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:56,394
It's a big step
you're taking, dear,

1019
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:59,097
but war deals out
strange tasks.

1020
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:03,801
Remember your
Great-Aunt Roberta.

1021
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,603
What about her?

1022
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:10,175
She loaded the guns at Lucknow.

1023
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,309
CORA:
I'll come with you.

1024
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,444
I'll tell William
to fetch the bags.

1025
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,649
CORA:
The first of you
to leave the nest.

1026
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,253
EDITH:
Poor Mama.

1027
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:24,122
She always feels these things
so dreadfully.

1028
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:25,823
That's her American blood.

1029
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,593
I'm so glad we've settled
everything with Cousin Matthew.

1030
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:31,562
Aren't you, Mary?

1031
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:32,830
Oh, please stop treading
on eggshells.

1032
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,733
I've other fish to fry.

1033
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,730
I make no apology.

1034
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,766
It would be a terrible thing

1035
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,435
if poor old Mr. Molesley's
son were killed.

1036
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:11,602
Wouldn't it, Molesley?

1037
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:13,138
ISOBEL:
I'm sure it would, but...

1038
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:14,239
VIOLET:
And then I heard

1039
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:17,475
William's father
would be left on his own

1040
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:18,476
if anything happened to the boy.

1041
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:21,846
And what would
become of Carson

1042
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:24,182
if the last of his staff
were to go?

1043
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,283
That's not the point.

1044
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,751
Do you want Molesley to die?

1045
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,553
ISOBEL: Of course I don't!
VIOLET: Well...

1046
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:29,687
I don't want my own son
to die, either.

1047
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,756
But this is a war,

1048
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,291
and we must
be in it together.

1049
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,325
High and low, rich and poor.

1050
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,361
There can be no
"special cases."

1051
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:41,399
Because every man at the front
is a special case to someone.

1052
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,600
CLARKSON:
Mrs. Crawley is right.

1053
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,502
I understand your motives,
Lady Grantham,

1054
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,637
and I do not
criticize them.

1055
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:48,573
Thank you.

1056
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,541
But I shall write
to the Ministry at once,

1057
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:52,610
correcting
the misinformation.

1058
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:53,678
Good day.

1059
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:57,348
I'll see myself out.

1060
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:58,683
Molesley, you understand
why I said what I did?

1061
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,451
Indeed I do, ma'am.

1062
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:03,621
You won't be called up at once.

1063
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:06,824
Not while there are
younger men to be taken.

1064
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:10,395
VIOLET:
But they'll get you
in the end, Molesley.

1065
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,830
And you can blame Mrs. Crawley
when they do.

1066
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:21,706
I wish you'd stop working
for one minute.

1067
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,775
At least put the light on,
or you'll strain your eyes.

1068
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:28,413
It's getting dark
so early now.

1069
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:31,582
Has she gone?

1070
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:32,883
She has.

1071
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:38,223
So, we've lost Mr. Bates
and Lady Sybil in one day.

1072
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,325
I can't believe it.

1073
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:42,693
I suppose I'll have to look
after his lordship now,

1074
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:44,262
on top of everything else.

1075
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:45,530
And I don't want any jokes

1076
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:47,365
about broomsticks
and sweeping the floor.

1077
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:50,868
His lordship's got
his regimental dinner

1078
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,936
in Richmond tonight.

1079
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,571
That means he'll be
in the full fig.

1080
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,373
You'll manage.

1081
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:58,543
You know, when Mr. Bates
first came to this house,

1082
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,978
I thought,
"He can never do the work."

1083
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,647
But now I can't imagine
the place without him.

1084
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,749
Did you see this coming?

1085
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:06,784
Because I didn't.

1086
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:09,254
I have a confession.

1087
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:10,355
I let them have their tea
in my sitting room.

1088
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:12,857
That was nice of you.

1089
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:17,295
It was quite nice,
but I had my reasons.

1090
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:21,699
There's a grating on the wall,

1091
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,569
which means you can hear
what's being said in the room.

1092
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:28,306
Now if I was a gentleman,
I wouldn't want to know.

1093
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:29,874
But you're not.

1094
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:32,277
Fortunately.

1095
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:00,305
It'll be hard
to let you go.

1096
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:01,972
My last link with home.

1097
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:04,542
Not as hard as it is for me.

1098
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,010
Branson...

1099
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,612
I know I shouldn't say it, but I
can't keep it in any longer.

1100
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:09,714
I wish you would.

1101
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,816
I've told myself
and told myself

1102
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:12,883
you're too far above me,
but things are changing.

1103
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,820
When the war is over,

1104
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,922
the world won't be the same
place as it was when it started.

1105
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,724
And I'll make something
of myself, I promise.

1106
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:20,591
I know you will.

1107
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,528
Then bet on me.

1108
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,463
And if your family casts you
off, it won't be forever.

1109
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:30,335
They'll come around,
and until they do,

1110
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:33,871
I promise to devote every waking
minute to your happiness.

1111
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:37,475
I'm terribly flattered.

1112
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:39,710
Don't say that.

1113
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:42,547
Why not?

1114
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,349
Because "flattered"
is a word posh people use

1115
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,016
when they're getting
ready to say no.

1116
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,953
That sounds more like you.

1117
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:51,356
Please don't make fun of me.

1118
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,758
No.

1119
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,926
It's cost me all I've got
to say these things.

1120
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,768
Right.

1121
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,670
I'll go.

1122
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,905
I'll hand in my notice

1123
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,674
and I won't be there
when you get back.

1124
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:10,875
No, don't do that.

1125
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:11,909
I must.

1126
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,544
They won't let me stay

1127
00:55:13,578 --> 00:55:15,480
when they've heard
what I've said.

1128
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,848
They won't hear.

1129
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,418
Not from me.

1130
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,430
Bloody hell.

1131
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:33,864
There must be more to life
than this.

1132
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,073
You all right, Corporal?

1133
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:48,446
I think so.

1134
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,880
Yeah, more or less.

1135
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:01,058
My God.

1136
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,093
They won't believe it,
back home where I come from.

1137
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:06,431
I thought, "Medical corps.

1138
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:08,433
Not much danger there."

1139
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:10,668
How wrong can one man be?

1140
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,503
Here.

1141
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,541
I think it comes down
to luck.

1142
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:19,810
If the bullet's got your name on
it, there's nothing you can do.

1143
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:22,012
If not,

1144
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,881
then thank God
you were lucky...

1145
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,956
Take these bodies away!

1146
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,692
Come on, Corporal Barrow.

1147
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:47,104
I cannot tell you how pleased
I am to be here tonight, sir.

1148
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,173
Oh, we are very pleased
to have you here, Grantham.

1149
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,141
You see, just to know
I'm with you all,

1150
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:54,178
to sense that I belong here.

1151
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,046
Well, it's as simple as this:
I no longer feel like a fraud.

1152
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:03,488
Mr. Molesley?

1153
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:04,321
What are you doing here?

1154
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,890
I was waiting
to see you, Doctor.

1155
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,958
How can I help?

1156
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,794
It's just I was wondering

1157
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,128
whether you'd written
that letter.

1158
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,730
The one you spoke
of this afternoon.

1159
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:13,831
To the War Office?

1160
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:15,032
Not yet.

1161
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,602
I'm sorry you were involved
in all that.

1162
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:18,603
I should have checked with you
first before I interfered.

1163
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:20,838
That's just it.

1164
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,673
You see, I think if you
had checked with me,

1165
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:24,909
you'd have found exactly
what Lady Grantham described.

1166
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,511
I don't quite...

1167
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:28,012
I have trouble
with my lungs.

1168
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,614
I get so...

1169
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:36,521
breathless sometimes, and...

1170
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:37,788
I've noticed
it's getting worse.

1171
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:47,164
They haven't written to William
yet-- the Ministry, I mean,

1172
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,600
but they have discharged me.

1173
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,802
Won't it just make
extra work for them

1174
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:54,572
to have to fail me
all over again?

1175
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:55,906
Very well.

1176
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,076
I shall correct my statement
as regards William,

1177
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:00,845
but make no mention of you.

1178
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,112
Thank you, Doctor.

1179
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:04,214
It's all right.

1180
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:08,152
But Molesley...

1181
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:11,689
I hope you will help the
war effort in other ways.

1182
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:13,791
Yeah, of course.

1183
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:16,894
When might the regiment
be wanted, sir?

1184
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:20,865
The talk at dinner suggested
it would be soon?

1185
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:22,833
Oh, pretty soon, I'd say.

1186
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:26,937
Well, I'm as ready now
as I'll ever be.

1187
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:29,206
For what?

1188
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,575
To go to France
with the regiment.

1189
00:58:30,575 --> 00:58:32,176
Why would you do that?

1190
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:34,679
Because I'm their
colonel, of course.

1191
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,682
Well, there must be some
use for me over there.

1192
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:39,917
My dear fellow.

1193
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,018
We're not as heartless
as that!

1194
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,820
The position is
only an honorary one.

1195
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,856
Nobody expects you
to go to war.

1196
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:46,724
An honorary one?

1197
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:49,694
We thought it'd
cheer things up a bit

1198
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,761
to have the Lord Lieutenant
at our table.

1199
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:53,197
And so it does.

1200
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,966
We're very glad
to welcome you here.

1201
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,934
I see.

1202
00:58:56,967 --> 00:59:00,137
We old codgers have
our work cut out for us

1203
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,272
keeping spirits
high at home.

1204
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:03,307
Someone must.

1205
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,809
Oh, indeed, sir.

1206
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,977
Is that Taxi Cavendish?

1207
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,613
I must catch him
before I go.

1208
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:19,757
So Lady Sybil got off
all right in the end.

1209
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,793
I'm afraid we have to admit
she knows what she wants.

1210
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:24,729
Yes. She certainly does.

1211
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:27,765
I don't suppose the war
will leave any of us alone

1212
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,634
by the time it's done.

1213
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,837
I'd a letter from Thomas
the other day.

1214
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,004
He writes that when he thinks
about how things used to be,

1215
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:37,775
it seems like a dream.

1216
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:40,144
It's not much more
than two years ago,

1217
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,211
but he says it might
as well be a century.

1218
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,981
So you hear from Thomas.

1219
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:45,349
Is he well?

1220
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:47,718
Please give him my regards.

1221
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,353
He's well enough, m'lady.

1222
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:51,388
But I don't think
he'd mind coming home.

1223
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,793
Oh, how I wish
he could, O'Brien.

1224
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,228
Of course, if Bates hadn't
been so bloody selfish,

1225
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:01,866
he would have let us plan
for his departure properly.

1226
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:04,234
Your lordship,

1227
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,203
I have information that
I have no proper claim to.

1228
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:10,107
Well? What is it?

1229
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,876
Well, if your lordship
can assure me

1230
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,644
that you will keep it
to yourself?

1231
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:16,246
I promise, Carson.

1232
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,682
You can drop the last veil.

1233
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:21,118
Well, I feel it
only right to tell you

1234
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:23,821
that Mr. Bates's leaving
was not selfish.

1235
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:24,789
Quite the reverse.

1236
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:27,291
It felt selfish to me.

1237
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:29,226
As for the wretched Anna,

1238
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,896
bedizened with
dishonest promises.

1239
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:35,700
Mr. Bates left because,
had he not done so,

1240
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:39,169
his wife was planning to
engulf this house in scandal.

1241
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,972
Scandal?

1242
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,974
What scandal?

1243
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:45,342
The point is, my lord,

1244
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,911
Mrs. Bates would have
made Downton notorious.

1245
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:51,215
The price of her silence
was her husband's return.

1246
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:54,118
But I must know what story
she was planning to tell.

1247
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,453
I'm sorry, my lord,
I could not speak of it

1248
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,790
without injuring you
and betraying myself.

1249
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,458
But you are saying
that Bates fell on his sword

1250
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,361
to protect the reputation
of my family?

1251
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:19,777
Ethel?

1252
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,246
What are you doing?

1253
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,814
Seeing to the plugs
for the night.

1254
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,049
What?

1255
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,851
Polishing the electric plugs
and checking them for vapors.

1256
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:29,453
And why are you doing this?

1257
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:32,790
Because you were too busy.

1258
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:36,026
She said you usually did it,
but could I manage it tonight.

1259
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,830
And "she," I take it,
would be Miss O'Brien?

1260
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:42,232
Go to bed, Ethel.

1261
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:47,304
And next time she gives you
an order, ask me first.

1262
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,780
CORA:
Is anything the matter?

1263
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:59,083
Nothing.

1264
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:01,118
Except that today has shown me
I'm not only a worthless man,

1265
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:03,220
but also a bad-tempered

1266
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,354
and ungrateful one.

1267
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,023
Well, we all know that.

1268
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,361
Can I help?

1269
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:19,003
I wonder how Sybil
is feeling.

1270
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,071
The war's reaching its long
fingers into Downton

1271
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:23,040
and scattering our chicks.

1272
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,541
But I'm glad we made peace
with Matthew.

1273
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,675
I agree.

1274
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:29,146
Let us thank Sir Richard
Carlisle for distracting Mary

1275
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,949
at just the right moment.

1276
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:33,450
By the way, she wants him
to come and stay.

1277
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,419
So we can all meet him.

1278
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:39,056
She wants us to invite
a hawker of newspaper scandal

1279
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,825
to stay as a guest
in this house?

1280
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:43,193
It's lucky I have
a sense of irony.

1281
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:51,068
(crying)

1282
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,540
ANNA:
Not you, too.

1283
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,255
What's the matter?

1284
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,990
Why ask?

1285
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:13,958
You don't care.

1286
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:16,293
Ethel.

1287
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,162
Perhaps if you stopped going on

1288
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:20,931
about all the marvelous things
you're going to do

1289
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:21,966
when you leave service.

1290
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:25,870
But you've got
to have dreams.

1291
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:27,537
Don't you have any dreams?

1292
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,307
Of course I do.

1293
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:35,012
Big dreams.

1294
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:37,982
It's just that I know now
they won't be coming true.

1295
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:47,925
(door opens)

1296
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,594
What do you want?

1297
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:52,062
I think I left
my book in here.

1298
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:02,006
Is that all?

1299
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:03,473
You were praying.

1300
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,475
Don't be ridiculous.

1301
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,977
You were praying.

1302
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:08,012
What were you praying for?

1303
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:14,985
Please go.
I'm tired.

1304
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,220
(door closes)

1305
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:38,342
Dear Lord, I don't pretend
to have much credit with you.

1306
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:42,679
I'm not even sure
that you're there.

1307
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:47,952
But if you are, and if I've ever
done anything good,

1308
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:50,420
I beg you to keep him safe.

1309
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,986
You look very comfortable
there, Corporal.

1310
01:05:23,988 --> 01:05:26,490
Would you like some, sir?

1311
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:29,426
We've got condensed milk
and sugar.

1312
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,861
I won't ask
how you managed that.

1313
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,501
Go on, sir.

1314
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,208
That's nectar.

1315
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,142
Are you sure
you can spare it?

1316
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:48,512
Gladly, if we can talk
about the old days

1317
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,314
and forget about all this
for a minute or two.

1318
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:55,352
Do you ever hear from anyone?

1319
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:56,686
Oh, yes.

1320
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,022
Miss O'Brien keeps me informed.

1321
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:00,324
Lady Edith's driving.

1322
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:03,227
Lady Sybil's training
as a nurse.

1323
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:08,665
Miss O'Brien tells me
the hospital's busier than ever,

1324
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,100
with the wounded coming in.

1325
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,768
Is that true?

1326
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,070
Certainly is.

1327
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:14,371
They had a concert
when I was there,

1328
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:16,540
to raise extra funds.

1329
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:21,045
I'm curious, sir.

1330
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:25,115
Do you think I could ever get
a transfer back to the hospital?

1331
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:28,252
Seeing as it's war work?

1332
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,320
Well, you'd have to be sent home
from the front first.

1333
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:34,591
And then you might have
to pull a few strings.

1334
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:40,630
Thank you for that.

1335
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,567
Thank you very much.

1336
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,570
What would my mother say?

1337
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:49,539
Me entertaining the future
Earl of Grantham to tea.

1338
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:53,710
War has a way of distinguishing

1339
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,679
between the things that matter
and the things that don't.

1340
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:31,581
(breathing nervously)

1341
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,815
(yells in pain)

1342
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:17,461
Thank you.

1343
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:19,529
Thank you
for my deliverance.

1343
01:08:20,305 --> 01:09:20,886

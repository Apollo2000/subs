1
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:07,036
_

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,528
So, why couldn't we just have

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,396
dinner with your boss
at a nice restaurant?

4
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:12,097
Because I'm trying
to make partner, Greg.

5
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:13,699
I need him to see the real me.

6
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,769
Then why did we put away
all the photos of Lark?

7
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,215
Oh, he doesn't know I have a kid.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,301
Also, he thinks we're vegan,

9
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,174
so the food's gonna suck... sorry.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,697
I mean, come on.

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,458
That is, like, legit crazy.

12
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:28,701
I cannot believe you went
to Camp Running Wolf, too.

13
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:30,870
Now, is this the camp
where the kid got murdered,

14
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:32,071
or the one with the cool hot dogs?

15
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,207
Same camp. Hey, Paul.

16
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:36,809
Hey, Paul, do you like mashed potatoes?

17
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,444
Oh, we don't have any
mashed potatoes, hon.

18
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:40,079
Hot potato, hot potato,

19
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,347
we'll be friends forever.

20
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:43,282
Hot potato, hot potato,
we'll be friends for life.

21
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,818
Mush it, dash it, mix it, mash it.

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,161
Never use a knife.

23
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,556
Okay, if you can lay down some lyrics,

24
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,358
I can beatbox.

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,327
And that's when I realized

26
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,329
somebody has to rescue

27
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:57,563
the teacup poodles.

28
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,098
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

29
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,814
- Of course, yeah.
- Absolutely.

30
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:02,702
How many poodles have you rescued?

31
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:05,772
Three. We're very picky.

32
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,074
Mm-hmm. I love a discerning charity.

33
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,709
Yeah, do you take donations?

34
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,978
As a matter of fact, I do.

35
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,945
Great.

36
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,213
I'm gonna get my checkbook.

37
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,848
Who should I make the check out to?

38
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,350
Well, the foundation's in my name,

39
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:19,062
so just make it out to me.

40
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,945
Done.

41
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,625
I can't remember Paul's wife's name.

42
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,794
Oh, you should have used
the rhyming trick, Jen-Pen.

43
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,629
Did you do the rhyming trick?

44
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,397
Not for her, but I did for Tall Paul

45
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,566
- who buys a ball in a stall.
- Okay.

46
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:34,600
Here, don't worry, I got you.

47
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,335
Hey, uh, how do I spell your name?

48
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:37,804
Just the way it sounds.

49
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,873
Got it. Then that is how
we are gonna spell it.

50
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,408
Yeah, if you don't do the rhyming trick

51
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,743
out of the gate, you're kinda screwed.

52
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:46,079
Okay. We're still looking
for that checkbook.

53
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,513
Oh, we found it.

54
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:50,116
Greg, do you not know
what we're doing in here?

55
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:51,584
I honestly don't.

56
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,854
Are you serious? None
of the other assistants

57
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:56,456
know Paul's wife's name?

58
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,168
Yeah, of course I know the
other assistants' names.

59
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,960
Yeah, of course I know your name.

60
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:03,316
Not today, okay? Please don't test me.

61
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:05,832
Yeah, no. We're done here.

62
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,266
You can get back to the funeral.

63
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:09,001
You want to know what
I've been getting into?

64
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,536
- Genealogy.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:11,771
- Mm.
- Did you know

66
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:14,006
that I'm named after my great uncle?

67
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,843
But, medically, great aunt.

68
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,010
Yeah, it's kind of like

69
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,712
that movie, Mrs.
Doubtfire... you've seen it.

70
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:21,948
Except her name was Greg.

71
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,050
You know, I've never
seen Mrs. Doubtfire.

72
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,251
What?

73
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:27,220
So, are you named after anybody?

74
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:28,988
Well, you know, there was this garden

75
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,356
in the home that I grew up in,

76
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,859
so, obviously...

77
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,294
- Pfft, yeah, obviously.
- Obviously.

78
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,531
Ding. Sounds like the coffee's ready.

79
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,100
- Greg, will you meet me in the kitchen? 
- Uh-huh.

80
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:42,902
Her name is related to a garden.

81
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:44,270
- Okay, I'm just gonna throw some out there.
- Okay.

82
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:45,605
- You tell me if any one lands.
- Yeah.

83
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,173
- Okay, Lily.
- Good.

84
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:48,207
- Myrtle.
- Yep.

85
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,009
- Fern.
- Maybe.

86
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:51,344
- Fence.
- No. Yeah, that's a hard pass.

87
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:52,545
Fence Saltarelli?

88
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,881
I mean, this is a disaster, Greg.

89
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,749
Like, if she finds out
that we don't know her name

90
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:58,551
after spending an
entire evening together,

91
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,886
she's gonna hate us.

92
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,587
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

93
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:04,190
Probably more you, but mm-hmm.

94
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,752
Do I have something in my nose, Bunny?

95
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,197
No. All good. Clear.

96
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,865
Bunny. Her name is Bunny.

97
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:15,268
Bunny in the garden. I am very mad

98
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,869
that I did not come up with that.

99
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:20,540
Okay, who's ready for coffee?

100
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,949
Bunny, you a regular or decaf girl?

101
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,878
Uh, regular, I guess.

102
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,547
You sure? 'Cause I can
whip up a pot of decaf

103
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,548
like that, Bunny.

104
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,284
Okay.

105
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:34,487
Excuse me, I forgot the sugar.

106
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,888
Crap, I got it wrong.

107
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,023
You should have seen
the look he gave her.

108
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,091
I mean, I clearly called
her the wrong name.

109
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,059
This is terrible.

110
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,561
I knew she wasn't a Bunny.

111
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,763
I mean, I didn't want to
say anything, but I knew it.

112
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,665
I just screwed myself
out of making partner

113
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,733
because I couldn't remember one name.

114
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:48,868
Now I'm gonna have to keep parking

115
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,736
between assistant what's-her-face

116
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:53,239
and Mrs. Never Flushes.

117
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,908
You know, it's actually
getting a little late.

118
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,677
We're gonna take a pass on the coffee.

119
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,279
Oh, no, no, stay. Just-just one cup.

120
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,515
We've got cream, sugar, agave.

121
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:03,683
You know what I say? I like it,

122
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:05,318
I love it, agave have it.

123
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,453
- Huh?
- We don't have any agave.

124
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,777
Well, damn it, Bunny!

125
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,493
You should have told me that earlier.

126
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:15,895
I mean,

127
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,798
Is he a funny bunny or what?

128
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,267
- You call your husband "Bunny"? 
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:24,858
'Cause we were wondering why
you were calling her Bunny.

130
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:27,139
- Yeah.
- That's my pet name for Rose.

131
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,942
No way. Yeah, I just
call everybody Bunny.

132
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,945
Rose blows her nose and
never shows her toes.

133
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:34,347
Got it.

134
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:37,416
- So, you bunnies want to stay for coffee?
- Hmm?

135
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:39,619
- What the heck, what's one cup?
- Yes.

136
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,354
- Great.
- Great, great. Hey, say, do you, uh...

137
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:43,923
you have any camp songs
about drinking coffee?

138
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,424
We were children at camp.

139
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:46,592
We didn't drink coffee.

140
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:49,028
Yeah. But we did drink bug juice!

141
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,592
Oh! Bug juice!

142
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,400
So, did you go to sleepaway camp, Peter?

143
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,583
- Uh...
- Uh...

144
00:04:56,608 --> 00:05:00,773
Yeah, Peter, uh, went
to break-dancing camp.

145
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,074
_

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,417
Oh. Oh, you just getting home?

147
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,915
I was just, uh, checking the
expiration date on the mustard.

148
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,490
Still got two months, but
that'll sneak up on us.

149
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,723
I'm sorry that I didn't
text you back last night.

150
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:20,814
- Oh.
- I lost my phone

151
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,872
in the dugout at Dodger Stadium.

152
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,501
Crazy night.

153
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:26,899
It turns out the players
are super nice, by the way.

154
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,001
Yeah. They seem really nice on TV.

155
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:29,966
Yeah.

156
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,305
Hey, uh, next time,

157
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:33,773
maybe we could just have a signal

158
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,107
so that I know you're okay.

159
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,443
That signal could be
that you text me back.

160
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,031
Totally.

161
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,446
Hey, when you first said

162
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:42,671
that we should break up, I...

163
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:46,800
wasn't so sure, but I am
learning so much about myself.

164
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:49,526
Like, it turns out I'm super funny!

165
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:51,157
Guys laugh at everything I say,

166
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,858
even when I don't understand the joke.

167
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,760
See?

168
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:56,028
Look at me.

169
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:57,700
Yeah. Look at you.

170
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,469
Where's Clementine, anyway?

171
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,572
The Dodgers have an away game,
and, evidently, she's good luck.

172
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,574
Oh, yeah, that's the dream.

173
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:10,543
To be a young, nubile woman.

174
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,011
And so funny!

175
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,312
- Right?
- Yeah.

176
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,115
She's...

177
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,552
But what you got's not bad.

178
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,900
You got to get out there
and let the ladies know

179
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,466
you're down to clown.

180
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:22,216
I'm respecting the honeymoon
period of our divorce.

181
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,381
I think Clementine and
I should take some time

182
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:25,913
and examine our feelings.

183
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:29,137
Oh, feelings are what got you
in this mess in the first place.

184
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:32,590
Marriage, responsibilities,
that stupid house.

185
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:34,184
Man, get out there and have some fun.

186
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,701
No strings attached.

187
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:36,902
I don't know if I'm ready.

188
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,738
You listen to me.

189
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,606
You take it from a man who
also got married too soon.

190
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,042
You never get these
years of freedom back.

191
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:44,810
Now, I love your mother.

192
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:46,606
- You know?
- Uh-huh.

193
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:49,509
Very happy with the
choices I've made, but...

194
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,117
if I had a chance to
do it all over again,

195
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,418
I'd do it a little different.

196
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,086
And I'd do a lot more of it.

197
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:55,221
You know?

198
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:56,295
Again, love your mom.

199
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,490
Very happy.

200
00:06:57,813 --> 00:06:59,458
But you got to get out there.

201
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:02,261
You got to live life for both of us.

202
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:11,310
Oh, I am so glad we matched.

203
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,805
I thought an app for divorcees

204
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,341
was gonna be filled with
a bunch of lonely losers.

205
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:18,334
God, it is just so
fascinating to meet someone

206
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,443
who's this naturally smooth.

207
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:22,114
Oh, thank you.

208
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,216
I love that we have so much in common:

209
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,619
still living with our exes,
just got on the market,

210
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,373
not looking for anything serious.

211
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:32,658
Yes! Let's just go crazy
and have fun, you know?

212
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,132
We all have HPV anyway.

213
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,439
- We do?
- Oh, yeah.

214
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:38,631
So, you're so smooth.

215
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,332
Okay.

216
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,935
Two mugs.

217
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,704
We did it! We did it!

218
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,534
Oh, wait, did we do it, or are
we just telling people we did?

219
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,352
Doesn't matter to me.

220
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:49,659
- No. We did it.
- Yes!

221
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:53,009
- This is for Alex.
- Alex! Oh, buddy.

222
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,246
Oh!

223
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:55,981
Ah, she sounds hot. Yeah.

224
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,218
I mean... "she," right?

225
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,285
Not that it matters. Doesn't matter.

226
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:00,740
Just want you to have fun,

227
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,301
'cause this is the life
that we were meant to lead.

228
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,334
Thank you, Dad.

229
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,891
No, thank you.

230
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,343
This is... a one-night stand for man,

231
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:12,386
and one giant-night stand for mankind!

232
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,668
I love your mother,
and I would never choose

233
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,403
to do anything different.

234
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:18,634
Okay.

235
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:20,272
- Yeah, okay.
- I can go?

236
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,440
All right.

237
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,676
Get out of here.

238
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,599
Man.

239
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:31,617
Oh.

240
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:32,618
Hold on.

241
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,819
Hi.

242
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:34,991
So, I, uh,

243
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,689
borrowed one of your shirts.

244
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:38,691
Hope that's okay. It's a little,

245
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,961
- uh, tight on me.
- Yeah, I have really narrow shoulders.

246
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:44,830
Oh, well, easier to
wrap my arms around you.

247
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:47,781
You're like a sexy...

248
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:49,471
string cheese.

249
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:53,239
And I cannot wait to peel
off another piece tonight.

250
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,207
Sure. Why don't we make a weekend of it?

251
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,810
Great. Go ahead and change
the locks, you son of a bitch.

252
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:59,812
The kids and I have a place to stay.

253
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:02,852
Whew! Coffee. Yes, please.

254
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,818
- Thank you.
- Sure.

255
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,119
I got you!

256
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:08,787
Hey, no running, please.

257
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:11,457
Gosh, guys, I told you not
to leave your clothes here.

258
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,195
Mom, this doesn't taste
like our apple juice.

259
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:17,930
Oh.

260
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,671
I need someone to wipe me!

261
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:22,835
Honey, can you do it?

262
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:24,236
I got the last one.

263
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:25,237
Oh.

264
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,509
Oh, here he comes,

265
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:32,444
barely standing... I
like the look of this.

266
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,281
I haven't slept... they
kept me up all night.

267
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,883
Do we have any sippy cups?

268
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,919
"They"? "Sippy cups"?

269
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:42,044
Ooh, you nasty! Come on.

270
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:44,725
_

271
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,244
- Wait, w-wait. 
- Huh?

272
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:50,612
What if we didn't?

273
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:52,548
Have sex? Colleen, we've been married

274
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,616
for, like, two seconds...
we can't start that now.

275
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:57,286
No. Use protection.

276
00:09:57,288 --> 00:10:00,255
No shirts, all skins.

277
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:01,003
Seriously?

278
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:02,285
- Yeah.
- But I thought

279
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,210
we were gonna wait
until your horoscope said

280
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,711
whatever dumb things horoscopes say.

281
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,347
Well, yeah. But then
I fell off the balcony,

282
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:11,384
and I realized that life doesn't
always allow you to make plans.

283
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:14,720
We both want a family, and
we're not getting any younger.

284
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,490
- I can't believe we're gonna do this.
- I know.

285
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:18,652
I love you so much.

286
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:19,980
I love you, too.

287
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,467
Mmm...

288
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:36,021
Hey, baby. Why you packin'?

289
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,046
Well, we have to be ready
to go to the hospital.

290
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,004
I could go into labor at any minute.

291
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,458
Whoa!

292
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:46,419
How can you be pregnant already?
We just had sex last night.

293
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:48,754
That's how it works, Matt.

294
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:50,656
I thought there would be more time.

295
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:51,657
And I don't know

296
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,259
anything about having a baby.

297
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,861
We need a baby room, and
we can't afford to move.

298
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,130
We've already moved, silly.

299
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:02,468
Welcome back to the garage, dear.

300
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,737
Stay as long as you want.

301
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:07,473
Just maybe don't breathe too deeply

302
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,441
near the paint

303
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,810
or the gas or the rat feces.

304
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,578
It might not be good for that baby.

305
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,779
John, that mobile

306
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:16,382
- is perfect.
- Thanks.

307
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,484
Just a few things I had laying around.

308
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,802
Um, we're not gonna be staying long.

309
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:24,390
I'm gonna get a better job.

310
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,125
I know a guy who's hiring.

311
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:30,863
I want to thank you
for this opportunity.

312
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:33,833
I'm a hard worker,
and I want to do well.

313
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:36,905
Well... I want to sit and drink all day,

314
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,182
but you don't see me doing that.

315
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:40,506
You do know

316
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:43,576
- this job i-is for father, right? 
- Yes.

317
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,069
So what makes you
think you're qualified?

318
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:55,087
Well, n-no one's really
qualified to be a dad

319
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,477
until you become one. Right?

320
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:59,692
Sounds like someone
who's gonna wipe the baby

321
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:01,060
from back to front.

322
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:02,428
There's a wrong way to wipe?

323
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,462
Next.

324
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,300
Ah. Did you get the job?

325
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:12,249
Uh, no. He turned into a T. rex
and chased me out of the office.

326
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,174
There he is now.

327
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:16,876
Well, just make sure you get a job

328
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:18,144
before the credit card bill comes.

329
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:19,278
'Cause I just bought everything

330
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,613
we're gonna need for the babies.

331
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,082
And an expensive governess.

332
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:25,985
Hey. Babies?

333
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:26,886
Yeah.

334
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:29,174
Um... is that Spanish

335
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,290
- for one baby?
- No, silly.

336
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,658
We're having quadruplets.

337
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,960
Ah. Really?

338
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,796
Think... think I would
have remembered that.

339
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,249
Uh, got a lot

340
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:39,532
going on in my life right now.

341
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,433
You know? And I'm just

342
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:41,600
starting to feel...

343
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,035
really...

344
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,603
overwhelmed.

345
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,618
Interesting.

346
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,287
And tell me what you see.

347
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,311
- _
- Happy baby?

348
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,580
- _ 
- Uh-huh. And this one?

349
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:55,815
Happier baby?

350
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,749
Mm-hmm.

351
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,268
Wait, did I get that wrong or right?

352
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:00,167
There are no wrong or right answers

353
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,954
when it comes to parenting.

354
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:03,756
Even if you forget

355
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:06,125
everything else, you'll
be okay if you remember

356
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:09,361

You missed it!

381
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:07,586
Don't worry. They have
your panicked eyes.

Oh.

- No.

00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,106
I was a couch,

390
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,975
and Tim was digging
around for loose change.

391
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:33,629
Wait.

392
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,013

Wait till you see what I got.

402
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,380
Is it something other
than what's in your hand?

403
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,973
Listen, I know it's been a lot
having our whole family here

404
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:03,487
since our house fire,
so this chore wheel

405
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,448
is gonna help us... pay our Hughes.

406
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,222
- That's a fun joke.
- Right?

407
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:11,894
Every time you make
it, I think, "Oh, fun."

408
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,086
Sophia, let's spin it and see who gets

409
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,921
to help Mom-Mom with dinner tonight.

410
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,695
Oh, Mom, wait, wait, wait.

411
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,427
Me. I'll get that. I
got it. I got it, got it,

412
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,742
- got it. I got it.
- Thank you.

413
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,382
Yeah, sure. It's...

414
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:29,224
Whoa. There's a lot of
empty wine bottles in here.

415
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:31,552
Didn't we just empty
this a couple days ago?

416
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,289
Oh, yeah. Well, it's a good point.

417
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,319
Now I can go to the liquor store.

418
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,243
Anyway, turns out it was a duck.

419
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,172
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, hey.

420
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,276
I'm pretty sure that mom
has a drinking problem.

421
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,786
Okay? Now that I've been
living here, I'm watching her.

422
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,657
She's drinking a lot of wine.

423
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,177
What do you think is going on?

424
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,255
I don't know, Greg.

425
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,805
I mean, maybe she realizes

426
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,063
that she wasted the
best years of her life

427
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:01,100
raising three kids that
don't appreciate it. Hmm?

428
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:06,729
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
she's got a drinking problem.

429
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:10,399
- And here's baby Greg taking a bath. 
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:12,876
All that tushy hair
fell off at three months.

431
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,416
- Yeah. Some of it came back.
- Mm.

432
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,683
Hey, uh, Mom, you need
a refill on your wine?

433
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,502
No, thanks, dear. I'm fine.

434
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,423
Oh, Mom, wait, wait, wait.
Let me help you with that.

435
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:26,191
- Mm.
- Oh, this is gonna be so fun.

436
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,397
- No, I-I learned a really cool... 
- No, honey, I-I really

437
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,695
- think that this should be a one-per... 
- No.

438
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,648
I just learned a really cool way

439
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,675
to get the pit right
on out of the avocado.

440
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,248
- Wait. Uh...
- Watch. Look.

441
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:37,093
Oh, wow.

442
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:37,947
How great...?

443
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:40,258
- How great is that?
- That's a wonderful life hack.

444
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:43,197
- I mean, this is...
- Oh, thank you for that.

445
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:44,710
'Cause you know...

446
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,512
this is the most important ingredient.

447
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,280
It's a secret. No one tells you,

448
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:50,749
but it what... it's what gives
the guacamole the-the thing.

449
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,117
No, no, no, can't drink

450
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,053
the secret ingredient. Mom!

451
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:58,457
Okay, so Mom may be drinking,

452
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,326
but she definitely doesn't
have a drinking problem.

453
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:03,095
- No. Mom has a Heather problem.
- Yeah.

454
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:05,631
Matt, you are moving up in the world.

455
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,916
- Welcome to the top two kids.
- Yeah.

456
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,119
I hope you enjoy
inside jokes about Matt.

457
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,577
I mean, Heather.

458
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,405
Jokes about Heather.

459
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:20,112
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

460
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:22,081
- Um, we were talking...
- Mm.

461
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,547
And-and we've noticed that, uh,

462
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,694
well, you seem a little bit overwhelmed

463
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,120
by having Heather here.

464
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:31,857
Oh, no, no. It-It's joyous.

465
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,960
It's like when a comet
blazes into the atmosphere,

466
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:39,105
and primitive people everywhere
think the world is ending,

467
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,433
and yet it may never come
again in your lifetime,

468
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,435
and so you should treasure it.

469
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:46,646
You do know that it is okay

470
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,507
to say when Heather is bothering you?

471
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,676
- She's not! Mm.
- Uh...

472
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,060
Heather means well.

473
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:56,226
And that's why she
deletes entire seasons

474
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,349
of Shark Week

475
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:58,917
on the DVR.

476
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,886
To free up space.

477
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,454
Where's JAG, damn it?

478
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,856
They don't make it anymore,

479
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,171
and once you delete it,
they're gone forever.

480
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:08,881
Yeah, okay. Mom, the first step

481
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,662
in dealing with your Heather problem

482
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,366
is admitting that you
have a Heather problem.

483
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,701
You're right.

484
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:17,569
I've hit rock bottom.

485
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,673
But don't tell Heather.

486
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,084
She'll be crushed.

487
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,345
Speaking of "crushed,"

488
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:30,048
why don't we whip up a batch of
daiquiris before she gets back?

489
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,650
Come on, kids.

490
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,820
Yeah, I don't think Mom
would admit this, but I think

491
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,190
maybe all the drinking is just
from her being overwhelmed.

492
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,225
Oh, Greg, well, duh.

493
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:42,194
I mean, yeah, of
course, she's overwhelmed

494
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,929
with all of us here.

495
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:45,831
Oh. No, I don't think you understand.

496
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,766
Her problem is actually with...

497
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,368
Uh, uh, uh, it's okay.

498
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,836
Heather gets it.

499
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,273
Oh. I got it. Yeah. Oh.

500
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,209
You are the best, sweetest brothers.

501
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:01,747
Part of being in the top two
is letting number three fail.

502
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:03,782
Right on.

503
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:05,684
Wait. Does that mean that you guys...?

504
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,388
Mm-hmm. For a long time.

505
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,876
What-What's going on?

506
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:16,021
We thought that you could
use some peace and quiet.

507
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:17,568
Yeah, so we're all going to Disneyland.

508
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:18,943
I'm gonna fake sunstroke

509
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,935
and then hang out in the
recovery tent all day.

510
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,615
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.

511
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,857
And while they're gone,

512
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,558
you and I are gonna do
a little at-home spa day.

513
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:34,062
- It's like a comet. 
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,696
It only comes once in a lifetime,

515
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:40,621
and you must treasure it.

516
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,058
You are... you are really feeling this.

517
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,309
Oh! Oh.

518
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,347
It's a man I'm excited for you to meet!

519
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:52,080
Oh, Mom, no!

520
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:54,082
I am not divorcing Tim!

521
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:56,602
You have to stop asking.

522
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:03,003
Heather, this is "Hecor."

523
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,458
He's a contractor.

524
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,317
He's gonna start work on your house!

525
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:10,299
You-You hired him?

526
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:13,731
He's being paid a
premium to go extra fast,

527
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:17,306
and that way, you can
move back to your own home.

528
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:19,121
Oh, my gosh, I can't
wait to get started.

529
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:20,746
Let me get my look book.

530
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:25,266
Here. You're gonna need this.

531
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,290

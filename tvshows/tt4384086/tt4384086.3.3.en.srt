1
00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:06,906
_

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,692
Hey, you guys, guess
what I found in my room.

3
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:12,327
That pillow you used to call Rob Lowe?

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,095
- No.
- Oh, remember when I washed

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,264
the Rob Lowe pillow in a new detergent,

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,333
and you got a rash all over your body?

7
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:20,802
It was everywhere.

8
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,871
Why was it everywhere, Heather?

9
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:24,506
No. Mom, thank you.

10
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:26,255
I found the map

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,077
- for the time capsule that we buried.
- No way!

12
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,812
Do you remember, we were
gonna dig it up in high school,

13
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,280
and then, you know,
we stopped being nerds.

14
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:35,183
Yeah, I wouldn't remember,

15
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,752
'cause you guys never
included me in anything.

16
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:39,187
I'd always hear you guys give each other

17
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:39,900
the secret signal.

18
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:41,087
"Greg's asleep.

19
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:43,191
Greg is asleep."

20
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:44,626
But I wasn't.

21
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,827
- No, we knew that.
- Yeah.

22
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,595
That's what made it so funny.

23
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:50,265
Yeah, well, it left me
psychologically scarred.

24
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:51,360
I mean, not as much as the time

25
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,151
that Dad busted in on
me holding a shotgun

26
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,686
while I was pooping, but still.

27
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,087
Oh, I remember that.

28
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,823
- Mm.
- Why don't you go dig it up?

29
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,825
It would be so much fun.

30
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,761
- I'm in if you are.
- I-I'm totally in.

31
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,475
Yeah! Wonder Twins activate!

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,350
Hey, you guys aren't
twins. They're not twins.

33
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,434
It's okay. We'll make popsicles.

34
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,161
Just like we did all those Friday nights

35
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:12,170
when you were in high school.

36
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,707
Mom, I'm married now, okay?

37
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,343
- Okay.
- I'll have to ask Jen.

38
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:21,612
This is really nice.

39
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:24,276
Yeah. This is much better
than making popsicles.

40
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,487
Greg's asleep!

41
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:27,486
Greg's asleep!

42
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,688
- What is that?
- Greg's asleep!

43
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,645
That is the sound of my
brother and sister loving me!

44
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,870
- Greg!
- I'm coming!

45
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,027
Greg's asleep!

46
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,395
Greg is asleep!

47
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,164
You can come, too, if you want, honey!

48
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,704
No, I'll just stay here with our baby.

49
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:51,743
Hey, guys.

50
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,311
Listen, Sophia knows exactly

51
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,413
what's in that basket, so
don't take anything, okay?

52
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,315
Yeah, okay. Oh, hey,
listen, before we go,

53
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,068
I-I just wanted to say that, you know,

54
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:03,522
I-I'm really touched
that you included me.

55
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,624
I mean, all of my life,
all I wanted was...

56
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,425
Told you we should've left him at home.

57
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,960
Yeah. O-Okay.

58
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,296
I'm just trying to say I
love you guys, that's all.

59
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,031
Shut up, Greg!

60
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,267
Love you a lot.

61
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,002
Come on!

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,613
- Come on!
- It's okay... yeah, I'm coming!

63
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:22,038
I'm coming!

64
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,410
Wait up, guys!

65
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,186
Okay.

66
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,955
All right.

67
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,290
Here, here.

68
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,225
- Thanks.
- And a light.

69
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,027
Here.

70
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:44,427
All right, ten running mans

71
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:45,921
- that way.
- Okay.

72
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,265
All right.

73
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,201
One, two, three...

74
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,690
Okay. This is the drain pipe.

75
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:59,227
"Don't look into it, or you will
get flushed up into the toilet."

76
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,795
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,065
Don't look, don't look,
don't look. Good job.

78
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,905
This is so great.

79
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:13,408
I haven't been to this
park for, like, 30 years.

80
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,043
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

81
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,678
I mean, I was too cool in high school,

82
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,645
and now that I'm an adult,

83
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,647
I just buy my drugs
online like everybody else.

84
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,282
Well, when you and Colleen have kids,

85
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,351
you'll be here, like, every day.

86
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:24,686
Why? Because this is the place I'm gonna

87
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:26,751
set them free because
I can't afford them?

88
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:29,197
Hey. I thought you were
excited about starting a family.

89
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:30,056
Oh, totally.

90
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:31,442
The kind of excited where you wake up

91
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,100
in a puddle of sweat every night.

92
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,796
- Oh, you get the night sweats, too?
- Oh, yeah.

93
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,397
Tim says it might be meat related.

94
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,832
You could be over-sausage-ing.

95
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,634
Huh.

96
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,836
I just, I don't know
about the whole baby thing,

97
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:43,140
guys, seriously.

98
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:46,155
What if I screw up?

99
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:47,795
It's okay.

100
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,811
I mean, that's really what parenting is.

101
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,514
It's just making one terrible
decision after the next.

102
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:55,617
And then just trying to fix
it before Jen finds out.

103
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:58,286
I don't know, man. You said yourself,

104
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:01,386
I scarred you. I mean, what
if that's all that I'm good at?

105
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,641
Hey.

106
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:06,094
Three-fingered tree.

107
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:10,291
And just on the other
side is Stumpy Joe.

108
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,534
- Stumpy Joe.
- Stumpy Joe.

109
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:15,036
- Stumpy... let's go!
- Come on, man.

110
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,330
Oh, look.

111
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:18,804
- There's our X.
- Oh.

112
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,774
Wow!

113
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:22,477
Look at that! Oh! Oh, it's wet.

114
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,046
And it didn't rain. Yeah,
something probably peed here.

115
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,649
Oh, man. You know, we could
be digging here all night,

116
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:29,150
depending on how deep you guys...

117
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,919
There's our time capsule.

118
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:33,388
Oh. So, what did you bury it in?

119
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,806
Like, a waterproof safe
or a hollowed-out missile?

120
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:36,890
Okay.

121
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,528
Oh, just generic can. That's cool.

122
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,629
Hey, can I open it?

123
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,065
Yeah, no, you should definitely open it.

124
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,214
- Oh...
- Oh.

125
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,435
Ugh.

126
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,028
Oh, God, are those bones?

127
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:50,730
Oh, you know what?

128
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,800
I don't think that this is the map

129
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,208
to where we buried the time capsule.

130
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,111
I think this is the map

131
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:58,853
to where we buried your dead guinea pig.

132
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:00,848
Super Greggy?

133
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,186
But Mom said he ran away
because I refused to take a bath.

134
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,388
Tell him, Matt, just tell him.

135
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,690
Tell me what, Matthew?

136
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,626
Dad sucked Super Greggy
up into the Shop-Vac.

137
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:13,261
What?

138
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,694
Why didn't you tell me?

139
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:15,797
Well, I was trying to protect you.

140
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,932
Dad killed all kinds of
stuff you never knew about.

141
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,637
Hey, look at that protective instinct.

142
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:22,170
You're already a mama bear.

143
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,272
Yeah, but it was just so
embarrassing to watch Greg cry.

144
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:26,240
Well, that is a very
important part of parenting.

145
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,142
- Fear and shame.
- Yeah.

146
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,877
You're gonna be great at this.

147
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,130
Huh, you know, maybe you're right.

148
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:34,549
Think of all the scars
you saved me from getting.

149
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,250
I mean, not physical scars,

150
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,020
'cause you were always
very, very rough with me.

151
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,692
Yeah. But you know what?

152
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:42,683
It turned out okay.

153
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,425
I mean, we all did. Huh?

154
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,566
Thanks, you guys.

155
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,676
Well, at least, uh, Super Greggy
Two died of natural causes.

156
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,501
- Natural causes?
- Yeah.

157
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,969
Dad thought he was a moldy orange

158
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,471
and threw him against a tree.

159
00:05:58,102 --> 00:05:59,802
Wow.

160
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:02,800
Gonna need to take some time.

161
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:06,143
Put him back.

162
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:07,267
All right.

163
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:15,516
_

164
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,527
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh, my God,

165
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:20,962
you guys must be starving.

166
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,631
I could not get a Lyft to come get me.

167
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,335
I mean, I got connected, but
then the driver cancelled.

168
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,734
Why does that keep happening?

169
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:27,835
Well, what's your rating?

170
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:29,337
I don't know. Greg says I can't check

171
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,272
without incurring some
huge fee or something.

172
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,605
Yes, that's right, Heather.

173
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,521
It ends up costing me quite a lot.

174
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,011
Oh, God, Greg. Don't be crazy.
Anybody can check their rating.

175
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,880
Okay, you know what, let's talk
about something else, shall we?

176
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:41,315
Let's talk about Matt
and how poor he is.

177
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,403
- How poor is he?
- Oh.

178
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,861
1.2.

179
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,355
What did you do to these drivers?

180
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,323
No, no, no. This can't be right.

181
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,692
1.2?

182
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,293
I'm a four, and I've never once

183
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,662
guessed my driver's ethnicity correctly.

184
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,064
I-I just, I don't understand.
Why would anyone ever

185
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,533
rate me this low? Like,
I'm a great passenger.

186
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:00,668
You are. You have one star.

187
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,703
That's a good star.

188
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,672
I mean, the-the sun is one star.

189
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,709
You know? I-I... I love you.

190
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,410
No, this is not right.

191
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:10,578
I am polite.

192
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm tidy. I'm nice.

193
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:13,933
I mean, I'm nicer than
the average person,

194
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,950
mostly because the average
person is a living nightmare.

195
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,185
God, I hate people. What was my point?

196
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,387
Oh, yeah. Who's super nice?

197
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,022
This girl.

198
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:24,425
What? Why is everyone
looking at the trees?

199
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:27,261
You got to butter up your
driver a little bit, Jen.

200
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,509
You know, it's like high school
when you need to make "friends"

201
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,693
with the bus driver, let
him think you're gonna maybe

202
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,852
meet him behind the roller rink.

203
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,108
Cool specific example, Heather.

204
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,724
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, Sophia.

205
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,476
You know you're done with the sugar.

206
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,945
I'm so sorry. I knew she wasn't allowed.

207
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,079
She's just so charming.

208
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,347
Yeah.

209
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,688
Took forever to get this Lyft.

210
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,624
Yeah, but now we're up and running.

211
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,393
We got a full aunt and niece
bonding day ahead. You excited?

212
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,331
You know me. If there's
candy, I'm getting in the car.

213
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,199
Okay, we're gonna circle back to that,

214
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:08,075
'cause that's slightly
problematic, but for now,

215
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:10,650
how about we get to know
our driver a little bit, huh?

216
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,159
- Can you not distract me?
- What's up?

217
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:14,512
- I'm trying to concentrate on the road.
- Oh.

218
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,081
Oh, my God.

219
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,362
Driving and eating.

220
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:19,354
Ooh, and it's tuna.

221
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,311
Wow, with that amazing air freshener,

222
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,738
I can barely even smell
your seafood sandwich.

223
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:29,023
Is that sandalwood?

224
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:30,758
It is.

225
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,527
I see you.

226
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,495
I see what you do.

227
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:00,555
And it took a little girl to teach me

228
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,089
that a brother's love is more important

229
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,926
than all the slot machines in the world.

230
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,963
And?

231
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:11,962
And... I love you.

232
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,768
I love you.

233
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:16,061
And I love you.

234
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:22,940
There's this new ice cream
place across town I want to try.

235
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:25,032
The soft serve comes out of faucets,

236
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:26,814
and the cups are little, tiny toilets.

237
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,282
Real wacky stuff.

238
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,255
Yeah, but we just got you ice cream.

239
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,163
Look, Aunt Jen, we both
know what's going on here.

240
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,170
What? What do you mean?

241
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:35,694
What's going on? What?

242
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,725
You're using me to
raise your Lyft rating,

243
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,193
and I'm using you

244
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,728
to get unlimited sugar.

245
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,230
What's the problem here?

246
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,543
No problem here.

247
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,934
What else you got in
that magic bag of yours?

248
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,337
Uh... gummy fish?

249
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,873
Why not? I could use the protein.

250
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,628
Damn.

251
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:58,367
Well, looks like you
two had a big day, huh?

252
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,526
Sophia, he's talking to you.

253
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,717
Sophia.

254
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:05,438
Oh, no. Um...

255
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,588
Yeah, we did, and, um...

256
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,559
has anyone ever told you
you're weatherman handsome?

257
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,060
My mother used to say that.

258
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,528
- Oh.
- But she's dead.

259
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,564
- Okay.
- So it's really nice

260
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,296
to hear it from somebody else.

261
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,720
Say, you know what's weird?

262
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,202
She kind of looks like her.

263
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,470
Hey, wait a minute.

264
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:24,205
You don't think she
could actually be...?

265
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,573
Oh, I think for sure.

266
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,074
Yeah, totally, totally, totally.

267
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,043
Yeah, Sophia's a very old soul.

268
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,344
- Huh.
- See?

269
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,213
She can't even stay up past 4:00.

270
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,363
Home, sweet home,

271
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:37,885
and we only hit two curbs.

272
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,466
- Five stars for you.
- And you, too.

273
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:43,201
Really? Yay!

274
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,992
Move it, Sophia. Come
on, I got a great rating.

275
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,761
We got to get out of
here before he realizes

276
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:48,509
you're not the ghost of his dead mom.

277
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:51,232
I think I ate some bad fish.

278
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,635
Are you serious?!

279
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,948
Oh. Ugh. Oh, my God.

280
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,773
Um, yeah, but you know what?

281
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:01,992
Your mom is really trying
to tell you something.

282
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:03,304
Support. How can I help you?

283
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,713
I'd like to report a
passenger for suspension.

284
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,648
No. What?! Oh, come on, dude.

285
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,483
I was doing so well.

286
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:10,785
Well, I'd like to report

287
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:14,038
that your car smells
better with vomit in it.

288
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,605
And your mom thinks so, too.

289
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,289
Tell him, Mom.

290
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,947
She's busy.

291
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,701
_

292
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,077
Are those Meyer Lemons?

293
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,711
Uh, yeah.

294
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,382
Oh, that's such a sexy smell.

295
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,425
If I knew you loved them that much, Mom,

296
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,951
I would've taken more
from Pam and Darryl's tree.

297
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,623
- What?
- Put these back on the tree.

298
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,552
- They're blood lemons.
- Oh, Mom, come on.

299
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,185
She gave them to me.

300
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,555
No, it's all part of her game.

301
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,230
She wants to put her
extra trash in our bins?

302
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:49,254
And if I take

303
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,316
- just one lemon...
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:54,177
Then she gains the leverage to do that.

305
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:58,975
Okay, Mom, there are actual
wars going on in the world, okay?

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,671
Oh, my God, do we not
have any Chardonnay left?

307
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,802
Hey, Mom, listen.

308
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:12,527
Pam just invited us over
for ladies' poker night.

309
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,925
It's mostly just an excuse to eat cheese

310
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,878
and then talk about how we
shouldn't be eating cheese.

311
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,944
Isn't that fantastic?

312
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,812
You always regret eating cheese.

313
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:21,814
Oh, I would just slow you down, though.

314
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,616
I've never played poker before.

315
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,385
Even better. See you tomorrow!

316
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:28,621
Bring some extra cash,

317
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,289
you know, to make it interesting.

318
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,391
I also charge for soda.

319
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:34,961
Is that my lemon?

320
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,366
Mmm, that's ripe.

321
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,735
Ciao, bella.

322
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,904
Now do you believe it's not a game?

323
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:48,235
It's just a silly poker
night with a bunch of girls.

324
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,927
What do you have to lose?

325
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:53,061
$300 is the buy-in.

326
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:56,349
What?! That's my entire
monthly hair removal budget.

327
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,217
Mom, maybe we should sit this one out.

328
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:00,353
No, I just got all this

329
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,221
from the change we've been saving up.

330
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:03,656
But you know what?

331
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,993
The fun we had at the
Coinstar machine was enough.

332
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,427
Yo, wash your hands.

333
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:10,229
I got hepatitis from that once.

334
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:11,798
All right, everybody's in.

335
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Consider it payment for
my first poker lesson.

336
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:17,036
Ginger ale, anyone?

337
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:18,938
- Ooh!
- $2.50.

338
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,411
I have two of the people.

339
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,577
Is that anything?

340
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,846
Ah, they're not the same
people, so you have nothing.

341
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,615
Really? But they're so dressed up.

342
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,294
It's your turn to be
the big blind, Joan.

343
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,352
But I don't understand the rules yet.

344
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:36,211
I don't understand how medicine works,

345
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:38,661
but I still have to
dispense it at the pharmacy.

346
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:39,852
Mm-hmm.

347
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:48,534
I see you...

348
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,701
I see you, too, Pam. You look great.

349
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,071
Oh, no, Mom.

350
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:53,706
"I see you"... that's-that's poker talk.

351
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:55,708
I see you,

352
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,311
and I raise you $50.

353
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,813
Unless you want to fold.

354
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:03,049
No, I don't want to
fold. I want to unfold.

355
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,979
- You want to call.
- I want to call.

356
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,352
Actually, you can't
'cause you don't have

357
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,640
enough to cover, so...

358
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,365
How about, instead of money,

359
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,590
you offer something else?

360
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,014
I don't know, maybe, um...

361
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,995
I put my spillover garbage in your cans?

362
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:18,545
You were right.

363
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,099
This is a game.

364
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,501
And if I win,

365
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:24,737
I get to pick lemons off your tree,

366
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,981
when seasonally appropriate.

367
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,044
Deal.

368
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,877
Because I've got

369
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,346
three... little...

370
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,494
piggies, and they're crying

371
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,385
"wee-wee-wee" all the way
home to your recycle bin.

372
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:42,363
That's an interesting story.

373
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:46,859
Once upon a time, there
was a rabbit and a fox,

374
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,701
both very cunning animals.

375
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,412
The fox, especially.

376
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:54,634
She lets the rabbit think
she's harmless, you know.

377
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:57,012
Perhaps they're even friends.

378
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,373
And then, one day,

379
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:03,169
without warning, she strikes.

380
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,228
And...

381
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,032
that... is...

382
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:18,824
how... you...

383
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,446
lose.

384
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,797
Oh, thank God, Mom. For a minute there,

385
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,732
I thought you were just
really, really stupid.

386
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,488
Yo, that fox/rabbit thing she said,

387
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:29,831
is that a well-known parable?

388
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,266
It is now.

389
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,957
I'm so glad that I met all
of you, and perhaps someday

390
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,722
you'll tell me the story of
how you all became friends.

391
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:39,480
Well played, Joan.

392
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,661
Maybe you and I need to take
a ride out to Vegas together.

393
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:44,353
Oh, I'd love that, but...

394
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,872
I've been banned from
all the good casinos.

395
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:52,270
_

396
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,052
John?

397
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:57,062
John? The...

398
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,177
- John!
- Hmm?

399
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:01,700
The dishwasher repairman
did come by yesterday.

400
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:02,822
He stood at the door

401
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:05,982
for 15 minutes trying
to get your attention.

402
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,733
I'm not gonna suffer though

403
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,693
a "La Cucaracha" doorbell
when you can't even hear it.

404
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,128
That's impossible.

405
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,077
You didn't hear the bell.

406
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:17,336
No, you go to hell, Joanie.

407
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,480
All right. Let's get these on you there.

408
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:24,208
Now, don't worry, John, I do
this test at work all the time.

409
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,565
You hear a noise, you raise your hand.

410
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,833
While your hand is up, I'll say,

411
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,034
"Who thinks I'm handsome?"

412
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:30,570
We both laugh. Five stars on Yelp.

413
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,039
You bring it. I'll beat you at any test.

414
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,041
No, no. This isn't you against me.

415
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:36,977
I'm already in your head.

416
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:40,438
Okay, let's, uh, let's begin. Shall we?

417
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,107
See? I still got it.

418
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,559
Yeah.

419
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,658
Coming!

420
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:54,096
Oh, go ahead, run out on me.

421
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,421
You're only cheating yourself, John.

422
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,299
Look, there's nothing to be upset about.

423
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:00,734
It's very natural for a man your age

424
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,289
to start losing his hearing, but look,

425
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,980
you still got your figure.

426
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,339
God, I'd kill for a bod like that.

427
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:08,831
I am not getting hearing aids.

428
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,078
Hey!

429
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:12,112
Huh?

430
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,446
You like 'em?

431
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,945
I call 'em "A Beat Off by John."

432
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,918
Suddenly I feel less embarrassed

433
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,286
my dad's still rocking a French braid.

434
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,720
- Oh, what was that, honey?
- Hmm?

435
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:22,956
You got to speak right into the mic.

436
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,190
It's like I'm delivering
a special message

437
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,225
at a bar mitzvah.

438
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,560
Um... wow.

439
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,895
Mazel, Joshy. You're a man now.

440
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,635
Okay. Uh, hey, Mom,

441
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,733
would you, uh, would you pass the...

442
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,423
- asparagus.
- Yeah.

443
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,636
Sure.

444
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,461
So, honey,

445
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:38,836
how's the construction going?

446
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:40,574
Oh, gosh, you know what?
It was a crazy week,

447
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,076
but I feel like it's finally starting...

448
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,233
What am I doing with this?

449
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:45,078
Give it to your sister. She's talking.

450
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,114
And then we'll start doing the
drywall next week, which is...

451
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,182
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, Greg.

452
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,917
- The bagels! The bagels!
- Oh, dude, no!

453
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,189
Hey, this is for our father.

454
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,655
Yeah.

455
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,025
So, um...

456
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,994
the insurance company
finally got a check to us,

457
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,697
so now we can actually
pay the contractors.

458
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:06,088
That money was from
the insurance company?

459
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:08,252
Oh, God, no, what did
you spend it on, Tim?

460
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:09,603
I bought a leather beanbag chair.

461
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:11,371
- Oh, what?
- And a leather hat.

462
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:12,872
- Oh!
- But they gave me a free vest.

463
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:13,740
Well, okay.

464
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,075
Hey, keep up, Greg.

465
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:16,577
I'm not hearing everything.

466
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:18,147
Tim got a stupid hat.

467
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,584
Hey, Dad, you want to...

468
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,047
Just a suggestion.

469
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,782
Maybe go wireless.

470
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:24,050
Wireless?

471
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:27,454
And have every FBI van
at the curb hearing us?

472
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,122
No, thank you.

473
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,324
Hey, check out the range on this baby.

474
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,244
Hey, Mom-Mom, are these
brownies kid-safe...

475
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:34,112
Whoa, look out!

476
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,562
- Oh!
- Oh!

477
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:36,930
This is more embarrassing

478
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,765
than when Dad wears
his jeans in the pool.

479
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,283
Mom, Sophia is trying to get out

480
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:41,607
of Grandparents' Day at school,

481
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:45,205
unless she can convince Tim
to wear his old man makeup.

482
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,707
Sometimes, he tries to get into
movies for three bucks less.

483
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,942
Does that really work?

484
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,428
Because last Halloween, I
went as Orville Redenbacher.

485
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,679
I thought you were Mark Twain.

486
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,047
Why would I go as Mark Twain?

487
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,259
Kids,

488
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,850
I've tried to talk to your father,

489
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:59,336
but he can be surprisingly sensitive

490
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:02,122
for someone who still wears
an "I love to fart" T-shirt.

491
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,457
Mom, he just looks so stupid.

492
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,393
Nah, nah, nah, nah...

493
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:08,795
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

494
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,163
God, I-I just, I meant...

495
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,497
I think I'm picking up a police scanner.

496
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:15,969
Yeah, apparently, there's a
murder-suicide down the block.

497
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,704
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Oh, thank you.

498
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,322
Honey,

499
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:22,045
please try hearing aids.

500
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,222
I don't want to look old.

501
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,977
You start replacing parts on me,

502
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:30,717
and eventually you're
gonna replace all of me.

503
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,918
I'll be gone.

504
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,688
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

505
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,557
Well...

506
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:38,158
And you won't be old in these.

507
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
They're almost invisible.

508
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,217
They hook up to your phone,

509
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,332
and so you can control the volume.

510
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,157
Well...

511
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:47,974
they are awfully dope.

512
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,029
Hey. Great news, guys.

513
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:54,246
Mom-Mom gave me aids.

514
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:56,203
Hearing aids.

515
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:56,974
Oh.

516
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,239
Here. Have some coffee.

517
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,431
Hmm?

518
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,839
So, my friend Susan

519
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,503
was attacked by birds.

520
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:12,295
How are they working, dear?

521
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:14,135
Do you want to turn up the volume?

522
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:16,329
Oh, I forgot you could do that.

523
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:17,991
So, Tim, uh,

524
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,289
how's everything been with you?

525
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:20,532
I really want to hear.

526
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,453
Oh, you stepped in it now, John.

527
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,475
Well, I, um, actually,
I joined a leather club,

528
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,456
but that was... actually,

529
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,824
I-I should start at the beginning.

530
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:36,284

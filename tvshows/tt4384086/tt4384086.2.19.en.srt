3
00:00:08,946 --> 00:00:10,059
- Hi, come on in.
- Hi!

4
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:11,907
- Yay.
- Come on in.

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,696
- Thank you so much for watching
Lark last minute. - Oh, of course.

6
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:16,265
I know, Colleen, you had to work today.

7
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,554
And Matt, you had to...

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,952
- so, thank you.
- Yep.

9
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,987
Yeah, I mean, first
interview for preschool.

10
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:23,126
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, hey.

11
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:24,598
And they place a-a lot of emphasis

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,289
on diversity so...

13
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:28,902
I'm gonna have to do
the interview like this.

14
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:29,870
I wouldn't.

15
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:31,204
- Yeah, what's that?
- But no worries.

16
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:32,947
This is like my dream day off.

17
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:34,007
I love Lark.

18
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:37,366
Oh, and she is so crazy about you.

19
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:38,398
- I mean, she can't stop talking about you.
- No.

20
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:39,560
- Oh. Oh.
- You know?

21
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,926
But just be sure when she wakes up

22
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:42,315
- to reintroduce yourself.
- Yeah.

23
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:43,525
- Okay.
- Okay.

24
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,414
And so I left you a schedule

25
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,958
- Uh-huh.
- and all of her favorite toys and books,

26
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,007
some of which are in our bathroom.

27
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:49,457
That's a question for Greg.

28
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,269
- But we really should get...
- Okay.

29
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:53,460
Okay, and, uh, you know,
where's her stroller

30
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:55,862
in case we want to take her
outside, a free-range Lark?

31
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,052
- Oh.
- You know what,

32
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,591
I think let's make today
just, like, an inside day.

33
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,859
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just 'cause we don't want

34
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,428
to risk her making
friends with a new baby

35
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,595
'cause then we'd have to
be nice to the parents.

36
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,130
- Uh-huh. Got it.
- Right.

37
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,319
- Yeah. Very good.
- Okay.

38
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:08,024
Hadn't thought of that.

39
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:08,937
- Thanks, guys.
- Bye, guys.

40
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,296
- Good luck.
- Take care.

41
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,837
Aw, this is fun.

42
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,239
It's like a little window
into our future as parents.

43
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,942
You think if we ever have a
kid, it's gonna be this cute?

44
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,486
Even cuter.

45
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:21,683
Ours is gonna be one of
those multiracial babies...

46
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:22,127
Yeah.

47
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:24,264
which are the only kinds they
put in commercials these days.

48
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,905
Right.

49
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm kind of a baby expert

50
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,319
'cause, you know, I-I looked
after all of Heather's kids,

51
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,755
and then we had this
little baby bird that...

52
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,156
didn't make it.

53
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,455
Well, I'm glad you
know what you're doing

54
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,324
'cause I didn't babysit much growing up.

55
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:36,761
Really? Not even in high school?

56
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,629
Well, I did once, but
then I became known as

57
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,465
"the girl who flirted with a dad,"

58
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,468
and that kind of killed
my career and a marriage.

59
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:49,040
And that's why everyone
was very confused

60
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,080
at your mommy and daddy's wedding.

61
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:53,442
I-I don't get it. She
giggled at this thing

62
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,046
for like ten minutes and
suddenly she hates it.

63
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,215
And now I'm starting to wonder if it was

64
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,548
ever really all that
funny to begin with.

65
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,892
She's just staring into space.

66
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:00,885
Is that normal?

67
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,720
I don't know. This is a weird baby, man.

68
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,333
Ooh, I know, we could
take her to a pet store,

69
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:06,958
and let her put her
fingers in all the cages.

70
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,093
That's a great idea.
We're ready for an outing.

71
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,863
Besides, it'll put some life
into this dumb Greg baby.

72
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,997
Oh, wait.

73
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:13,904
Jen said we didn't need

74
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,433
to take her anywhere in the stroller.

75
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:17,835
We're not gonna take a stroller.

76
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,741
Okay, I've got a bottle
and snacks and that puppet

77
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,150
in case it makes a comeback.

78
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,313
You really thought of everything.

79
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:28,338
Yeah. I think I'm gonna
be a really good mom.

80
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:29,343
I know you are.

81
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,948
Aw.

82
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,155
She's fine.

83
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,293
Oh, I feel terrible.

84
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,462
Sleeping with that dad
in high school was a sign

85
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:43,694
I wasn't meant to take care of kids.

86
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,029
You said you just flirted with him.

87
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,199
Huh? Maybe we should call Jen.

88
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,341
No way. We'll look incompetent.

89
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:51,669
And then when we have kids of our own,

90
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,037
everyone will be worried
that we can't handle it.

91
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,038
Well, maybe we can't.

92
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,574
Oh, we dropped one baby on her face.

93
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,574
We'll be much more careful with ours.

94
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,845
- Yeah. You're right.
- Yeah.

95
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,140
I'm glad we can learn these
lessons on someone else's baby.

96
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:03,814
Totally.

97
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:06,717
Really?

98
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,019
We drop you on your head, you don't cry.

99
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,043
Now you're crying at this? Greg baby.

100
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:11,084
Oh, no.

101
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,732
What do we do?

102
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:12,957
Oh, no, no, no. Don't answer.

103
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,425
No, they'll hear in our
voice that something is wrong,

104
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,445
and then they'll start to worry,

105
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:16,894
so just, like, let it ring forever.

106
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,062
- Okay.
- Okay.

107
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,465
Hi.

108
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:24,905
I think it totally works.

109
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,335
I can still see it.

110
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,285
Yeah. Maybe I shouldn't have been

111
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,076
so quick to dismiss
your Blue Man Group idea.

112
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,046
That's the garage. They're home.

113
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,448
Okay, whoa, whoa, stay
calm. It's not a big deal.

114
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,482
Lark is fine.

115
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,218
And maybe

116
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,119
we don't have to explain anything.

117
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,424
Okay. You go there.

118
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,928
- You stay there, okay? Yeah.
- Ready?

119
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:47,291
Hi.

120
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,960
- Hi.
- Oh, no.

121
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,562
No, God, you opened
the door into her face.

122
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,964
I think that's gonna leave a mark.

123
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,765
Oh, yep, there it is.

124
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,527
Yeah. You do know that
we have cameras everywhere

125
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,242
and we watched the
whole thing on my phone?

126
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:00,771
No, we did not know that.

127
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,406
Give me my child.

128
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,575
Oh, sweetie, are you okay?

129
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:05,963
We're really sorry.

130
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,234
And look, she's fine.

131
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,426
Yeah, and sorry about, you
know, having sex on your bed.

132
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,209
Yeah.

133
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:12,145
Well, we don't have
cameras in the bedroom.

134
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,618
- Okay.
- Oh.

135
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,087
Uh, I was gonna say that
I was pretty impressed

136
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,456
with the way you two
came together in a crisis.

137
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,852
The first time Lark tripped over

138
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,292
one of my shoes and got a fat lip,

139
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,355
Greg gave me the stink
eye and called me a slut.

140
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,231
Huh.

141
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,264
She picks up her shoes now, though.

142
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:30,011
Look at that. See? We
do make a good team.

143
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:30,814
We do.

144
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,793
Maybe we're gonna be
great parents after all.

145
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,380
Well, you know, you did concuss a baby

146
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:35,573
and then try to fix it with a makeover,

147
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,241
but I guess everyone's definition

148
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,403
of great is different.

149
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,779
Well, uh,

150
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:41,251
I'm gonna go clean our sheets.

151
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:43,347
And also this baby's diaper

152
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,050
because didn't catch
that on the surveillance.

153
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,351
Okay.

154
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,528
I thought you said
you were gonna do that.

155
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,967
- Well, I'll do it if it's our baby.
- Yeah.

156
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,069
_

157
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,715
Oh, man. Look at this.

158
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:58,232
Yeah, I get it, Marmaduke's a big boy.

159
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,998
No. No. That-That virtual
health care company

160
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,135
I wanted to invest in
years ago just went public.

161
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:06,698
If you would have let
me invest that money

162
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,572
my parents gave us, we would be rich,

163
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,777
and not in the stupid way
that you're supposed to say

164
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,539
with, like, friends and health,
but in the good way, with money.

165
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:16,147
Virtual health care?

166
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,420
I never told you that you
couldn't invest in that.

167
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:20,451
Yes, you did!

168
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,459
Babe, it was the biggest
fight we ever had.

169
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:24,955
It caused my scalp to
reject my new hair plugs.

170
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,191
Babe, biggest fight we ever had

171
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,824
was how much skill does it take

172
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,827
to become a game show host.

173
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,395
It is very difficult,

174
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,764
but I am talking about
a much bigger fight.

175
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,629
We were screaming at each other

176
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:37,702
in the middle of that
Asian fusion restaurant.

177
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,890
You left crying.

178
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,586
And then the delivery
guy had to drive me home

179
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:41,539
on his handlebars.

180
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,056
Oh, was that the place

181
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,164
with the hamburger egg rolls?

182
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,812
- So, you remember the egg rolls...
- Yes.

183
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,494
but you don't remember the biggest fight

184
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,781
in the history of our relationship?

185
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,027
Oh, my God. I had a sex
dream about those egg rolls.

186
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,296
All right, look, I'm just
upset because if your mom

187
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,334
hadn't put the kibosh on my dreams,

188
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,529
we'd all be wearing,

189
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:01,625
you know, name-brand sneakers

190
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,294
instead of these Air Gordons.

191
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:05,471
Don't you have to wear
those because of your corns?

192
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:06,944
Look, that's not the point.

193
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,705
The point is that I
want her to acknowledge

194
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,001
how much money she cost us. You know.

195
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,989
I mean, look, this is the
first time I've ever been

196
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,071
proven right in an argument,

197
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,099
and now your mother just

198
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,607
conveniently forgets about it?

199
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,020
Dad, this space is too small.

200
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,343
Ah, I never listen to people

201
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,115
who say I can't fit into things.

202
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:23,687
Well, Clementine and I
like to handle our arguments

203
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:24,789
like mature adults.

204
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:25,960
That's why we only fight naked.

205
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:26,784
You should try it.

206
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,052
Yeah, it helps remind you

207
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:29,912
of each other's vulnerabilities,
and then the fights

208
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:30,921
don't last as long.

209
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,890
It's called Let Me Geni-Tell Ya.

210
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,192
No, it's not. It's called Nude Feud.

211
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,128
Um, I think I know what it's called.

212
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,733
My Mom and Uncle Dad invented it.

213
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:39,631
No, they didn't.

214
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:40,902
I came up with it when we got

215
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,096
in that argument in the
shower about the pee rules.

216
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,644
No, you didn't. Okay, we
are settling this right now.

217
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,004
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

218
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,301
Nobody's getting naked
in my car unless it's me.

219
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:51,409
Why should we take
advice from you and Mom?

220
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:54,322
Do you know how traumatizing
it is to be a little kid

221
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,046
and go into an Asian Fusion restaurant,

222
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,082
asking for your dad's hair plugs back?

223
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,551
That was genuine Norwegian corpse hair.

224
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,286
I could have replanted that stuff.

225
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:03,898
And wait a minute.

226
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:04,801
If you remember that,

227
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,755
that means you remember the argument.

228
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,799
Oh! You got to tell your mom.

229
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:11,017
Nobody's getting ice cream until you do.

230
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,522
I didn't even want ice cream.

231
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:13,664
You asked us to come with you

232
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,800
because you were too
embarrassed to go alone.

233
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:17,744
That's because I was here this morning.

234
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,636
All right, let's go.

235
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:21,338
And for the record, I fit in the spot.

236
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:23,443
Yeah, I'd like to see you pull out.

237
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,162
I just want to make
sure that everyone has

238
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,979
the same information,
so we can all agree

239
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,581
that for once, I was right.

240
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,654
Go ahead, Tyler.

241
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,284
So you and Dad came home, and you were

242
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,318
arguing about the investment.

243
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,028
Aha, yes! See?

244
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,496
Now you remember.

245
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,632
Yeah, and then you said
that you make the money,

246
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:41,101
so you get to make the decisions.

247
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,294
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

248
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,030
That sounds familiar.

249
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:46,597
- I said that?
- Yeah.

250
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,324
And then you said that Mom got to decide

251
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,673
what she packed for my lunch,

252
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,377
and that was enough
decision-making for her, so...

253
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,003
All right, that'll do, Tyler.

254
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,339
Yeah, this is all coming back to me now.

255
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,874
But I didn't even get to the
part where you called her...

256
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,322
Hey, who asked you, anyway?

257
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,294
Right?

258
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,955
I'm gonna go get you

259
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,547
a diamond bracelet out
of my apology drawer.

260
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:04,992
Wait, so...

261
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:06,283
now you don't want to talk about it,

262
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,019
now that I actually remember the fight?

263
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,554
Well, there's no need to.

264
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,720
Everybody's memories are
sufficiently refreshed,

265
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,732
and apologies accepted.

266
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:16,994
Hey, I bet we're all starving.

267
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,195
What are you making for...

268
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,212
For what, Tim? What
am I making for what?

269
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,070
For reservations for yourself

270
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:28,064
- for the spa for tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah.

271
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,617
That is happening.

272
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:31,583
But let's get back
to this, about how you

273
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,277
went out of your way to demean me

274
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:36,354
as a wife, a mother, and a woman.

275
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,682
And hey, just so you know, guy,

276
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:39,283
we can talk about this all night long,

277
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,620
because tomorrow's
lunches are already packed.

278
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,614
You two are gonna want to leave.

279
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,625
Wait, so your mom is not making dinner?

280
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,327
Oh, no, he's getting
naked. We got to go.

281
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,829
We should not have suggested this

282
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,491
- to anyone over the age of 20.
- Okay...

283
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:56,011
If you're gonna do that
thing that you talk to me

284
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:57,968
with your belly button,
I'm not in the mood.

285
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,103
If this is gonna be a big fight,

286
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,170
we have to do it naked...

287
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,939
apparently that helps.

288
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:03,477
Okay.

289
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,982
You know what? I can
fight with you naked

290
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,834
just as well as I can
with my clothes on.

291
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,201
In fact, naked...

292
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,083
I got a lot more ammo.

293
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:16,819
Full Monty.

294
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:21,525
Okay, this works.

295
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,627
- Yeah.
- I feel more vulnerable.

296
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:28,268
It's hard to... it's hard...

297
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,401
- I...
- I don't know if I'd say that.

298
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:32,109
It's getting there, though.

299
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,880
Oh.

300
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:35,773
Oh, what were you talking about?

301
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,347
I was saying it's hard to be mad at you.

302
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:38,619
- Oh.
- But it's, yeah...

303
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,625
Don't make me laugh, it bounces.

304
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,383
That was good. That was really good.

305
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,987
Hey, I'm sorry about all
the money that I lost us.

306
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,619
Oh, it's okay.

307
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:54,533
I'm sorry, too,

308
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,833
that I demeaned you as a wife

309
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,986
and a mother.

310
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,319
I love it. I don't know why I said

311
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,553
that I wasn't in the mood.

312
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,393
- I'm always in the mood for that.
- Mm.

313
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,719
I wish you would have
proposed to me like that.

314
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:15,582
I mean, how many other
kids you know that's got

315
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:17,810
a real professional
inventor in their family?

316
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:21,074
- Actually, Kyle Edison's great, great...
- Yeah, whatever.

317
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:25,155
_

318
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,416
Welcome to the Dream Lab.

319
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,151
So tell me about your project.

320
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:30,665
I have to come up with an idea,

321
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,166
build a prototype, and then
develop a business plan.

322
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,382
It's so stupid.

323
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,750
If I actually had any good ideas,

324
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:37,385
then I would already be an inventor.

325
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:38,886
Well, it's a good thing

326
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,722
little Ricky Hammock didn't say that.

327
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,457
Although he would have
been so much more productive

328
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,993
if his first invention wasn't a hammock.

329
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,696
Excuse me.

330
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,488
I had those when I was little.

331
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,300
And that's precisely the problem.

332
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:53,826
See, it's not just little kids

333
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,393
that need to get to places in a hurry.

334
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,599
It's also big, important
people, such as myself.

335
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,540
Well, they do make you look taller.

336
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,542
I'd do anything for that.

337
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,144
Why don't you just wear heels?

338
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,545
My mom won't let me.

339
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,001
If only they made shoes
with retractable heels,

340
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:08,282
then I could leave the house in flats,

341
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,314
then switch to heels
when I got to school.

342
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:11,519
Bingo.

343
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,854
Sam, it's brilliant.

344
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,322
That's your idea.

345
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:15,656
We can call them...

346
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,291
Swiss Army Heels.

347
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,727
Or how about Peek-A-Boots?

348
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:22,530
Eh. It's good to have options.

349
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,676
Oh!

350
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:29,670
Huh.

351
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,513
So, what do you think?

352
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,063
Well, I think it's a good draft.

353
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,111
But... just playing
devil's advocate here...

354
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,887
I was just envisioning
this totally different,

355
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:42,583
and just a little bit better.

356
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:44,191
Uh...

357
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:46,087
So... lose that.

358
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,955
Keep this first word,

359
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,724
but then all of that's got to go.

360
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,221
Uh, you know what?

361
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:53,327
What do you say we
just start from scratch?

362
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,429
Shall we?

363
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,481
So, let's...

364
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:57,765
What if we make the straps...

365
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:59,372
Uh, shh, shh.

366
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:00,168
Okay, um...

367
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,949
All right? My ideas
are whispering to me,

368
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,288
and I have to...

369
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,110
- Hey!
- Hey.

370
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:11,446
Look who stopped over to see
how you did on your project.

371
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:12,580
So, how'd we do?

372
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,269
I got a B+.

373
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:16,484
- B+.
- That's so great.

374
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,771
Thank you, little brother.

375
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,220
Thanks for what?

376
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,422
- I invented a failure.
- Oh, God.

377
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:22,990
No, I am a professional inventor,

378
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,259
I should be getting an A- at least.

379
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:26,394
Minimum.

380
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:27,919
I got to get to my Dream Lab.

381
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,501
What made da Vinci so
influential to Tesla was his...

382
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:35,653
Hello.

383
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,872
Uh, my name is Greg Short,
and I have a problem.

384
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:41,008
Sir, the A.A. meeting isn't until 6:00.

385
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,412
No. No, no, no. I am,
uh, Sam's uncle, here.

386
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,881
And I'd like to speak
with you about her grade.

387
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,150
I'm teaching.

388
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:50,840
Are you? Because it really sounds

389
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:52,653
like you're unfairly criticizing.

390
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:53,721
Samantha's prototype

391
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,089
was amazing,

392
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:58,526
and her essay was super, duper smart,

393
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,133
I mean, it included very witty wordplay,

394
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,098
such as, uh, "Come heel or high water."

395
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,267
Sir, did you do her project for her?

396
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,835
No. No, I did not.

397
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,937
But I am a professional,

398
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,205
um, inventor,

399
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,908
and I know a good idea when I hear one.

400
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,277
Oh. We've been studying inventors.

401
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,347
Maybe you could tell the
class about your work.

402
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,282
Oh. Uh...

403
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,316
All right, sure.

404
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,784
Yeah, I can spit my flow.

405
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:26,654
Mrs. Sandoval, can I
take a mental health day?

406
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:28,956
So, as I'm sure Sam told you,

407
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,526
I'm the guy that invented CryTunes.

408
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,384
Ha.

409
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:37,798
Which is a monitor that,
uh, converts the sound

410
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,102
of a crying baby into smooth jazz.

411
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,488
It's something my wife
and I have been using

412
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:44,472
with our daughter.

413
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:45,640
Wife?

414
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:47,175
Yeah, I have a wife.

415
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:48,809
Do you have any more questions?

416
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,923
Do you always ignore your
child when it's in distress?

417
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,674
We... Uh, it's not ignoring.

418
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,813
So if a stranger abducts your
baby, you'd just hear jazz?

419
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,819
Yeah, this idea is completely unsafe.

420
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,054
No, it's not.

421
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,155
Good comeback.

422
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:02,375
Why don't you talk more about

423
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:05,159
how you plan on growing your business?

424
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:06,961
Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:11,256
We are growing at, uh,
an almost-alarming rate.

426
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:12,717
But in a good way.

427
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,240
Uh, we're trying to expand

428
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:16,404
our musical libraries to include

429
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:17,672
alt-rock,

430
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:18,906
alt-ska.

431
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,141
All the alts.

432
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:21,809
Do you have the licensing for that?

433
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,377
Uh, not yet.

434
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,812
This is a legal nightmare.

435
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,682
Okay, look, I'm talking with people

436
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:30,384
about selling my company
for a lot of money, so...

437
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,199
Then why are you talking to us?

438
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:35,140
Because I love the children.

439
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:37,558
I hate them.

440
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:39,310
They ridiculed me.

441
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:41,429
First it was CryTunes,
then it was my jeans,

442
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:42,803
then it was my posture.

443
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,849
Aw, honey. They didn't
mention you wearing

444
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,572
your sunglasses on
the back of your neck.

445
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:48,569
Who's that?

446
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:50,538
Sam? Hi.

447
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,672
What are you doing here?

448
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,741
Have you come to make
fun of my phone case, too?

449
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,142
They made fun of my phone case.

450
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,978
I'm really sorry about all that.

451
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:58,813
If it makes you feel any better,

452
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,449
one of the boys thought you were cute.

453
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:02,704
Eh, you're just saying that.

454
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,023
Okay, I am. But for real.

455
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,288
One of my friend's parents
invests in startups,

456
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,290
and he loves Peek-A-Boots.

457
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,758
He wants to fund it.

458
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,594
What? That's amazing.

459
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,811
Yeah. That's, that's...
really great news,

460
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,464
that there's a successful
inventor in the family.

461
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,838
I'm very happy for you.

462
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:23,904
What do you mean "me"? This is our idea.

463
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:25,517
I can't do this without you.

464
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,506
Really?

465
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,278
Okay. Uh...

466
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,612
I like the sound of this.

467
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:32,580
Me, too.

468
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:34,815
Partners. 70/30.

469
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,484
Okay, well, that's not
contractually binding.

470
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:37,551
I'll write something up.

471
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:38,919
Let's go celebrate, right?

472
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:41,022
This is so exciting, you guys.

473
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,558
Be right back.

474
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,465
I don't touch bugs, you know?

475
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,600
They're icky.

476
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:54,435
Didn't you fight in a war?

477
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,437
Some say I still am.

478
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,030
_

479
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,864
Hi, sweetie.

480
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,403
Hey, there's our favorite

481
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:08,571
almost eight or
nine-year-old granddaughter.

482
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:11,151
We got you an early birthday gift

483
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,402
because we couldn't wait
to shower you with love

484
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:15,385
and my coupon expires tomorrow.

485
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,966
Oh, you shouldn't have, guys.

486
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:19,101
Because this year I
just want gift cards.

487
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,870
That way, I can get what I want,

488
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:22,939
and not just a bunch of pink stuff.

489
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,102
Giving gifts is not about buying
someone something they want,

490
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:28,299
it's about getting them
something they don't want,

491
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:30,499
so they learn to appreciate it.

492
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:31,864
You want to open it?

493
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,670
Yes. Thank you.

494
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,359
A butterfly kit?

495
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,964
Yes! Those little

496
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,990
squirmy wormies

497
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:48,631
are gonna transform
magically into butterflies.

498
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,533
They are nature's drag queens.

499
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:51,500
Thanks.

500
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:52,735
How long does it take?

501
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,003
Mm, just two weeks.

502
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,771
- Two weeks?
- Yeah.

503
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:57,840
Couldn't you have thrown
down a few extra bucks

504
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,076
to get the same-day butterflies?

505
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:02,887
I mean, you got a
pension, right, Pop-Pop?

506
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:05,481
Look, you can't pay nature
to hurry things along.

507
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,784
If you could, I wouldn't clock
so many hours on the toilet.

508
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:10,138
- Ha.
- Ugh.

509
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:16,520
Wow, these cocoons are even more boring

510
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:18,527
than the movie of the same name.

511
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,029
Boring?

512
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:21,787
Inside the cocoon,

513
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,899
the caterpillar is digesting itself.

514
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:28,004
If you were to cut it open,
caterpillar guts would ooze out.

515
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,384
Ooh, let's do that.

516
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,789
Oh, no! Wait, wait. No.

517
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:32,434
This is the exciting part,

518
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:34,510
where you get to watch them

519
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,475
hang there for, like, ten more days.

520
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:41,896
- Fine.
- Great idea.

521
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:44,353
You're gonna want to
remember this experience.

522
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:48,392
Actually, Michelangelo in class
said that he would buy these.

523
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,184
And since I really ripped him off

524
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,794
in our last business venture,

525
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:53,496
he wants pictures first.

526
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:55,031
So you're selling them, hmm?

527
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,632
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, then.

528
00:17:56,634 --> 00:18:00,136
Uh, well, I'm sure Micacacalo
will give them a good home.

529
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,745
A good mobile home.

530
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,056
Sophia wants to sell our butterflies

531
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:08,177
because she says,

532
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:10,766
"They're boring."

533
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,752
Oh, why are kids so impatient?

534
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,617
She needs to grow up already.

535
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:18,821
Well, it seems to me some older
folks can be impatient, too.

536
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:20,823
I don't have time for this.

537
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:23,122
Why is everybody so annoying?

538
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:28,579
Sophia.

539
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:32,462
Look, I understand if you want to sell

540
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:34,494
a piece of Pop-Pop's heart.

541
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,475
I mean, butterflies.

542
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:39,753
Pop-Pop, one of the
cocoons fell off the branch.

543
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,077
I don't want him to die.

544
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,311
I'm only nine,

545
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:44,164
and I've already buried three pets

546
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,270
and my sheets that...

547
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,884
someone peed on.

548
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:51,705
Well, I'll try to
reattach him to the branch.

549
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:52,774
But I'll warn you,

550
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,323
it's gonna be a risky procedure,

551
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:56,672
because I don't touch bugs.

552
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:57,890
They're icky.

553
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:03,332
I do this for Dad when
he's making a sandwich.

554
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,301
Ah, well.

555
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:09,138
Yeah, we've done all we can
to save one of God's creatures.

556
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:10,951
I'm gonna name her Deirdre.

557
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:12,455
Well, I guess that's fair,

558
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:15,010
since I named all of
those other ones John.

559
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:17,780
I really hope she pulls through.

560
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,716
Or dies quickly, so she's not a burden.

561
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,747
Did I miss it?

562
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,371
I ran out on my probation
hearing at the country club

563
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,317
as soon as I heard.

564
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,794
Nope, you're just in time.

565
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,787
They're hatching.

566
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,239
Ooh, thank God.

567
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:36,079
It's the only hobby I got left.

568
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:38,382
Oh, no,

569
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:39,934
Deirdre never came out.

570
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:42,133
But let's not tell the
other butterflies yet.

571
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,107
Let them keep their
innocence a little longer.

572
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:47,443
Sweetie, I'm sure
she's flying in heaven.

573
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:49,078
Yeah, but everyone flies up there,

574
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,767
so it's, like, no big deal.

575
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,293
No, look, she's hatching!

576
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,292
Why is saying good-bye always so hard?

577
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,089
I know, but if you love something,

578
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:09,694
you have to set it free. Right?

579
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,067
Is that's why you walk
around with your robe open?

580
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,341
This is the best gift ever.

581
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:15,357
When I grow up,

582
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,064
I'm gonna get a butterfly tattoo

583
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,313
on my lower back.

584
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,175
You want to do the honors?

585
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,307
What are those crows doing?

586
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:44,266
They're just saying hello.

587
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,908
Uh, you know, welcoming
them to the neighborhood.

588
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:47,939
Oh, that was nice of them.

589
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,171
They're happy they're here.

590
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:51,273
Yeah, well, the lesson
about life wasn't quick,

591
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,038
the one about death sure is, huh?

592
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:53,943
What do you mean?

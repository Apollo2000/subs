1
00:00:04,765 --> 00:00:06,648
_

2
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:08,445
Parenting is easy.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,816
Oh, God, no!

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,220
Hey, there's our favorite

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,189
almost eight or
nine-year-old granddaughter.

6
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,325
- We got married.
- What?

7
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,585
Clementine knows my
entire romantic history.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,995
You have no romantic history.

9
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:22,999
Then, she knows that.

10
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:25,242
I can't believe this is our house.

11
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:28,468
Babe, that fridge saw me
naked more times than you did.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,803
I know she did.

13
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,673
I now pronounce you man and wife.

14
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:34,374
- Come on, bring it in, buddy.
- Oh.

15
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:37,110
Don't tell me the universe
doesn't want us together.

16
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:45,172
Colleen?

17
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:47,376
_

18
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,205
This is our wedding night.

19
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,729
And now our lives are ruined.

20
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:57,497
Because of your motel balcony,

21
00:00:57,499 --> 00:00:59,340
we haven't even been able
to consummate our marriage.

22
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:01,268
Mm-mm. I mean, we do some stuff.

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,577
- Yeah, but not the stuff.
- Mm-mm.

24
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,572
Although the stuff we have
been doing has been really nice.

25
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:06,907
I really appreciate the
effort you've put in.

26
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:07,974
It's been really great.

27
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:09,736
Excuse me, yeah.

28
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:12,464
That's just the universal
sign for "Stop talking."

29
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,822
This may not be the
amount you were hoping for,

30
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,792
but this is the best
the motel can offer.

31
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:25,433
$2 million?

32
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:28,498
$2 million.

33
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,289
$2 million.

34
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:32,573
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,347
Hey...

36
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,550
$2 million?

37
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,386
That's not our official response.

38
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,321
We're gonna mull it over
and we'll get back to you.

39
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:39,389
- No, no, we're not.
- No, no, no!

40
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,830
- No!
- No, no, we want it.

41
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,433
Give it to me, give it
to me, give it to me.

42
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:45,713
Well, I guess by now

43
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,574
you've all heard about
our-our settlement.

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,166
So, it's pretty obvious that,

45
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,468
well, things couldn't be going
any better for Colleen and me.

46
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,871
Uh, Matt, could you turn me around?

47
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:57,240
Oh, yeah, sorry.

48
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,908
Hi, guys.

49
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:01,408
Been a long road to get here.

50
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,514
But, uh, through it all, you,

51
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,990
my family,

52
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,125
you, uh, even in my darkest hour,

53
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,896
you always believed in me
because you knew that one day

54
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,264
I would make it.

55
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,832
"Make it"?

56
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,702
Your wife fell off a balcony.

57
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,237
Exactly. My wife.

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,337
You don't think that my wife
could fall off a balcony?

59
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,619
Just admit it, Greg.

60
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,172
You've always thought that
you were better than me.

61
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:26,310
I never thought that.

62
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,158
I did.

63
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:30,081
But now I think that Matt's the best.

64
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:32,166
- Wow.
- So weird.

65
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,752
Uh, now, e-even though
I am the millionaire,

66
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,687
Colleen and I have decided
that we're not gonna

67
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,823
- let this money change us.
- No.

68
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,758
Are you ready?

69
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,493
It's a cash grab.

70
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,765
Oh! Cash grab!

71
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,874
Oh! Oh, this is it.

72
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,232
This is everything
that you've ever lent me

73
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,769
over the years, swirling around
in a giant vortex of money.

74
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,005
It looks like only ones.

75
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,374
I mean, this is really showy, Jen.

76
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,491
Besides, like, I don't have money?

77
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,277
Look, I got plenty of money.

78
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,462
You see all this?

79
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,816
I got all of this money
right... no, that's mine!

80
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,351
Mine!

81
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:09,085
That's...

82
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,256
There isn't a booth big
enough for all the money

83
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,824
that you've lent me.

84
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,673
Thank you, Dad.

85
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:19,300
Here's what I think
of you paying me back.

86
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,978
It was a gamble,

87
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,570
you pushing Colleen off that balcony,

88
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,973
but it paid off.

89
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:31,176
You're a bigger man than I'll ever be.

90
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,911
I want to get out!

91
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,345
Let me out, please!

92
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,313
Oh, oh, no!

93
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,550
No, no, it's swallowing me!

94
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,151
Oh, no!

95
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,520
Well, I hope you all had fun today.

96
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,022
But Matt and I feel
like what's the point

97
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,223
of having all this money

98
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,991
if there's nowhere to spend it.

99
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:51,763
So, we are taking you all to Las Vegas!

100
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,164
Pack your bags!

101
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,768
Vegas, bitches! Yeah!

102
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,542
Babe, everyone is so proud of you.

103
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,077
You're a winner now.

104
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,378
We both are.

105
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,713
I'll feel more like it

106
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,515
when you don't have to
lift me off the toilet.

107
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,732
Hey, guys.

108
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:14,385
Just want you to really
hold onto this happiness

109
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,789
for as long as you can, which,
in this case, is not very long.

110
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,226
You see, the motel just
filed for bankruptcy.

111
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,502
What does that mean?

112
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,030
Well, it means that you get nothing.

113
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,514
Not-Nothing? They can do that?

114
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,773
Yeah, sadly, they can.

115
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,240
I'm so sorry.

116
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,943
But this is fun.

117
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:46,150
So, the good news is,
um, we're going to Vegas.

118
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,052
The, uh, bad news is that

119
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:52,023
we won't be able to cover
the rooms, the shows,

120
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,025
or the food.

121
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,761
And also, it's Barstow, not Vegas.

122
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,569
But the bus is totally on us

123
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:01,499
as long as you give us the cash back.

124
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,167
And also, don't open any more champagne.

125
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,601
Oh.

126
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,720
I brought this from home.

127
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,931
_

128
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,656
Paci! Paci! Paci!

129
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:18,249
Where are you? Where
are you? Where are you?

130
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,318
- Paci! Paci!
- Just a second, Lark!

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,620
Come on, come on, come on.

132
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,122
Where is it? Where is it?

133
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,124
Please, please, please.

134
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,292
Where is it?

135
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,726
- Hey! I'm in here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,061
Sorry, sorry, quit
messing around, honey.

137
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,696
- Come on, help me.
- Paci!

138
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,964
Paci! I need it.

139
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,499
Somebody hand me it.

140
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,900
Yeah, okay, okay,
okay, here, here, here.

141
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,201
Please, please, just
suck on one of these.

142
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,103
- Any, please.
- Unless one of those

143
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,606
is the stinky-ass yellow one
with the chewed up handle,

144
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,941
you're just wasting our time.

145
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,108
Uh, yeah, well, look.

146
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,176
Oh, see this.

147
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,444
I'm chewing on the handle.

148
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,413
Right here, okay. Now, here. Try it.

149
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,526
Okay, I've run out of ideas.

150
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,587
I know. The car.

151
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,155
- I'm checking the car.
- Yeah, great.

152
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,723
Check between the...
oh, whoa, no, no, no, no.

153
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,959
Wait a minute. You are
not getting away again.

154
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,427
Oh, please, honey. Just ten minutes.

155
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,462
- One beer, I'll be right home.
- No.

156
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,097
No one is leaving here

157
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,932
until we find this paci.

158
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:10,335
Paci, I need it, Mommy.

159
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,670
I know, sweetie. I feel your pain.

160
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,339
I felt the same way
when they pulled fen-phen

161
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,274
from the drugstore shelves.

162
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,042
- Found it!
- What?

163
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,310
Where was it?

164
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,346
It was in the pantry...

165
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,148
along with something
else I thought I lost.

166
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,558
- My ukulele.
- Oh.

167
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,986
- You found that, too?
- Yeah.

168
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:31,242
And you're still doing the
authentic pronunciation.

169
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,224
Night, night.

170
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,331
Oh, God.

171
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,766
Honey, we have got to break her

172
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,134
of this habit now

173
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,902
or she's gonna wind
up on a street corner

174
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,005
selling her body for pacifiers.

175
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,203
And honestly, I don't think
she's got the ass for it.

176
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:50,163
Ah, you're right.

177
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,894
It's just we have to do
this delicately, you know?

178
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,778
Yeah. This is totally one
of those things that could,

179
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,747
like, scar a kid for life.

180
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,682
I know. Why don't we tell her

181
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,886
that she has to send her
paci to the Paci Fairy?

182
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,587
That like the sweatpants
fairy your mom made up

183
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,922
so you'd stop wearing
sweatpants to school every day?

184
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,958
- Yeah.
- That's so weird.

185
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,192
It's not weird if it works.

186
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,055
Hmm...

187
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,148
Oh, come on.

188
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:12,867
What, these are my
lounge-abouts, right?

189
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:13,756
Chefs wear these.

190
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,047
- Mm-hmm.
- O-Oh.

191
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,768
We could tell her that
the Paci Fairy is a guy,

192
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,103
so that you don't have an
issue with it being sexist.

193
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,905
No, my issue is not with his gender.

194
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,341
Although, why couldn't a fairy be a guy?

195
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,561
My issue is that

196
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:26,236
parents shouldn't lie to their kids.

197
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:28,161
Remember what happened
with the Sinclairs?

198
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,673
They told that kid he could fly.

199
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,573
Oh, my gosh, I never sent flowers.

200
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:34,018
Don't worry, I took care of it.

201
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,049
- Thank you.
- And I'm gonna take care of this, too.

202
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:37,940
By not lying to our child.

203
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:40,024
I mean, the last thing
we need is her standing

204
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,593
at her bat mitzvah with
a paci in her mouth.

205
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,762
- You know, or her confirmation.
- One thing at a time.

206
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,930
- Okay.
- You know?

207
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:48,166
Oh, come on, Lark.

208
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,368
Come on, can we please
just talk about this?

209
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:52,898
Lark,

210
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:53,838
listen to me.

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
Do you really want to grow up to be like

212
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,057
that lispy chick from my office?

213
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:00,521
You've met her. She had a pacifier.

214
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,115
And now she lives alone with a turtle.

215
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,739
Jen, trying to scare our kid

216
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,380
by telling her she's
gonna go live with a turtle

217
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,920
is like trying to scare
a Jewish mother by saying

218
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,122
her kid's gonna grow up to be a doctor.

219
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,129
Stop. You think Lark could be a doctor?

220
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:18,262
All right. Honey? Um...

221
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,733
Listen, have you, have
you ever heard of the, um,

222
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,046
the Paci Fairy?

223
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:26,170
Paci Fairy, who's that?

224
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:31,146
Well. Your daddy is gonna
tell you all about him.

225
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:32,185
Yeah... oh.

226
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,077
- Yeah.
- Okay.

227
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,418
Yeah. We're gonna send

228
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:39,016
your paci away on a
balloon to the Paci Fairy,

229
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,729
and because you are such a big girl,

230
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,156
he is gonna get you a present.

231
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,758
A present?

232
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,431
- Yeah.
- That's right. Yeah.

233
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:51,257
But if you keep your paci,

234
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:55,500
then the Paci Monster sneaks
into your room at night

235
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,034
when you're sleeping,

236
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,294
and he just eats you up in one big bite.

237
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,405
Jen, what the hell are you doing?

238
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,174
Come on, "Paci Monster"? Come on.

239
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,743
I don't know, I felt like we
needed a bad guy or something.

240
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,280
Okay. Paci Fairy, no monster.

241
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,284
Okay, so...

242
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,586
Here we go. All right?

243
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,588
Now, everybody is here,

244
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,791
so we're gonna send these off,

245
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,026
and let it float away to the Paci Fairy,

246
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,962
and then he is gonna
bring you a big present.

247
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,024
The Paci Fairy's a dude?

248
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,582
Joanie, get your hat, we're leaving.

249
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:29,731
Stop.

250
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:31,871
This is so something you
only do for the first kid.

251
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:32,970
Oh, totally.

252
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,140
Come on, Tyler's pacifier
got a blastoff to Paci Planet,

253
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,975
while Samantha's got tossed
into the garbage disposal

254
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,798
while I screamed at her, "Look
at what you made Mommy do!"

255
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,994
Do you remember that, sweetie?

256
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:42,947
Yeah, I remember feeling

257
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,917
like it was my fault
but not knowing why.

258
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,756
I don't even remember what
we did with Sophia's pacifier.

259
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,381
I probably lost it or something.

260
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,660
Okay, ready? We're gonna count it off.

261
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,463
- Five...
- Five...

262
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:58,229
Four...

263
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,597
three...

264
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,898
two...

265
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,799
Wait, wait.

266
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

267
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,304
All done.

268
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,550
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Ready?

269
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:11,142
One, two, three.

270
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,578
Bye-bye, paci!

271
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,346
- Good job, Lark.
- See you, sucker.

272
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,104
- Come here, I'm so proud of you.
- Come here, sweetie. Oh.

273
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,295
You're such a big girl.

274
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:20,718
And now,

275
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,510
no big scary Paci Monster's

276
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:24,989
gonna come and eat my Lark's face off.

277
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,158
Oops. Look, right there.

278
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,159
Oh, the power lines.

279
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,393
- Oh, God.
- No.

280
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,728
No, no, no, no,

281
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,196
no, no, no... No, no, no...

282
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,031
Oh!

283
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,471
No Paci Monster, no Paci Monster.

284
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,740
No Paci Monster.

285
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,942
Mommy!

286
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,313
Ugh, what have we done?

287
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,679
'Cause I'm gonna go
out on a limb and say

288
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,448
it's the wrong thing.

289
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,185
We need a bigger crib.

290
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,256
Yeah.

291
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:04,598
_

292
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,470
Ma'am, please pull over.

293
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,308
Ma'am. Please pull the mower over.

294
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,877
- Ma'am?
- Don't call me ma'am.

295
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,217
Whoo-hoo!

296
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:36,385
Sophia, are you kidding me?

297
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:37,541
It wasn't me.

298
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,589
I just took you off the lawn mower.

299
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,846
Sweetheart, why would
you do such a thing?

300
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:44,182
I don't know. I'm bored over here.

301
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:45,877
But, dear, we have a tennis ball.

302
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:47,939
Sophia, our house just burned down.

303
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,463
We have a ton of boxes to unpack.

304
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Why do we even need so many boxes?

305
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,902
Because we might be
living here for a year.

306
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,712
Okay, so it's not a great time
for you to jack a lawn mower

307
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:58,032
and take it for a joyride.

308
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:00,442
I-I'll watch her, Heather,
you go unpack your boxes.

309
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:02,087
You know, sometimes, these kids

310
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,245
need to be disciplined

311
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,813
the old-fashioned way.

312
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:05,614
Oh.

313
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,930
Here, go put this in my closet.

314
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,217
I don't want to get it dirty.

315
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:12,387
'Cause we're gonna be
doing some hard labor.

316
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,653
N-No. Put that down.

317
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,968
We're not here to play.
We're here to work.

318
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:21,450
All right.

319
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,684
Now, get up there.

320
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,971
I'm not supposed to go
in the attic, you know.

321
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,049
Well, why don't you channel

322
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,932
some of that sass into figuring out

323
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,598
what critter is
scratching around up there?

324
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:32,846
Is this even safe?

325
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:34,908
No, but that's what the rope is for.

326
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,409
Fine. I'm going.

327
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,824
But I better get some
candy when I'm done.

328
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,125
Even coal miners

329
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,784
get to have a beer
at the end of the day.

330
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:45,387
Sophia?

331
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,189
I baked some cookies.

332
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:49,324
Come on down, I'll give them to you.

333
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,063
What the...?

334
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,899
Mr. Pickle?

335
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,935
I've been had.

336
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:03,238
Sophia? Sophia?

337
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,725
Tim, have you seen Sophia?

338
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,450
I thought you were watching her.

339
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,241
I thought you were unpacking.

340
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,324
I fell in the pool.

341
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,406
In your swimming trunks?

342
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:16,551
I was quite lucky.

343
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:18,902
Oh, hey, Dad.

344
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,960
- Hey.
- I fell in the pool.

345
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:22,867
Uh, where's Sophia?

346
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,366
Oh, we were playing
hide-and-seek, uh...

347
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,407
Uh, Sophia?

348
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,531
Pop-Pop gives up.

349
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,933
Come on out, right now.

350
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,501
She's not gonna learn what hard work is

351
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,903
if you let her just quit
in the middle of a game.

352
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:36,406
Sophia, honey, you stay hidden, okay?

353
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,641
You make Pop-Pop look for you.

354
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:41,444
Sophia? Sophia!

355
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,612
Okay, Tank.

356
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,280
This is Sophia's scent.

357
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,250
Now, go find her, girl.

358
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:47,851
Is she outside?

359
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:49,652
Is that it?

360
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:53,022
My sweater.

361
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,691
I've been looking for that.

362
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:56,693
Well, then who's Tank chasing?

363
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,495
A Subaru?

364
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:00,663
What? Tank!

365
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,199
Excuse me.

366
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:04,868
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

367
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,569
Have you seen a little girl?

368
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:09,506
Uh, she was in my attic,
but, uh, she got away.

369
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:12,776
She must've squiggled out of
the rope I had tied around her.

370
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:16,412
Come on, Gracie, let me
show you the other sidewalk.

371
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,383
Did you lose Sophia, dear?

372
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:22,285
No.

373
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:26,222
Well, all right, yeah,
she... she duped me.

374
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:29,225
Her-Her and that pickle
were working together.

375
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:32,200
You know, sometimes kids
can be a lot like dogs.

376
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:35,532
When they feel lost,
they usually go home.

377
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:39,123
Wait, a-are we still
talking about Sophia?

378
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,937
'Cause I lost Tank, too.

379
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,607
We're talking about our granddaughter.

380
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,409
If you want to find her,

381
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:48,611
think about what she just lost.

382
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,207
Well, there you are.

383
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:59,389
That wasn't a very nice
trick you played on Pop-Pop.

384
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:03,589
In some families, my
creativity would be celebrated.

385
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:04,996
Well, why are you doing it?

386
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:08,031
I mean, you're usually so well-behaved.

387
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,128
Don't tell anybody,

388
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:12,502
but you're kind of my favorite grandkid.

389
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:13,937
I know.

390
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:15,872
You wrote it on my birthday cake.

391
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,940
So, what is it?

392
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,107
You can talk to me.

393
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,475
This is my home.

394
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,183
I don't know how to live anywhere else.

395
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,014
Oh, honey.

396
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:26,950
This is just a house.

397
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:28,818
A home is where your family is.

398
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:32,789
And you're always gonna
have a home with me.

399
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,798
Thanks, Pop-Pop.

400
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:38,661
I already feel safer.

401
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,713
Oh, my God!

402
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,149
We'd better go.

403
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:45,156
Yeah, let's get out of here.

404
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,721
_

405
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:49,517
So, what do you think

406
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,767
Tyler's announcement is?

407
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,361
Either Clementine's pregnant

408
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,512
or they want us to listen to a new song.

409
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,303
God, I hope she's pregnant.

410
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:58,005
Hi, everyone.

411
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,106
Thank you for coming.

412
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:01,560
So, after much consideration

413
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,912
and a Twitter poll,
Clementine and I have decided

414
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,314
that our marriage has come
to its natural conclusion.

415
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,617
What? No.

416
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,107
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

417
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:13,821
All marriages come to
a natural conclusion.

418
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,556
Y-You stick it out.

419
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,558
It's okay, Mom. It's for the best.

420
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,667
Can't you convince her to take you back?

421
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,992
No, it was my idea.

422
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:24,259
If Tyler gets to quit his marriage,

423
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,566
can I quit tee-ball?

424
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,468
I've been doing that twice as long.

425
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,327
I'm really sorry, honey.

426
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:31,561
So strange.

427
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:34,263
You always think you'll
divorce before your children.

428
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,243
Yeah.

429
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,579
Oh, poor Tyler and Clementine.

430
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,014
Oh.

431
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:43,017
I-I didn't get to
say good-bye to her.

432
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,186
I don't think I ever said hello to her.

433
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:48,147
I don't think we ever
even had a conversation.

434
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:49,948
Oh, well.

435
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,600
Hey, family.

436
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:53,828
- Here.
- Thank you.

437
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,795
Love you.

438
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,467
I love you.

439
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,299
You're a liar, Heather,

440
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:00,682
the same damn liar you've always been.

441
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:02,803
Hi.

442
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:04,416
Hi. Wh-Wh-What's
going on?

443
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,041
You told us that you
were getting a divorce.

444
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:09,902
Well, I mean, legally,
we have filed for divorce,

445
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,979
but that doesn't mean
we can't still share

446
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,114
a house or our music or our cat.

447
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:16,070
Yeah, we just got a cat.

448
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:18,054
Probably wasn't the best timing, though.

449
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,186
Look, the point is,

450
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,255
Tyler and I are still
gonna be best friends

451
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,290
who just love and support each other

452
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,926
as we explore new relationships.

453
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:28,562
- We're calling it romantic unsyncing.
- Romantic unsyncing.

454
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,531
Is it okay if in the Christmas letter,

455
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,700
if I just call it divorced?

456
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:34,329
No, Joan.

457
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,037
Oh, okay.

458
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,473
I've enjoyed our little chat.

459
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,574
You know, when you first said

460
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:41,927
that we should unsync,

461
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:42,990
I wasn't so sure,

462
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:45,201
but it was a great idea.

463
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:47,693
We don't need labels to
define our relationship.

464
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:50,367
Which reminds me, I should
define what we are online.

465
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:51,368
Me, too.

466
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,087
Okay.

467
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:54,435
Single.

468
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,123
Me, too. Single.

469
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,935
Oh. Mine must be broken.

470
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:11,877
Can we talk?

471
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:12,713
Hey, guys.

472
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:15,572
- Listen, we were just thi...
- Oh!

473
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,177
- Honey.
- What, did this house get smaller?!

474
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,214
Uh, we had to make room for the cat.

475
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,215
- Gah!
- Ow!

476
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:23,651
- Oh, God.
- Oh, geez, honey, sorry.

477
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:25,386
You're standing in his litter box.

478
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,369
Oh, sorry.

479
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,888
Will you just cut it out, Tim?

480
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,423
I'm...

481
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:30,758
Okay.

482
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,161
Before you guys make this permanent

483
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,763
life-altering decision,

484
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,298
could we talk about

485
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,522
what it is that went
wrong in your marriage?

486
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:42,002
We just don't really have
anything to talk about

487
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:45,336
- unless we watch a TV show together.
- Yeah.

488
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,221
Yeah, and then we'd only have sex, like,

489
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:49,330
five times a week.

490
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:50,311
Huh.

491
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:51,879
Only in the bed.

492
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:53,775
What you're talking about,

493
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,732
that's marriage.

494
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:57,151
- Yeah. It's-it's a really
good one, actually. - Yes.

495
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:59,053
See, I knew you guys
wouldn't understand.

496
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,154
Relationships have evolved

497
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:02,690
way beyond your generation's limited,

498
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,191
conventional view of love.

499
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:06,193
- Is he too old to spank?
- Honey...

500
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,428
Oh, you know, I have to go get ready

501
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,896
or I'm gonna be late for my date.

502
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,265
You have a date already?

503
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,165
Yeah, that's why we're doing this.

504
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,329
Hey, do you want me to drop you off?

505
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,270
Sure.

506
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:17,432
Thanks.

507
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:19,340
See?

508
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:22,166
Modern relationships
don't have to be binary.

509
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,544
Let that wash over you.

510
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,212
All right, he's getting spanked.

511
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,674
I don't care how old he is. Come here.

512
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,525
- No.
- Hit him. Hit him.

513
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,307
Get... don't you run away from
me. You're only making it worse!

514
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:40,491
Are you sure we should be doing this?

515
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,687
It's gonna be great.

516
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:43,060
Do you want me to walk you in?

517
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:45,190
No. That might be a little weird.

518
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,125
Yeah, he might be the jealous type.

519
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,294
And I am having a good hair day.

520
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,499
So, do we kiss or hug or...?

521
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:57,227
What if we just took a deep
breath at the same time?

522
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:06,311
- Okay.
- Okay.

523
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:08,013
Knock 'em dead.

524
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,892
You know what? I think, maybe,

525
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,696
maybe our idea of marriage is antiquated

526
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:26,898
and relationships really are changing.

527
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,367
Yeah, I got to say, I know it...

528
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,102
it didn't look like it
when I was spanking him,

529
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,237
but I am so proud of
the man Tyler's becoming.

530
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,972
Oh, yeah.

531
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:38,218
Hey, what's up?

532
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,582
She's so much prettier than me.

533
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:45,740
This is just like when he was a baby,

534
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:48,504
when we first brought him
home from the hospital.

535
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:49,888
Oh.

536
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,303

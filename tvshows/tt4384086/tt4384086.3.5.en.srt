_

2
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:08,775
Happy anniversary.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,366
- Thank you, honey.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:12,268
Oh, thank you so much. (GASPS)

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,636
Oh, my God, this is so nice.

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:17,360
- I cannot believe that you got us in here.
- I know...

7
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:18,817
Welcome to Boccone.

8
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:21,244
- This is the chef's tasting menu.
- Ooh.

9
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,912
20 courses.

10
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:25,848
She created it especially
for this evening.

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,548
And-and-and is that the
price or the year you opened?

12
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:33,475
This looks lovely. So, thank you.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,566
Enjoy.

14
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,972
Okay, front or back door,

15
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:36,745
what do you want to do?

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,960
I get a choice?

17
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,629
Happy anniversary indeed.

18
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,930
No, Tim, come on.

19
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:42,131
We've got to get out of here.

20
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,166
This is too expensive.

21
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,767
We're not gonna pay
this much for a meal.

22
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:47,001
Yes, this is absurd, but listen,

23
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,604
this is a very special night,

24
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:50,206
and I need to make up for 20 years

25
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,308
of forgetting our
anniversary, so we stay.

26
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,255
That's very sweet and true.

27
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,847
Okay, you know what?
Yes. We're gonna stay.

28
00:00:57,872 --> 00:01:00,482
We're gonna stay and we'll
just have to eat fast food

29
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:01,706
for the rest of the year.

30
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:03,438
Planning on doing that anyway.

31
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:07,990
Enjoy your first dish.

32
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:11,227
Foam of scampi with an uni crust.

33
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:14,219
I recommend eating it
from the inside out.

34
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:15,865
Bon appétit.

35
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,635
Oh, God, Tim, you
constantly surprise me.

36
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:22,138
And these last 20
years have just been...

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,773
Done!

38
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:25,475
Next!

39
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,644
Oh, that's good.

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:31,092
WAITRESS: Let it swish

41
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,281
- around in your mouth.
- Thank you.

42
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:33,950
Let it just coat the inside

43
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,852
of all your mucus membranes.

44
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:37,386
Ah,<i> fantastique.</i>

45
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,489
WAITRESS: You will taste
all kinds of spices,

46
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:40,857
like clove,

47
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:43,066
cardamom and eye of newt.

48
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:45,294
(GASPS)

49
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:47,675
Ooh. I don't think it's a straw, babe.

50
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,309
Mmm.

51
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,240
How could you finish that already?

52
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,274
College.

53
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,453
Don't breathe, don't think.

54
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:00,592
Just drink.

55
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:03,131
This is loin of bush bison.

56
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,147
(SHOUTS)

57
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:05,782
I'm not eating your steak for you.

58
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:07,450
I haven't even finished my own.

59
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,685
It's your meat. You're my meat man.

60
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,693
I'm starting to get
full. I think I might

61
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,254
have to go to the bathroom
and take my underwear off

62
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,445
just to make more room.

63
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,060
I took mine off seven courses ago.

64
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,530
I didn't start the evening
with a pocket square.

65
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:22,352
WAITRESS: And now we set sail

66
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:24,573
through the South China Seas

67
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:26,536
to experience the famous

68
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,958
black pepper crab.

69
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,141
It just keeps coming.

70
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,495
We have to tell them to stop.

71
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,620
No. Heather,

72
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:38,541
this is the greatest
meal we might ever eat.

73
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,349
It's our children's college fund.

74
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,585
And we are going to finish it together.

75
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,343
I freakin' love you, Tim.

76
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:45,895
Okay.

77
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:47,760
We are not gonna have sex tonight.

78
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:48,817
No.

79
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,964
(GROANS)

80
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,232
You're slowing down. Come on.

81
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:58,159
We can't slow down. What's wrong?

82
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,914
I might need you to burp me.

83
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,371
You're seriously
looking at me like that?

84
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:05,263
I have changed you behind
a shed at a barbecue.

85
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:07,221
It's been a great 20 years, hasn't it?

86
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:08,579
- Yeah.
- All right, come on.

87
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,680
Oh, God. Okay,

88
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:12,081
just make it look like we're hugging.

89
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,883
- Shh, shh, shh.
- (BURPS)

90
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,185
(DINERS GROAN)

91
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,120
It's delicious, huh?

92
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:19,722
(GROANS)

93
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:22,158
Oh, it's gonna hit my
stomach and ping-pong back up.

94
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,324
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey. Come on. Look here.

95
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,716
You got it. You got this. There you go.

96
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,675
Oh, no more wine. No. I'm pregnant.

97
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:31,934
Whole right side of my body is numb.

98
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:33,302
I can't feel my right arm.

99
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:34,942
- Can't hold my fork anymore.
- (FORK CLATTERS)

100
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,667
(GROANS)

101
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,697
Have you been hiding
courses under the table?

102
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,345
- Just the even-numbered ones.
- Heather,

103
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,146
- I can't believe you lied to me.
- Oh, you know what?

104
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:46,900
Just shut up, Tim. I freakin' hate you.

105
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:48,851
This meal is just like our marriage.

106
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,952
You know, it just seems like

107
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,325
it's going on and on,

108
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,091
and it's not gonna end
until one of us dies.

109
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:57,942
Enjoying your meal?

110
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:58,828
It's amazing. It's
amazing. (CLEARS THROAT)

111
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,801
Wonderful. Is it still going on?

112
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,200
This dessert

113
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:03,259
is inspired

114
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,694
by the men and women

115
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,084
of the armed forces.

116
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,069
With every bite,

117
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:08,638
you're honoring them.

118
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,874
No course left behind.

119
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:16,925
Mmm.

120
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,082
Mm-hmm.

121
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,439
Oh, my God.

122
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,985
It's like a clown car where
you have to eat the clowns.

123
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:24,153
I can't do it... eat no more.

124
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:25,554
You got to put that in your purse.

125
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,589
Oh, honey, you have a hot towel.

126
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,336
Just stick it in there.

127
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,215
Hot towel?

128
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,637
I thought that was a course.

129
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,395
Did you eat your towel?

130
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,533
(STAMMERING) Everything's so blurry,

131
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,260
and he put lemon juice on it.

132
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:37,838
Oh, honey.

133
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,202
I think part of me knew it was a towel.

134
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,127
Hey, you know what?

135
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,242
I am so lucky to have you.

136
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,876
I love you, too, babe.

137
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:48,388
Are you gonna throw up?

138
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,165
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

139
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,631
_

140
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:56,575
So, my friend Helen,
the preschool director...

141
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,020
the one who cuts holes in her shoes

142
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:59,655
- to make room for her bunions.
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:01,223
Mm. Mm-hmm.

144
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:03,684
She took Lark off the wait list.

145
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,460
What?

146
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,228
Lark's in, starting Monday.

147
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,030
- That is amazing!
- Oh! (LAUGHS)

148
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,765
How did you make that happen?

149
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,300
Are you and Helen lovers?

150
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:13,469
- No. She wishes.
- Yeah. Mmm.

151
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,538
Well, you know, all the kids
have to be potty-trained,

152
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,206
and this one little fellow,

153
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,542
he was pooing in the turtle habitat

154
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:22,578
- and blaming it on the turtles, and...
- Oh.

155
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,180
Yeah, it's so great

156
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:26,015
that you've got Lark potty-trained.

157
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,085
- Well, of course.
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:30,369
Lark is...

159
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:31,287
- good to go.
- Yep.

160
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,421
Or not go.

161
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,687
Like her dad.

162
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:36,783
- I'm just so stressed.
- I know.

163
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:39,028
We've only got two days
to potty-train Lark.

164
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,263
No, it's about lying to my mom.

165
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,232
We have a relationship built on trust.

166
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,867
Yeah, but this didn't
start out as a lie.

167
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:46,035
You know? She just wanted us

168
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:47,837
to do it when Lark clearly wasn't ready.

169
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,839
And then we weren't ready,
and then we took that trip,

170
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,009
and then it was winter, and then
spring and summer, and now, well,

171
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,010
here we are.

172
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:55,411
- But now's a good time. Right?
- Yeah.

173
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:56,998
Larkie, you want to use the potty?

174
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,422
No!

175
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,916
She outsmarted us again.

176
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:02,518
JEN: Okay.

177
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,020
So Larkie goes in the potty

178
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:05,788
just like Mommy and Daddy.

179
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,765

TOY POTTY VOICE: Good
job! You're a big girl!

182
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,964
No, I want to go on that one.

183
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,365
JEN: All right.

184
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,434
- Sure. Big girl, big potty.
- Okay. Sure.

185
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:20,770
All right, there's that.

186
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:22,304

Look at you up there.

189
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:27,276
I could fall in.

190
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,278
Okay, you want to go in
the little potty, then?

191
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,513
No!

192
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:34,309
Well, much like when
I'm not in the mood,

193

I think we're gonna need some props.

194

(HIGH-PITCHED): Poop, poop.

195
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:41,123
Look what I did!

196
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:42,957
'Cause I'm a big girl.

197
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,994
And if you hold it in for too long,

198
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:46,996
it comes out your mouth.

199
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,364

(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

202
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,836
So, apparently we've
scared our daughter so much

203
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,954
that now she won't
even poop in her diaper.

204
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,140
Yeah, but at least we got
her to pee in the potty.

205
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,542
I mean, technically, she
started peeing and you

206
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,677
slipped the potty under
her, but you got a lot of it.

207
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,379
You think the preschool
would accept that?

208
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,448
I called and they said hard no.

209
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,818
(GROANS) We have 24
hours to make this happen.

210
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,387
Actually, it's more like an hour.

211
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,856
Yeah, uh, my mom wants
to come for dinner.

212
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,324
I-I could totally tell her no,

213
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,094
but I replied with those
emojis of the two dancing girls,

214
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:19,995
and-and that kind of
means boogie on over.

- (ELECTRONIC DING)
- Oh, wait a minute.

216
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:22,999
Oh. This is her.

217
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:24,518
She'd also like fajitas,

218
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,545
but she doesn't care which meat.

219
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,802
And, look,

220
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:28,003
I can totally tell her not to come.

221
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:29,105

- Oh, wait a minute.

She's here.

223
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,508
But I can totally tell her to leave.

224
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:37,109
I never thought of tofu as meat.

225
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,839
But the way you cook this,

226
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:41,230
it certainly requires a steak knife.

227
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,185
- I see what you did there.
- Mmm.

228

I should have mentioned
that I like shrimp.

- Shrimp is really easy to cook.

230
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,024
- Right.
- Uh, hey, Jen?

231
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,012
Lark's about to go
again, and she just says

232
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:54,470
that you applaud the best, so...

233
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,695
Chicken is another good option.

234
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,649
It's really difficult to screw it up.

235
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:00,569
That's why they call
it "the forgiving meat."

- Mm-hmm.
- I want to poop in a diaper!

Yeah. Uh, hey, you
want to know what, Mom?

238
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:07,910
Uh, what do you say we
go to your house, and, uh,

239
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:11,503
I can tell you about a traumatic
childhood memory that, uh,

240

I've never discussed with
anyone un-until this moment.

241
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,415
Is this about your tail?

242
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,653
- What?
- Your tail.

243

you'd never remember the surgery.

What's going on?

250

(SIGHS) We didn't potty-train Lark

251
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,624
when you told us to, and now...

252
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,467
well,

253
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:35,538
we're stuck.

00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,152
it just so happens

258
00:08:42,177 --> 00:08:45,748
I carry around a bag of
prunes for your father.

259
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,456
So, "no"

260
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:49,110
is no longer an option.

261
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,167
Good-bye.

262
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,972
I'm gonna go home and eat.

263
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:54,423
So we'll just circle back
to the tail thing, then.

264
00:08:57,762 --> 00:08:59,662
Oh, she's had an entire bag, Greg.

265
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,363
I mean, if we can't
get her to poop today,

266
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:03,265
we're just gonna have to
start over with a new baby.

Come on, Lark.

Come on, let's keep
eating these prunes, right?

to do with the fact

327
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,556
that Clementine just started
working here as a cart girl?

328
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,354
Nope, nope. I just love getting out

329
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,010
and playing all ten
holes every chance I get.

330
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,322
It's 18 holes.

331
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,264
18? Are you kidding me?
We'll be here all day.

332
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,765
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:30,404
(GOLF CLUB WHOOSHES THROUGH AIR, THUMPS)

334
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,739
You can play that.

335
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:33,341
Or-or hit another.

336
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,547
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

337
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:40,982
Hey, what's going on over there?

338
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,416
Oh, it's nothing. They're probably

339
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,541
just hitting on the cart girl.

340
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,419
Clementine?

341
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:46,487
Not necessarily.

342
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,389
I mean, it could be
a different cart girl.

343
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:50,490
No, the club only allows one.

344
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,845
When we had more, the
members kept paying them

345
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,471
to wrestle in the water hazards there.

346
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,465
Did everybody get one?

347
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,667
All I care about is that Clem is happy

348
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,836
and I finish this hole under ten.

349
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,068
Oh!

350
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:05,125
Hey!

351
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,341
Sorry.

352
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:08,709
You're still away.

353
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,301
- (LAUGHS): Have fun.
- All right.

354
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,483
Hey, guys.

355
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,752
Sorry. I got the balls
only the pros use,

356
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,620
- so they go a lot further.
- Oh.

357
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,269
Do you guys want anything to drink?

358
00:12:21,294 --> 00:12:23,924
No, I want to golf sober like an idiot.

359
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,424
- (CHUCKLES)
- Two beers.

360
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:26,928
- Okay.
- I'll have a Perrier.

361
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,962
What?

362
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,765
I mean, uh, rosé.

363
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:31,899
Okay.

364
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,492
- Rosé.
- Yeah.

365
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:34,869
And two beers.

366
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,304
That'll be 26 bucks.

367
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:38,587
But we agreed... I get you the job,

368
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,383
and you get me the free drinks.

369
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,777
Oh, is that what all
the winks were about?

370
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:44,612
No, I just thought you
were having a stroke.

371
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,553
Well, this is ridiculous.

372
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,041
I made you.

373
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,457
Do you want me to
watch you hit the ball?

374
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:54,850
I'd rather you didn't.

375
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:58,928
Oh! Geez.

376
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:00,036
Oh.

377
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:00,950
Hi.

378
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:02,129
Hi.

379
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,120
Look, on behalf of my entire gender,

380
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:06,846
I want to apologize for the
way that you were treated today.

381
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,604
(CHUCKLES) Are you kidding me?

382
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:11,268
Oh, I had so much fun today.

383
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:12,706
You know, I never knew
that I looked like someone

384
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:13,941
who could keep a secret.

385
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,659
Wait, so you're fine with
being completely exploited?

386
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:17,511
What are you talking about?

387
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:18,779
Well, I just thought you were above

388
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,094
using your sexuality to get a tip.

389
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:22,750
Wait, so that's what
you think I was doing?

390
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:23,515
Yeah.

391
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,539
Oh, well, then, no, no,
please, please, come on,

392
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:28,078
tell me how you think
a woman should behave.

393
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:29,657
Well, first of all, I don't
think she'd look to a man...

394
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:32,026
That was not a real question.

395
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,225
Save double bogey. (CHUCKLES)

396
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,665
(GRUNTS)

397
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,998
Whew, look at that hot new cart girl.

398
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:42,103
I don't understand how you guys get

399
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:43,855
any golf done around here.

400
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,272
(WHISTLES)

401
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,503
Hi, Dad!

402
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:51,045
You realize you were just
attracted to your own son?

403
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:54,015
And he's not even that hot.

404
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:56,884
Hey, Tyler, what are you doing here?

405
00:13:56,886 --> 00:14:00,521
And, more importantly, where do
you stand on family discounts?

406
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:03,665
I told the club president
that only having female servers

407
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,827
was a sexist policy that could
revoke their tax exempt status.

408
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:10,141
- Attaboy, huh? Stick it to the man.
- (CHUCKLES)

409
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,166
The man who's against
giving me free drinks.

410
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,750
That'll be 26 bucks.

411
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,304
Damn it, Tyler. Not you, too.

412
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,673
I should've let your old
man have his way with you.

413
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,894
- What?
- (CHUCKLES): Wha... (SPUTTERS)

414
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,754
And I'll pay for the drinks!

415
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,013
So, decided to go
behind Clementine's back

416
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,156
and steal her job, huh?

417
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:29,214
Wouldn't it have been easier

418
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:31,198
to just admit to her
that you were jealous?

419
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:33,587
Then she'd know that I made a
huge mistake in wanting a divorce.

420
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:34,989
Everyone knows you made a mistake.

421
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,401
That doesn't mean she doesn't think

422
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,815
it was a mistake, too.

423
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,994
- You think?
- So you need to go find that girl

424
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,230
and you need to get
her back in your life.

425
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,473
All right? You go tell her how you feel.

426
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:46,012
- Really?
- Yes!

427
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:47,590
She can't read minds.

428
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:48,812
She's not a psychic.

429
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:50,671
God, I hope she's not psychic.

430
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,520
- All right. Thanks, Dad.
- Go!

431
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,078
- Run!
- (CHUCKLES)

432
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:57,856
Look at him.

433
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:01,082
Enjoying the show, you sick freak?

434
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,209
Clem.

435
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,688
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

436
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,290
- You gonna apologize?
- Yes.

437
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:13,005
Look, I'm sorry that I
acted like such a jerk.

438
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,711
You were right. I was just jealous

439
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,837
of all the attention
that you were getting.

440
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,033
You know, Tyler, this
divorce hasn't been

441
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,104
exactly easy on me either.

442
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,594
- Really? Because I was rethinking
my decision... - MAN: Hey!

443
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,383
You must be Tyler?

444
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,375
Yeah, has Clementine
been talking about me?

445
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,470
No. She just said your name.

446
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,588
Um, this is Ricardo. He works
with me in the kids' club.

447
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,716
Hey, we should probably get going if
we want to catch the meteor shower.

448
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,228
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

449
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:38,933
I'll talk to you later, okay?

450
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,064
Nice to meet you.

451
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,188
Yeah.

452
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,135
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

453
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,994
Is that Clementine's new fella?

454
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,959
She could do a lot worse.

455
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:53,434
Maybe someday she will.

456
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:56,264
Thanks, Pop-Pop.

457
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:01,959

00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,646
Ooh, Napa Chardonnay. Hmm.

459
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:07,952
Hey, Uncle Matt.

460
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,417
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I'm definitely not taking food

461
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,219
and sticking it in a grocery
bag and then going home

462
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,154
because I didn't think anyone was here.

463
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:15,522
Cool.

464
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,325
Why aren't you at the strawberry
festival with your family?

465
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,354
That's where they went? (CHUCKLES)

466
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,464
I just woke up and nobody was here.

467
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:24,807
I'm sure your parents will feel terrible

468
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,932
when they realize they left you out.

469
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:30,125
No, they won't. Dad'll
come in and he'll be like,

470
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,562
"Oh, how'd you beat us in from the car?"

471
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,871
Yeah, I know what it's
like being a middle child.

472
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,062
I mean, look around this place.

473
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:37,611
There's no pictures of me anywhere.

474
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,936
And I'm the good-looking
one. You know, my whole life,

475
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:41,634
it was all about Heather.
And then, suddenly,

476
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,024
Greg was born with a tail, and
it's like I don't even exist.

477
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,539
No one told me he had a tail.

478
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:47,421
(SIGHS) Nobody tells me anything.

479
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,723
I'm like the middle piece of
bread in a club sandwich...

480
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,725
Everyone just wishes
you were more bacon.

481
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,636
You know what?

482
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:54,795
All that changes today.

483
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,597
Today is Middle Child Day.

484
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,765
What is something that you
have always wanted to do

485
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,834
but you haven't been able to do
because you're the forgotten one?

486
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,603
I don't care. You choose.

487
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,193
No. Stop accommodating
everyone like a middle.

488
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,217
Be the bacon.

489
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,074
Uh... (CHUCKLES)

490
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,176
I've always wanted to do trapeze.

491
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,143
Anything else?

492
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,334
Get my tongue pierced?

493
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,025
- Trapeze it is.
- (LAUGHS)

494
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,851
You know, there is a piercing
place around the corner.

495
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,586
It's only got one star
on Yelp, but that's fine.

496
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,188
What if I love this?

497
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,790
What if I'm good at this?
What if it becomes a career?

498
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,627
What if I give you all the money in
my wallet and we just call this a day?

499
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,061
I thought you didn't have any money

500
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,296
and I had to pay for this.

501
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,433
That is correct.

502
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,191
Are you scared of heights?

503
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:34,404
I thought you were
just afraid of spiders.

504
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,936
Oh! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

505
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:37,593
Oh, look at that.

506
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:38,874
Yeah, no, I'm scared of heights.

507
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:40,140
Why? Do you think that
there's spiders up there, too?

508
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,375
Because if there are,
then, you know what,

509
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:42,643
to hell with it...
I'm just gonna go home.

510
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,444
Uncle Matt, the thing
about being a middle

511
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:48,983
is that people never believe
in us or they forget about us.

512
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,218
- But you know what?
- What?

513
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,737
I don't know. I've never been
able to make a speech this long

514
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,595
without someone interrupting me.

515
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,859
You're right.

516
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,142
Middle power.

517
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,267
View is beautiful.

518
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,835
(PANTING)

519
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:13,325
I really should've told Colleen
I loved her this morning.

520
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,130
Can't believe my last
words to her are gonna be,

521
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,276
"Hey, can you hand me that spray?

522
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:18,578
I just wrecked this bathroom."

523
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,980
Hey! Hurry up!

524
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,815
Other people want to go, too!

525
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,350
We'll go when we're ready!

526
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,885
You want to come down here and say that?

527
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,286
Yes, I really do!

528
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,871
Okay. We're gonna do this.

529
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:31,024
All right, just take this bar.

530
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,588
There it is. (CHUCKLES): Hey.

531
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,894
All right, now. (SIGHS)

532
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,330
Now... now, just don't look down.

533
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:39,499
Don't look... what'd I just say?

534
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,867
Matt, don't look down. Don't...

535
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,437
Uncle Matt?

536
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,150
Are you okay?!

537
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:51,011
Don't say anything if you're okay!

538
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:00,951
All right, Sammy, here you go!

539
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,356
Spotlight's all yours!

540
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,424
SAMANTHA: Okay! Here it goes!

541
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:06,460
Ready, set, go.

542
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,061
(SQUEALS, LAUGHS)

543
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,663
Hey, man, check it out.
That's my niece. I mean,

544
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,732
she's a little bit quiet, but
if you keep your eye on her,

545
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,067
you see what makes her so special.

546
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,471
Oh! Oh, no! Okay. All
right, all right, all right.

547
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:19,473
- That is special.
- Okay, well, look away.

548
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:20,658
That's my niece.

549
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:21,942
Ooh!

550
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,394
Look at you! You're
amazing! With the thing

551
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,852
with the legs! You went upside down!

552
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:28,683
- It was incredible! (LAUGHS)
- I know! Thank you.

553
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,017
Would you like a souvenir
photo of you on the trapeze?

554
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,586
Whoa.

555
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,755
Or you being lifted out
of the net by a cable?

556
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,080
Whoa. (CHUCKLES) Man, I
don't even remember that.

557
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:39,387
(CHUCKLES) It probably
happens all the time, huh?

558
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,444
No.

559
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:43,330
It's $19 for one or $20 for 50.

560
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,411
What would we possibly do
with that many pictures of us?

561
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,851
(CHUCKLES)

562
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,827
This is great. (CHUCKLES)

563
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,624
I can't wait to see their faces
when they notice these pictures.

564
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:00,851
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES)

565
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,757
You think tomorrow I'm gonna go back

566
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:04,242
to being the middle kid
that doesn't get invited

567
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,744
to the strawberry festival?

568
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,398
Honestly?

569
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,585
Yeah, probably.

570
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,948
(CHUCKLES)

571
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:11,917
But I won't ever see you that way.

572
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:15,144
Do you want to hear something
that no one else knows?

573
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,468
What?

574
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:19,191
Colleen and I are trying to have a baby.

575
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:21,523
Oh, my gosh!

576
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:22,894
- That's so exciting!
- (CHUCKLES)

577
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:24,996
- Thank you. Now, you can't tell anyone.
- (CHUCKLES)

578
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:26,631
- No, I-I won't.
- Okay.

579
00:20:27,202 --> 00:20:28,667
Do you want to hear something first?

580
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:31,002
- Yeah!
- I have a boyfriend.

581
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:32,404
Oh, Sam.

582
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,405
He's a senior.

583
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,306
Hmm?

584
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:35,540
Isn't that so hot?

585
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:38,343
(CHUCKLING): Oh...

586
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:43,554

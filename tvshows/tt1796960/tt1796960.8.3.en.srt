<i>Vice President Warner will be

5
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:14,457
You're here

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,583
but you're asking
about Russians.

7
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,127
Jesus, Mike, not you, too.

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:17,836
What the hell'd they tell you?

9
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:20,171
That you tanked
the polygraph.

10

Jalal..."We don't want
to stop the war.

We're winning."

12
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,384
That's his son, Haqqani.

13
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,177
"But we never do."

14
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,346
That's the head of the Taliban
saying, "Enough of war."

15
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,057
Haqqani is tired
of the fight, <i>aba.</i>

16
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:35,061
Direct talks with Berenson
could lead to a breakthrough

17
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:37,022
Well, any breakthrough
must be controlled by us

18
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:38,064
and not the United States.

19
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:40,984
Or prevent it from happening
in the first place.

20

Anything new?

00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,593
We'll find out
when the president

Yeah, you leave Washington for

00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,946
We may not have gone

00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,322
but we know how to have
a good time.

84
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,287
Thank you all

85
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,790
for getting here
on such short notice

86
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,417
at such a late hour.

87
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,464
General Ryan
has been in contact

88
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,799
with the Taliban delegation
in Doha,

89
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:17,925
and they've confirmed
that Saul Berenson

90
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,470
is their prisoner.

91
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:24,056
Despite our intel
implicating the I. S. I.,

92
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,977
Haqqani is convinced we were
behind the attempt on his life,

93
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,979
and he's threatening
to kill Saul

94
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,190
at the first sign of a rescue.

95
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,317
Well, I realize, uh,
I was out of town

96
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,863
when all this was decided,
but what in the hell

97
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:38,740
was the National Security
Advisor thinking?

98
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:41,660
He was trying to facilitate

99
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:43,328
a breakthrough
in the negotiations.

100
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:46,039
How many red lights
we gonna let this guy run?

101
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,750
He's a Keane holdover anyway.

102
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,751
I say fire his ass.

103
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:53,130
Well, I don't know, Ben.

104
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:55,757
Shouldn't we try
to get him back first?

105
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,348
HQ wants to keep
a low profile.

106
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:03,765
Nothing that
will draw attention.

107
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,600
Uh-huh.

108
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,227
Come in.

109
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,606
Glad you're not leaving
without saying good-bye.

110
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:14,443
I'm not leaving.

111
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:17,112
Not yet anyway.

112
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:19,823
I'm fairly certain I signed
a travel memo.

113
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:21,408
You're due back in Germany
this evening.

114
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:25,162
Hey, Alan, give us a minute,
will you?

115
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:26,455
Sure.

116
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,924
Yevgeny Gromov...

117
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,469
is here
in Kabul.

118
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:48,310
Aren't you at all curious
what he's up to?

119
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:50,562
Whatever it is,
we can't touch him.

120
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,521
Orders from on high...
no contact,

121
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:54,483
no officer access,
not even at arm's length.

122
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm aware.
He contacted me.

123
00:05:58,403 --> 00:05:59,529
Last night at the club,
he put himself in front of me,

124
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,783
said he was the one who gave us
the lead on Samira Noori.

125
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,245
Any idea why he would
do something like that?

126
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,247
It's hard to say for sure,

127
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:11,666
but I think we're obligated
to find out, don't you?

128
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,384
You realize we're gonna
need consent from headquarters

129
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:21,843
to follow up.

130
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:24,387
Not necessarily.

131
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,348
Not if we wait for him
to reach out again.

132
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:27,182
Are you so sure he will?

133
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:30,352
He already has,
twice in secret.

134
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:31,520
Clearly there's
something on his mind.

135
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:35,732
Since when is this
even a debate?

136
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:38,193
Russian intelligence
is knocking on our door.

137
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,028
It's more complicated
than that, and you know it.

138
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,656
Yeah, it's complicated!
I lost seven months of my life!

139
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:46,785
You look me in the eye
and tell me

140
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,537
I don't get a shot
at some operational payback.

141
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:58,588
I guess I could fail to report
the contact last night

142
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:03,009
and call the next one, if it
happens, a chance encounter.

143
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,220
That's a good plan.

144
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:07,556
You're finally getting
the hang of this job.

145
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,518
48 hours.

146
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,979
If he's not in touch by then,

147
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:15,564
you're on your way
back to Germany.

148
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:16,523
Fair enough.

149
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:34,249
It wasn't us.
If it was, you'd be dead.

150
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:36,626
Arrogant as ever.

151
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,628
I was on the street
trying to save you.

152
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:39,796
Your men saw me.

153
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,673
My men are dead.

154
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:43,633
They were murdered
by the I.S.I.

155
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,468
Who couldn't have known
about our meeting

156
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:46,761
because I did not tell them.

157
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:48,847
Well, someone did.

158
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,973
Someone you confided in.

159
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,726
Someone you trust.

160
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,352
You have a traitor
in your camp.

161
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,730
- Enough.
- You read my letter.

162
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,442
I took as big a risk
coming here as you did.

163
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,652
Enough!

164
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,779
Your death would have
served me no purpose.

165
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,947
The opposite.

166
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:05,674
<i>Don't worry.</i>

167
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:07,092
Any doubts
about your leadership

168
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:08,343
will be resolved
at the Shura.

169
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:10,637
What makes you so sure?

170
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,640
They remember
what your father forgot.

171
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:16,017
That without me,
there is no Taliban.

172
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,139
Hello.

173
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:56,016
Jalala.

174
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:58,810
Speak English
so we are not understood.

175
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:02,313
Amadullah said there was an
assassin sent by the Americans.

176
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:04,232
He told me you were dead.

177
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,985
My men went ahead
as a precaution.

178
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:08,236
<i>Four are murdered.</i>

179
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:10,613
Thank God you're alive.

180
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:14,117
The danger isn't over.

181
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,911
You must come at once.

182
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,121
<i>Where are you now?</i>

183
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:24,002
With our cousins,
north of Peshawar.

184
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:25,920
<i>I'll be there
as soon as I can.</i>

185
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,766
He wants me by his side.

186
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,476
Then you must go to him.

187
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,686
What if he thinks it was me?

188
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,646
You have to convince him
otherwise.

189
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,315
He'll figure it out.

190
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:46,441
Not if you keep
your wits about you.

191
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:50,278
You and I are
the only ones who know.

192
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,697
And what
about this meeting...

193
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:54,449
the one we're having
right now?

194
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:57,243
He'll find out
about that for sure.

195
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:59,621
Then tell him the truth.

196
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:01,623
Tell him I came
to talk to you

197
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,875
about consolidating your power
in the wake of his death.

198
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,926
Your time will come, Jalal.

199
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:17,430
Until then, you need
to be your father's son.

200
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:24,354
Change keywords.

201
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:26,606
National Security Advisor.

202
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:29,567
Hostage.

203
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:31,194
Ransom.

204
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:32,612
Search.

205
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,075
- Hey.
- I got him.

206
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:39,119
Don't fight it!
Just let it happen!

207
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:40,161
Just let it happen!
Let it happen!

208
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:43,790
- Chill the fuck out!
- Get the fuck off of me!

209
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:46,376
- The shirt!
- I got it, go, go!

210
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,085
Yes! Yes!

211
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,461
Yes!

212
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:51,798
You fucking freaks!

213
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:55,385
- Is that all you got?
- Hey, Max, chill out!

214
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:57,178
Chill, chill.
He's going up to the firebase.

215
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:58,221
He just needed
a hardcore hit.

216
00:11:58,304 --> 00:11:59,639
Sorry, man, I had to.

217
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:00,390
How many times
do I have to tell you?

218
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:02,684
I'm not your fucking Buddha!

219
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,018
Don't say that.
You're gonna jinx it.

220
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:05,603
Oh, yeah?

221
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:09,023
I just got my boss
taken prisoner.

222
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:11,067
How fucking lucky is that?

223
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,586
I'm Carrie Mathison.

224
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:31,254
I was told something
was dropped off for me.

225
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:32,881
Of course, ma'am.

226
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:07,118
Contact was made
the same way as before...

227
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:08,244
kid on a bike
passes the message

228
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:10,580
to one of the contractors
guarding the perimeter.

229
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:12,040
- Just an address?
- And a time.

230
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,583
Zero six thirty
tomorrow morning.

231
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,544
Fifty-two hundred
Asmayi Road.

232
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:18,671
That's the Abdul Kahn Mosque.

233
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,381
Just across the street
from the Ministry of Finance.

234
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:21,507
The handwriting's a match.

235
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:25,053
There's no reason to believe
this is anybody but him.

236
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:26,095
It's an odd choice
for a rendezvous, though.

237
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,598
Not if you're considering
coming over to our side.

238
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,100
Is that what you think?

239
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:33,728
That Yevgeny Gromov
is recruitable?

240
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:35,563
I'm beginning to.

241
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:37,732
I mean, first, the unsolicited
help with G'ulom.

242
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:40,526
Now this.

243
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,236
Huh.

244
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,071
It's Kabul, Carrie.

245
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:45,573
You're gonna need backup
regardless.

246
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:47,116
What do you think,
three teams on foot?

247
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,577
Minimum, plus a rotation
of vehicles.

248
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,870
You might as well put me back
on the plane to Germany, then.

249
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:53,414
Come on, Carrie,
you know I can't let you

250
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:54,415
hunt alone on this one.

251
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,374
He'll be watching.

252
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,585
He'll make our people
in two seconds,

253
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:58,795
and if he's
the least bit skittish,

254
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:00,671
the chance will be lost.

255
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:08,012
Hey, it's your station, Mike.
It's your call.

256
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:12,225
You know what I would do.

257
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,402
If we think she was
compromised in Russia...

258
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:24,612
Why would we give her
the go-ahead

259
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:26,781
to meet with a Russian?

260
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:27,907
I think I just answered
my own question.

261
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,785
To get her to incriminate
herself, right?

262
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,954
Right, which is how come I was
pushing so hard for backup.

263
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:36,249
We need eyes and ears
on her the whole time.

264
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:38,960
- What about a bug?
- What about it?

265
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:39,794
Any chance you could
slip one into her purse?

266
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,421
- Carrie's purse?
- Yeah.

267
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:44,799
Uh, highly unlikely.

268
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:47,593
Not buying
the friendship routine, huh?

269
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:50,638
No, she is, we're just not
braiding each other's hair yet.

270
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:54,016
Parabolic it is, then.

271
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,854
Tell her one team in a van
parked where no one can see.

272
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:30,321
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Tasneem.

273
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:33,074
- <i>Who's this?</i>
- It's Jalal.

274
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:35,076
- <i>What the hell are you doing?</i>
- We have a problem.

275
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:36,788
<i>You're on an open line.</i>

276
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:39,082
<i>I told you never to call me
on an open line.</i>

277
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:40,625
<i>Tasneem?
Tasneem?</i>

278
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:21,374
Mind if I join?

279
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,334
Not at all.

280
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,054
You ever sleep?

281
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:38,016
Is it that obvious?

282
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:42,312
You're never in your room.

283
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,022
I'm right next door.
Walls are like paper.

284
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:52,989
So, uh, what happens tomorrow?

285
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,535
Your guess is as good as mine.

286
00:19:57,618 --> 00:19:59,454
Let's say Yevgeny
asks to defect.

287
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,456
What's the procedure?

288
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:04,208
That he won't do.

289
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,127
Why not?
I thought you said...

290
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,256
I said he was a candidate
for recruitment, not defection.

291
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,300
The last thing a field guy
like Yevgeny wants

292
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:14,844
is a new identity
and a condo in Scottsdale.

293
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:18,014
You know him better
than anybody, I guess.

294
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:21,893
Is that what Mike told you?

295
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:24,604
No, I just assumed.

296
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,397
Don't assume.

297
00:20:31,152 --> 00:20:32,904
What has he told you?

298
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,322
Not much.

299
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:38,826
Come on.

300
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:44,082
Your long stay in Russia
raised some flags.

301
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:51,589
Are you spying on me, Jenna?

302
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:54,258
Mike send you up here
to take my temperature?

303
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:56,177
No.

304
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:15,780
I've met Yevgeny Gromov
exactly five times in my life.

305
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:17,907
Two of those times have
happened right here in Kabul

306
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,909
over the past few days.

307
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,789
For all I know...

308
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,749
he's staging this whole event
just to throw more shade on me

309
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,127
and do what he does best...

310
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,212
spread rumor and innuendo,

311
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:33,714
divide us against ourselves.

312
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:36,092
Why even agree
to meet with him, then?

313
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:39,637
'Cause I could be wrong.

314
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,473
He could just as easily
be the genuine article.

315
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:47,270
How you gonna know
which it is?

316
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,105
That's the thing...
you never really do.

317
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,568
Not 100%, anyway.

318
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,926
You're free to go.
No one will stop you.

319
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,001
Wait!

320
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,213
Wait.

321
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:58,799
What's happened?

322
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:23,032
What is this place?

323
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,243
<i>Badonbaay.</i>

324
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,332
It means
"where the clouds end."

325
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:33,459
My father used
to bring me here.

326
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:40,132
There, that's where I grew up,

327
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:42,426
at the end of the valley.

328
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,262
Afghanistan.

329
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:50,768
My unlucky country.

330
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:03,739
It was Jalal who tried
to have me killed.

331
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,038
He's the youngest
of my four sons,

332
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:13,958
the only one
who's still alive.

333
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,752
Yes, I know.

334
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:18,754
I was hoping for something
more for him

335
00:24:18,838 --> 00:24:19,672
than war and death.

336
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:22,967
It's not too late.

337
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:27,013
Anybody else
would be dead already.

338
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:29,890
Surely you can make
an exception

339
00:24:29,974 --> 00:24:31,350
for your own child.

340
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:34,186
Not without compromising
my command.

341
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:40,484
No, the only other option
is to step down.

342
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:42,278
Don't do that.

343
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:48,326
Maybe it's time.

344
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:49,201
Some have said as much.

345
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:51,120
There are many
who would take my place.

346
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:53,664
None who have the power
or influence

347
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:55,333
to end the war.

348
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,171
You overstate my standing.

349
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:04,216
Is that why they call you
"the Arrow of God"?

350
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:11,474
I'm...

351
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:12,808
just a man.

352
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:18,147
Then you are a man
like Faisal was to the Saudis,

353
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,650
Kemal to the Turks.

354
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:46,884
<i>Where the fuck is he?</i>

355
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,136
Still no sign.

356
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,389
<i>He's 15 minutes late.</i>

357
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:53,140
<i>Any chance he made you?</i>

358
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:54,892
We're pretty hidden up here.

359
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:03,901
Any chance she made you
and warned him?

360
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:05,778
<i>I don't see how.</i>

361
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,238
<i>We've been on her since
she got out of the taxi.</i>

362
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,906
Hasn't even looked up
in our direction.

363
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:10,991
Stand by.

364
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:12,535
<i>Standing by.</i>

365
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,274
Listen to me.

366
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:09,318
Another Islamic Emirate
of Afghanistan

367
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,403
will be never won
on the battlefield.

368
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:15,491
You don't know that.
How can you say that?

369
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,368
The West won't allow it,

370
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:20,454
no matter what the I.S.I.
is telling you.

371
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,127
Then we will outlast them,
Father.

372
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:28,796
We will outlast them.

373
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,801
No.

374
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:38,639
No.

375
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:41,517
We are just strong enough

376
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,811
never to lose

377
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:46,897
and just weak enough
never to win.

378
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:55,573
So you've decided.

379
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:03,539
What choice do I have
but to accept your decision?

380
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:14,508
You could do it
as a good soldier...

381
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:17,428
and a good son.

382
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:19,930
At the end of a rope?

383
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:23,267
With a gun to my head?

384
00:29:58,218 --> 00:30:00,429
What do you say now, Jalala?

385
00:30:02,306 --> 00:30:03,641
Will you join me
on this new path?

386
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:12,858
I will try...

387
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:16,195
Father...

388
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:17,655
for you.

389
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:21,630
Come.

390
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,383
We have much to discuss.

391
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:34,017
Another ten minutes,
and I'm calling it.

392
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,018
<i>Copy that.</i>

393
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:39,815
Well?

394
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,024
I don't buy it.

395
00:33:41,108 --> 00:33:42,651
Why make the whole thing up?

396
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,319
Because she didn't want
to go back to Germany.

397
00:33:44,403 --> 00:33:45,696
Look at her.

398
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,197
She's just as bummed
he didn't show as we are.

399
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:49,408
It's an act.

400
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:51,076
She must know
we're watching her,

401
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:51,869
or at least suspect.

402
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:55,372
That doesn't make her
a liar.

403
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:57,207
She reported the contact,
didn't she?

404
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,960
What the hell?

405
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:01,753
Mike, look.

406
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:12,806
Right on cue.

407
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,141
You knew?

408
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:16,393
The minute I read
the time and place.

409
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:18,896
Your people,
do they know?

410
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:19,938
They do now.

411
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:21,899
Are you getting this?

412
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:23,525
I can't make out
a word they're saying.

413
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:25,402
Negative, problem is we're
aimed right at a wall of sound.

414
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:28,071
- Fix it.
- We're trying.

415
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,006
Where are we going?

416
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:33,841
We'll talk by the fountain.

417
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:36,844
I want to make double sure
they can't hear us.

418
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,056
What's so amusing?

419
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,392
Just admiring the tradecraft.

420
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:53,611
What do you want?

421
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:56,822
Come on, admit it... you're
a little pleased to see me.

422
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:59,367
You know, "pleased" isn't the
first word that comes to mind.

423
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,411
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

424
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:04,622
Apology is in order.

425
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:06,666
I didn't mean to leave
your life like that.

426
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,793
Well, it was crowded.

427
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:09,585
I assumed you didn't want
to be seen.

428
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:13,798
No, not... not at the bar.
In Moscow.

429
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,676
At the asylum.

430
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:20,137
I'm sorry I left you alone
in that place.

431
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:24,767
So... so what was
Samira Noori, then... penance?

432
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,644
Yeah, sort of.

433
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:28,562
And Roshan Shadman?

434
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:29,730
Who's that?

435
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:31,440
Tied to a truck

436
00:35:31,524 --> 00:35:33,818
and dragged through the streets
of Ghazni to his death?

437
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:35,987
Sorry, I don't know
who that is.

438
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,699
Tell that to his widow,
to his 12-year-old child.

439
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:41,784
I can see you're angry, but
I had nothing to do with that.

440
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:45,496
Well, forgive me,
but you're full of shit.

441
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:48,499
Don't think I don't know
what you're really doing.

442
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:49,583
You're wrong.

443
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:52,169
I really was trying to just...

444
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:55,423
just pick up
where we left off.

445
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,591
Right, whatever that means.

446
00:35:57,675 --> 00:36:00,803
You really do not remember?

447
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:05,933
Remember what?

448
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:11,188
Remember what?

449
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:14,358
I saved your life...

450
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:16,402
for one thing.

451
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:22,575
You were trying
to hang yourself

452
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:26,037
with a rope
made from your bedsheets.

453
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:34,086
I hadn't seen you in months,
I got there, and by pure luck...

454
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,421
<i>If I was there a minute later,
just a minute later,</i>

455
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:38,299
you would have been gone.

456
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:41,677
And after that,
I managed to get you

457
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,929
back on your meds
for a couple weeks.

458
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:49,643
There was a birch forest
right near the hospital.

459
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:51,270
<i>You really liked
walking there.</i>

460
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,026
It's true.

461
00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:00,404
Turns out we had
a lot to talk about.

462
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:02,740
Really?
Like what?

463
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:04,658
Like your relationship
with Nicholas Brody.

464
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:07,453
Tell me something you didn't
just read in my file.

465
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,415
You had a daughter with him.

466
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:14,585
Franny.

467
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:18,672
You slipped her head underwater

468
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:20,091
in the bath.

469
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:27,598
There was a moment
when you actually considered

470
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:30,434
drowning your own child.

471
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:42,780
Shh.

472
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,119
And now they aren't
saying a word.

473
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,453
Fuck.

474
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,588
I have to go.

475
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:09,348
How much of what they did say

476
00:38:09,432 --> 00:38:10,057
are we gonna be able
to recover?

477
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:10,975
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

478
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:12,810
<i>I'll get the techs
working on it</i>

479
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:14,353
<i>once we're back
at the station.</i>

480
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:15,646
Make it a first priority.

481
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:26,157
- David.
- Mr. President.

482
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,825
We may have caught a break.

483
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:30,327
Haqqani released Saul
a little over an hour ago.

484
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:32,580
What happened?

485
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:35,624
It turns out Haqqani's son
was an I.S.I. asset.

486
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,918
They promised him
keys to the kingdom.

487
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,670
If he killed Daddy?

488
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:42,381
Something like that.

489
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:44,300
Does this mean Daddy
might be willing

490
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:45,509
to negotiate after all?

491
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:47,011
Looks that way.

492
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,597
I need you to talk Saul
through some

493
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,349
of the stickier points
of the deal just in case.

494
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:53,767
He's got to know
where he can compromise,

495
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:57,813
where to hold the line.

496
00:38:57,897 --> 00:38:59,565
He's expecting your call.

497
00:39:03,235 --> 00:39:04,528
What is it, David?

498
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:08,991
Last night I asked
the vice president

499
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:11,827
about an unscheduled trip
to Columbus.

500
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:14,288
He said he was there
for a football game

501
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:15,706
with Frank Gillette.

502
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:17,750
So?

503
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,877
So he neglected to mention
that every other major donor

504
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,921
in the country
was also there.

505
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:24,840
It was a who's who
of heavy hitters.

506
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:27,218
He's fundraising for his side.

507
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,178
Not much we can do about that.

508
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:32,181
Or positioning himself.

509
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:34,767
Positioning himself?

510
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,935
Well, you're aware Ohio voters
approved a proposition

511
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:38,729
to move up the state's primary.

512
00:39:38,812 --> 00:39:42,255
They're now number two in line
after the Iowa caucuses.

513
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,560
No vice president
has ever challenged

514
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:46,747
a sitting president, David.

515
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,542
No vice president's ever been
from the opposing party.

516
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:54,046
Not for 150 years, anyway.

517
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:57,800
Look, the country
was tearing itself apart.

518
00:39:57,883 --> 00:40:00,094
You reached across the aisle
to bridge the divide,

519
00:40:00,177 --> 00:40:02,721
but those fault lines run deep.

520
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:05,265
They're still active.

521
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,559
And Ben Hayes is in the perfect
position to exploit them.

522
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:13,399
Has he put a poll
in the field?

523
00:40:13,482 --> 00:40:14,441
Not yet.

524
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,570
Well...

525
00:40:18,654 --> 00:40:20,698
let me know when he does.

526
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:24,201
Everything we've talked about
so far falls apart

527
00:40:24,284 --> 00:40:28,455
without a timeline
for Taliban disarmament.

528
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:31,375
We disarm when there are
no more foreign troops

529
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,835
in Afghanistan.

530
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:33,752
National Unity Government
will never accept

531
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:36,171
that order of events,

532
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:38,507
and neither will
the United States.

533
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,261
If you're serious
about a political settlement,

534
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:44,263
first you must agree
to a mechanism

535
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:46,515
for decommissioning
your weapons.

536
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:47,975
- What do I get in return?
- A lot.

537
00:40:48,058 --> 00:40:51,437
Amnesty for your fighters,

538
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,940
guaranteed positions
in the new government,

539
00:40:55,023 --> 00:40:56,275
and a clean break
from the Pakistan military,

540
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:59,236
who's held you hostage
all these years.

541
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:04,491
You also gain the power
of legitimacy.

542
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:07,786
No longer identified
as a terror organization,

543
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,329
you can start
to enjoy the comforts

544
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:10,873
of political privilege.

545
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:12,416
Your good friends
in Saudi Arabia

546
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:14,710
looking to fund the movement
can do so legally.

547
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:19,631
Your wealth and influence
will actually grow and expand.

548
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,822
Sometimes I'm thinking...

549
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:47,117
I just want to go home
while I still can.

550
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:49,912
That too.

551
00:42:06,011 --> 00:42:08,472
Okay.

552
00:42:12,184 --> 00:42:13,477
Okay?

553
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,686
I agree.

554
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:22,444
We have a deal, then?

555
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:25,989
You and I...

556
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:27,115
known each other
a long time.

557
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,494
I'm counting on you
to make sure

558
00:42:30,577 --> 00:42:34,164
America lives up
at its end of the bargain.

559
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:36,083
It will.

560
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:40,629
Then, yes, we have a deal.

561
00:42:40,712 --> 00:42:41,797
And you'll declare an immediate
country-wide cease fire

562
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,132
as we discussed?

563
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:49,638
Starting tomorrow morning.

564
00:42:57,813 --> 00:43:01,316
What's wrong?

565
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,903
I'm worried I made a mistake
with Jalal.

566
00:43:04,987 --> 00:43:05,737
By letting him go?

567
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:08,991
Hmm.

568
00:43:09,074 --> 00:43:11,410
By not putting
his head in a bag

569
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:14,746
and sending it to his fighters
in the field as a warning.

570
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:25,132
Hey, what's this?

571
00:43:25,215 --> 00:43:26,967
What's it look like?

572
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,344
You seeing this, Sarge?

573
00:43:29,428 --> 00:43:31,221
Christ sakes,
leave the man alone.

574
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,474
You can't be serious, bro.

575
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:37,811
I'm on a chopper back
to Bagram in a couple hours.

576
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:39,980
No way.

577
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:42,274
What about the Pakistan border,
patrolling the airwaves?

578
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:45,611
It's all on automatic
collection now.

579
00:43:45,694 --> 00:43:47,946
What about your boss?
He's still out there somewhere.

580
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,698
You can't... you can't just
give up on him.

581
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:52,200
- He's been released.
- When?

582
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:53,577
This morning.

583
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:57,289
That's fucked up.

584
00:43:57,372 --> 00:43:58,665
Soto, relax.

585
00:43:58,749 --> 00:43:59,499
You're gonna give
yourself a stroke.

586
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,668
- Get over it.
- You get over it.

587
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:05,213
Haven't you noticed?
Dude's been here a week.

588
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:08,759
Not a single IED, RPG, mortar,
rocket, sniper, nothing.

589
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:11,136
I'm not saying it ain't weird.

590
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:13,889
It's weirder than weird.

591
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:16,350
We shouldn't even
be talking about it.

592
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:19,311
Well, nobody's going
anywhere anyhow.

593
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:20,604
How's that?

594
00:44:20,687 --> 00:44:21,813
We got some weather coming in.

595
00:44:21,897 --> 00:44:24,191
What?

596
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:26,276
Yeah, it's gonna get nasty.

597
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,320
All air traffic in
the mountains is grounded.

598
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:29,988
Usually takes
a couple days to clear.

599
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:31,531
Oh.

600
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:36,495
Thank you, God.

601
00:44:36,578 --> 00:44:38,997
Thank you.

602
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:53,929
- Come on.
- Where?

603
00:44:54,012 --> 00:44:55,639
Berenson's been
waiting for you.

604
00:44:55,722 --> 00:44:57,015
Saul's here?

605
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:58,517
In the SCIF
talking to the president.

606
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,935
Apparently there's
been a breakthrough

607
00:45:00,018 --> 00:45:02,312
in the negotiations.

608
00:45:10,445 --> 00:45:13,115
...our government
to the process.

609
00:45:13,198 --> 00:45:16,034
Without that,
we wouldn't even be here.

610
00:45:18,453 --> 00:45:21,039
<i>Is that you, Ms. Mathison?</i>

611
00:45:21,123 --> 00:45:22,708
<i>Um, it is, sir.</i>

612
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:23,542
Glad you could join us.

613
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:26,545
And it's nice
to finally meet you.

614
00:45:26,628 --> 00:45:28,880
Thank you, sir.

615
00:45:28,964 --> 00:45:31,550
- Hello, Carrie.
- David.

616
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:32,634
<i>We were just
discussing next steps.</i>

617
00:45:32,718 --> 00:45:36,138
<i>To catch you up,
Haissam Haqqani has agreed</i>

618
00:45:36,221 --> 00:45:37,389
in principle to the terms
and the timelines

619
00:45:37,472 --> 00:45:40,559
laid out
in the Doha Framework.

620
00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:43,020
Not only that,
he's committed to a ceasefire.

621
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:43,895
That should buy us some time

622
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:46,398
to hash out
the outstanding issues.

623
00:45:46,481 --> 00:45:49,818
One of which is to sell this
peace to the American people.

624
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:53,030
<i>Well, I think the prospect
of ending our longest war</i>

625
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:54,781
<i>would enjoy broad support.</i>

626
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:57,826
Well, not when it's twisted
into a partisan issue

627
00:45:57,909 --> 00:45:59,995
made to look like we're
capitulating to terrorists.

628
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:03,331
<i>Seeing as you were one of
the architects of the policy,</i>

629
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:05,459
<i>we thought you might
have some ideas.</i>

630
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:08,962
Well, I can tell you

631
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:11,131
what Elizabeth Keane
was planning to do.

632
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:13,258
<i>Get out in front
of the debate.</i>

633
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:14,885
Come here to Afghanistan
and make the case

634
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:16,428
directly to the men and women

635
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:19,264
who put their lives
on the line every day.

636
00:46:19,347 --> 00:46:21,641
You're talking about
taking a secret trip,

637
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:24,019
making a surprise announcement?

638
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:25,020
<i>Followed by
a joint press conference</i>

639
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:27,939
<i>with President Daoud
at the Arg Palace.</i>

640
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:29,775
Hmm.

641
00:46:29,858 --> 00:46:31,359
I'm just saying,
win over the military,

642
00:46:31,443 --> 00:46:33,904
and you're halfway there.

643
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:35,989
<i>It also has
the benefit of good optics.</i>

644
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:37,991
Flying into a war zone,
rallying the troops,

645
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:39,659
and not looking anything
remotely like surrender.

646
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:43,538
<i>Sounds like you've made
this argument before.</i>

647
00:46:43,622 --> 00:46:46,249
I have, sir.

648
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:49,377
<i>Well, I appreciate
the bluntness.</i>

649
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:51,630
<i>Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like a few minutes alone</i>

650
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,924
<i>with my
National Security Advisor.</i>

651
00:46:54,007 --> 00:46:55,467
Yes, sir.

652
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,385
<i>Saul, Carrie...</i>

653
00:46:57,469 --> 00:46:58,804
<i>Thank you, David.</i>

654
00:47:00,305 --> 00:47:03,642
<i>Talk to me, Saul.</i>

655
00:47:03,725 --> 00:47:05,727
Well, sir, the best part
you've already heard.

656
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:09,481
Hey, slow down.

657
00:47:09,564 --> 00:47:10,690
What's the hurry?

658
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:13,318
I want to write up
the contact with Yevgeny

659
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:15,112
while it's still fresh.

660
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:15,862
Where'd you disappear to?

661
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:17,656
I'm sorry?

662
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:18,323
If you're so eager
to write up the contact,

663
00:47:18,406 --> 00:47:19,825
where'd you go afterwards?

664
00:47:19,908 --> 00:47:22,744
You were off the grid
for more than 90 minutes.

665
00:47:22,828 --> 00:47:24,412
I was walking.

666
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:25,956
Walking?

667
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,335
It wasn't so easy
seeing him again,

668
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:32,462
if you must know.

669
00:47:32,546 --> 00:47:34,881
I went up to the university
to clear my head.

670
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:37,175
You said he was recruitable.

671
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:38,176
Is he?

672
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,719
Just give me an hour,

673
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:42,514
and you'll have the entire
conversation verbatim.

674
00:47:42,597 --> 00:47:44,224
It's a simple question, Carrie.
Yes or no?

675
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:51,481
He's feeling
underappreciated, okay?

676
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:53,316
He and Mirov were demoted
for letting us

677
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,068
get Simone Martin
out of Moscow.

678
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:57,070
We made them look
pretty damn silly.

679
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:59,197
He said that?

680
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:01,950
Not in so many words,

681
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:04,995
but he did call Afghanistan
the penalty box.

682
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:10,083
Well, that doesn't sound
unpromising.

683
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,544
Provided it's not all
some grand deception.

684
00:48:13,962 --> 00:48:17,048
- Where'd you leave it?
- In his court.

685
00:48:17,132 --> 00:48:18,258
Either way, I don't think

686
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:20,010
I should be getting
on a plane anytime soon.

687
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:24,556
How about we talk
after I read the report?

688
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,892
Sure.

689
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:47,257

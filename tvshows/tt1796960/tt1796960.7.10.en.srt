1
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,991
Previously on <i>Homeland</i>...

2
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:07,950
- Maggie around?
- Uh, no.

3
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:10,950
Don't call her. She's--
she's talking to a lawyer.

4
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:13,283
- About?
- Franny.

5
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:16,409
You can't provide her with a
stable home, so we are going to.

6
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,450
- Carrie.
- Stay the fuck away from my kid.

7
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:21,325
Dante's missing.
I can't go, then.

8
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:23,242
This can put the whole
operation at risk.

9
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:25,950
Then I must plan
to never see you again.

10
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:29,409
Simone. Simone.

11
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:31,908
Mr. Allen is
in federal custody, Senator,

12
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,033
charged with violations
of the Espionage Act.

13
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,283
And he's talking.

14
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,741
So far, he's confirmed
a devastating account

15
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,950
of Russian interference
in our democratic process,

16
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:42,534
including feeding you
and your committee

17
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:45,283
a steady diet
of manipulated information.

18
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,158
You've been played, Sam.

19
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:48,908
- Sorry, can you help me?
- Sure.

20
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,283
I need to pull my daughter out
a little early today.

21
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,659
- Hey, sweetheart. You ready?
- Yeah.

22
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,825
- Hey, Dante?
- Yeah.

23
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:58,409
Can I call you back
in, like, five minutes?

24
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,291
Yevgeny's here.
Lock down the hospital.

25
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,825
Dante! Fuck.

26
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:06,741
Hey, you need to go
back to class.

27
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,450
I love you, baby.
I'll see you after school.

28
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,825
- No, Mommy. No, Mommy. No.
- No, I gotta go. I gotta go.

Hey!

00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:32,575

34
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,783
Yeah.

35
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:47,005
What was his name?

36
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,395
Carrie, you're not yourself.

37
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,534
But you don't have
my condition.

38
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,908
I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it

39
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,534
since I was 22.

40
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,991
She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.

41
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:07,882
The mood of the country,
it's not great.

42
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:11,534
Civil... war.

43
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:12,741
Madam President, please!

44
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,659
You have to put a stop to this!

45
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:18,741
It's only getting worse.

46
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:19,991
Is there no fucking line?

47
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:25,158
Ridiculous lies and accusations.

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,061
The White House
is in crisis mode.

49
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,859
I'm talking
about information warfare.

50
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,200
Our country
is under attack.

51
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:43,033
The time to rise up is now!

52
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:47,003
I swore an oath
to protect it.

53
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:53,242
Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,

54
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:56,432
a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.

55
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:07,492
You're doing great. Doc says
this is the last one, okay?

56
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,659
You ready, Carrie?
We're gonna start prepping

57
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:35,325
for your third
and final treatment.

58
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,367
Same procedure as before.

59
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,908
Let's get started.

60
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:42,825
Today, we've got
a bilateral application

61
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:46,534
with dexmedetomidine infusion
for her lithium at 2cc's

62
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:49,866
and 5 cc's of Succinylcholine.

63
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,534
So far, the patient's responded
well to the procedure,

64
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:53,700
other than slight memory loss
immediately

65
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:57,409
following the application.

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,991
Just like before, okay?

67
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:13,037
Counting backwards from 100.

68
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:19,367
100, 99,

69
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,033
98...

70
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:24,200
97...

71
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:25,700
96...

72
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,908
Ready for oxygen.

73
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,325
Giving Succinylcholine now.

74
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,825
Vitals are normal.

75
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,186
Current is good.
EEG is good.

76
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,450
Everyone clear.

77
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:08,575
Apply stimulus.

78
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:15,409
Seizure induced.

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,492
_

80
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,783
- Yeah, there you go.
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:39,700
Something wrong, sir?

82
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:43,617
Uh, no, it's fine.
Tie's too red.

83
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,446
Maybe the wrong kind
of red.

84
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,283
Sir, he's been downstairs
for half an hour.

85
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,283
He's kept me waiting longer
than that more than once.

86
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,450
They both have.

87
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:57,033
He can wait.

88
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:17,325
- Sorry to keep you.
- Mr. Vice President.

89
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,700
Want some coffee?
Something stronger?

90
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:20,575
It's early,

91
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,991
but Kyle can get you
whatever you like.

92
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:24,492
I'm fine. Thank you.

93
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:27,950
Ah. Please, sit.

94
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:32,409
Am I mistaken, or is this
your first visit here?

95
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,950
- Um, my first time.
- Ah.

96
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:38,242
It was built
for the superintendent

97
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:42,575
of the Naval Observatory
back in 1893...

98
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,991
until the Chief
of Naval Operations

99
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:48,534
decided he liked it so much,
he took it for himself.

100
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,530
That rank has
its prerogatives.

101
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,679
I'm usually the one
who's summoned.

102
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,700
Something important
must be happening.

103
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:02,659
Last night,

104
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,450
the Attorney General
called the President

105
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:09,908
about a document Senator Paley
wanted the AG to sign.

106
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:13,492
What kind of document?

107
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,783
Invoking the 25th Amendment.

108
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,534
Declaring the President
unfit for office.

109
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:26,492
The Senator thinks enlisting
the President's Cabinet

110
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:29,659
will be easier than
getting Congress to impeach.

111
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,117
He claims four members
have signed on already.

112
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,325
Four short of
the majority required.

113
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,492
Who are the four?

114
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,158
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me.

115
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:46,075
I wouldn't have asked
if I knew.

116
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,575
So you, yourself,
haven't been approached.

117
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,908
No. In fact, I was under
the assumption

118
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:56,242
that Paley had eased off
once he saw the Russia file.

119
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:59,908
He had. Dante Allen's death
put him back on the warpath.

120
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:04,117
And how worried are we?

121
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,283
Depends.

122
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,741
On what?

123
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,908
You, sir.

124
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:18,158
Because Congress can't
ratify the 25th Amendment

125
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,783
- without my signature.
- Correct.

126
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,866
Even if he's got
a majority of the Cabinet,

127
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,741
Paley can't get this done
without you.

128
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,367
Must gall her,

129
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,450
that the survival
of her Presidency

130
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:36,450
could come down to me.

131
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:39,283
The President trusts
your judgment.

132
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,617
Trusts my judgment?

133
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,450
That's a very generous
interpretation

134
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:43,783
of our relationship.

135
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,325
You're being a little
sensitive, aren't you?

136
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,492
Maybe.

137
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,575
Still, I can't remember
one time she demonstrated

138
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:54,908
any real interest in my opinion
or solicited my advice.

139
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:58,700
But I took an oath

140
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:01,158
to defend this country
against all enemies,

141
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:04,033
foreign and domestic.

142
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:06,158
And I won't let
the President's indifference

143
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:08,158
interfere with that.

144
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:11,200
So...

145
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:13,950
you tell her she's got
nothing to worry about,

146
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,158
at least not from me.

147
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:18,200
Thank you, sir.

148
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,325
- She'll appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,908
Saul, quickly.

150
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,534
Thanks for coming.

151
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:57,534
I couldn't think of another
excuse to get out of the house.

152
00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:59,158
He thinks I've been subbing
all this time

153
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:02,700
for another professor
out with the flu. Please, sit.

154
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,492
So I couldn't get those damn
flight logs out of my head.

155
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,866
- What about 'em?
- Two private aircraft booked

156
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,200
out of the same private airfield
within 24 hours of each other?

157
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:17,700
Tail numbers
on both planes blocked

158
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,700
by an identical
onboard system.

159
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:24,033
Let's just say the timing
of Dante's murder

160
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:27,534
puts Yevgeny
on the second flight.

161
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,700
Question is, who's on
the first flight?

162
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:32,200
Could be anybody
in his network.

163
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:33,325
Or Simone.

164
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:37,450
Simone's at the bottom
of a lake somewhere.

165
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:38,534
What if she isn't?

166
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,866
If Yevgeny was gonna
kill her,

167
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,075
why not do it on the spot
like he did with Dante?

168
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:49,283
No, Saul. He couldn't
leave her behind.

169
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:50,700
It's a love story.

170
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,409
It's always a love story
with you.

171
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:58,534
11 years ago, they were
both living in Paris.

172
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,117
She, a doctoral candidate
at the Sorbonne.

173
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,325
He, running a small group
of Western residencies

174
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,033
- for the SVR.
- Still, you can't...

175
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:09,659
you can't be sure the young spy
met the young graduate student.

176
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:11,117
Actually, I can.

177
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,741
Simone's thesis advisor
at the time

178
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:14,117
has a vivid memory
of her boyfriend--

179
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,991
tall, dark, and Russian.

180
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:33,991
- You good?
- I'm good.

181
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:40,117
- Your lawyer's here.
- Oh, thanks.

182
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,158
Morning.

183
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:46,908
Hey, Rhonda.
You said there was news.

184
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:48,659
There is.

185
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,242
There's an offer
on the table.

186
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,117
Tell me.

187
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,075
Your sister's agreed to
a visitation schedule.

188
00:11:57,158 --> 00:11:58,325
Every third weekend
at first,

189
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:01,950
moving to alternating weekends
after a probationary period.

190
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:05,783
Okay. Uh...

191
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:08,450
This is a giant step forward,
Carrie.

192
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,950
It means that
you're guaranteed

193
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,325
to see your daughter
every month.

194
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,866
That wasn't the case
yesterday.

195
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:17,866
This is assuming
Maggie and Bill win

196
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,659
- the custody hearing tomorrow.
- No.

197
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,158
This is in lieu of the hearing.

198
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:28,617
I-I don't understand.

199
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
It's an agreement
between parties

200
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,700
in exchange for signing over
sole physical custody.

201
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,617
Me signing over custody
to them.

202
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:43,325
Yes.

203
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,409
And no hearing?
I don't even get a chance

204
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:50,825
to argue my side
in front of a judge?

205
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:53,575
Carrie, I think your sister
wants to avoid

206
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,825
a protracted legal battle,

207
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,200
which will be hard
on everyone.

208
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:02,575
Right now,
that gives you leverage.

209
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,409
After the hearing,
not so much.

210
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,825
If they want Franny, I'm not
just gonna hand her over.

211
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:13,409
They're gonna have to
take her from me.

212
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,367
I thought
you understood that.

213
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,991
As long as you understand,

214
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:22,575
if the court awards Maggie
and Bill sole custody tomorrow,

215
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:26,283
even temporarily,
you stand to lose

216
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,659
any and all access
to your daughter.

217
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,534
Is that what you think's
gonna happen?

218
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:41,409
I really don't know.

219
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,367
In your professional
opinion, then.

220
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,908
Look, I've done this
long enough

221
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:50,117
to tell you that there are
no certain outcomes.

222
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,741
But you said courts
bend over backwards

223
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,908
to keep children
with their parents.

224
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:56,783
Yes. They do.

225
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:59,783
Come on, Rhonda. Quit hedging.
Tell me what you think.

226
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:04,158
I think you should seriously
consider the merits

227
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:06,617
of the visitation offer.

228
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:19,575
As most of you know,

229
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,492
my ex-husband was
an anthropologist.

230
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:26,075
About politics, he used to say,

231
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,741
mankind was not descended
from peaceful arboreal apes,

232
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:32,741
but from a cruder, earthbound
type who hunted in packs

233
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:36,325
and crushed the skulls
of his prey with gloves.

234
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:46,158
Ladies and gentlemen...

235
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:49,534
we are under attack,

236
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:54,200
as radical as it sounds.

237
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:58,991
Senator Paley must now be
considered a witting participant

238
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:03,075
in a massive
Russian influence operation,

239
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:06,492
designed to paralyze
our democracy

240
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:10,325
and to diminish our role
on the world stage.

241
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,617
If you don't believe it,

242
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,200
and I gather that
some of you don't,

243
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:21,492
ask yourself this--

244
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:26,283
What of the people's business
have we, any of us,

245
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:30,908
managed to get done
in the first 100 days?

246
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:36,075
All our high hopes
in pieces on the ground.

247
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:39,117
If there was ever a moment
to stand together,

248
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,450
it is now.

249
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,783
So...

250
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,908
the next time the good Senator
comes calling

251
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:56,908
with his schemes
of invoking the 25th...

252
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:00,075
and he will come calling,

253
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,825
know two things.

254
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:05,617
One, that there is no daylight
between me

255
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,908
and the Vice President
on this matter.

256
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:11,075
None.

257
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:14,492
And two...

258
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,075
feel free to
beat his head in with a club.

259
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,033
- Okay. Are we ready?
- Yes, Madam President.

260
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:26,575
- Yes, Madam President.
- Let's get into character, then.

261
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,534
- Madam President...
- Madam President...

262
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,075
- Madam President...
- Thank you.

263
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:38,534
You'll come
through this, Madam President.

264
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:42,200
With your help, I will.

265
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,450
Good morning.

266
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:47,908
Doesn't sound
like Rhonda's exactly...

267
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,950
brimming with confidence.

268
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:54,991
Well, she's a lawyer. She wants
to prepare me for the worst.

269
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:56,659
And?

270
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:59,575
Are you? Prepared?

271
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:04,117
I don't think you are,
Carrie.

272
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,033
You're in a knife fight
without a knife.

273
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:08,659
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I don't know.

274
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:12,741
Maybe a little
opposition research?

275
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,908
- On my sister?
- Or her husband?

276
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:22,075
I'm sensing some moral confusion
here. Should I shut up?

277
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:26,242
No, not at all. I-I was just
wondering what kind of dirt

278
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,200
you could actually dig up
on those two.

279
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:29,825
Well, you tell me.

280
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,866
What,
Supermom and Saint Bill?

281
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,908
It's not exactly
a laundry list.

282
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,991
Come on, Carrie.
Everybody has something.

283
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,575
- Well...
- What?

284
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,700
She was my unofficial doctor
for years,

285
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:51,283
treated me under an alias,

286
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:52,950
ran my blood tests,
wrote my lithium prescriptions.

287
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,283
To avoid you getting
flagged by the agency?

288
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,075
Yep.

289
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,783
Well...

290
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:02,075
That's her medical license
right there.

291
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,617
Good to go.

292
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,825
Moscow's on
the secure uplink, sir.

293
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,200
- Talk to me.
- Good morning, Saul.

294
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:26,075
This is crap, Jim.

295
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,866
It's been over a week.

296
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,866
It's fuckin' amateur hour.

297
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,866
Well, to be fair,
finding Yevgeny

298
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,283
was only made
a priority yesterday.

299
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:38,534
If I didn't know better,
I'd say I'm being slow-rolled.

300
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,492
Am I being
slow-rolled, Jim?

301
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:43,367
The long answer is

302
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,200
the President hasn't
exactly banked

303
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:46,492
a whole lot
of good will with HQ.

304
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,200
What's that supposed to mean?

305
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:51,534
Well, after what she said
during the campaign,

306
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:54,117
nobody on the seventh floor
is much in the mood

307
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,575
to throw her a lifeline.

308
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:57,200
Fuck them.

309
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:04,283
You don't seem happy, Saul.

310
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:07,033
Is the President
really that vulnerable?

311
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:08,866
Yeah, she is.

312
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,741
If we don't produce
some hard evidence

313
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:13,409
that screams Russia,
and soon,

314
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,866
I don't see her making it
to the end of the year,

315
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,409
much less
the end of her term.

316
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:19,409
Tell me what to do.

317
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,741
Start by sending a team
to Sergiyev Posad.

318
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:24,325
Why there?

319
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:26,158
I hear it's a beautiful town.

320
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:27,242
Plus, Yevgeny goes on and on
about it

321
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:31,325
in an unpublished novel
he wrote at university.

322
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:32,908
Describes
an idyllic summer there

323
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,492
at a baronial dacha
on the river.

324
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,783
Shouldn't be hard to find,
if it exists.

325
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,700
In the novel, a rich uncle
on his mother's side

326
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:40,741
- owns the place.
- I'll have people there

327
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:44,325
- first thing in the morning.
- Good.

328
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:49,075
Jim, while you're there,

329
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:51,492
keep an eye out
for Simone Martin, too.

330
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:53,783
I will.

331
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,033
Good.

332
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:04,351
_

333
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,325
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

334
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:13,950
Saul, you didn't have to.
They're beautiful.

335
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:18,242
Where do you want them?

336
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:23,325
I was here on Monday.
You were sleeping.

337
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:24,741
I didn't want
to disturb you.

338
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:25,991
Yeah, Anson told me.

339
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:28,117
How are you?

340
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,866
Better. I'm much better.

341
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,700
I'm starting a whole new
drug protocol.

342
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:36,200
Is it true you also did another course of
electroconvulsive therapy?

343
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:38,825
I did. I know they scare
the hell out of you,

344
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:42,117
those treatments, but for me,
they're a miracle, really.

345
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:48,158
What happened, Carrie?

346
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:49,866
Can you tell me?

347
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,991
Um, wh-what happened is...

348
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:57,242
what always happens

349
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,075
when I don't listen
to the people around me,

350
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,825
when I think I can keep all
the plates spinning by myself.

351
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:05,033
I swear, I should've
seen it coming.

352
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,575
That makes two of us.

353
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:10,492
No. In no way is this
your responsibility.

354
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,283
I feel responsible.

355
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:15,200
Don't. It was a complete
psychotic break.

356
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:17,075
They had to hit me with
a massive dose of Haldol

357
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:18,575
and take me away
in four-point restraints.

358
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,242
Waking fucking nightmare.

359
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:29,075
And now I'm in the middle

360
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:31,866
of this ugly, ugly
custody battle with Maggie.

361
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,450
Hearing's tomorrow, huh?

362
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:36,158
- Yeah.
- What can I do?

363
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,534
Nothing.

364
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:44,575
Wish me luck.

365
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:47,117
Good luck.

366
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:55,741
Come on, Saul.
I-I appreciate the visit, but...

367
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,991
why are you really here?

368
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,367
Yevgeny slipped the net.

369
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,908
Best guess is he made it
back to Russia.

370
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:09,741
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

371
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:10,991
There's also some institutional
resistance on our side

372
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:14,325
to finding him,
if you can believe that.

373
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:17,367
Oh, I believe it.
So what do you need?

374
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,200
Next best thing to you,
Carrie-- people I can trust.

375
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:24,283
- I need your team.
- To do what? Repatriot him?

376
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,242
Him or Simone Martin.

377
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:28,450
Turns out she might
be alive after all.

378
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,950
Of the two of them,

379
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,367
she'd be the easier
to exfiltrate.

380
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,950
What's the timeframe?

381
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,492
Soon as we can locate
one or the other,

382
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:39,783
which we're hoping happens
in the very near future.

383
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:42,741
I'll reach out
right away, then.

384
00:22:42,825 --> 00:22:43,950
The boys will jump
at the chance.

385
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:47,075
Who leads the team,
Anson or Bennet?

386
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,450
That's a tough call.
I...

387
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:55,409
Bennet's steady, but Anson
can think outside the box.

388
00:22:55,492 --> 00:23:00,617
Either one run an operation
in Eastern Europe before?

389
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,825
Not that I know of.

390
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,617
Really should be you,
Carrie.

391
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:12,117
I can't.

392
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,283
I'm talking about
in a purely supervisory role.

393
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,075
Really, I-I can't.
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:19,283
You'd be in the field
three days. Week at the most.

395
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:23,991
That's not about days
or weeks, Saul.

396
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:25,908
This is about
the rest of my life.

397
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:29,659
Tomorrow, I walk
into a courtroom

398
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,075
to fight for my daughter.

399
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,409
If I'm ever gonna
convince anybody

400
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:38,325
I deserve a second chance,
first I have to convince myself.

401
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:42,033
That means putting the job
behind me once and for all.

402
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:45,242
You tried that before.
Didn't work.

403
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:48,908
It will this time.

404
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:04,741
- James.
- Good to see you.

405
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,242
- Mr. Vice President.
- Sir.

406
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:20,450
You asked me to review
the defense budget

407
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:21,950
over a working dinner.

408
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,866
Last I checked,

409
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,409
the Senator wasn't on
the Appropriations committee.

410
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,492
You're wasting your time, Sam.

411
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:33,075
Whatever differences I may have
with the President are overstated.

412
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:36,991
Look, none of us
wants to be here,

413
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,741
but it's on all of us to hold
that woman accountable.

414
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:43,367
You know, your indignation
might be more convincing

415
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,325
if it weren't
quite so covered in crap.

416
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,866
Crap? You mean like, uh,
this, uh,

417
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,367
Russian bogeyman
she keeps talking about?

418
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,075
Have you seen any evidence?
Any actual evidence?

419
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,283
I've seen the same
intelligence you have.

420
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,534
Right, those photographs
and timeline.

421
00:24:58,617 --> 00:25:01,617
It all looks real enough,
I'll give 'em that.

422
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:05,950
I almost bought it myself until
that FBI agent turned up dead.

423
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:09,283
Murdered
by Russian operatives.

424
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:10,866
Dante Allen was
in federal custody,

425
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,158
just like General McClendon,

426
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:16,741
just like Simone Martin,

427
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,450
Fool me once, shame on you.

428
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:21,450
But... three times?

429
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:27,242
The President is covering up
one crime with another.

430
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,242
A majority of the Cabinet
concurs.

431
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:33,950
What are you talking about?

432
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,325
Eight Secretaries are ready
to sign a document, if you are.

433
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:41,409
We gave her the chance
to step down,

434
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:45,033
and to do so with dignity,
but she refused.

435
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,908
So that leaves you,
Mr. Vice President.

436
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:53,991
Like it or not,

437
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:56,075
it's up to you to end
this national nightmare.

438
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:02,617
Please.

439
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:08,659
At least hear us out.

440
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:11,617
It's the most important decision
you'll ever make.

441
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:25,367
Okay, what are
the classification parameters

442
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,450
so I can sign off on them?

443
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:31,866
No, consider it a go order
until you hear otherwise.

444
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,075
And good luck.

445
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:36,242
Saul Berenson.

446
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:39,700
He's working a lead with
our station chief in Moscow.

447
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:42,534
- Sounds promising.
- We'll see.

448
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:44,492
So far, so good today.

449
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,908
Nothing to worry about,
but I thought you should know--

450
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:54,492
Senator Paley just reached out
to the Vice President.

451
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:55,367
No surprise there.

452
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,325
Well, only that
it's taken this long.

453
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,242
Warner had
a dinner scheduled

454
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:05,908
with Secretary Mullen
in Georgetown.

455
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,075
Paley ambushed him there.

456
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:12,741
So... Mullen was in on it.

457
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,200
Looks that way.

458
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,492
He was sitting next to me
in the Cabinet Room,

459
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,741
looked me right in the eye.

460
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:33,492
Besides Mullen, who else
might be wavering?

461
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:35,659
Warner find out?

462
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,409
I actually haven't
spoken to him yet.

463
00:27:37,492 --> 00:27:40,575
So how do you know
this dinner happened?

464
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,409
Is happening, right now.

465
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:45,325
There's a bartender
at the restaurant

466
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:48,617
I keep on retainer.

467
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:49,825
How long have they been
in there?

468
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:53,409
Over an hour.

469
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:58,700
What the hell are they
talking about?

470
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:06,950
Get me the Vice President,
please.

471
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,991
I wouldn't read too much
into this.

472
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:11,200
I can't afford not to.

473
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,700
Voicemail.

474
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:17,534
Ralph?

475
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:22,783
I know where you are,
and I know who you're with.

476
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:24,991
Please call me back
when you get this.

477
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,950
Elizabeth, you talked to him
this morning.

478
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,534
Trust me, he's solid.

479
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:36,825
I talked to Mullen, too,
and he lied to my face.

480
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:43,783
I'll be here late tonight.

481
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:45,950
Let me know
when he calls back.

482
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,825
Hello?

483
00:29:04,908 --> 00:29:06,450
It's not here.

484
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:08,117
- What?
- The file.

485
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,450
There's no one by the name
of Jessica Field.

486
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,700
F-I-E-L-D.

487
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:18,158
Nope. Nothing.

488
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:20,325
You sure?

489
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:24,200
Look, I'm looking at the F's now--
Feddermen, Feld, Fuchs.

490
00:29:24,283 --> 00:29:26,367
- Maybe she shredded it?
- Not Maggie.

491
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,534
- She keeps everything.
- Fraudulent prescriptions?

492
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:30,783
It wasn't
just prescriptions.

493
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,617
She monitored my dosages,
my blood work.

494
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,242
It was an important
medical record.

495
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:36,534
She wouldn't have
just tossed it.

496
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:40,783
Oh, wait.

497
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,283
What?

498
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,825
Fuck.

499
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,033
It must be at home. She has
an office there, too.

500
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,283
- Where?
- Above the garage.

501
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:51,367
So what do you want me
to do?

502
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,409
Is there an alarm?

503
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,741
Yeah.

504
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,575
Do you know the code?

505
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:02,866
Yeah.

506
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:08,200
So are you gonna
give it to me or what?

507
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:22,700
Thank you.

508
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,409
Olivia.

509
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,783
- Didn't see you on the schedule.
- I asked her here myself.

510
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,283
What's going on?

511
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,158
Madam President, if you'd like
a minute alone with David--

512
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:42,741
What I need is for
my White House counsel

513
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:44,700
to deliver these before
the Vice President

514
00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:45,283
invokes the 25th.

515
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:48,492
Before he does what?

516
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:51,534
- What exactly did he tell you?
- Nothing.

517
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:55,242
He didn't return my calls
last night or this morning.

518
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:57,617
His office is saying
he is unreachable.

519
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,117
Well, if-- if he's
not returning your calls,

520
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,117
- there must be a reason.
- Yeah, there is.

521
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,033
He's thrown down
with Paley and Mullen.

522
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:06,450
- You don't know that.
- Why do you doubt it?

523
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:10,117
The plan is to deprive him of
the signatures Congress needs

524
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,991
- to open debate.
- Deprive him? How?

525
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:14,659
Let me see that.

526
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,033
You're firing your Cabinet.

527
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:24,575
Only those who caved.

528
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:28,450
Besides Mullen, you have
no idea who that is.

529
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:31,991
Well, I can
damn well guess.

530
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,409
The ones I didn't
hand-pick.

531
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,575
The ones
whose portfolios

532
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,659
intersect with
National Security.

533
00:31:37,741 --> 00:31:39,325
Is this even legal?

534
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:40,700
It's unprecedented,
but the law's clear.

535
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:43,367
The President can dismiss
Cabinet members at any time

536
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,367
- for any reason.
- You do realize

537
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,450
that you are playing
right into their hands.

538
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:49,825
You don't think
I know that?

539
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:55,700
Warner is
a human weather vane,

540
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,492
- but Paley and Mullen...
- No, no, no, no, not them!

541
00:31:57,575 --> 00:32:00,075
- ...are smart as--
- The Russians!

542
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:03,200
You are giving them
the very Constitutional crisis

543
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:05,659
they've been trying
to instigate for months.

544
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:09,033
What choice do I have?
Wait any longer,

545
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,950
and I could be removed
from office this afternoon!

546
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:15,950
Temporarily. Even if Warner does
deliver those signatures,

547
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,659
it's just the first round.

548
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:19,617
He still needs Congress
to declare you unfit,

549
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,617
and by a two-thirds vote
in each house.

550
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,200
If I let them march me
out of here today,

551
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:28,450
they are never
letting me back in.

552
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:32,617
The press will crucify you,
Elizabeth.

553
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,367
Articles of impeachment
will be drafted.

554
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,825
This will make
the Saturday Night Massacre

555
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:40,075
look like a dress rehearsal
for the real thing.

556
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,325
Please...

557
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:44,200
I'm begging you.

558
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:48,325
Reconsider.

559
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:01,700
I did not bust my ass
to get elected.

560
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,700
I did not survive
an assassination attempt

561
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:09,825
just to fold up my tent
and go home.

562
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:11,325
Send 'em.

563
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:25,200
Don't.

564
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:11,825
Hey. Carrie.

565
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:16,575
Any issues?

566
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:19,741
No. In and out
in five minutes.

567
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,575
It's all there.

568
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,991
Thanks.

569
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:23,991
Good luck.

570
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,825
Franny always loved
when Aunt Carrie was around--

571
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:57,450
played with her,
fixed her breakfast.

572
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:59,575
Stuff like that.

573
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:02,084
Does your Aunt Carrie
spend a lot of time with Franny?

574
00:35:05,783 --> 00:35:07,325
Not really.

575
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,659
Can you speak up, please?

576
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:13,200
No.

577
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:14,741
It always seems like Aunt Carrie
is going somewhere,

578
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:19,117
and my mom couldn't
depend on her.

579
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:24,575
Do you know what kept
her out of the house so much?

580
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,075
I think she's trying
to save our democracy,

581
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:30,659
which is a pretty good thing,
if you ask me.

582
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:34,825
Josie,
have you noticed any changes

583
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:38,200
in Franny recently?

584
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:41,033
Some, yeah.

585
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:42,950
Can you give the court
an example?

586
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:49,367
She's gotten really quiet.
I've noticed that.

587
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,117
Anything else?

588
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:54,617
At night, she crawls
into bed with me.

589
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:01,200
Most times,
she cries herself to sleep.

590
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:08,409
It's a terrible situation.
Mr. Quinn was a close friend.

591
00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:12,283
He was homeless and suffered
from PTSD, so she took him in.

592
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:15,659
It wasn't, uh, the wisest
decision on her part,

593
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,283
but it was
an act of compassion.

594
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:19,659
Unfortunately,
things got out of hand,

595
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:21,991
and there was an incident.

596
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:24,075
More than
an incident, correct?

597
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:27,991
Didn't he hold Franny hostage
at gunpoint?

598
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:31,492
According to Carrie, he thought
he was protecting her.

599
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:36,117
Ms. Lonas, do you
think it's sometimes necessary

600
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,866
to separate a child
from her parent?

601
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,158
I hate to see it happen.

602
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:45,991
Research has shown that children
suffer life-long damage

603
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:50,617
when their bond with
the primary caregiver is broken.

604
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,492
Is there any exception?

605
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:57,950
Yes, when a child has suffered
repeated trauma.

606
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,991
Apparently, she had been
in a man's house.

607
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:04,825
Someone she called
Mommy's friend.

608
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:09,242
Then she said some bad men
broke in. They had guns.

609
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,741
They fought with Mommy
and her friend

610
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:13,783
and took the friend away.

611
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:15,200
She said
Mommy was screaming,

612
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,409
and somebody
was screaming at her.

613
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:19,825
We didn't press too hard
for details

614
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:24,575
because it really agitated her
to talk about it.

615
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,158
She would literally
start trembling.

616
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:30,409
No more questions.

617
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:32,825
The witness may step down.

618
00:37:32,908 --> 00:37:35,204
Our next witness is
Dr. Margaret Mathison.

619
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,908
- Good morning, Dr. Mathison.
- Good morning.

620
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:53,908
- You're Franny's Aunt?
- Yes.

621
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:56,534
And the sister of her mother,
Carrie Mathison.

622
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:58,367
Yes.

623
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,534
And you and your husband are
petitioning the court

624
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:02,033
for sole physical custody
of your niece. Is that correct?

625
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:05,075
- That's correct.
- You have a lot of experience

626
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,367
taking care of Franny,
don't you?

627
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,033
I've been taking care of her
on and off since she was born.

628
00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:13,283
And Franny lives with you now,
doesn't she?

629
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:17,283
Yes, Carrie and Franny moved in
with us about three months ago.

630
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:18,534
Was that difficult
for you and your family?

631
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:21,242
Not at first.

632
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:25,117
Um, Josie's always loved her
Aunt Carrie, so she was happy.

633
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,741
And Franny's a delight.
It was good to have them.

634
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:30,158
But it didn't last.

635
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:33,075
What happened,
Dr. Mathison?

636
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:34,700
What always happens.

637
00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:37,950
Uh, Carrie became
obsessed with something,

638
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,659
started staying out
all hours,

639
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:41,950
forgetting to pick up
Franny from school.

640
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:45,908
I found strangers in the house
at night in her bedroom.

641
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,783
And she was racking up
thousands of dollars in debt

642
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:51,617
on her credit cards
and lying about it.

643
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,908
- Did you confront her?
- I did. Finally.

644
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:57,367
At first,
she denied everything,

645
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,409
and then she said she was
working on something

646
00:38:59,492 --> 00:39:01,033
but couldn't say what.
That's typical.

647
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:03,659
And the whole time
in the middle of it all

648
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:07,117
is this little girl, desperate
for her mother's attention.

649
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,033
Was there something specific
that prompted you

650
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:13,075
- to petition for custody?
- Definitely.

651
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:15,117
It was the incident
Mrs. Shepherd was talking about.

652
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,575
But what she didn't
tell you is that

653
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,450
the man who was
arrested that night,

654
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,741
he was an FBI agent who Carrie
suspected was dirty.

655
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:25,741
- Dirty? How?
- I have no idea.

656
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:29,409
But your point is, your sister
thought this was a bad guy,

657
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,158
and still, she allowed him
near her daughter?

658
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:32,950
- is that correct?
- It's worse than that.

659
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:35,033
She deliberately
put Franny in harm's way

660
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:38,866
in order to collect evidence
against him.

661
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,866
Is that the only reason
you're petitioning for custody?

662
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,325
No, there's more.

663
00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:49,575
Your Honor,
Dr. Mathison would

664
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:51,325
like to read a statement
to the court.

665
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:53,117
I'll allow it.

666
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:16,534
Is it okay if I just
speak to her instead?

667
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,075
I mean, directly,
is that okay?

668
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:19,783
Yes, go ahead.

669
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,033
Carrie, the last thing I wanna
do is take Franny away from you.

670
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:36,700
- Then don't.
- Please don't interrupt

671
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:37,700
the witness, Ms. Mathison.

672
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:39,575
You'll get your chance
to respond.

673
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:47,450
From the day you were born,
you've had a mind of your own.

674
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:52,700
You never listened to anyone,
even when you were little.

675
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,991
You used to wave at planes.
Remember?

676
00:40:57,075 --> 00:41:01,117
And I would say, "Who are you
waving at? They can't see you."

677
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,534
But you would just
keep on waving.

678
00:41:05,617 --> 00:41:08,325
You were always so fearless,
too, my God.

679
00:41:11,575 --> 00:41:14,242
I hated you for that.

680
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:17,075
Why was I scared
all the time?

681
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:19,033
How come you got to be
the brave one?

682
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:23,283
And Dad going around
to everyone,

683
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:24,117
calling you
his little daredevil

684
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,741
until I could scream.

685
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,741
I am not...

686
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:38,325
...extraordinary
like you, Carrie.

687
00:41:40,158 --> 00:41:43,200
I don't run CIA stations
in Afghanistan

688
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:47,033
or disrupt terrorist plots
in Berlin.

689
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:50,492
I don't advise the President
of the United States.

690
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,783
My job doesn't require me
to risk my life.

691
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:58,409
I'm not a hero.

692
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:03,200
But as it turns out,

693
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:07,409
safe has
its advantages, too.

694
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,367
A family...

695
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,783
A stable home life...

696
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:18,033
These are the things that
I can offer Franny...

697
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:21,367
things that you can't.

698
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,325
It's a chance to be normal.

699
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:27,075
No. I-- Maggie, that's what
I've decided, too.

700
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,741
I have to give it up.
All of it. I swear.

701
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:34,409
I'm seeing this
very clearly now.

702
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:39,283
Carrie, you're my sister,
and I love you, I really do,

703
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,409
but I don't believe you.

704
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:45,242
In six weeks,
the ECT will wear off,

705
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:47,825
and Saul will come knocking
with some new crisis,

706
00:42:47,908 --> 00:42:51,325
and the whole crazy orchestra
will start playing again.

707
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,991
I'm sorry. I really am.

708
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:05,325
That's all I have to say.

709
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,242
Mr. Schroder?

710
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:12,200
No more questions,
Your Honor.

711
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:14,283
I think this would be
a good time for a short break.

712
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,866
Court is adjourned
for 15 minutes.

713
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:25,991
You okay?

714
00:43:26,075 --> 00:43:29,534
Yeah.

715
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:32,325
Yeah, I'm just gonna-- I'm just
gonna sit here for a while

716
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,033
- if that's all right.
- Sure. Take your time.

717
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,825
Talk to you for a second?

718
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:40,242
Before you say anything,
and just so you know,

719
00:44:40,325 --> 00:44:41,242
I wanted to come see you
in the hospital.

720
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:45,534
- I was advised not to.
- It's fine.

721
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:51,325
Listen, is that visitation
agreement still on the table?

722
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:55,325
What?

723
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:57,450
If I sign over sole custody
to you and Bill,

724
00:44:57,534 --> 00:44:59,950
do I still get to see her
every third weekend?

725
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:03,200
Of course.

726
00:45:05,741 --> 00:45:08,492
How about
every other weekend?

727
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:12,659
I think we can make
that work, yeah.

728
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:18,991
We should get the lawyers,
then.

729
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:20,825
Oh, my God.
Are you sure about this?

730
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:23,409
I am.

731
00:45:23,492 --> 00:45:25,700
- Carrie.
- Quick. Before I change my mind.

732
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:28,200
Okay.

733
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:42,659
The White House has yet to
respond to what one source

734
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:46,575
has characterized as
a major purge in the administration.

735
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:47,575
According to that
unconfirmed report,

736
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:50,700
President Keane will dismiss
at least four

737
00:45:50,783 --> 00:45:55,158
Cabinet-level Secretaries
effective today at 5 PM.

738
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:57,409
While three of the four
are unknown at this time,

739
00:45:57,492 --> 00:45:59,409
the source did name
Secretary of Defense

740
00:45:59,492 --> 00:46:00,617
Terry Mullen as one of
the potential...

741
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,659
- They're piling on.
- ...to be dismissed.

742
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:04,283
And it's happening a lot
faster than I thought.

743
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,825
...are directly tied

744
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:08,783
to Senator Sam Paley's
investigation...

745
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,158
The Vice President is here.

746
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:13,033
- He's asking to see you.
- Now?

747
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:15,492
He's right outside.

748
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:18,409
Well, if he's carrying
an olive branch,

749
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:22,242
tell him he's a day late
and a dollar short.

750
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:24,409
He won't say what he wants

751
00:46:24,492 --> 00:46:28,075
except that
he'll only talk to you.

752
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:30,117
If you like,
I can get rid of him.

753
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,450
No. Now I'm curious.

754
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:38,617
Bring him in.

755
00:46:56,158 --> 00:46:58,450
Thank you, David.

756
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:06,409
Madam President, when you
asked me to stand with you,

757
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:10,575
I was grateful
for the opportunity.

758
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:13,741
Whatever bad blood existed,
I was happy to put it behind us.

759
00:47:13,825 --> 00:47:15,741
- I truly was.
- Until you weren't.

760
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:17,908
Until you let Paley
turn your head.

761
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:20,825
- Well, you're wrong there.
- How do you mean?

762
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:25,825
It's true. After I saw him,
I-I had some second thoughts.

763
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:31,367
I... I found myself wanting
more time to think it through.

764
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,908
Once I did, though,
I came down on your side.

765
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:38,950
You mean...

766
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:45,325
You signed no document
invoking the 25th Amendment?

767
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:49,617
I have not, and I won't...

768
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,866
on the one condition that you
immediately walk back the firing

769
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,908
of Secretary Mullen
and the others.

770
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:57,700
Power without authority
is tyranny.

771
00:47:57,783 --> 00:48:01,659
That's the line I'm trying
to keep you from crossing.

772
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:04,033
Okay.

773
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:06,825
Okay, what?

774
00:48:06,908 --> 00:48:11,700
What assurance can you give me
that if I rescind the firings,

775
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:15,158
you won't just go ahead
and sign the document anyway?

776
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:18,825
I guess you'll just
have to trust me.

777
00:48:21,908 --> 00:48:25,450
When you're one signature away
from sitting at this desk?

778
00:48:25,534 --> 00:48:28,783
After you ignored my phone calls
knowing full well

779
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:31,825
- what I was going through?
- I needed the time I needed--

780
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:35,659
time I knew you wouldn't allow
without browbeating me somehow

781
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:37,617
into pledging my loyalty.

782
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,117
Which, now, all of a sudden,
you're willing to do.

783
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,450
In good faith, as long
as you do the right thing.

784
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:47,450
I don't like being
dictated to.

785
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:49,283
I'm defining the limits
of my support.

786
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:52,741
There's a difference.

787
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:01,492
Without a majority
of the Cabinet,

788
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:05,450
which you do not have,
as of now,

789
00:49:05,534 --> 00:49:08,367
that document is invalid.

790
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,534
You are pointing
an empty gun at my head.

791
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:13,575
Before I came here,

792
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,575
I spoke
to three separate lawyers.

793
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,659
Each one confirmed that
firing close to a third

794
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:23,450
of your Cabinet
under these circumstances

795
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:26,075
is probably unconstitutional.

796
00:49:26,158 --> 00:49:29,700
The White House counsel
doesn't share their opinion.

797
00:49:29,783 --> 00:49:33,450
I'm giving you a simple choice,
Madam President.

798
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:35,908
Plunge this nation
into crisis

799
00:49:35,991 --> 00:49:37,866
or defend it
from its real enemies.

800
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,367
Madam President--

801
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,534
The answer is no.

802
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:53,242
Then you leave me no choice
but to deliver

803
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:54,866
to the President pro tempore
of the Senate

804
00:49:54,950 --> 00:50:00,283
and the Speaker of the House
a document declaring you

805
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:03,325
unfit for the Office
of the Presidency.

806
00:50:09,825 --> 00:50:12,242
It doesn't have to be
such a snake pit, Elizabeth--

807
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:15,991
the world.

808
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:19,033
It really doesn't.

809
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:01,283
- I miss the service?
- Just ended.

810
00:51:04,991 --> 00:51:06,492
What happened in court?

811
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:12,075
Franny's gonna live
with Maggie and Bill.

812
00:51:12,158 --> 00:51:14,117
Sorry.

813
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,783
I'm okay.

814
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,409
Really?

815
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:22,659
Yeah.
It's the right thing.

816
00:51:27,158 --> 00:51:28,908
Did you find Simone?

817
00:51:28,991 --> 00:51:32,534
At a dacha on the outskirts
of Moscow.

818
00:51:32,617 --> 00:51:34,866
Yevgeny's with her.
The clock's ticking.

819
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,617
- What do you mean?
- Warner signed on

820
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,075
- to the 25th Amendment.
- Fuck.

821
00:51:40,158 --> 00:51:41,991
- So Keane has to stand down?
- Not yet.

822
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:46,575
She preemptively fired
four members of her Cabinet.

823
00:51:46,659 --> 00:51:49,033
Warner's petitioning
the Supreme Court

824
00:51:49,117 --> 00:51:52,200
to rule on the legality
of her action.

825
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:55,033
- So what's your plan?
- At my request,

826
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:57,825
the President's demanded
immediate and high-level talks

827
00:51:57,908 --> 00:51:58,741
with my counterparts on

828
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:01,033
the Russian
national security council.

829
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,409
As the pretext for an operation
to grab Simone?

830
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,242
Delegation leaves tonight.

831
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:11,117
Is it too late?

832
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,700
For?

833
00:52:12,783 --> 00:52:15,908
Me to join?
I think I could be useful.

834
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:19,825
Fucking kidding? Can you
be ready in four hours?

835
00:52:19,908 --> 00:52:23,700
If I hustle.
Text me the details.

836
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:30,075
I gotta say something
to Dante's parents first.

837
00:52:30,158 --> 00:52:32,158
- What do they know?
- Medical examiner found

838
00:52:32,242 --> 00:52:35,117
a congenital heart defect
that was never diagnosed.

839
00:52:57,534 --> 00:53:00,908
Here you go, sweetie.

840
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:13,492
Hey.

841
00:53:13,575 --> 00:53:14,908
Find your bag?

842
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:15,741
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

843
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:18,991
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetheart.

844
00:53:19,075 --> 00:53:23,367
- What kind of cookies are those?
- Chocolate chip.

845
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,075
Mmm.
Did Aunt Maggie make 'em?

846
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:27,908
No, she bought them
from the store.

847
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:36,117
So, um...

848
00:53:40,075 --> 00:53:42,908
Sweetheart, you know how
Mommy goes away sometimes?

849
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:48,617
And you stay
with Aunt Maggie, right?

850
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,908
Are you going away?

851
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:53,659
Yeah. Yeah,
I have to go to work.

852
00:53:53,741 --> 00:53:56,825
And while I'm gone,

853
00:53:56,908 --> 00:53:58,075
you're gonna live here
with Aunt Maggie

854
00:53:58,158 --> 00:54:02,200
and Josie and Uncle Bill
just like you have been.

855
00:54:02,283 --> 00:54:03,991
Where are you going?

856
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,367
Um, I'm going to Europe.
Remember?

857
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,825
- Where we used to live?
- Not really.

858
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:14,700
I showed you on a map once.
Across the ocean.

859
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,367
You showed me,
but I don't remember.

860
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,575
Well, that's where
I'm goin'.

861
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:23,200
Are you coming back?

862
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,158
Of course I'm coming back.
I'm going to work,

863
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:32,825
and I always come back
when my work's over, don't I?

864
00:54:32,908 --> 00:54:35,158
Hey, Franny.

865
00:54:35,242 --> 00:54:38,117
I always come back.

866
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,866
And while she's gone, you and I
are going to what?

867
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,033
Make pictures for her every day.

868
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:50,659
- Are you?
- We are going to draw a picture

869
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:54,534
of something we've done that day
and then when Mommy comes home,

870
00:54:54,617 --> 00:54:56,325
we're gonna give her
all the pictures

871
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,033
so she's going to know
what we've been up to. Right?

872
00:54:59,117 --> 00:55:01,200
- Right.
- That's an amazing idea.

873
00:55:01,283 --> 00:55:04,659
Did you think of that?
Ah. You're so smart.

874
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:07,950
Come here. Give Mom a hug.

875
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,741
Can I go play
with Josie now?

876
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:35,908
Yeah, of course you can.

877
00:55:47,908 --> 00:55:49,450
She's going to be fine.

878
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:55,700
Yeah, I know.

879
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,242
Thank you.

880
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:14,950
Come here.

881
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,117
Now go.

882
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,325
Go do what you were born to do.

883
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:34,075
Thank you.

884
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:38,409
Stop saying that.

885
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:16,158
- Ready?
- Yeah.

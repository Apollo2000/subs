1
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,804
Previously,
on Homeland...

2
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:08,363
We have to buy time,
40 minutes, maybe an hour,

3
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:09,762
till they're in the air.

4
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:11,154
- I'm not leaving you.
- I agreed with Saul.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,618
If things go wrong,
this is the plan.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,237
What, to allow them
to fucking catch you?

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,178
speaking foreign language

8
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:27,553
It was you.

9
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,804
Carrie Mathison, you're just
going to leave her here?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,303
Ms. Martin, what was
your most recent operation?

12
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:47,428
We tried to compromise
your president

13
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:50,178
and push her out of office.

14
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:59,053
Your medication.

15
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,053
How do you wanna spend
the rest of your days here?

16
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,428
Reading nice books
that Alexander brings you

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,470
and exercising in the yard...

18
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:11,387
or going mad,
locked up in an asylum?

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,929
No one back in Moscow

20
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,845
is much in the mood
to negotiate, anyway.

21
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:17,428
Maybe it's better
if you wait a few months.

22
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,053
I can't wait a few months.

23
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,387
I don't even know if she'll be
alive in a few months.

24
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:25,595
Go.

25
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,261
You all right?
You all right?

26
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,220
No, no, no, no.
Not the coat.

27
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,011
No, no, no, no, no.
Not the coat.

28
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:07,387
Not the coat.
Not the coat.

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,529
Don't be scared.

30
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:15,887
Don't be scared.

31
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:27,053
No, no, no, no!

32
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,053
Rough ride?

33
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:11,512
You need to sleep.

34
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:13,303
I'm trying.

35
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:15,178
It's been almost six hours.

36
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,136
You can have another lorazepam.

37
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,387
No, I wanna wean myself.

38
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,387
Maybe a half.

39
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:01,553
Blood work?

40
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,512
Tomorrow.

41
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:18,220
Sorry.

42
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,595
No, come on in.
Have a seat.

43
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,720
Is Doug...

44
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,863
I'm sitting in for Doug.

45
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:25,929
Jim Turrow.

46
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,011
You're his supervisor.
Is that right?

47
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:37,387
You want anything to drink?

48
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,178
Uh, no.
No, I'm good.

49
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,637
Okay if I ask you
a few questions?

50
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,095
Sure.

51
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:45,553
You were detained in Russia
for 213 days?

52
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,428
Yes.

53
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:49,679
And you were interrogated
for the first...

54
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:52,679
Uh, 30ish...

55
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,136
Who was your interrogator?

56
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,679
Um, a colonel named
Sergei Tobokov,

57
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:58,887
most of the time, anyway.

58
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,011
GRU.

59
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,970
Why'd he stop?

60
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:03,720
All of this is in the file.

61
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,303
It's a big file.

62
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,029
Can you tell me why
he stopped interrogating you?

63
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,845
I think because
I threw my feces at him.

64
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,845
And was that strategic?

65
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:16,428
No, no.

66
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:19,970
I... I... I was in the midst
of a florid psychosis.

67
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,679
They withheld my medication

68
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:25,345
and it took about 20 days
for me to devolve

69
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:28,303
into a not
very helpful subject, um,

70
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:30,303
but they kept at it
for another week or so.

71
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,929
I can't give you
an exact figure.

72
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,720
After that,
it's all either blank

73
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:37,929
or a series of images

74
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:40,345
that don't much comport
with reality.

75
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:42,303
Um, if we're doing this
the slow way,

76
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,345
may... maybe I will take
some water.

77
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,470
Doug informs me you'd like
to be reinstated at the agency.

78
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,178
Yes.

79
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,887
Yes,
I would like that very much.

80
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,970
A security clearance
isn't an option

81
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,303
with upwards of 180 days
unaccounted for.

82
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,845
Yeah, I know that.

83
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:58,196
That's why I've been
working so hard

84
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,679
with Dr. Foley and Doug,

85
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,970
just trying
to fill in the gaps.

86
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:02,845
Did they give you
the impression

87
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,845
that wasn't the case?

88
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,303
No.

89
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:07,107
Did they tell you
you failed your polygraph?

90
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,095
Deception indicated.

91
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:13,553
So you're gonna have
to bear with me.

92
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:18,970
Um... which questions?

93
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:22,178
You said it was usually Tobokov
but not always.

94
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,387
I'd like to know
which questions, please.

95
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,720
Quite a few, actually.

96
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,136
Such as?

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,595
Have you ever conspired

98
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,929
with a foreign intelligence
officer or service?

99
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,345
Wh... so... so what does that mean?

100
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,762
Are... are you accusing me
of something?

101
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,261
Could mean a lot of things:

102
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:52,261
giving up sources
and methods,

103
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,053
working for the enemy.

104
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,553
You tell me.

105
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,053
My memory doesn't distinguish
between what was real

106
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,679
and... and what wasn't.

107
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,178
You get that, right?

108
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:05,679
The polygraph doesn't care
if you were delusional.

109
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,261
It says you were lying.

110
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,261
I edit my answers,
because I don't trust

111
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:11,345
my own brain.

112
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:12,762
That's what it's picking up.

113
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,804
Maybe.

114
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,387
We expected that
going into this.

115
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,970
Dr. Foley and Doug both said
it was a possibility.

116
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,762
Why is he acting like
this is incriminating?

117
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:30,428
We expected it.

118
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,072
You wanna jump in here?

119
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:33,887
Sit down, please.

120
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:48,011
You did admit to giving up
the location

121
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,845
of a safe house in Beirut.

122
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:52,762
Yeah, one that hasn't been
active for decades.

123
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,095
I believe at that point

124
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:56,512
I had been kept awake
for 96 hours.

125
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:59,470
- What about assets?
- What about them?

126
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:01,154
Did you ever reveal
the identity of an asset?

127
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,470
No.

128
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:04,553
Maybe somebody who died
ten years before.

129
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,762
No, assets have families.
I wouldn't do that.

130
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,095
You sure?

131
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:10,929
How much more clearly
can I say this?

132
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:13,261
I did not.

133
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:16,720
Ms. Mathison,
how can you be so sure

134
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,428
if there's 180 days
of your life

135
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,011
you don't remember?

136
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

137
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:40,512
Parties are prepared
to work through dinner tonight.

138
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,987
Should we take that
as a positive sign?

139
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,887
Just getting the Taliban
to the table

140
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,428
has taken nine years.

141
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:46,613
So the fact
they're sitting down

142
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:48,517
with the Afghan government
at all is a positive.

143
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,512
Come on, Saul, make some news.
It's been three weeks.

144
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:54,512
At least give us a sense
of how it's going so far.

145
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,136
It's going;
from what I understand,

146
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,053
there's a nice lamb kabsa
on the menu tonight.

147
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:59,595
- Ha.
- Okay.

148
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,879
How 'bout off the record then?

149
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:04,220
Sure.

150
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:08,895
Well, the list
of missed opportunities

151
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,637
for peace in Afghanistan
is long.

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,887
What do you see as the main
obstacles to a deal?

153
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,220
Well, for one thing,
America hasn't got

154
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:17,220
a whole lot of good options.

155
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:19,136
We're not staying forever.

156
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,553
President's made that
abundantly clear.

157
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:22,877
We can't just walk away either.

158
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,345
Why not?

159
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,108
Well, our forces out past
a critical point,

160
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:28,679
Kabul falls in six weeks.

161
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:31,762
General Edwards
told me six months.

162
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:34,387
Trillion dollars spent,

163
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,178
more than 2,000 lives lost...

164
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,595
it's a U.S. surrender
any way you look at it.

165
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,720
Other issue is
the Taliban itself.

166
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:45,321
It's not clear they have
anything to gain

167
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:46,679
by a political settlement.

168
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:48,553
What do you mean, exactly?

169
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:51,136
Only reason to cut a deal
is to get us to leave

170
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,345
sooner than later.

171
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:53,828
Which you just said
isn't an option.

172
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,887
Not without serious
security guarantees in place

173
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,011
before we go.

174
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,387
And what's wrong with that?

175
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,946
Nothing, if you think
the Taliban will abide

176
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,130
by the terms of an agreement.

177
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:02,345
And will they?

178
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:05,053
Your guess is as good as mine.

179
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,720
President Warner
seems confident enough.

180
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,595
Well, the President's
an optimist.

181
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,929
Me, I'm a spy.

182
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:12,595
And his
National Security Advisor.

183
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,720
Don't remind me.

184
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,529
G'ulom's making a statement.

185
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:18,637
Sorry, I gotta go.
More later.

186
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,553
What's he gonna say?
Do we know?

187
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,887
No idea.

188
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,428
His office only just announced

189
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:29,178
that he was doing
the press conference.

190
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,929
This can't be good.

191
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:36,804
But we are
lions, brothers and sisters.

192
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,679
Other animals in the jungle
are afraid

193
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:46,053
of even a sick lion
and stay away from him.

194
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:50,011
We are lions.

195
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:54,011
The United States
should treat us

196
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:56,762
as lions.

197
00:10:56,845 --> 00:11:00,178
And we demand nothing less.

198
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:05,303
Instead, our president

199
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:09,136
and foreign minister
have been tricked.

200
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,387
Tricked into promising
to release

201
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,553
more than 1,000

202
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:20,387
Taliban prisoners of war,

203
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,387
12 of them responsible
for the bomb...

204
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,428
hidden inside an ambulance

205
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:31,470
and killed nearly

206
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:35,845
100 citizens last month

207
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,720
in Kabul.

208
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,512
I want you to know...

209
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:47,804
I am in charge of these
prisoners,

210
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:51,720
and I will never agree
to their release.

211
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:54,053
Never.

212
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:58,387
Not even a single one.

213
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:20,303
Robin, talk to me.

214
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:21,720
Phones started going off,

215
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,237
and you can imagine
what happened next.

216
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,762
Where's Agha Jan?

217
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,279
He threw down his credentials
and he stormed off

218
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:28,595
with the rest
of the Taliban delegation.

219
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,178
I don't think
he's coming back, Saul.

220
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:31,529
- I really don't.
- Which way they go?

221
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:32,679
Um...

222
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,553
Agha Jan.

223
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,011
Agha Jan!

224
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:48,053
We told you,
no prisoners, no talks.

225
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,387
I'm aware.

226
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,220
The very first thing
we agreed to

227
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,553
and now it is broken.

228
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,845
I understand you're angry.

229
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,720
I'm angry,
but nothing is broken.

230
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:59,720
We agreed
to a prisoner exchange

231
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,720
upon successful completion
of an agreement.

232
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:03,720
We are not there yet,
not even close.

233
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,053
You heard G'ulom.

234
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:06,946
Vice President doesn't speak
for the government.

235
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,387
You know that.

236
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,261
What is done is done.

237
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:11,637
Too bad.

238
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:13,887
Agha Jan.

239
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,738
Leave now
and it'll be years before

240
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,220
we get back to this point,
if ever.

241
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,887
I'm sorry, I truly am.

242
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,053
I have an idea.

243
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,887
What if I was able
to accelerate the release

244
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,637
of some of the prisoners
in U.S. custody?

245
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,595
Say, 5 of the 32 at Guantanamo?

246
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,929
Would that change your mind?

247
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,804
You could do that?

248
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:36,845
I could try.

249
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:40,011
I would consider it
if we get to choose which five.

250
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,679
Okay.

251
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:46,053
Then we'll stay
for one week,

252
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:49,845
but you still have to get
G'ulom to change what he said.

253
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,428
speaks foreign language

254
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,053
I'll call you back
from the office.

255
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:10,178
Give us a minute, will you?

256
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:11,970
Of course.

257
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,428
You look peeved.
What's happened?

258
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,011
You know damn well.

259
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:19,470
I warned you.

260
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,220
It was only a matter of time
before things fell apart.

261
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:23,720
There's falling apart

262
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,011
and then there's pushing 'em
off a cliff.

263
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,512
Pakistan had nothing to do
with this.

264
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,220
We're not leaking details
of these talks to anyone.

265
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,095
Please.

266
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:38,762
It wasn't me, and it wasn't
anybody in my delegation.

267
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,738
You know, you almost
make me believe you.

268
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:44,845
Then I remember Islamabad,
the embassy,

269
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,887
the two hours you stood down
your response team,

270
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:51,845
while 36 Americans were killed
in cold blood.

271
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,387
Colonel Jefrani.

272
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,011
Yes, ma'am?

273
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,220
Show Mr. Berenson out.

274
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,011
You got a lot of shit.

275
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:25,595
I'm Gonzales.

276
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,762
Piotrowski.

277
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,095
Huh?

278
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:30,929
Piotrowski.
Max!

279
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:34,011
Squad's out on patrol.

280
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:35,762
Nobody gonna be back
till morning.

281
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:38,178
Anything I should do
in the meantime?

282
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,762
Stay low, try not to get shot.

283
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,387
Doug.

284
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,637
Hey.

285
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,136
Jim Turrow,
counterintelligence.

286
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,303
Hi, Jim, good to meet you.

287
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,303
And you know Dr. Foley.

288
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,387
Hi.

289
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,595
Where are we?

290
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,196
Physically,
she's in good shape.

291
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,804
Sleep is still an issue,
but it's better than it was.

292
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,970
Her thyroid hasn't quite
leveled out.

293
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,762
That's from?

294
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,637
The malnutrition.

295
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,470
It improves when she eats more
or treat it with a pill?

296
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:24,553
Medication.

297
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:26,011
We're playing with the dosage.

298
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,804
That and the sleep
both have an impact

299
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,136
on mood regulation
and memory access.

300
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,470
So we are hoping
that her recall will improve

301
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,136
as we go.

302
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,071
There are still
significant gaps in her story,

303
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:38,470
but that's par for the course.

304
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,512
She's recovering
more information every day.

305
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:42,470
It's not the gaps
I'm concerned about.

306
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:44,679
If you're worried
about the polygraph,

307
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,202
I would take it
with a grain of salt.

308
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,512
It's not something
we can ignore.

309
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:50,136
Polygraphs are unreliable.

310
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,637
"Deception indicated"
can mean she's nervous

311
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,512
or lying to herself.

312
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,303
Or it can indicate deception.

313
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:00,011
We have a long way to go.
This is just one data point.

314
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:03,595
Look, I... I don't wanna dismiss
your misgivings,

315
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,929
but bringing in Mr. Berenson
may have been premature.

316
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,345
He didn't call me here.

317
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,053
Oh.
I misunderstood.

318
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:12,929
I'm here because
I need Carrie in Kabul

319
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,095
for a week or two.

320
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,428
- When?
- Right away.

321
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,929
We're making progress here.

322
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,261
Put her in a war zone,
we could be back to square one.

323
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:28,220
Terms of debriefing timeline
or her mental state?

324
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:29,595
Both.

325
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,804
She unstable?

326
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:32,804
Not now.

327
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:35,929
It's an important mission.

328
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:38,887
I'm okay with a setback.

329
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,887
We may be dealing with
a compromised officer here.

330
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,679
You know, she has a kid.

331
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:45,095
Mathison?
Yes.

332
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:46,887
You know,
she signed away custody

333
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,387
and walked into a bear trap
in the middle of Moscow

334
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,387
to stop an attack
on our presidency.

335
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,970
Yes.

336
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,196
Everyone breaks
under interrogation,

337
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,762
especially
Russian interrogation.

338
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,345
They're good at it.

339
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,929
That's why our sources
were protected

340
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,970
and procedures changed
after she was captured.

341
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:02,428
It's more complicated
than that.

342
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:04,428
I'm well aware.

343
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,136
What I wanna know is,

344
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,637
do you have anything
other than a jumpy polygraph?

345
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,637
Hey.

346
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,095
Hey.

347
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:26,845
How are you?
Color's better.

348
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:31,345
They're big on fresh air
around here.

349
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:34,136
It seems my vitamin D level's
not great.

350
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,696
Also, I'm a Russian agent,
apparently.

351
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,178
So I heard.

352
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,553
Ridiculous.

353
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,553
You won't mind, then,
if I pick your brain a bit.

354
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:43,804
Only if you think it's safe
to be seen talking to me.

355
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:45,220
I'll take my chances.

356
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,804
Your old friend
Abdul Qarid G'ulom

357
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:53,095
just fired a broadside
into the peace talks.

358
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:55,053
Yeah, I saw that.

359
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:56,720
I need him to
publicly walk back

360
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,428
his comments about the POWs.

361
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,595
Agreeing to their release
is what got the Taliban

362
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,428
to the negotiating table
in the first place.

363
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:06,595
I assume the ambassador's
already taken a run at him.

364
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,887
And the chief of station,
got exactly nowhere.

365
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,303
Who's the current COS?

366
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:12,428
Mike Dunne.

367
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,512
What?

368
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:16,279
You need an alpha to deal
with an alpha.

369
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,303
- Mike's not that.
- No.

370
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:21,821
All right, give me a few days.
I'll come up with some options.

371
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,679
You don't have a few days.

372
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:24,905
Putting you on
a military transport

373
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:27,929
to Kabul tonight.

374
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,387
If you're up for it, that is.

375
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,929
You kidding?
Hell yes.

376
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,929
- Saul...
- Don't thank me yet.

377
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:40,845
Kabul isn't the place
you knew before.

378
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,470
It's ten times more dangerous
just walking around,

379
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:45,845
and you'll be without
any of your old assets.

380
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,887
Pulled from the field, huh?

381
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,490
The minute you were
arrested in Moscow.

382
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,053
Everybody?

383
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,261
Ones you reported
to headquarters, at least.

384
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,512
Saul, I report all my assets
to headquarters,

385
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,053
no matter who they are
or how sensitive.

386
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,887
Of course you do.

387
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,637
Come on, let's get you
packed up, ready to go.

388
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:12,512
Hey, Mike, it's Turrow.

389
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:14,804
You heard from Saul Berenson
by any chance?

390
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:16,303
No, what's up?

391
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:17,696
I could be wrong,

392
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,905
but I think you got
a bad situation

393
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:19,595
coming your way.

394
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,887
Bad how?

395
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,720
A compromised officer.

396
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:24,720
Who is it?

397
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:27,220
Your old boss,
Carrie Mathison.

398
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:33,553
Piotrowski's doing
hardware maintenance.

399
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:36,470
We're gonna provide support
so he can repair or replace.

400
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,553
The unit's on Sar Ridge.

401
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:41,220
We're gonna loop around
north of Decup.

402
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:42,804
We're going over the six-one?

403
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,762
If the trail's intact,
we'll take it two clicks west.

404
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:48,325
If the rain last week
washed it out...

405
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:49,470
What is he, NSA?

406
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:54,178
We're doing this
for a cable repair guy?

407
00:21:57,178 --> 00:21:58,428
Back me up, Gonzo.

408
00:21:58,512 --> 00:21:59,905
We already know
how this shit goes down.

409
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,136
He's right, LT.

410
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,620
At least tell us
what this is about.

411
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:07,011
Mission's classified.

412
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,845
- Oh, great.
- Hey.

413
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,512
We leave at 22:00.

414
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:13,553
Whole thing will be done
under cover of darkness,

415
00:22:13,637 --> 00:22:15,720
which should afford us
a measure of security.

416
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:17,095
This is bullshit.

417
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:21,720
Show him where
the riverbed's at.

418
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:25,929
Okay, look, every time we cross
the six-one, we get hit.

419
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,637
Last couple of times,
we lost a guy.

420
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,970
We'll take it slow

421
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:30,112
'cause you're not used
to the altitude,

422
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:31,804
but we're gonna cross
the riverbed

423
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:34,136
right about here
that's fairly exposed.

424
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,053
You just gotta haul ass
till you get

425
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:37,011
to the trees
on the other side,

426
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:39,637
about 25, 30 yards.

427
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,887
So when we get
to the riverbed...

428
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,470
Run.

429
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:27,553
Can you unlock the window?

430
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:29,553
They don't open.

431
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,595
speaking foreign language

432
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:22,428
Thank merciful God.
The cavalry's shown up.

433
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:24,312
Is it just me or is that
chip on your shoulder

434
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,107
bigger than the last time
we saw each other?

435
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:28,428
Fuck off.

436
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:30,220
Hey, I want you
to meet somebody.

437
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,720
This is Jenna Bragg.
Jenna, Carrie Mathison.

438
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,512
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

439
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:35,780
Jenna's the newest member
of the team.

440
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:36,946
She's gonna be looking
after you.

441
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,154
Come on, Mike,
you know how I roll.

442
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:38,804
Don't waste your time.

443
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:40,303
Not at all.

444
00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:41,446
She wants to do it,
don't you, Jenna?

445
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,679
Happy to.

446
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:44,387
Any word on the G'ulom meeting?

447
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,178
Set for Friday morning.

448
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,571
I figured you'd want a few days
to see what you could dig up.

449
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:51,470
Saul told me I could get a look
at the latest 201 file on him.

450
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,345
Loaded onto the laptop
in your room,

451
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:55,148
and if you need anything
run down, just ask.

452
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:56,970
Thanks.

453
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,178
Glad you're here, Carrie.
I mean that.

454
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:04,095
Glad to be here.

455
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:05,321
I'll show you to your room.

456
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:08,220
Hey, Carrie, um, truth is,

457
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:09,943
she's a little stuck
in the starting gate.

458
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,720
I've only been here a month.

459
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,553
Sorry?

460
00:25:41,637 --> 00:25:43,720
How am I supposed to get
out of the starting gate

461
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:45,470
if he won't let me leave
the station

462
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:48,428
without an armored vehicle
and a security detail?

463
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:53,553
I might as well have
"CIA" tattooed on my forehead.

464
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:58,345
How bad is it out there?

465
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:01,011
It's bad and getting worse.

466
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:02,720
Foreign workers are
definitely a target,

467
00:26:02,804 --> 00:26:04,845
but isn't this exactly
what I was trained for?

468
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:10,762
Here.

469
00:26:13,095 --> 00:26:15,720
- Insist, then.
- Excuse me.

470
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:17,762
You're in a hard place,
trying to do hard things.

471
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,565
Don't whine and don't take no
for an answer.

472
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,095
Who's it to?

473
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:45,136
Berenson.

474
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:47,696
What makes you think
she's gonna have

475
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
any more luck with G'ulom
than we did?

476
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:51,387
G'ulom trusts her.

477
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,780
The two of them made
a pretty good partnership

478
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:53,929
back in the day.

479
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,887
Killed a lot of bad guys
together.

480
00:26:57,178 --> 00:26:58,470
Shh.

481
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,053
What's that?

482
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:09,679
A call code...

483
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,595
prearranged between asset
and base.

484
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,053
Two pings for this,
three for that.

485
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:15,136
Old-school.

486
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:20,762
Now find out
who owns that number.

487
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,595
Got any questions?
'Cause this is the time.

488
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,762
Only about the riverbed.

489
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:43,261
You'll let me know?

490
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,780
You'll know,
'cause we're fucking running.

491
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:46,845
You don't need to worry
about it on the way out.

492
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,154
There's just spotters
when we head out.

493
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:50,261
It's the way back
that's the problem.

494
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:51,625
So they'll have eyes on us?

495
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,804
Starting now.

496
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:55,595
Where the road ends,
the Taliban begins.

497
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,178
Should we walk
or would you rather go inside?

498
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:21,929
Let's walk.

499
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:25,011
I was emotional before
and rude.

500
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:26,303
I apologize.

501
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,220
Apology accepted.

502
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,011
I've been meaning to ask
about your father.

503
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:34,303
How is he?

504
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,804
Stepfather, and poorly,
I'm afraid.

505
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:39,303
The MS is starting to affect
his vision.

506
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,095
I'm sorry to hear that.

507
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,279
Must be proud of you, though,

508
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,178
getting the job
he always wanted.

509
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:46,345
I think he'd have
preferred grandchildren.

510
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:48,220
You said you needed to see me.

511
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,970
Frankly, I'm at a loss.
I don't know what to do.

512
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,887
- About what?
- You.

513
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,970
Me?

514
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:57,720
Well, Pakistan.

515
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:00,595
I was hoping for another
adult in the room.

516
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:02,239
Seems all you're interested in
is making

517
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:04,679
what's already a difficult
situation impossible.

518
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:06,804
I'm sorry.
Am I missing something here?

519
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:09,178
Weren't you just apologizing
30 seconds ago?

520
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:11,011
I was, now I'm imploring.

521
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:12,679
Really?

522
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:15,303
Because that's not
what it sounds like.

523
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,220
I know we want
the same thing here.

524
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:20,303
- Do we?
- Yes.

525
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:22,553
Fair and durable peace
in the region.

526
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,428
Don't lecture me
about peace in the region.

527
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:28,887
You abandoned the region

528
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,470
after the Soviets
were sent packing.

529
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,595
Then 9/11 happened
and you're back.

530
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,428
We've all seen this movie.

531
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,512
We know how it ends...

532
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:40,345
in chaos and civil war
on our border.

533
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:42,136
That's exactly what
we're trying to avoid.

534
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,762
How?

535
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:46,470
By announcing timetables
and benchmarks?

536
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,136
By unilaterally drawing down

537
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,011
your combat troop levels
to zero?

538
00:29:51,095 --> 00:29:54,303
The Afghan state you've built
is a house of cards,

539
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:56,136
its army a joke.

540
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,762
You want real resolution,
then show some real resolve.

541
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:04,053
At least make the Taliban think

542
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,637
you aren't running
for the exits.

543
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,053
Policy's the policy.

544
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:11,845
No way that is changing now.

545
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:16,303
Then peace isn't what you want.

546
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:18,345
You just want out.

547
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:25,387
speaking foreign language

548
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,178
All right, we're here.

549
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,970
You see the kid?

550
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,595
Where?

551
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,929
By the caves.

552
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:33,970
Come on, get a move on.
We don't got all night.

553
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,929
They sent the fucking A-team.

554
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:27,637
Carrie!

555
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,011
Arman, how are you?

556
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:30,845
Good, good, prosperous.

557
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,637
Yeah, I can see that.

558
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,220
23 in the fleet now.

559
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:37,011
This one, it is brand-new,
10,000 gallons.

560
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:38,011
Beautiful.

561
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:39,220
All thanks to you.

562
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:40,470
Hardly.

563
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:42,237
You built this yourself,
Arman, from nothing.

564
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:45,095
One rented truck,
and who helped me rent it?

565
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,053
This is for Daria.

566
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:50,387
I tried to get the Lancome,
but I couldn't find it.

567
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,011
Never mind.

568
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:53,470
She will love
whatever you bring.

569
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:55,428
So who's driving me tonight?

570
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,512
I am.

571
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,345
- You are?
- Yeah.

572
00:34:58,428 --> 00:34:59,905
But I thought you don't
drive anymore.

573
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:01,887
I do for you.

574
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:08,845
Nothing has changed:

575
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:11,053
bribes, extortion, murder.

576
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:14,720
It is criminal enterprise,
this government.

577
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:17,720
And G'ulom himself, where does
he fit in these days?

578
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:20,095
Oh, he's at the very top
of the pyramid.

579
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:21,658
He's more powerful
than the President.

580
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,720
Then I need to find an enemy,

581
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:26,637
someone willing
to bring him down.

582
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,136
Maybe one
of the other ministers.

583
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,136
Don't bother.
They don't have the guts.

584
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:35,845
What about Faqiar?

585
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,863
I read somewhere he was running
an anti-corruption campaign.

586
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,387
G'ulom paid him off.

587
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,762
I hear he's in Dubai now.
He's living like a king.

588
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:47,095
The law in this country,
it is only for the poor.

589
00:35:51,553 --> 00:35:52,970
Taliban?

590
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:55,011
Most likely pro-Taliban
kochi nomads.

591
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:58,428
They are very brave
to be fighting Sunni in Kabul.

592
00:35:58,512 --> 00:36:00,762
I thought Ghazni was as far
as they'd advanced.

593
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:02,095
That was last month.

594
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:04,679
Today, they make attacks
on Afghan army positions

595
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:05,887
almost anywhere.

596
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:11,512
That was closer.

597
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:14,470
I give them free gas
in exchange for safe passage.

598
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:15,637
I think we'll be fine.

599
00:36:24,178 --> 00:36:26,720
Ghazni.

600
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:28,804
Ah, right, checkpoint.

601
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,720
All clear.

602
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,261
No checkpoint, huh?

603
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,178
- No.
- What's that mean?

604
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,970
I don't know.
How long will you be?

605
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:59,512
An hour at the most.
I'll text you when I'm ready.

606
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:00,512
Okay.

607
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:36,512
speaking foreign language

608
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,136
Are you Sheena?

609
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:49,929
Do you speak English?

610
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,637
English study, Pashto.

611
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,762
Good.

612
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:56,261
I'm so sorry to disturb you
at night.

613
00:38:56,345 --> 00:38:58,929
Your husband has told me
wonderful things.

614
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:00,845
It's really an honor
to meet you.

615
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:02,970
I met Zarawar
when he was this high.

616
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:04,929
He's so big.

617
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:06,970
Uh, is Roshan here?

618
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,345
No.

619
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:12,595
Okay, do... do you know
when he'll be back?

620
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,011
No.

621
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,303
I really would like to see him.

622
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:20,136
Would you mind calling him
for me?

623
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,220
No, I'm sorry.
You should go.

624
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:28,178
I understand it's uncomfortable
having a strange woman

625
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:29,303
speak to your husband,

626
00:39:29,387 --> 00:39:31,929
but it's... it's very,
very important.

627
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:33,470
And I'm not gonna leave
your house

628
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:34,637
until you contact him.

629
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,905
Can you please pick up
your phone?

630
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:37,178
I said no.

631
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:41,303
speaks foreign language

632
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:43,553
Tell me what?

633
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:53,345
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

634
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:55,929
I didn't know.

635
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:58,011
They killed him.

636
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:00,303
Who did?

637
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:02,970
The Taliban, because of you.

638
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:05,220
Because of the CIA.

639
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,220
No, no, that's...
that's not possible.

640
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:09,220
They said,
"This is what happens

641
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:11,261
to a traitor
for the Americans."

642
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,136
They pulled him from the house,

643
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,762
ropes on his hands, feet...

644
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,512
tied him to a truck,

645
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:19,887
dragged him
through the streets.

646
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,970
Oh, Sheena, I'm so sorry.

647
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,095
Zarawar...

648
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:24,720
Don't speak to my son.

649
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,887
You have to believe me.

650
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,470
I never told anyone
about my meetings with Roshan,

651
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,053
not... not even the people
I work for, nobody.

652
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,470
Is it... is it possible he had
another American contact?

653
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:39,970
Only you.

654
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:44,220
When did this happen?

655
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:46,804
Five months ago.

656
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:51,470
I don't... I...

657
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,470
I... I... I... I wasn't
even in Afghanistan.

658
00:40:53,553 --> 00:40:55,762
I was in prison.

659
00:40:55,845 --> 00:41:00,053
I never told anyone his name.
Please... please believe me.

660
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:02,970
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

661
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:05,804
You should go now.

662
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,387
Get out of my house.

663
00:41:25,804 --> 00:41:27,845
Did you ever reveal
the identity of an asset?

664
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:29,512
No.

665
00:41:29,595 --> 00:41:31,237
Maybe somebody who died
ten years before.

666
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:32,404
No.
Assets have families.

667
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:33,553
I wouldn't do that.

668
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:35,845
Ms. Mathison,
how can you be so sure

669
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,220
if there's 180 days
of your life

670
00:41:37,303 --> 00:41:38,303
you don't remember?

671
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,428
No, stay.

672
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:49,136
Don't leave me.

673
00:41:49,178 --> 00:41:51,095
Don't leave me.

674
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,845
Stay.
Stay, stay.

675
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:56,887
shouting in foreign language

676
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,970
shouting in foreign language

677
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:24,345
Fuck!

678
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:27,470
speaking foreign language

679
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:36,762
speaking foreign language

680
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:45,887
shouting foreign language

681
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,011
speaks foreign language

682
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:11,762
speaking in foreign language

683
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,387
speaks foreign language

684
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:30,136
shouts foreign language

685
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,178
Are you done yet?

686
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:48,345
No.

687
00:43:48,428 --> 00:43:50,220
How much longer?

688
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,553
I don't know.

689
00:43:51,637 --> 00:43:53,345
I thought I could fix
the switch box,

690
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:54,428
but it's not working.

691
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,220
I gotta swap it out.

692
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,720
How involved is that?

693
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:03,428
Fuck this, man.

694
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:06,261
Well, it's gonna be light
in an hour.

695
00:44:06,345 --> 00:44:07,845
You're gonna have to
wrap it up.

696
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:12,470
You go ahead.
I'll find my own way back.

697
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:16,011
Come on, huddle up.

698
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:20,470
Hey, we're going.

699
00:44:20,553 --> 00:44:22,178
I'm not leaving until I'm done.

700
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:24,303
Just pick up
your fucking bag and walk.

701
00:44:26,345 --> 00:44:29,053
We don't have
a functional listening device

702
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:31,512
in 14 miles
of the Pakistani border.

703
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:34,595
We're in negotiations
with the Taliban in Doha.

704
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,679
Our people don't know
if they are having

705
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:39,345
a real conversation
or if it's just bullshit

706
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:41,178
designed to get us to release

707
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,679
1,000 Taliban fighters
from prison.

708
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,512
Hasan Hakhami is
down there somewhere.

709
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:51,804
He's the one calling the shots
in a hideout in Pakistan

710
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:54,804
that we can't find,
on a phone that we can't tap.

711
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:59,428
He's the guy that slaughtered
36 of our people

712
00:44:59,512 --> 00:45:00,804
in Islamabad.

713
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:04,720
I watched him do it.

714
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:08,387
You were there, at the embassy?

715
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:16,387
It's not that you went out,

716
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,905
it's that you went out
without informing anybody.

717
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:18,845
Mike...

718
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:19,845
And don't give me any bullshit

719
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:21,387
about source protection

720
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,780
or "better to ask forgiveness
than permission."

721
00:46:22,804 --> 00:46:24,595
I don't need anybody's
permission.

722
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:26,613
I'm here on behalf of
the National Security Advisor.

723
00:46:26,637 --> 00:46:27,720
God damn it, Carrie.

724
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:29,279
There are three teams
out there right now

725
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:30,720
risking their lives
to find you.

726
00:46:30,804 --> 00:46:31,905
Well, I didn't ask
for that either.

727
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:35,553
Well, for your sake,
I hope it was worth it.

728
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:37,470
Wh... what's that supposed
to mean?

729
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:40,220
That you got what you needed,
because G'ulom's office called.

730
00:46:40,303 --> 00:46:41,446
Your meeting's been
rescheduled.

731
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,178
- For when?
- This morning.

732
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:44,387
Six hours from now.

733
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,220
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

734
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:50,553
Jenna will be here at 8:45
to pick you up.

735
00:46:50,637 --> 00:46:52,553
Hey, Mike.

736
00:46:52,637 --> 00:46:54,553
I need to ask you something.

737
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:55,804
What?

738
00:46:57,512 --> 00:47:00,345
About Russian cooperation
with the Taliban.

739
00:47:00,428 --> 00:47:01,845
How real is it?

740
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:04,845
Real enough.

741
00:47:06,762 --> 00:47:08,095
What does that look like,
exactly?

742
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:09,595
Military aid, advisors?

743
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:10,929
Both.

744
00:47:13,136 --> 00:47:15,303
What about intelligence?
Are they sharing intelligence?

745
00:47:15,387 --> 00:47:17,595
You bet,
anything to piss us off.

746
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:18,919
It's what the Kremlin
lives for.

747
00:47:22,178 --> 00:47:24,887
I see.

748
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,762
Why do you ask?

749
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,428
I don't know.

750
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:32,136
I just... I'm trying to get
the lay of the land, I guess.

751
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,460
Where were you tonight, Carrie?

752
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,040
Well, maybe you can tell me
how it relates to Russia, then.

753
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:40,053
How what relates?

754
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:41,376
You're here to leverage G'ulom,

755
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:42,637
but you're asking Russia.

756
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,136
Jesus, Mike, not you too.

757
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,428
What the hell'd they tell you?

758
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:47,053
That you tanked a polygraph.

759
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,887
I was in Ghazni, okay,
meeting a guy

760
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,363
who used to run against
the insurgents.

761
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:57,780
He mentioned a GRU contact
in the area.

762
00:47:57,804 --> 00:47:59,637
- Who?
- Well, he wasn't naming names,

763
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,720
was he?

764
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,553
Okay.

765
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,679
Okay.

766
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:20,428
You look tired.
You should get some rest.

767
00:48:20,512 --> 00:48:22,136
Big day tomorrow.

768
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,428
Yeah.

769
00:49:49,345 --> 00:49:51,762
All right, I'm pushing up
with Stout.

770
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:53,071
Cover till we're behind
the boulders.

771
00:49:53,095 --> 00:49:55,804
Durkin, you and Soto got
rear security.

772
00:49:55,887 --> 00:49:58,261
Remember what I told you about
that path at the riverbed?

773
00:49:58,345 --> 00:50:00,178
Watch out.

774
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:03,136
This is it.
Remember what to do?

775
00:50:04,345 --> 00:50:05,762
Haul ass.

776
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:07,804
Wait till I tell you.

777
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:09,929
- Ready?
- Yeah.

778
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:10,929
Move.

779
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,011
Stay down.

780
00:50:43,929 --> 00:50:45,220
Set.

781
00:50:45,303 --> 00:50:46,428
Okay.

782
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:47,637
Your turn.

783
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,136
Hey, tell me when.

784
00:50:51,512 --> 00:50:52,804
When.

785
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:57,011
Look, they're right there.
Okay?

786
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,679
Go, go.

787
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:17,595
Motherfucker.

788
00:51:24,553 --> 00:51:26,011
Come on.
On the wall.

789
00:51:26,095 --> 00:51:27,387
On the wall.

790
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:31,095
We got him.

791
00:51:36,095 --> 00:51:39,178
Where the fuck are they?

792
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:41,053
Some patient motherfuckers.

793
00:51:41,136 --> 00:51:42,512
Fuck this place.

794
00:51:42,595 --> 00:51:44,303
You ready?

795
00:51:44,387 --> 00:51:46,595
- No.
- Let's move.

796
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,428
Move, move, move!

797
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,512
Now!
Coming in, coming in!

798
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:38,220
Everybody okay?

799
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:40,512
- Yeah.
- Brace for a second attack.

800
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:42,595
Viper zero-two,
troops in contact.

801
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:44,428
I say it again.
Troops in contact.

802
00:52:44,512 --> 00:52:46,432
Viper
zero-two is two mikes out.

803
00:52:46,512 --> 00:52:47,655
I'll give you a ten-second...

804
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:48,821
Negative.
We need close air support.

805
00:52:48,845 --> 00:52:50,595
I repeat, close air support.

806
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:51,905
Roger,...

807
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:53,303
What the fuck is that?
Am I hit?

808
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:54,762
Am I hit?

809
00:52:54,845 --> 00:52:57,679
Shit.

810
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:00,679
Just your CamelBak.

811
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,220
What?

812
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:03,804
It's water.

813
00:53:03,887 --> 00:53:05,762
Ha.
I thought that fucker hit me.

814
00:53:05,845 --> 00:53:08,470
It's water or piss.
It ain't blood.

815
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,404
I thought that motherfucker
hit me.

816
00:53:11,428 --> 00:53:14,220
Hey, get down!

817
00:53:14,303 --> 00:53:16,970
This ain't over.

818
00:53:17,053 --> 00:53:18,804
Where the hell are those
air assets?

819
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:20,136
One minute out.

820
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:31,053
Coming down from Sar Ridge,
where else?

821
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,804
In broad daylight?
Nobody got hit?

822
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:37,095
My pack got hit,
blew my fucking water open.

823
00:53:37,178 --> 00:53:38,553
You pissed yourself?

824
00:53:38,637 --> 00:53:40,136
No, my actual water pack.

825
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,512
He fucking pissed himself.

826
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,720
No, I didn't.

827
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:48,053
One casualty:
water transport apparatus.

828
00:53:48,136 --> 00:53:51,679
Cable Guy, he's like a... he's
like a lucky fucking charm.

829
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,303
Cable Guy.

830
00:53:53,387 --> 00:53:56,345
You're like a frosted
Lucky Charm, man.

831
00:53:57,762 --> 00:53:58,845
You're all right.

832
00:53:58,929 --> 00:54:00,387
Look at his face.

833
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,637
He's still freaked out.

834
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:07,512
You good, pal?

835
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,095
It's working.

836
00:54:15,095 --> 00:54:17,345
Heh.

837
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:50,845
Thank you.

838
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:53,804
Here you go.

839
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,637
Ms. Mathison,
this way, please.

840
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:05,720
The Vice President is
completing another meeting.

841
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:06,946
He will be ready in a moment.

842
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,637
Thank you.

843
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,303
You okay?

844
00:55:15,387 --> 00:55:16,738
Mike told me you were
out late last night.

845
00:55:16,762 --> 00:55:18,679
I'm fine.

846
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,261
You know you're not going
in there with me, right?

847
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:24,929
I'm sure you're smart enough
to realize

848
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:26,387
the Vice President's
not opening up

849
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,178
with some female in the room
he's never met before.

850
00:56:16,011 --> 00:56:17,845
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me.

851
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:19,095
Don't leave me.

852
00:56:19,178 --> 00:56:23,679
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

853
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,887
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

854
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,428
No!
No!

855
00:56:32,512 --> 00:56:35,762
You can't leave me here!
You can't leave me here!

856
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:37,136
No!

857
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,428
Don't go!
Don't go!

857
00:56:41,305 --> 00:57:41,700

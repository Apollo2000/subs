2
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,425
This is Charlie Echo Four.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,968
We are at the crash site.

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,888
Nothing.
No pulse.

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,223
The president's dead.

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,976
All of them.
No survivors.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,979
There was an assassination

8
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,731
ordered by Haissam Haqqani

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,652
carried out by Taliban forces.

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,778
Saul...

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,780
President Warner
is dead.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,657
So is President Daoud.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,092
Their helicopter went down
in the Korengal.

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,911
There were Taliban
in the area.

15
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,788
You think I did it?

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,414
I need to know.

17
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,291
No.

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,876
I did not.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,045
If the Taliban did it,
the Taliban did it.

20
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,964
But if the ISI did it,
I want to know.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,327
If G'ulom did it,
I want to know.

22
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,800
If the pilot
flew the helicopter

23
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,194
into the side
of the fucking mountain

24
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,862
because he thought
Jesus was talking to him,

25
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,646
I want to know that, too,
because it matters.

26
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,725
It fucking matters.
It determines what we do next.

27
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,726
Carrie?

28
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,770
You have to get
the flight recorder.

29
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,147
‐ We're leaving.
‐ No, first get the recorder.

30
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,691
They're gonna
destroy the site?

31
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,151
The vice president
made the call.

32
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,279
What about the black box,
the flight recorder?

33
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,071
Did you tell them
what the mechanic said

34
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,115
about problems
with the airframes?

35
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,618
Carrie, we are out of time.

36
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,079
Max, tell me you have
the black box.

37
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,247
Yes.

38
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,127
Max, tell me
what's happening.

39
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,587
Can you hear me?

40
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,465
Max?

41
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,972

43
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,625
The World Trade Center,
Tower Number One

44
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,235
is on fire!

45
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,488
I missed something
once before. I won't‐‐

46
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,324
I can't let that happen again!

47
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,076
An American prisoner of war
has been turned.

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,370
You're a disgrace
to your nation,

49
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,455
Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

50
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,749
You're a traitor
and a terrorist,

51
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,793
and now it's time
to pay for that.

52
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,004
Are you accusing me
of something?

53
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:09,921
You really do not remember?

54
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,674
Remember what?

55
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,277
We may be dealing with
a compromised officer here.

56
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,637
You had a relationship
complicated enough

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,306
to lie about.

58
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,849
Yeah, it's complicated.

59
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,351
I lost seven months
of my life.

60
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,020
To my Russian handler?

61
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,855
Is our strategy working?

62
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,775
And you will become
the focus of an investigation

63
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,944
that will define
the rest of your life.

64
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,922
That not every
problem in the Middle East

65
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,866
deserves a military solution.

66
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,329
Because this whole country
went stupid crazy after 9/11.

67
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,872
Carrie, you're not yourself.

68
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,291
I'm still putting
the pieces together.

69
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:51,213
Please, God,
tell me you have it.

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,633
Is there no fucking line?

71
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,843
I believe you.

72
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,096
No one else will.

73
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,560
The Cabinet met
early this morning

74
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,688
as soon as word
reached Washington

75
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,898
that President Warner
was confirmed dead

76
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,125
at the site of
a downed helicopter

77
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,652
in Afghanistan's
Korengal Valley.

78
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:18,907
Both houses of Congress met
in an emergency session today.

79
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,991
They declared Wednesday

80
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,911
a national day of mourning
for the President,

81
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,430
and plans for his funeral
have commenced,

82
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,332
though his remains
have not yet returned

83
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,042
to the United States.

84
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,878
None of that has discouraged
the thousands of people

85
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,714
gathered outside
the White House today,

86
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,260
expressing their devastation
over the loss of a man

87
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,179
who was president
for only a few short months

88
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,014
but was a great statesman

89
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,352
and a servant of the American
people for over 40 years.

90
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,910
Speaking Pashto.

91
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,148
Speaking Pashto.

92
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,944
They'll pay you.

93
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,571
Big money.

94
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,198
They'll pay you
big money for me.

95
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,617
Speaking Pashto

96
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,539
speaking Pashto.

97
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,046
Ok‐okay, okay.

98
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,297
Speaking Pashto.

99
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,980
Speaking Pashto

100
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,575
‐
‐

101
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,597
Shouting in Pashto.

102
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,975
Hey! Hey!

103
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,102
I'm here!

104
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,985
I'm here!
I'm here!

105
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,088
Eight seconds to air.

106
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,759
Five, four, three, two...

107
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,807
Good evening.

108
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,560
In the words
of Lyndon Baines Johnson,

109
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,605
"All I have
I would have given gladly

110
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,940
not to be standing
here today."

111
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,610
At 4:52 this afternoon,

112
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,737
Justice Harlan Crawford
swore me in

113
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,823
to the office of President
of the United States.

114
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,700
It is with a grieving heart

115
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,827
that I take
this nation's solemn oath

116
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,204
to preserve, protect,
and defend

117
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,790
the Constitution
of these United States.

118
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,417
Kabul's on the uplink,

119
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,209
and the Joint Chiefs
want to talk to you

120
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,670
about moving around
some hardware.

121
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,130
What does that mean?

122
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,549
Redirecting the Fifth Fleet
into the Arabian Sea.

123
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,651
So they want to surge troops?

124
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,179
N‐no, it's about readiness
for another attack

125
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,973
or if we need to evacuate
the embassy.

126
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,601
You know, they're saying I had
Warner's chopper shot down.

127
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,603
‐ Palace coup.
‐ Who's they?

128
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,397
Fucking Buzzfeed, somebody,
I don't know.

129
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,401
There's gonna be
a lot more of that.

130
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,192
I'd try to tune it all out.

131
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,153
I just pledged
the hand of justice,

132
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,238
Old Testament style,
to the whole damn country.

133
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,300
Now, somebody in there
better come up with something

134
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,159
for me to do and quickly.

135
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,584
Please.

136
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,462
Where's Kabul?

137
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,231
We're having trouble
with the connection, sir.

138
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,716
It's going to be a minute.

139
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,760
Still nothing?

140
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,429
I don't know
what the fucking problem is.

141
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,432
JSOC's stonewalling me.

142
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,309
Any word on Max?

143
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,553
QRF searched both crash sites.
They didn't find a body.

144
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,896
‐ So he's alive.
‐ Let's hope.

145
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,499
How many units
are out looking for him?

146
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,191
We've got drones
in the air,

147
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,484
but it's over 12 hours,

148
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,003
and the search radius
is only getting bigger.

149
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,296
JSOC's still looking,
though, right?

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,321
Not on the ground.

151
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,532
I've got bases,
the embassy,

152
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,950
this place, all targets.

153
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,593
That's got to be
our priority right now.

154
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,161
We're up.

155
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,672
‐ Saul.
‐ We're doing what we can do.

156
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,210
That's bullshit.
I sent him in there.

157
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,295
We both did.

158
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,130
Mr. President,

159
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,716
we apologize
for keeping you waiting.

160
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,683
Mike, do you have a minute?

161
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,102
It'd be really great
if you could look at‐‐.

162
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,107
Tech cleaned up the tape

163
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,584
of Carrie and Yevgeny
at the mosque.

164
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,627
I think you need
to listen to it.

165
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,695
Can't do it.
I'll try and get to you later.

166
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,495
Hey, anything on
Max Piotrowski?

167
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,039
Whole sector's gone quiet.

168
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,433
They shot down
the fucking president.

169
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,500
‐ They're gonna go to ground.
‐ How about Kabul?

170
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,103
Maybe they're referencing him.
He was carrying a‐‐.

171
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,336
A flight recorder, I know.

172
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,088
Uh, we're listening
to hundreds of calls.

173
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,299
We got automated searches
on thousands more.

174
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,926
He's on the list,
but it's a long list.

175
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,803
Can I see the keywords?

176
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,603
Print me a copy.

177
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,775
Hello?

178
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,276
No, I can't even get through.

179
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,778
The secure lines
are overloaded.

180
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,279
I'm‐‐I'm trying.
I‐‐.

181
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,615
This is everything?

182
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,783
Hang on.

183
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,260
The Taliban knows
how to avoid these.

184
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,678
You want to add something,
be my guest.

185
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,412
We got a dozen guys coming
from Fort Meade.

186
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,247
We'll have more ears
on it then.

187
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,042
Sorry, uh, Bagram SIGINT's
not calling me back.

188
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,561
Is there anybody
you can try in Kandahar?

189
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,745
We put together a
timeline of everything we know

190
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,196
once the president landed
at Bagram.

191
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,466
It's incomplete,
but it's a start.

192
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,510
Alan Yager, Vanessa Kroll, FBI.

193
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,886
‐ Hi, Alan.
‐ Alan's my Deputy.

194
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,697
Chief of Station‐‐
he'll get your team set up.

195
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,139
Great, Ray Auerbach,
Marshall Carter

196
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,141
are the legats
from Islamabad and Abu Dhabi.

197
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,101
The three of us
will need doors that close.

198
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,645
Follow me, folks.

199
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,955
You can drop
your stuff in here,

200
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,582
and then we'll get you set up
on secure comms.

201
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,001
How much of your staff
is out in the field right now?

202
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,568
About half,
pumping sources.

203
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,196
Okay, well, uh, I don't want
to gum up the works,

204
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,157
but until we know otherwise,
this station is a crime scene.

205
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,659
What's the working theory?

206
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,328
Somebody told the Taliban
where to stand with an RPG.

207
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,411
You've got the highest
concentration in the country

208
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,874
of people that knew
the President was in the air.

209
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,459
I need statements
from everybody

210
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,479
and access to all communication
in and out of here

211
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,380
in the last 72 hours.

212
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,715
Put out an RTB.
Everybody back to base.

213
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,717
- ‐ You got it.
- ‐ Thanks.

214
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,752
What about the embassy,
even just nonessentials?

215
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,462
We start evacuating
nonessentials,

216
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,840
we turn a panic
into full‐on hysteria.

217
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,551
Saul, President G'ulom's
office called.

218
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,845
He wants to talk to you
as soon as possible.

219
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,182
‐ Put him through.
‐ In person.

220
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,576
Your security detail doesn't
want you leaving the building.

221
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,061
‐ He was insistent.
‐ Oh, fuck.

222
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,374
Yeah, I need an armed convoy

223
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,065
for the National
Security Advisor.

224
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:31,983
Do we know
where Haqqani is?

225
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,735
Did he even make it
out of the city?

226
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,986
No idea.

227
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,770
I want a favor.

228
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,646
Apparently I earned it.

229
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,025
Okay.

230
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,902
This isn't the beginning
of an arrangement

231
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,697
or whatever the fuck you think
you're laying groundwork for.

232
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,827
One of our people went missing
near the crash site.

233
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,788
You had a lot of casualties.

234
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,874
I'm not surprised
you didn't recover one or two.

235
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,252
I think he's still alive,
and he's a friend of mine.

236
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,420
Ah.

237
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,380
I'm sorry to hear that.

238
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,049
I'm worried
the Taliban has him.

239
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,345
If they do, he's only alive
if they want to trade him back

240
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,555
or sell him.

241
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,432
Can you find out?

242
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,726
Our network in that part
of the Korengal is‐‐

243
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,479
it's pretty thin.

244
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,458
You don't have to be cute
about it.

245
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,242
I know you bought a lot
of goodwill up there.

246
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,693
No, no, I‐I do want to help,
but...

247
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,487
What?

248
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,825
You have a surveillance blanket
on that area.

249
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,284
The moment I talk to anybody,

250
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,703
the man's gonna get
a Hellfire missile on his head

251
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,164
in a matter of seconds.

252
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,290
Can you disable it?

253
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,001
I mean, I just need long enough
to make a phone call.

254
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,628
You want me to take down
our monitoring

255
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,171
in the sector
where two presidents

256
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,923
were just shot out of the sky?

257
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,302
No.

258
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,847
Well, then I can't help you.

259
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,725
We have troops on the ground.

260
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,435
I can't give you
and the Taliban

261
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,062
a free pass in a hot zone.

262
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,399
It's not a hot zone anymore.

263
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,986
Look, all I'm asking for
is two minutes.

264
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,989
I trust you
to protect my sources.

265
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,283
You have to trust me
not to take advantage.

266
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,535
Let's not push it
on the trust front, okay?

267
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,996
You're an enemy officer,
and you're asking me

268
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,832
to sabotage an American
intelligence capability.

269
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,293
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

270
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,752
You came to me.

271
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,967
Can't fucking be‐‐.

272
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,072
Two minutes is all you need?

273
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,784
Three o'clock this afternoon.

274
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,788
Two minutes.
Does that work?

275
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,960
This is not the time
to lie to me.

276
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,504
Honestly, I have no idea
where he is.

277
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,506
He is in your embassy,

278
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,927
and you will turn him over
immediately.

279
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,179
Yesterday he was
in a CIA safe house.

280
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,223
He left.

281
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,516
We haven't
heard from him since.

282
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,267
No one followed him?

283
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,562
‐ No tracking device?
‐ No.

284
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,439
The man who assassinated
your president,

285
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,107
you let him go.

286
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,277
Haissam Haqqani came to Kabul
at great personal risk

287
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,695
in the name of peace

288
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,881
to meet with the President
of the United States.

289
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:15,576
Haissam Haqqani
came to Kabul

290
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,038
to deceive one man, you.

291
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,414
You believed him

292
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,642
and brought your president
across the seas.

293
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,126
It was not Haqqani.

294
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,087
- ‐ And you know?
- ‐ Yes.

295
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,839
Hmm.
How?

296
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,009
Because he looked you
in the eyes?

297
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,096
People change, they evolve.

298
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,348
Do they?

299
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,226
I wonder what
General Ryan thinks.

300
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,146
Do people like
Haissam Haqqani change?

301
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,023
Yes, sir, I believe they do.

302
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,443
Do you know the sound
a woman makes

303
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,239
when her hand is removed
from her arm with a hacksaw?

304
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,034
It can be heard
even over the cheers

305
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,496
of 5,000 Taliban.

306
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,707
Mr. President,
no one wants to see

307
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,001
the Taliban return to power.

308
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,169
But no one wants to see
the kind of lawlessness

309
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,589
you presided over
in the '90s either.

310
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:13,175
I reject the comparison.

311
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,429
You just declared martial law

312
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,515
and rounded up 300 insurgents
in a soccer stadium.

313
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,894
To prevent them
from attacking my country.

314
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,521
Please.

315
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,356
You've wanted absolute power
for 40 years.

316
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,316
Now you have it.

317
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,985
‐ Frankly, it makes me wonder.
‐ What?

318
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,905
Maybe you had
the presidents killed.

319
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,623
You'll see yourselves out.

320
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,239
Carrie.

321
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,199
FBI's doing
preliminary interviews

322
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,760
with senior people
from the country team.

323
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,745
You should head in.

324
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,830
Mike's office.

325
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,300
Hi.

326
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,469
Oh. Hi.

327
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,388
Come on in.
I'm Vanessa Kroll.

328
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,615
- ‐ Carrie Mathison.
- ‐

329
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,474
Mathison, yeah.
Have a seat.

330
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,771
Mathison, special envoy.
What's that mean?

331
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,690
Saul Berenson
brought me in a few days ago

332
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,734
as a‐a sort of advisor
in the peace talks.

333
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,986
I worked with a lot of
the parties a few years back.

334
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,530
You arrived in Kabul on...

335
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,157
Uh, the third.

336
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,078
When did you find out
the President was arriving?

337
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,579
Yesterday...

338
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,248
A couple hours
before he landed.

339
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,709
The National Security Advisor
had a detail

340
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,210
bring me over to Bagram.

341
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,854
President Warner
wanted to speak with me,

342
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,255
but I didn't know
what was going on

343
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,589
until I was in the hangar.

344
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,692
Why'd the President
want to speak with you?

345
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,176
Um...

346
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,970
Well, I was involved
in sketching out

347
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,764
some of the administration's
Afghanistan policy.

348
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,141
Mm...

349
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,017
he was thanking me,

350
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,520
which was premature.

351
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,147
Which part of the policy?

352
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,940
Um, getting out,

353
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,942
ending the war.

354
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,737
You know anyone around here
who didn't support it?

355
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,780
The peace deal?
Well, a lot of people.

356
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,784
But in this station,
n‐not really.

357
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,830
Hmm.

358
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,516
If you think of anything,
here's my email.

359
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,958
Thank you.

360
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,835
Okay, that's‐‐that's all?

361
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,045
Yeah, I'm just getting
the lay of the land.

362
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,758
Safe to say this won't be
the last time I talk with you.

363
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,149
You were trying
to hang yourself

364
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,485
with a rope
made from your bedsheets.

365
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:21,864
I hadn't seen you in months.
I got there...

366
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,073
by pure luck.

367
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,743
If I was there a minute later,
just a minute later,

368
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,745
you would've been gone,
and after that,

369
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,580
I managed to get you
back on your meds

370
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,207
for a couple of weeks.

371
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,335
There was a birch forest
right near the hospital.

372
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,085
You really liked
walking there.

373
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,755
‐
‐ It's true.

374
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,299
Turns out,
we had a lot to talk about.

375
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,675
Really?
Like what?

376
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,010
Like your
relationship

377
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,571
‐ with Nicholas Brody.
‐ Tell me something

378
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,764
you didn't just read
in my file.

379
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,974
You had
a daughter with him...

380
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,726
Franny.

381
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,855
You slipped her head
underwater in the bath.

382
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,691
There was a moment
when you actually considered

383
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,860
drowning your own child.

384
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,780
- ‐ Fucking Christ.
- ‐ Yeah.

385
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,664
Did you read
the contact report?

386
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,707
It's, uh, not quite the same.

387
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,793
It's a total fabrication.

388
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,006
Timing's not great.

389
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,759
I didn't want to mention it
with all this going on, but...

390
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,928
I just knew
you needed to see it.

391
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,513
Yeah.

392
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,182
I mean, I understand
why she lied about it.

393
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,517
She wants back in the agency.

394
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,786
She can't get
security clearance

395
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,061
if that's on the record.

396
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,188
That's for damn sure.

397
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,023
Maybe he's lying.

398
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,445
Jenna, it was Carrie's idea
for the President to come here.

399
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,573
‐ She pitched the visit.
‐ When?

400
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,908
Ninety minutes
after this conversation.

401
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,956
She was in the SCIF when
Saul laid out the peace plan.

402
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,834
She told Warner the best way to
sell it to the American people

403
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,504
would be here, in Afghanistan,
in front of combat troops.

404
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,174
Okay.

405
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,302
But t‐that doesn't mean...

406
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,805
I have an FBI team
working out of my office.

407
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,975
I can't neglect to mention it.

408
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,983
I got to give it some thought.

409
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,989
Do me a favor‐‐don't let her
out of your sight.

410
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,751
Speaking Dari

411
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,301
speaking Pashto.

412
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,509
What kind of numbers
are we talking about?

413
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,761
Just shy of 300
in the stadium right now.

414
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,304
He massacres 300 Taliban

415
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,074
who came out of the mountains
for a ceasefire,

416
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,934
we're gonna be looking at
an insurgency on steroids.

417
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,978
Which means what exactly?

418
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,205
Suicide bombs,
kidnappings,

419
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,898
attacks on every military
instillation in country,

420
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,483
Afghan and American.

421
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,669
And we don't have
the troop force for that.

422
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,736
If G'ulom lights
this thing on fire,

423
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,199
I don't know if I can secure
the embassy and the bases,

424
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,868
never mind prop up
his government.

425
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,286
Well, can we turn over
Haqqani?

426
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,621
Can we just do that?

427
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,084
Sir, we do not have him.

428
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,502
Why the fuck
did somebody tell me

429
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,254
he was in a CIA safe house?

430
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,731
Mr. President, we'd
like you to get on the phone

431
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,259
with G'ulom
and draw a clear red line.

432
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,802
He needs to understand,

433
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,888
if there are executions
in that stadium,

434
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,932
American aid to his government
will immediately cease.

435
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,106
Listen, is it possible

436
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,150
this is a lot of hot air?

437
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,193
I mean, he could be
bluffing, right?

438
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,196
No, sir, no, sir,
this is how he does business.

439
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,490
He'd kill 300 men in a stadium
without a flinch.

440
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,825
Oh, that's great.

441
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,995
Folks, let's talk through

442
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,456
how the President
can broach this.

443
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,921
I would start
by reminding G'ulom

444
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,632
that his country
has a new constitution

445
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,384
and that it enshrines rights
like due process,

446
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,094
even for the Taliban.

447
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,679
They have a judiciary.

448
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,431
They have a framework
for civil society.

449
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,142
None of that can be ignored,
even in the face of a crisis.

450
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:47,768
Especially in the face
of a crisis.

451
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,561
That's why it's there.

452
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,897
It's for your enemies,
not your friends.

453
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,322
All right,
get him on the phone.

454
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,700
Uh, we'll touch base
after the call.

455
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,619
Thank you, Mr. President.

456
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,919
President G'ulom in Kabul
for the President, please.

457
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,629
Thank you.

458
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,839
Say his name.

459
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,633
‐ G'ulom?
‐ Yeah.

460
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,718
G'ulom.
Abdul G'ulom.

461
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,637
"Goo‐LOM."

462
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,846
"GOO‐lom."

463
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,473
"GOO‐lom."
Is that right?

464
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,393
‐
‐ Fuck me.

465
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,561
Yes, thank you.

466
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,110
- ‐ Mr. President.
- ‐ Mr. President.

467
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,529
"Congratulations" is not
the right word

468
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,031
for this place
we find ourselves.

469
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,283
No, it's not...
sadly.

470
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,285
May God be at your side.

471
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,955
And yours, sir.
Amen.

472
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,669
I'm told you've got
a lot of Taliban fighters

473
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,170
in your soccer stadium.

474
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,214
That's correct.

475
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,341
Mr. President,
I need you to understand

476
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,636
those men need to stay alive.

477
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,848
Now, I want Haissam Haqqani
in custody as much as you do,

478
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,891
but you've got
a judicial system

479
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,077
that you've just
put on its feet.

480
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,271
Even Taliban prisoners
need to go through something

481
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,732
that looks like due process.

482
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,275
Of course.

483
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,195
I am the president
of a nation bound by law.

484
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,406
Civil society.

485
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,324
Yes.

486
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,201
You start executing
men in a stadium,

487
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,965
you could be setting off
a wave of violence

488
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,330
that'll destabilize
your whole country.

489
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:36,626
I am afraid that part
is not correct.

490
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,297
Well, I think
you're going to see

491
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,175
suicide bombings
and attacks.

492
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,636
The spike in violence
has already occurred,

493
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,972
when you drew down
your troops,

494
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:52,392
and again when you began
peace talks.

495
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,938
That's unfortunate.

496
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,607
To this enemy,

497
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,484
appeasement is a sign
of weakness,

498
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,778
and it is met
with aggression.

499
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,491
They murdered the leader
of the free world.

500
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,743
It is the victory
of a lifetime.

501
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,745
Can you imagine
the consequences

502
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,624
if our answer
is due process?

503
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,961
Yeah, no.

504
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:25,425
We must respond in a language
they understand.

505
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,511
A band of criminals

506
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,597
is holding our
countries hostage,

507
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,974
and we have an opportunity
to crush them

508
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,268
once and for all.

509
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,063
We must have the strength
to do it.

510
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,400
What exactly
would that look like?

511
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,158
Hi.

512
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,827
You need something?

513
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,537
No.
Sorry.

514
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,206
My first week in town,
this was my room.

515
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,374
I still wind up here
when I'm not thinking.

516
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,918
Sorry.

517
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,761
Fuck.

518
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,752
Hey.
Can I get a hard copy

519
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,715
of whatever we're recording
that might reference

520
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,172
Max Piotrowski,
the missing guy?

521
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,674
There haven't been any pings.

522
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,026
Yeah, because like I mentioned,
they dodge the keywords.

523
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,511
I want to read what
they're actually saying,

524
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,596
see if I can piece
anything together.

525
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,139
If he's alive,
he's a big get.

526
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,766
Somebody is talking about it.

527
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,410
You know that's
gonna be hundreds of pages.

528
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,620
You don't have to read it,
Lonnie.

529
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,521
You just have to hit "print."

530
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,397
I don't have time
for this conversation.

531
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,983
Do you?

532
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,631
Lonnie, it jammed.

533
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,300
God damn it.

534
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,635
Did you do something?

535
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,679
Well, it jammed, and then
I tried to take it out.

536
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,723
Yeah, that doesn't help.

537
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,266
How's it going?

538
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:43,850
How do you think it's going?

539
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,603
Sorry.
Can I help?

540
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,063
I got it.

541
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,987
‐
‐ What did you do?

542
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,239
I don't know, it said,
"restart, question mark."

543
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,409
Just don't touch anything.

544
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,087
Okay.

545
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,316
Okay.

546
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,610
Hey.

547
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,947
‐ Carrie shook me.
‐ What do you mean?

548
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,466
She knew I was on her,
and she ditched me,

549
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,117
clear as day.

550
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:47,706
How long was she
out of your sight?

551
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,084
About 15 minutes.

552
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,586
Write everything up,
detailed.

553
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,553
G'ulom told him it'll be
the first defining moment

554
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,931
of his presidency,
and Hayes lit up.

555
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,659
Does he understand
that slaughtering

556
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,060
300 unarmed men
is a war crime?

557
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,454
Scott, the war
crime's not the half of it.

558
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,441
We just lost control
of the whole policy.

559
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,901
Hayes reversed course
based on the counsel

560
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,821
of Abdul fucking G'ulom.

561
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,199
I'm worried the guy's about
to order 100,000 troops

562
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,618
back into the Afghan theater.

563
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,290
Two days ago,
we were ending this war.

564
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,918
Two days was a long time ago.

565
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,856
We'll see what we can do
on this end.

566
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,133
Yeah.

567
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,141
Saul, you got a minute?

568
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,688
Mind if we stretch our legs?

569
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,774
Sure.

570
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,323
Yevgeny Gromov is in Kabul.

571
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,866
Did Carrie tell you that?

572
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,493
She did.

573
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,453
And that she's seen him?

574
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,830
They ran into each other
at the Ministry of Defense,

575
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,792
and he gave her a tip
that helped leverage G'ulom.

576
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,003
They saw each other again.
Did she mention that?

577
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,547
No.

578
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,299
She asked
if she could go after him.

579
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,175
I said absolutely not.

580
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:26,095
Apparently
he reached out again.

581
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,972
She came to me,
and it seemed like

582
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,267
something we shouldn't ignore,
so I authorized a meeting.

583
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,645
Okay.

584
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,857
I recorded it,
which she doesn't know.

585
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,943
Her contact report
is very different

586
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,820
from the actual conversation.

587
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,489
That's not unheard of
in a contact report.

588
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,699
It's a complete fabrication,

589
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,994
as is her account
to me after.

590
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,413
I'm gonna have to let
the FBI know.

591
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,541
Let 'em know what exactly?

592
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,544
That she's lying about
the nature of her relationship

593
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,170
with Yevgeny Gromov

594
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,172
and may have unwittingly
helped him assassinate

595
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,132
the President
of the United States.

596
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,055
I need to hear the tape.

597
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,890
May I?

598
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,975
Sure.

599
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,738
Please...
characterize for me

600
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,532
your current relationship
with Yevgeny Gromov.

601
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,618
Is this coming from Mike?

602
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,786
Answer the question.

603
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,665
He reached out.

604
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,249
It seemed irresponsible

605
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,127
not to find out
what was on his mind.

606
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,672
Even though I ordered you
to stay away?

607
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,633
Even though.

608
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,344
I didn't strap
the guy to a chair.

609
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,638
We had‐‐we had a conversation.

610
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,515
About?

611
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,850
Well, he has some issues

612
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,769
with his current employer.

613
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,413
So you're what,
bringing him in from the cold?

614
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:25,358
I'm laying
the groundwork, yeah.

615
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,944
Mike recorded the meeting.

616
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,029
So he knows
you're lying to him.

617
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,243
And now you're lying to me.

618
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,293
You heard it?

619
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,379
Yes.

620
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,382
All of it?

621
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,193
It's my fault.

622
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,530
I put you in a terrible
position bringing you here.

623
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,118
And I'm sorry about that.

624
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,873
But I need to send you
back to Germany tonight.

625
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,207
Come on.

626
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,502
The doctors said you weren't
ready, and they were right.

627
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,588
Can we ju‐‐for a second

628
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,215
not talk about me
like I'm a child?

629
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,556
Fine.

630
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,769
You lied about your interaction
with Yevgeny Gromov.

631
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,562
Let's start there.

632
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,981
You had a relationship
complicated enough

633
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,192
to lie about.

634
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,820
Also, he saved your life.

635
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:58,367
You don't think you carry
some sense of obligation?

636
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,412
I get that there are risks.

637
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,916
You couldn't possibly.

638
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,835
You told him things
you never told me.

639
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,756
You told him you think
you've been a danger to Franny.

640
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,093
Is that true?

641
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,807
Because, my God,
if it is...

642
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,142
you are vulnerable
to him in ways

643
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,394
neither of us can imagine.

644
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,951
I'm still putting
the pieces together, you know?

645
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,869
I'm not trying
to be evasive.

646
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,372
I don't remember everything.

647
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:49,210
Which is why you've been
in a recovery facility

648
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,838
and why you are going back.

649
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,382
No.

650
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,801
Max is still out there.

651
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,724
You understand what'll happen
if you stay here?

652
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,263
I just talked Mike Dunne

653
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,140
out of sharing all of this
with the FBI.

654
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,016
Jesus Christ,
there's nothing to tell.

655
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,352
Let him talk.

656
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,813
You told President Warner
he should come to Afghanistan.

657
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,275
I didn't know Warner
was gonna take me up on it.

658
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,110
I had no idea until
I showed up at Bagram

659
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,754
and Air Force One
was on the fucking tarmac.

660
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,904
There was a full hour

661
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,423
between then and the
helicopters going down‐‐

662
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,992
enough time
to make a phone call.

663
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,702
To my Russian handler?

664
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,036
Who informs the Taliban.

665
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,456
Then an RPG hits the President
of the United States.

666
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,837
Do you believe that?

667
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,547
No.

668
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,049
But the FBI
most certainly will.

669
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,888
And you will become
the focus of an investigation

670
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:46,475
that will define
the rest of your life.

671
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,106
I don't care.

672
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,942
I'm not leaving Max.

673
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,360
I won't.

674
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,571
You think you're the only one
who gives a shit?

675
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,740
Max is on everyone's mind.

676
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,117
We will do everything
we can to find him.

677
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,911
Okay, well, that means
keeping me here,

678
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,370
because Yevgeny
has a lead on him.

679
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,164
He just sent word.

680
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,666
I reached out
to him this morning.

681
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,922
Everyone in the station

682
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,757
was told to shake
their contacts for intel.

683
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,342
That is what I did.

684
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,259
The Russians have relationships

685
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,303
with Taliban commanders
on the border.

686
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,721
Tell me you didn't.

687
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,558
He says he has a lead.

688
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,019
Can I call him back, please?

689
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,246
Carrie, think for a minute‐‐
what would you do

690
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,539
if you were
trying to recruit him

691
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,323
‐ and he came to you desperate?
‐ No. That‐‐.

692
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,733
You would do exactly this.

693
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,403
You would tell him exactly
what he wanted to hear.

694
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,508
So you are gonna
blow off this lead?

695
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,745
I will have the CIA
pursue it.

696
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,258
In 30 minutes, you will be
escorted to a plane.

697
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,263
You will go willingly
or in handcuffs.

698
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,890
Rehab center's expecting you.

699
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,601
I told them
your work here is done

700
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,312
and they should
take their time.

701
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,357
Okay.

702
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,788
You gonna keep me company?

703
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,415
Yeah.

704
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,755
Hostile! Hostile!

705
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,091
Get your hands up!
Do not move!

706
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,300
Down on the ground!

707
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,427
Haissam fucking Haqqani
at the west gate.

708
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,262
Stay where you are!

709
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,074
Make sure we
got this area clear.

710
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:15,184
We have a high‐value asset
inside the key.

711
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,018
- ‐ Get on the ground!
- ‐ Corporal!

712
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:19,814
Get over there!
Check for vest!

713
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,607
Do not move!

714
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,778
Let him up.

715
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,071
Mr. Berenson,
please stay back.

716
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,507
Hostile, sir.
I need you to stay back.

717
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,366
‐ I said "let him up."
‐.

718
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,352
When I lost you,

719
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,522
I was in the Machine Room
with Lonnie.

720
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,417
I wanted to see if I could find
anything on Max.

721
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,377
I didn't want Mike to know
I was bogarting his people

722
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,111
in the middle of all this.

723
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,532
Yeah.

724
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,783
Max is out there.

725
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:17,204
And the flight recorder
is out there.

726
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,707
I printed out everything
from the last couple of days.

727
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,877
It's a mountain of paper.
It's on my desk.

728
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,880
Somebody should look at it.

729
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,064
Speaking Pashto

730
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,046
‐
‐ You okay?

731
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,255
Yes?

732
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,798
No.

733
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,384
Speaking Pashto.

734
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,269
Where's the backpack?

735
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,022
My bag.

736
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,815
Where is it?

737
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:30,069
Speaking Pashto.

738
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,196
No more bag.

739
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,614
Well, I need it back.

740
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,032
Gone.

741
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,742
No.

742
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,077
Where is it?

743
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,038
Where is it?

744
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,998
You have to get it back.

745
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,792
I need it back.

746
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,614
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

747
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,617
Flight 641 to Dubai,
continuing to Berlin,

748
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,762
will begin boarding rows
one through 14 at gate three.

749
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,787
Good luck.

750
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,955
Thanks.

751
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,164
You too.

752
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,876
Ticket, please.

753
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,131
‐

754

Ticket, please.

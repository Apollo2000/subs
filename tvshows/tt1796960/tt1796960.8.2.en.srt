<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,176
You were detained in Russia
for 213 days?

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,886
Yes.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,181
And did they tell you
you failed your polygraph?

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:14,723
"Deception indicated."

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,645
My memory
doesn't distinguish

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,022
between what was real
and what wasn't.

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,690
You get that, right?

9
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,734
I want you to know

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,404
I am in charge
of these prisoners,

11
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:33,534
and I will never agree
to their release.

12
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,079
Your old friend,
Abdul Qadir G'ulom,

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,747
just fired a broadside
into the peace talks.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,250
Yeah, I saw that.

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,252
I need him
to publicly walk back

16
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,503
his comments about the POWs.

17
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,215
I'm here because I need Carrie
in Kabul for a week or two.

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,176
We're making progress here.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,428
Put her in a war zone, we could
be back to square one

20
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,097
It's an important mission.
I'm okay with a setback.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,891
We may be dealing with a
compromised officer here.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,772
Is Roshan here?

23
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,945
They killed him,
the Taliban, because of you.

24
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,531
Is it... is it possible he had
another American contact?

25
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,950
Only you.

26
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,910
I don't... I...

27
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,956
I-I wasn't even in Afghanistan.
I was in prison.

28
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,874
Piotrowski's doing
hardware maintenance.

29
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,419
We're gonna provide support
so he can repair or replace.

The vice president
is completing another meeting.

35
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,478
He will be ready
in a moment.

What's going on?

00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,444
Nothing.

Vice president can see you now.

75
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,638
Carrie Mathison.

76
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,807
General.

77
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,476
Four years since you left,

78
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,605
everything is
crazier than ever here.

79
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,981
Please.

80
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,825
Tell me about the Russians,

81
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:48,079
the ones who were just here
who you paraded in front of me.

82
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,039
Businessmen.

83
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,415
No, no, Abdul.

84
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,708
They were not businessmen.

85
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,752
They were
intelligence officers, GRU.

86
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,296
- If you say so...
- I do.

87
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,216
Well, maybe you are right.

88
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,177
Maybe they are worried
that this peace

89
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,887
you think
you are negotiating

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,515
will turn to shit,

91
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,683
like in Syria.

92
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,185
Maybe they think

93
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,063
that shit will ooze

94
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,815
across the border

95
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,108
into Tajikistan

96
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,194
and Uzbekistan,

97
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,197
maybe all the way
to Moscow.

98
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,448
That's what they think,

99
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,116
or that's what
you're telling them?

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,536
That's what will happen

101
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,038
if the Americans leave.

102
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,629
I know why Saul
sent you here...

103
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,714
to convince me to release

104
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,843
1,000 Taliban prisoners

105
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,012
onto my streets...

106
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,975
so that he can have
his agreement.

107
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,353
Well, go ahead.

108
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,106
Convince me.

109
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,695
General, those people
you're talking about

110
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,237
are prisoners of war.

111
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
They are terrorists.

112
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,075
When the war ends,
they'll have to be released.

113
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,494
You know that.

114
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,705
The peace is happening.

115
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,415
Even Saul
doesn't believe this.

116
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,918
He does.
That's why he brought me here...

117
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,628
to make sure you understand

118
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,462
and to make sure
you understand

119
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,425
we need unity now
about everything.

120
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,594
We're partners.

121
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,262
Are we?

122
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,930
You know we are,

123
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,473
and we have been for years,

124
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,934
not just our countries...
you and I.

125
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,899
Someone leaked you information
from the peace talks.

126
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,692
You used that information
to undermine

127
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,484
our position on the peace...

128
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,904
also, your government's
position.

129
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,322
What you said on TV,

130
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,157
that you would never release
the prisoners...

131
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,742
you have to walk it back.

132
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,869
- Really?
- Yes.

133
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,162
Or what?

134
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,001
Or what?

135
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,879
Tell me, partner.

136
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,304
The Carrie Mathison
I knew...

137
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,015
would never come
in here...

138
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,810
making demands...

139
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,979
not without a gift

140
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,774
or a gun to the head.

141
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,696

142
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,383

Carrie.

153
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,383
<i>How'd it go?</i>

154
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,468
Not well.

155
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,011
But you saw him?

156
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,554
Yeah, and you know
who else I saw talking

157
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,931
to our vice president friend
right before me?

158
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,600
Yevgeny fucking Gromov.

159
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,935
Yevgeny?
You sure?

160
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,562
Am I sure?

161
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,272
I mean, did you see him
with your own eyes?

162
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,274
I just said he was talking
to G'ulom right before me.

163
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,109
He came out of the office
with his GRU friends.

164
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,153
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.
He walked right by.</i>

165
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,947
Did you know he was here?

166
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,074
Of course not.

167
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,077
I want to roll him up.

168
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,788
<i>Saul?</i>

169
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,663
You can't.

170
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,664
The fuck I can't.

171
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,416
I want to strap him to a chair.

172
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,793
I'm telling you, you can't.
You can't touch him.

173
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,628
You can't touch anybody.

174
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,213
Everything that happened
in Russia, it's all off-limits.

175
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,756
It's part of the deal.

176
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,174
What deal?

177
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>Deal that got you
released.</i>

178
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,470
<i>It's the only way
I could get you home, okay?</i>

179
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,888
<i>Carrie?</i>

180
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,306
<i>Listen to me.</i>

181
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,058
<i>Forget Yevgeny.</i>

182
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,436
What I need you to do now
is get G'ulom on our side.

183
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,979
Fine.

184
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:05,647
Carrie...

185
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,482
I said fine.
I'm on it.

186
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,987
Sir.

187
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,155
Sir.

188
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,532
Yeah.
What is it?

189
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,201
Max Piotrowski picked up
an intercept

190
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
at the command outpost.

191
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,954
He says it's Haqqani.

192
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,373
Got a secure call
on the SCIF.

193
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,672
What do you got, Max?

194
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,549
<i>We placed our equipment</i>

195
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,592
on the ridgeline just west
of Shingaz Ghar last night.

196
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,593
It went live just after dawn.

197
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,471
You picked up
all these calls today?

198
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,431
Yeah.
Well, the machine did.

199
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,559
Six hundred conversations
in seven hours.

200
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,853
<i>Mostly what people
were having for lunch.</i>

201
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,146
<i>Then this came in.</i>

202
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,190
Play 537.

203
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,115
What are we listening to?

204
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,533
You should have transcripts.

205
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,329
- We're sure this is Haqqani?
- <i>Pretty much.</i>

206
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,582
We have voice samples
going back three decades

207
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,750
to when he was training
with the 82nd Airborne.

208
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,461
And who's the other guy?

209
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,089
No voice match on him.
We don't know.

210
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,008
Mm, another Taliban commander,
obviously.

211
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,260
They're talking about the raid
on Sang-E-Masha.

212
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,930
Which his son led.

213
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,099
Jalal.

214
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,684
You think that's who it is?

215
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,772
Who else could get away

216
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,691
with talking to Haqqani
like this?

217
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,235
Well done, Max.

218
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:34,736
- Sure.
- <i>Really.</i>

219
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,738
Keep us posted.

220
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,203
All right, let's go, boys.

221
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,204
See you later, Maxie.

222
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,080
It's Max. Hey, don't do that.
Hey, look...

223
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,584
- Okay, look, um... okay, um...
- See you later, Maxie.

224
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,961
Look, I-I really don't like
people touching me.

225
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,171
Good luck, man.

226
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,500
How do I find out
where this came from?

227
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,880
"We don't want the war to stop.
We're winning."

228
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,299
That's his son.
Haqqani...

229
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,676
"We've been telling ourselves
that for 18 years,

230
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,637
that we're winning,
we're winning,

231
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,473
but we never do.

232
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,601
I don't want you to be having
this same conversation

233
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,728
in another 18 years."

234
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,689
That's the head
of the Taliban talking

235
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,775
right there in black and white,

236
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,278
saying, "Enough of war."

237
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:02,323
We've been saying peace
is possible like a mantra,

238
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,742
but now we have this,

239
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,869
and we know...

240
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,955
it may actually be possible.

241
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,503
Haqqani's not an obstacle.
He's ready.

242
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,589
We don't need to beg Pakistan
to bring him to the table.

243
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,509
He'll come on his own if we
approach him the right way.

244
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,725
The Guantanamo prisoners
we got released

245
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,686
to keep the Taliban delegation
from leaving...

246
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,522
one of them
was Haqqani's cousin, right?

247
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,107
Second cousin.

248
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,945
And they're arriving tonight.

249
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,406
What's this?

250
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,034
Car bomb.

251
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,910
Happened
a year and a half ago.

252
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,788
Young man blown to bits.
His wife watches it happen.

253
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,166
Newlyweds.
It was all over the local news.

254
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,792
The wife's name
was Samira Noori.

255
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,794
She was part
of a corruption probe

256
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,837
launched by our government.

257
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,214
The investigation
took this turn

258
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,090
toward our good friend,
Abdul G'ulom...

259
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,134
- Right, I remember.
- At which point,

260
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,719
everyone working on it
was fired.

261
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,888
The auditors
literally disappeared.

262
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,349
No one would say what happened
except Samira.

263
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,060
She calls out G'ulom publicly,

264
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:12,977
demands the probe
be reopened.

265
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,438
A few days later...

266
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,981
- Her husband dies.
- Yeah.

267
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,776
But the bomb was
almost certainly meant for her.

268
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,070
Well, how'd you get
onto her, anyway?

269
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,073
Anonymous tip,
waiting for me when I got back

270
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,199
from my meeting with G'ulom.

271
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,366
Well, that's convenient.

272
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,117
G'ulom's got a million enemies.

273
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,660
It could've been any one
of them,

274
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,120
someone in his office, even.

275
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,538
It could be a setup.

276
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,207
Look, I need leverage
on G'ulom.

277
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,167
That's what Saul
brought me here to find,

278
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,460
and right now
I've got nothing.

279
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,588
G'ulom basically laughed me
out of his office this morning,

280
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,508
which is why I want to stand up
an operation...

281
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,594
- Shit.
- For your approval.

282
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,554
Samira hasn't managed
to find a job

283
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,598
since her husband died...
she's looking, though.

284
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,141
Her résumé's online

285
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,102
at three recruiting sites
here in Kabul.

286
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,520
The idea is to bring her in
for a job interview...

287
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,272
not here, obviously.

288
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,565
So you want to talk to her.

289
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,735
No, I want someone else to,
and while they're doing that,

290
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,444
I want to take a look
through her apartment.

291
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,613
She's a fighter.

292
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,198
She lost her husband
over this.

293
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,075
My bet is
there'll be something there.

294
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,873
Let Jenna Bragg run
the interview.

295
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,667
She set up a phony NGO

296
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,751
that would work perfectly
for this...

297
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,170
medical clinics or something.

298
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,089
Didn't you say she was stuck
in the starting gate?

299
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,299
So now she gets out.
Win-win.

300
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,669
What's going on?

301
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,880
Apparently one had
a health issue.

302
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,673
They had to take
a physician

303
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,467
on board when they stopped
to refuel in Croughton.

304
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,976
Where's Saul?
I thought he'd want to be here.

305
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,353
He had to go to D. C.
to make this happen.

306
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,093
This it?
The Saba Project?

307
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,553
Means "the future" in Pashto.

308
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,097
I set it up a while ago,
never used it.

309
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,936
You know not to push it,
right... the interview?

310
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,063
- Yeah.
- You're not looking for intel.

311
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,564
- You're just...
- Stalling for time.

312
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,232
Right.

313
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,317
Making small talk, I know.

314
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,198
Did Mike say I was a fuck-up
or something?

315
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,076
No, actually, he asked me
to bring you on board.

316
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,578
Oh, so you're the one
with the reservations.

317
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,790
No, not really.
Should I be?

318
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,256
It's her. She's available
for an interview tomorrow.

319
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,261
So?

320
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,054
If you want someone who's glad
to finally be doing something,

321
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,807
I think you could do
a lot worse than me.

322
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,435
All right, make it afternoon.

323
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,270
You don't want
to look too eager.

324
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,356
Say you can squeeze her in
at 2:15.

325
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,543
Easy.

326
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,028
Where am I?

327
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,864
In Doha, as we promised,

328
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,034
where, as we also promised,
you and the others will stay

329
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,995
until a final settlement
is reached in the peace talks.

330
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,457
But I have a proposition
for you alone,

331
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,500
a chance to go home right now,

332
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,254
to your village, your family,
wherever you choose.

333
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,553
I won't be your spy.

334
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,431
I'm not asking you to.

335
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,267
All I want is for you to take
a message

336
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,353
to someone you know.

337
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,687
Haissam Haqqani.

338
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,564
No, no.

339
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,692
It's a letter...

340
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,528
I promise he will want
to receive.

341
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,741
And then what?

342
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,661
Then you're free.

343
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,293
That's her.

344
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,238
You're on.

345
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,914
She's on her way.
Just got in a cab.

346
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,582
She'll be there in ten minutes.

347
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,710
I'm ready.

348
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,919
<i>Good.</i>

349
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:49,999
Start on that side.

350
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,960
Bedroom, kitchen.
I'll start here.

351
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,462
Okay.

352
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,206
- So where are we going?
- Over the border.

353
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,959
Yeah, they said that
in the briefing.

354
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,670
Any more specific?

355
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,381
Peshawar.

356
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,919
So we're still on
for this evening?

357
00:22:59,003 --> 00:22:59,587
Absolutely.

358
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,840
Good.
See you then.

359
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,592
Samira?

360
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,259
Yes.

361
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,262
Olivia Hahn.

362
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,388
Peter Brand,
from the foundation.

363
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,308
You'll get to know him
if this works out.

364
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,851
It's where we get our money.

365
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,812
Please.

366
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,606
Can I get you anything?

367
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,064
Tea, water?

368
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,233
No, thank you.

369
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:32,119
So tell me about yourself.

370
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,801
Nothing here.

371
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:48,802
Bedroom's clean.

372
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,597
I'm starting to think
the whole place is.

373
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,849
No, there's something here.
I'm sure of it.

374
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,812
She was married a few months
when G'ulom killed her husband.

375
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,397
She go running
back to her village? No.

376
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,149
She stayed here,
despite the danger,

377
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,651
living as a single woman
in Kabul,

378
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,235
a place where that
is just not done.

379
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,570
That's...

380
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,071
That's not someone giving up.

381
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,367
That's someone...

382
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,369
biding her time.

383
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,001
She barely wears a headscarf.

384
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,878
What's she doing
with one of these?

385
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,543
Okay, then this last one,

386
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,087
with the government
accounting office...

387
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,963
Yes.

388
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,381
...through 2017.

389
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,926
I know, it has been
a couple of years.

390
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,011
I-I didn't mean...

391
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,847
I just had some family issues
after that job,

392
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,890
but I'm ready now
to work again.

393
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,600
- Good.
- Very ready.

394
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,810
Good.

395
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,771
So how was it, working
for the government, this audit?

396
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,694
I just mean you hear
these things can get tricky.

397
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,031
It went fine.

398
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,074
I have a reference there.
They'll confirm.

399
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,201
Why did you call it an audit?

400
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,079
You know, I'm not sure.

401
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,998
It says here
"cost accounting."

402
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,916
I must have read it
somewhere else,

403
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,753
maybe another listing
you have online.

404
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,799
I don't think
this is going to work out.

405
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,092
You know what?

406
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,011
I think it was
one of your references.

407
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,804
Who are you?

408
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,389
Who am I?

409
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,475
I didn't mean to offend you.

410
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,225
Give me that.

411
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,318
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

412
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,323
- <i>We got a problem.</i>
- What's that?

413
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,492
Samira.
She's coming your way.

414
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,743
You can't let her leave.

415
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,161
Are you fucking kidding?

416
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:19,745
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

417
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,370
She took my picture.

418
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,413
You've got to stop her.

419
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,957
Did you clear this with Mike?

420
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:24,625
There's no time.
Did you hear me?

421
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,627
She took my goddamn picture.

422
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,169
It'll be all over Kabul.

423
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,505
Don't let her leave.

424
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:24,810
For the emir.

425
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,190
Put it in his hands.

426
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,609
We'll know if you don't.

427
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,212
<i>To His Excellency,
the Emir Haissam Haqqani,</i>

428
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,048
<i>assalamu alaikum.</i>

429
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,218
<i>Seems like
a lifetime since you and I met</i>

430
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,553
<i>in the mountains of Safed Koh,</i>

431
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,015
<i>when we fought
on the same side.</i>

432
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,350
<i>Now we fight as enemies,</i>

433
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,519
<i>using every weapon we have...</i>

434
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,147
<i>the drone,
the suicide bomber...</i>

435
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,191
<i>to kill and maim families...</i>

436
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,819
<i>children.</i>

437
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,530
<i>We're like two madmen,</i>

438
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:19,239
<i>hands around
each other's throats,</i>

439
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,075
<i>unable to let go,</i>

440
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,787
<i>spilling each other's blood
and treasure...</i>

441
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,414
<i>for 18 years.</i>

442
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,586
<i>No one can win such a war.</i>

443
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,380
<i>I've come to believe this.</i>

444
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,675
<i>I think in your heart,
you believe it, too.</i>

445
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,054
<i>So I invite you
to come talk to me...</i>

446
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,347
<i>face-to-face,</i>

447
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,475
<i>because you and I know that
it's only the men with guns</i>

448
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,685
<i>who can make peace.</i>

449
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,774
<i>I'll be at the Kashmir Hotel
in Peshawar from Tuesday,</i>

450
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,944
<i>alone, apart
from the four men guarding me.</i>

451
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,780
<i>No drones, no satellites,
no backup... you have my word.</i>

452
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,745
<i>I can wait three days,
no more.</i>

453
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,625
<i>It's time to stop sending
our young men to die.</i>

454
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,336
<i>Come and talk.</i>

455
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,640
- What have you done?
- It was me.

456
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,976
I lost control
of the interview.

457
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,978
Samira panicked,
took a photo of me,

458
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,145
and tried to run.

459
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,147
So you put a hood on her?

460
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,482
Like she's gonna talk,

461
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,442
now we've traumatized her
all over again.

462
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,403
Fine.
Let her go.

463
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,906
Come with me.

464
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,376
Bring her some water.

465
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm taking the hood off.

466
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,511
I'm so sorry.

467
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,013
This was a mistake.

468
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,639
Okay, untie her.

469
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,825
My name's Carrie.

470
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,410
<i>I work for the CIA.</i>

471
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,625
I found this in your apartment,

472
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:36,918
sewn into the headband

473
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,546
of a burka
hanging in your closet.

474
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,631
You broke into my home?

475
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,466
I did.

476
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,677
And I saw what was on this...

477
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,555
personnel files for a battalion
of the Afghan National Army,

478
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,556
files from the audit
that you kept.

479
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,225
<i>I know you were working</i>

480
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,061
<i>on an anti-corruption probe
for your government.</i>

481
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,645
I know it was shut down

482
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,397
when it pointed
at General G'ulom.

483
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,525
You were fired, and your
husband was killed by a bomb

484
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,736
that was probably meant
for you.

485
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,905
But I don't think
you gave up.

486
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:10,243
You kept this because you know
it can sink G'ulom.

487
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,036
What do you want?

488
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,164
Your help.

489
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,084
Tell me what these mean,
and we can do together

490
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,086
what you tried to do
on your own.

491
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,837
We can bring him down.

492
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,674
You mean arrest him?

493
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,593
I mean control him.

494
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,011
Your government and mine

495
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,054
are trying to secure peace
with the Taliban,

496
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,641
a binding deal
to end the war in your country.

497
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,809
General G'ulom is standing
in the way of that.

498
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,605
With this, he'll have
to back down.

499
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,024
So you won't arrest him.

500
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,319
If he does what you want,
you'll bury this.

501
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,114
For now.

502
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,784
'Cause you need him
on your side.

503
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,077
Yes.

504
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,330
The man who killed my husband.

505
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,293
Who do you think you are?

506
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,921
You offer me a job
that doesn't exist,

507
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,299
kidnap me, terrorize me,
make me think I'm going to die.

508
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,802
Then you say, "I'm so sorry.
It was all a mistake.

509
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,346
Please help us.
It's for your own good"?

510
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,806
Well, it's not.

511
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,143
You know
how you could help me?

512
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,854
You know how you could help us,
you Americans?

513
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,565
Go.
Get out of our country.

514
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,567
Stop helping.

515
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,318
Leave us alone.

516
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,115
I've waited two years
to get G'ulom.

517
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,825
I can wait another two.

518
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,785
I can wait 20.

519
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,251
Okay, you're... you're right
about us, our mistakes.

520
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,212
You're right about me,
but you are wrong about G'ulom.

521
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,463
He's too strong.

522
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,261
If things stay as they are,
you won't get him.

523
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,055
If we leave Afghanistan,
you won't get him either.

524
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,684
The only thing
that will weaken him is peace.

525
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,562
Maybe that won't get justice
for you and your husband,

526
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,814
but if you don't help me,
nothing changes,

527
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,359
and G'ulom stays in power
for another 18 years.

528
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,705
Yeah.

529
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,373
It's me.

530
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,542
Hey.

531
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,877
How you holding up?

532
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,254
Better.
I can turn G'ulom.

533
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,881
What have you got?

534
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,799
Personnel files
of the 25th Battalion

535
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,219
of the Afghan National Army.

536
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,929
It's the safest unit
in the entire ANA...

537
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,057
no casualties,
no rotations out,

538
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,475
no desertions, nothing.

539
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,768
It doesn't fight.

540
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,977
It doesn't exist.

541
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:45,106
It's a ghost created
by General Abdul G'ulom.

542
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,733
- Have you got proof?
- <i>I'm looking at it.</i>

543
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,027
I'm on an army base

544
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,821
built with $30 million
of American money.

545
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,782
It's supposed to house
2,000 Afghan troops

546
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,076
with an annual payroll
of $14 million.

547
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,579
There's no base,
and there are no troops.

548
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,081
It's a scam, a paper army.

549
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,250
Anyone ask questions,
they get killed

550
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,502
or scared into silence.

551
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,922
We've enabled
this motherfucker for 18 years.

552
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,715
<i>What is wrong with us?</i>

553
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,926
All that matters right now is,
can you get him back in line?

554
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,719
- Oh, yeah.
- <i>Good.</i>

555
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,554
Then do it.

556
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,848
Right.

557
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:22,477
How's it going in Doha?

558
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,230
Been some developments.

559
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,731
Maybe see you in Kabul soon.

560
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,854
Assalamu alaikum.

561
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,584
Mm.

562
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,336
I thought you were supposed
to be in Doha.

563
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,174
<i>Aba,</i> this has to stop.

564
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,842
I'll stop when they stop.

565
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,552
If you take
the birdfeeder down,

566
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,471
the squirrels won't eat
the seeds anymore.

567
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,973
That wouldn't be fair
on the birds, would it?

568
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,101
Somebody's going to get hurt,
most likely you.

569
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:45,852
The neighbors
are complaining, <i>aba.</i>

570
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,063
Oh, to hell with them.

571
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,148
What did they ever do, huh?

572
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,317
Which one of them helped
this country

573
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,903
become a nuclear power?

574
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,668
You were friends
for a long time.

575
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,587
If 40 years is a long time.

576
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,588
Then what happened
between you?

577
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,800
9/11 happened,

578
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,469
then America's crusade
against the Muslim world.

579
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,931
He asked about you.

580
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,350
- Did he?
- Mm-hmm.

581
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,394
You know, Saul can be
very charming

582
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,145
when he wants to be.

583
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,898
And very two-faced.

584
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,275
He outflanked me, <i>aba.</i>

585
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,986
I was told he was sent
back to Washington,

586
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,780
but I think
he's here in Pakistan,

587
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,198
somewhere in FATA.

588
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,283
Doing what?

589
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,119
One of the five
Taliban prisoners

590
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,746
he had released
from Guantanamo

591
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,416
is Haissam Haqqani's cousin.

592
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,043
The other four are
under house arrest in Doha.

593
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,129
Cousin's vanished.

594
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,133
So Berenson is using
this fellow

595
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,177
as an envoy to get to Haqqani.

596
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,345
That's the theory.

597
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,601
Haqqani's tired
of the fight, <i>aba.</i>

598
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,272
Direct talks with Berenson
could lead to a breakthrough.

599
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,108
Well, any breakthrough
must be controlled by us

600
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,818
and not the United States.

601
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,528
Or prevented from happening
in the first place.

602
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:30,498
Question is, how far
am I allowed to go?

603
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,044
The Americans despise our god.

604
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,214
They despise our prophet.

605
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,216
They despise... us
for the very attempt

606
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,303
that we are trying to put
this country

607
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,804
on a self-reliant,
independent path.

608
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,390
Go as far as you must.

609
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,190
Photos of
the so-called base at Kulali.

610
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,567
Not a single structure.

611
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,985
Movement order
for the 25th Battalion

612
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,863
to the base,
signed by you.

613
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,490
Statement of unit strength

614
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:07,202
uh, from January this year,
initialed by you.

615
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,078
Monthly wage statements,

616
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,415
uh, from January and February,
countersigned by you.

617
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,958
Okay.

618
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,627
Ammunition and fuel requests
for March and April.

619
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,753
- I said okay.
- We haven't calculated

620
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,672
exactly how much you've stolen
from your own army,

621
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,841
but it's at least 100 million.

622
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,927
So what?

623
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,887
So what?

624
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,307
Everyone in government
has their nose in the trough.

625
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,810
You think they will put me
in prison?

626
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,853
They are terrified
I expose their secrets.

627
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,356
Not this time.

628
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,358
Really?

629
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,317
You went
against government policy

630
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,195
when you capsized
the peace process.

631
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,823
You humiliated the president
and the parliament.

632
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,449
So, when they hear you've also
been creating fake army units,

633
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,910
you're right...
they won't put you in prison.

634
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,662
They'll put you
up against a wall.

635
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,041
So here's the deal.

636
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,293
The United States
will give you two hours.

637
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,837
To do what?

638
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,756
Walk back your statement
about the prisoner exchange.

639
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,216
You will say you misspoke,

640
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,260
that you fully support
the peace process,

641
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,554
and you will do it publicly.

642
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,431
You do that, and these...

643
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,059
will be kept between us.

644
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,485
This peace of yours...

645
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,321
Do you really think the Taliban
will keep any agreement?

646
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:30,743
They wait till you draw down
your forces

647
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,413
while they gather theirs
in the villages

648
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,248
and in the mountains,

649
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,084
and then it will be Saigon
all over again...

650
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,421
your embassy under siege,

651
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,424
helicopters taking off
from the roof,

652
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,760
every fool who ever worked for
you massacred in the street.

653
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,471
Then...

654
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,517
who will you
come running to?

655
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:59,439
Me, just as you did in 2001,

656
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,567
because no one else

657
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,112
has the balls to fight.

658
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,782
Two hours.

659
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,826
A public statement.

660
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,132
Max for you.

661
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,634
Max.

662
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,886
I know you said
not to contact you

663
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,972
unless it was important,
but I think this is important.

664
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:33,848
<i>What is it?</i>

665
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,100
I told you,
I can get this myself.

666
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,894
- Sure, Max.
- <i>Max, what's going on?</i>

667
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,187
Is it Haqqani?

668
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,313
<i>Not exactly.</i>

669
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,814
Then what, for Christ's sake?

670
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:42,899
<i>I'm not sure,</i>

671
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,108
but in the last four hours,

672
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:48,196
been a lot of phone calls
in Pakistan, all ISI numbers.

673
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,031
<i>I can't work out
what they're saying.</i>

674
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,491
<i>Everything's encrypted.</i>

675
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,451
But it's where they are
that worries me.

676
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,661
It started in Rawalpindi.

677
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:59,332
Now it's converging
on where you are, Peshawar.

678
00:40:59,415 --> 00:40:59,999
Keep me informed.

679
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,337
What was that about?

680
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,215
Pakistani intelligence
may know we're here.

681
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,051
We get caught here,
so far from the border,

682
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,095
on an illegal military
operation,

683
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,846
we're fucked.

684
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,598
We're staying.

685
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,602
Well, then we better have
a look around.

686
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,772
Okay.

687
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:37,704
General.

688
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,525
<i>shouting in Pashto</i>

689
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,592
- Anything?
- Not that we can see.

690
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,761
Doesn't mean it's clear, but...
hold on.

691
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,182
Lookout says we got a convoy
of Hiluxes half a klick out

692
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,434
headed towards us.

693
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,395
- Haqqani.
- You need to stay inside.

694
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,521
Shit.

695
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,275
Sir, you're not safe out here.

696
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:05,291
Max said the ISI
was converging on us.

697
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,336
What if we're not the target?

698
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,256
Roger that.

699
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,966
Convoy's about to turn on
to the street.

700
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,468
We need you back inside.

701
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,107
They're gonna hit the convoy.

702
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,417
Move! Move! Move!

703
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:51,754
They... they killed him.

704
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,464
The Talibs are gonna think
we did.

705
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,675
We're getting the fuck out.

706
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,176
Stay!
Keep your head down!

707
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,803
Go! Get the vehicles!
Move it out!

708
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,680
Fucking go, go, go!

709
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,993
There she is.

710
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,079
They just played G'ulom's
press conference again.

711
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,873
He looked almost sincere.

712
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,084
The man knows how to lie.
You got to give him that.

713
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,461
My round.
What can I get you?

714
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,174
Uh, soda water with lime.

715
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,176
Yeah, I'm not as fun
as I used to be.

716
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,303
Hmm.

717
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,597
Thanks for saving my ass
with Samira.

718
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,848
It didn't need saving.

719
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,308
Yeah, it pretty much did.

720
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,977
Hey, what's she saying?

721
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,063
It's need to know.

722
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,439
Hopefully it's good-bye.

723
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,524
No such luck.

724
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:38,444
Seriously, when are you getting
the fuck out of my hair?

725
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,447
Don't know.
Depends on Saul.

726
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,616
Hey, where do you pee
around here, anyway?

727
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,701
Back and to the left.

728
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,881
Easy.

729
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,549
Get the fuck away from me.

730
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,302
I thought
you were gonna thank me.

731
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,138
For what?

732
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,141
Handing you Samira Noori.

733
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,936
That was you?

734
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,815
Who did you think it was?

735
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,275
Why?

736
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,236
Come on.

737
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,696
Don't play dumb.

738
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,576
Why are you looking at me
like that?

739
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,162
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

740
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,710
<i>You can't leave me here!</i>

741
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,837
<i>You can't leave me here!</i>

742
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,673
<i>Don't go!</i>

743
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,845
Thank God.

744
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,764
You're alive.

745
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:43,108

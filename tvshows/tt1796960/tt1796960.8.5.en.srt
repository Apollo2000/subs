<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,968
<i>Well, I think the prospect
of ending our longest war</i>

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,553
<i>would enjoy broad support.</i>

4
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,556
Well, not when it's twisted
into a partisan issue.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,159
<i>Seeing as you were one of
the architects of the policy,</i>

<i>we thought you might
have some ideas.</i>

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,438
Well, I can tell you
what Elizabeth Keane

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,231
was planning to do‐‐

<i>get out in front
of the debate.</i>

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,461
Come here to Afghanistan
and make the case

11
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,405
<i>directly to the men and women
who put their lives</i>

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,197
<i>on the line every day.</i>

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,242
<i>Before I left Washington,
I had a phone call,</i>

14
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,995
<i>a long phone call with Taliban
leader Haissam Haqqani,</i>

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,830
<i>and we spoke about how
we can bring peace</i>

16
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,541
<i>to this beautiful country.</i>

17
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,712
They've reached an agreement
without input from you or me,

18
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,339
but they expect us
to stand here

19
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,216
and applaud the result.

20
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,802
After 18 long years,

21
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,595
he has agreed
to negotiate for peace.

Bagram ATC got a report
from the AWACS

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,904
shadowing the Steedley mission.

25
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,674
Four minutes ago,
the President's helicopter

26
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,949
disappeared off radar.

27
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,285

<i>Camera on Chalk One,
the escort.</i>

29
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,957
Saul, what's happened?

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,042
President's helicopter's down.

31
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,961
Targets, two o'clock!

<i>Taliban.</i>

<i>An American prisoner of war

<i>You're a disgrace

<i>Sergeant Nicholas Brody.</i>

<i>You're a traitor

<i>and now it's time
to pay for that.</i>

44
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,346
<i>Are you accusing me
of something?</i>

45
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,889
<i>You really do not remember?</i>

46

<i>Remember what?</i>

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,578
<i>We may be dealing with
a compromised officer here.</i>

48
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,021
<i>You had a relationship
complicated enough</i>

49

<i>to lie about.</i>

50
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,208
<i>Yeah, it's complicated.</i>

51
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,859

<i>To my Russian handler?</i>

53
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,988
<i>Is our strategy working?</i>

54
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,325
<i>And you will become
the focus of an investigation</i>

55
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,494
<i>that will define
the rest of your life.</i>

<i>That not every
problem in the Middle East</i>

<i>deserves a military solution.</i>

58

<i>Because this whole country

<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

<i>Please, God,

<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

63
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,560
<i>I believe you.</i>

<i>No one else will.</i>

65
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,489
Max, there you are.

66
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,243
I need your tools.
Where are they?

67
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,035
Fuck.

68
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,246
‐ Which ones?
‐ I‐I don't know.

69
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,080
They need us to get
encryption sleeves,

70
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,499
PAVE modules,
all kinds of shit.

71
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
They sent pictures.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,085
I'll do it.

73
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,920
I know the equipment.
I'll do it.

74
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,088
Okay.

75
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,798
Let's go, let's go!

76
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,651
<i>A dozen grunts.</i>

77
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,028
The greatest fighting force
in the history of the planet,

78
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,447
and that's what we've got?

79
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,699
Mr. President, we have
substantial air support

80
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,117
over the crash site.

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,845
All useless‐‐
that's what you're telling me.

82
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,847
<i>Sir, there is a
Quick Reaction Force en route.</i>

83
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,456
Until they get there,

84
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,500
we are relying on the soldiers
from C. O. P. Steedley,

85
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,628
<i>but they are far
from our entire response.</i>

86
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,213
Graveyard of empires.

87
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,299
<i>Thugs with
third‐grade educations</i>

88
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,526
and automatic weapons‐‐we try
and make peace with them.

89
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,678
How shocked can we be
when they kill our president?

90
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,222
<i>We don't know the President
is dead.</i>

91
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,391
Well, are there signs
of life I'm missing?

92
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,103
Also, sir, we don't know
the Taliban is responsible.

93
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,980
At this point,
we don't know that anybody is.

94
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:32,814
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

95
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,150
Did we or did we not see
the Taliban

96
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,401
on the ground fire an RPG?

97
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,988
<i>Did we or did we not see
that RPG hit the helicopter</i>

98
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,240
carrying two presidents?

99
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,409
That was
the escort copter, sir.

100
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,411
Well, they're both down,
aren't they?

101
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,959
You know,
for the record,

102
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,171
I was against all of this.

103
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,017
You okay?

104
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,437
Should I be?

105
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,081
The Vice President just said
it doesn't matter

106
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,525
what actually happened.

107
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,236
‐ That's not what I heard.
‐ Then you weren't listening.

108
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,112
The peace deal
was your baby, Saul.

109
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,698
Whatever you say now, expect
to get your head cut off.

110
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,908
So I should just shut up?

111
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,160
No.
I'm saying be realistic.

112
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,329
Which is what?
What is that?

113
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,164
If the Taliban did it,
the Taliban did it,

114
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,875
but if the ISI did it,
I want to know.

115
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,876
If G'ulom did it,
I want to know.

116
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,604
If the pilot flew
the helicopter into the side

117
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,481
of the fucking mountain
because he thought Jesus

118
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,265
was talking to him,
I want to know that, too,

119
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342
because it matters‐‐
it fucking matters.

120
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,178
It determines what we do next.

121
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,055
You want realistic?

122
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,056
We've been through this before
after 9/11.

123
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,725
We did everything wrong.

124
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,605
What do you want me to do?

125
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,440
Mike sent everyone off
to work their assets.

126
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,067
They don't need me
doing that, too.

127
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,070
Tell me what to do.

128
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,657
Hello.

129
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,826
Can I have
your attention, please?

130
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,702
Thank you.

131
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,829
Uh, for those of you
I haven't met,

132
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,415
I'm Janet Gaeto,

133
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,586
U.S. Ambassador to the Islamic
Republic of Afghanistan.

134
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,506
Now, I have an announcement
of what must be obvious by now,

135
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,551
but the Presidents
have been delayed.

136
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,510
We've got
a weather hold.

137
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,014
‐ Weather hold.
‐ You don't believe it?

138
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,491
I don't believe it would
take them this long

139
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,935
to announce bad weather
in the Korengal.

140
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,230
Colleague of mine just arrived
from the consulate.

141
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,691
He says there are rumors...

142
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,110
helicopters down.

143
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,614
It's unverified.
I can't find out more.

144
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,949
We're still all basically
prisoners here.

145
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,784
I'd like to thank...

146
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,453
Excuse me.

147
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,039
First,
our Afghan partners...

148
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,129
Who's in there?

149
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,008
What the hell
are you doing here?

150
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,091
Hold on.

151
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,137
Sorry, General.
This is a private conversation.

152
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,267
You asking me to leave?

153
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,519
‐ Tell me...
‐ Tell you what?

154
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,730
The helicopters‐‐
where are they?

155
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,231
They've been delayed.

156
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,942
You call yourself an ally?

157
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,820
Really?

158
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,946
Only when it suits you.

159
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,338
They're down...

160
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,839
both helicopters.

161
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,675
What happened?

162
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,009
We don't know.

163
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,678
What about the presidents?

164
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,347
We don't know that either,
but until we do,

165
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,059
we've got to keep it
under wraps.

166
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,019
General, listen to me.

167
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,979
No one else can know.

168
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,238
Hello, ma'am?
Stop right there.

169
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,990
‐ Ma'am.
‐ I'm Carrie Mathison.

170
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,368
Here for the National Security
Advisor Saul Berenson.

171
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,804
‐ Mr. Berenson left hours ago.
‐ I know.

172
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,288
I was just with him
in Kabul Station.

173
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,082
Mr. Berenson asked me
to gather material

174
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,165
on the flight operation‐‐

175
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,460
manifests, briefing packets,
surveillance video,

176
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,063
anything that might help
shed some light.

177
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,213
On what?

178
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,382
JSOC helicopters are usually

179
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,301
plus or minus, what,
30 seconds?

180
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,178
Must have occurred
to you by now

181
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,622
you've got two flights
way overdue.

182
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,409
Holy fuck.

183
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,017
Max.

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,436
Okay, listen up.

185
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,239
The President's bird's
still two klicks out.

186
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,106
Gonzales, DaSilva,
you stay here,

187
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,024
search for survivors.

188
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,443
Everyone else on me.
We're moving now.

189
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,408
Max, let's go.

190
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,827
I was supposed to be on that.

191
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,091
What do I say
to the men

192
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,634
when they ask why you're here?

193
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,528
Nothing, not until there's
an official announcement.

194
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,179
And when will that be?

195
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,806
When they know what happened.

196
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,890
Which will be when?

197
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,697
Excuse me.
This one isn't right.

198
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,367
The tail number
should be 30368.

199
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,326
Well, uh, no, ma'am.
The board is wrong.

200
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,288
We had
a last‐minute tail swap.

201
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,623
They swapped helicopters?

202
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,542
Uh, yeah, the presidents'.

203
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,044
Something with the avionics.

204
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:28,711
Worley?

205
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,006
Our Chief Mechanic.

206
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,426
Uh, can I talk to him, please?

207
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,886
He's not here.

208
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,639
He left after
the helicopters took off.

209
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,431
He left?

210
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,016
Left is maybe the wrong word.

211
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,327
He wasn't feeling well.
He went back to barracks.

212
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,520
Anderson subbed in.

213
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,274
I know what you're thinking.

214
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,775
Good.
You're thinking it, too.

215
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,776
No, I'm not.

216
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,220
Worley's as true blue
as they come.

217
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,529
Then why isn't he
at his post?

218
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,822
I'm not making excuses,

219
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,466
but the man hasn't slept
in over 48 hours.

220
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,700
No one has.

221
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,577
Everyone's been
killing themselves

222
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,411
prepping for this flight,
so easy on the attitude.

223
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,788
That's all I'm saying.

224
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,042
Worley.
It's Major Landau.

225
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,546
Wake up!
You got company.

226
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,819
Where's his car?

227
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,906
Any idea where he might
have taken it?

228
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:38,989
I might know.

229
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,723
All right,
Soto, Laughton,

230
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,242
set up a perimeter there,
there, at tree line.

231
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,268
Expect contact.

232
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,103
Max, Durkin, Stoudt,
stay with me.

233
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,105
Move out.

234
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,989
Stoudt.

235
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,411
This is Charlie Echo Four.

236
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,579
<i>We are
at the crash site‐‐</i>

237
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,872
<i>a canyon,
steep sides,</i>

238
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,083
<i>wooded,
large conifers.</i>

239
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,417
<i>Stand by.</i>

240
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,544
What about the President?

241
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,505
He‐‐he can't hear us, sir.

242
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,548
Well, find out.
Ask him.

243
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,676
Who cares
about the damn trees?

244
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,662
Stoudt.

245
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,890
The aircraft is largely intact.

246
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,625
<i>No fragmentation
of the main fuselage.</i>

247
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,170
<i>Grid coordinates to follow.</i>

248
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,547
Where are they?

249
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,091
‐ Not sure, sir.
‐ Did something happen?

250
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,010
No.
There they are.

251
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,237
<i>Durkin, give me a hand.</i>

252
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,037
What's this?

253
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,372
They're uplinking the video
from the crash site, sir.

254
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,190
<i>This is Charlie Echo Four.</i>

255
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,442
<i>Nothing.</i>

256
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,569
No pulse.

257
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,404
The President's dead.

258
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,741
All of them‐‐
no survivors.

259
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:04,946
‐ Sir.
‐ Not now.

260
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,365
It's a difficult time,
I know,

261
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,951
but there are a number
of things that can't wait.

262
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,869
We have to notify
congressional leadership,

263
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:12,787
initiate continuity
of government.

264
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,206
Treasury has to close
the markets.

265
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,040
We don't want a panic.

266
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,668
Most importantly,
we need a plan‐‐

267
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,479
how to break the news
to the American people.

268
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,923
The way we do that will set
the tone for months to come.

269
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,216
Not now!

270
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,372
- ‐ Yes?
- ‐ <i>General G'ulom?</i>

271
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,957
General, it's Saul Berenson.

272
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,667
<i>I'm afraid I have bad news.</i>

273
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,335
More bad news?

274
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,896
Scott Ryan said he informed you
that the helicopter

275
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,214
carrying the U. S.
And Afghan president

276
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,967
went down while returning
to Bagram Airfield.

277
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,260
He did.

278
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,804
A team of U. S. Soldiers just
reached the crash site.

279
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,015
Both presidents are dead.
There are no survivors.

280
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,351
I've asked our ambassador,
Janet Gaeto...

281
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,769
Yes, I see her here.

282
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,479
‐ <i>And Scott Ryan.</i>
‐ Him too.

283
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,915
<i>I've asked them
to work with you</i>

284
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,691
<i>on a joint announcement.</i>

285
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,402
General...

286
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,114
<i>I know we've seemed
at cross purposes lately,</i>

287
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:35,203
but it's important
we coordinate our response.

288
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,164
Division will look
like weakness.

289
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,542
Right.

290
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,889
General,
first and foremost,

291
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,141
we want to offer
our condolences

292
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,851
on the loss
of your president.

293
00:16:58,935 --> 00:16:59,518
I've had the pleasure
of working with him

294
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,604
for two years now.

295
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,356
He was truly a great man.

296
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,901
I never really liked him.

297
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:15,743
Daoud is dead,
also the U. S. President.

298
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:20,414
There will be an announcement
within the hour.

299
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,585
The U. S. President was planning
to meet Haqqani.

300
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,463
He must be here.
Find him.

301
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,589
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,890
‐ I was right.
‐ Yes.

303
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,976
Presidents' helicopter is down.

304
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,187
Not just down.
They are dead, both of them.

305
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,899
Saul Berenson just told me.

306
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,484
What happened?

307
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,194
I don't think he knows.

308
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,788
We have been
allied these past months.

309
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,957
I've liked that.

310
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,170
But everything's
about to change.

311
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:12,174
Two hours from now, I won't be
able to guarantee your safety.

312
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,189
You're sure this
is the right area?

313
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,151
I was here once at night,
so, no.

314
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,986
Where did he meet her,
this friend of his?

315
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,822
How the hell should I know?

316
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,218
Do you want to tell me what
you were even doing here?

317
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,328
I don't know what he was doing.
I was getting laid.

318
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,496
We were drunk, sir.

319
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,377
Wait, hey, stop.

320
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,796
‐ Hey, stop, stop.
‐.

321
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,756
Wait, there,

322
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,525
that's the graffiti
I was telling you about.

323
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,383
The eyes.

324
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,011
Message to the people
who live here‐‐.

325
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,138
"We're watching you."

326
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,016
This is definitely it.

327
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,434
Turn left up ahead.

328
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,609
Pull over.
That's his car.

329
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,618
Worley's in back talking
to one, maybe two others.

330
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,411
Is he armed?

331
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,287
Wearing a jacket.
Nothing visible.

332
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,289
Two other targets
in the front room‐‐

333
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,166
one female,
one military‐aged male.

334
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,835
‐ Full house.
‐ How do we do this?

335
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,638
You stay back.
Wait till we clear the space.

336
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,939
Don't you hurt her!
Don't you fucking hurt her!

337
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,562
<i>Soto, status.</i>

338
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,272
All quiet.

339
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,943
What are you doing?

340
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,820
You said get
his personal stuff.

341
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,756
Hold the line!

342
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,859
This is Charlie Echo Four!

343
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,152
<i>We are in contact!</i>

344
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,237
<i>Taking fire!</i>

345
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,032
<i>Twenty, 30 Taliban,
100 meters to the northwest!</i>

346
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,325
Can you hold your position?

347
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,411
Not for long!
What's the ETA on backup?

348
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,705
Wait out.
Where's the QRF?

349
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,498
‐ Still an hour out.
‐ Air support?

350
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,581
The canopy is too thick.
They can't see through it.

351
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,217
Carrie, where are you?

352
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,761
In Kabul
with the Special Ops team.

353
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,637
Find something?

354
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,556
Actually, yeah.

355
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,701
A mechanic at Bagram switched
the presidents' helicopter

356
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,743
‐ at the last minute.
‐ What?

357
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,286
<i>He returned to his quarters</i>

358
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,396
saying he was sick.

359
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,832
Only, he didn't go back
to his room.

360
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,565
He snuck off base.

361
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,191
Well, tell me you found him.

362
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,360
I did,
with his Afghan girlfriend.

363
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,987
She's pregnant.

364
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,464
They were trying to figure out
what to do about that

365
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,574
when we smashed
through the door.

366
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,158
Can't just leave her.
Her family will kill her.

367
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,660
You know that, right?

368
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,915
You know why he swapped
the helicopters?

369
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,751
Because they're always
swapping helicopters.

370
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,020
<i>He says that's
the way it works here.</i>

371
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,588
They're flying max payload
above their service ceiling.

372
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,507
Something's always breaking.
The weather sucks.

373
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,260
I mean, what if it was
an accident?

374
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,970
The whole thing?

375
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,434
Saul?

376
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,561
The President is dead.

377
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,732
The crash site is about
to be overrun by Taliban.

378
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,567
Oh, Jesus.

379
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,737
Haven't we got men there?

380
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,863
Not enough.

381
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,573
<i>Get back here.</i>

382
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,827
‐ What now?
‐ You're not gonna like this.

383
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,121
A tip from one of our assets
in the A. N. A.

384
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,682
G'ulom just ordered
two battalions out of barracks.

385
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,334
They're searching every car
leaving Kabul.

386
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,461
They're looking for Haqqani.

387
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,004
Thought you'd want to know.

388
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,088
Thank you.

389
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,073
<i>Haissam.</i>

390
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,156
Saul, is it time?

391
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,119
No, Haissam.

392
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,287
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,331
<i>President Warner is dead.</i>

394
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,666
<i>So is President Daoud.</i>

395
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,211
Their helicopter went down
in the Korengal.

396
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,422
<i>We're holding back
on a public announcement.</i>

397
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,884
How?

398
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,427
<i>We don't know.</i>

399
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,096
<i>There were Taliban
in the area.</i>

400
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,347
Of course there are.

401
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,765
You know we control
the Korengal.

402
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,518
They shot down
the escort helicopter.

403
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,398
You think I did it?

404
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,525
I need to know.

405
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,113
No.

406
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,739
I did not.

407
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,536
I'm observing the cease‐fire.

408
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,372
<i>So are my men.</i>

409
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,457
I believe you.

410
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,335
No one else will.

411
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,216
General G'ulom
is locking down the city.

412
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,443
I can't protect you from him.

413
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,220
I might not even be able
to protect you from my side.

414
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,558
Your president
gave me his word.

415
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,436
My president is dead.

416
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,437
Haissam...

417
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,564
if what you and I worked for

418
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,691
is to have any chance
of surviving,

419
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,568
you have to stay alive.

420
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,821
<i>Have to get out of Kabul...</i>

421
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,407
<i>now.</i>

422
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,284
<i>And hurry.</i>

423
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,616
Laughton's down!

424
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:22,427
Charlie Echo Four,
I got one down,

425
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,055
and we're gonna get more
if we don't pull back!

426
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,820
QRF is close.
Can you hold on?

427
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,821
Negative!

428
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,739
We're fish in
a fucking barrel here, sir!

429
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:43,925
<i>- ‐ Move, move, move!</i>
- ‐

430
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,493
- ‐ I've got to pull them back.
- ‐ Wait.

431
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,054
What happens when
the Taliban take the site?

432
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,163
The QRF rolls in and cuts them
to fucking pieces.

433
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,457
Meaning the Taliban will have
President Warner's body

434
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,042
until they get there.

435
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,211
‐ So what do you suggest?
‐ You have F‐22s overhead.

436
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,454
As soon as your men withdraw,

437
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,024
drop a bomb on the site,
obliterate it.

438
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,274
You want me to destroy the body
of the American President?

439
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,859
Yeah, unless you want to see
him dragged through the streets

440
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,219
of Miramshah
with his dick in his mouth.

441
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,178
Hold on.

442
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,139
We bomb the site,
we lose the evidence.

443
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,408
‐ What evidence?
‐ It's all evidence.

444
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,725
The entire site.

445
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,160
We'll never know
how the crash happened.

446
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,020
Those are Taliban
killing my guys.

447
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,272
‐ We know what happened.
‐ Drop the bomb.

448
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,693
I don't have the authority
to give that order.

449
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,119
Where is he?

450
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,037
Uh, Oval Office.

451
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,705
He asked for his things
to be moved.

452
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,719
Sir.

453
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,972
The situation in Afghanistan
has gotten worse.

454
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,475
The soldiers
from C. O. P. Steedley

455
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,910
‐ are at the crash site.
‐ I know that.

456
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,562
They're under attack
from a large Taliban force

457
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,956
and about to lose control
of the site.

458
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,606
What about the rapid,
uh, Quick‐‐.

459
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,400
The QRF won't arrive in time.

460
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,527
The Taliban will take the site,

461
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,988
and they will have
the President's body.

462
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,033
Kabul needs you to make
a decision.

463
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,660
Either we cede control
of the site to the Taliban

464
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:14,539
and hope
to recover it later, or...

465
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,043
we drop a 1,000‐pound bomb
and destroy it.

466
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,799
‐ Bomb President Warner?
‐ Yes.

467
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,652
You're asking me to incinerate
my predecessor.

468
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,554
General Owens needs a decision.

469
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,306
This is a military matter.

470
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,450
You're Commander in Chief now.

471
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,851
So I'm responsible
for the old man's mistakes,

472
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,228
trusting a goddamn terrorist?

473
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,438
Sir, if the Taliban get hold
of Warner's body,

474
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,832
that image,
whatever they do to it,

475
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,109
will go all over the world.

476
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,907
You need to make a decision.

477
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,072
Tell me what to do.

478
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,824
Bomb the site.

479
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,203
Yes.

480
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,663
Tell them that.

481
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,366
The order has to come from you.

482
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,807
Owens.

483
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,560
<i>General, I have the President.</i>

484
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,739
General.

485
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,490
Calling to confirm.

486
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:16,161
Confirm what, sir?

487
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,538
Do it.

488
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,874
I need you to be specific, sir.

489
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,838
Bomb it.
Bomb the damn site.

490
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,426
Yes, sir.

491
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,563
We should go
to the Situation Room.

492
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,068
To oversee the operation.

493
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:52,322
Wha‐‐you want me to watch?
What's that gonna look like?

494
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,743
Like you can make
a tough decision

495
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,411
and see it through.

496
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,255
Yes, we should go.

497
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,600
Confirmed.
You are clear to withdraw.

498
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,685
<i>Roger that!</i>

499
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,272
Eagle Two,
target at 28, 35, 45 north,

500
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,649
47, 52, 06 east,

501
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,900
ordnance two by 1,000 JDAM.

502
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,195
Release only on my command.

503
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,489
<i>Copy, Eagle Two.
Cleared hot on your command.</i>

504
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,323
They're gonna destroy the site?

505
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,201
The Vice President
made the call.

506
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,035
Did you tell them
what the mechanic said

507
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,453
about problems
with the airframes?

508
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,497
Yes.

509
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,308
That we won't know what
actually caused the crash?

510
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,460
Yes, I said I told them,
but there are other issues,

511
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:51,464
like the President's body being
mutilated by the Taliban

512
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,925
beamed out over the Internet.

513
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,635
Four minutes to target.

514
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,821
Charlie Echo 4,
this is Delta One.

515
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,054
Confirm when clear.

516
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,978
What about the black box‐‐
the flight recorder?

517
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:04,144
Carrie, we are out of time.

518
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,827
For Christ's sake,
this morning you said,

519
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,813
"It matters what caused
the crash."

520
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,374
"It matters," you said.
What happened to that?

521
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:13,069
What happened is that no one
is listening to me.

522
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,493
Max‐‐he's with them,
isn't he?

523
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,495
Yes.

524
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,390
You were communicating with him
in the Korengal.

525
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,414
How?

526
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:35,133
Everybody, get back
to the trail!

527
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,363
Max, we're out of here!

528
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,465
‐
‐ Move!

529
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,169
They're dropping a JDAM
on the whole thing!

530
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,587
‐ Hello?
‐ Max, it's me.

531
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,546
Carrie?

532
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,882
Are you at the President's
helicopter?

533
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,050
<i>Yes.</i>

534
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,968
You have to get
the flight recorder.

535
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,429
No.
No, we're leaving.

536
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,181
<i>No,
first get the recorder.</i>

537
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,892
Max, it's really
fucking important.

538
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,893
Do you know where it is?

539
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,271
Yes.

540
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,067
Give me my bag!

541
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,123
Get Max and Durks to move!

542
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,708
I need a hand!

543
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,732
Durks, let's go!
What the fuck are you doing?

544
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,091
Come on!

545
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,759
We're getting
the flight recorder!

546
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,052
Max, have you got it?

547
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,138
Two minutes out.
Are we clear?

548
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,515
Charlie Echo Four,
are you clear from site?

549
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,599
Negative!

550
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,978
Soto, Durks,
get the fuck out of there!

551
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,896
Eagle Two,
target not clear.

552
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,124
Sergeant,
you need to move now.

553
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,817
Max, Max,
you have 90 seconds.

554
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,943
Yeah, I'm trying.

555
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,073
Let's go!
Hurry the fuck up!

556
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,701
‐
‐

557
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,536
I got it!
I got it!

558
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,704
Now go.

559
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,249
For fuck's sake,
Maxie, come on!

560
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,332
I got it.

561
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,505
Let's go!

562
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,593
Charlie Echo Four,
clearing the site now.

563
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,679
Back to the trail!

564
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,805
Go, go, go!

565
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,807
Go!

566
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,357
Eagle Two, start your run‐in.

567
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,818
<i>Roger that. Starting run.</i>

568
00:37:58,902 --> 00:37:59,902
<i>Sixty seconds out.</i>

569
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,005
Move it, Stoudt!
Hustle, hustle!

570
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,011
‐
‐

571
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,387
Wenzel!

572
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:28,973
‐
‐

573
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,893
Go!
Fuck!

574
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,191
Durk!

575
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,328
We got to go!
We got to go!

576
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,587
Charlie Echo Four,
are you clear of target?

577
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,217
Charlie Echo Four,
are you clear? Over.

578
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,347
Taliban have the site.

579
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,449
Eagle Two,
you are weapons free.

580
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,059
<i>Roger that. Weapons free.</i>

581
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,775
<i>Two in the air.</i>

582
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:25,988
Max?

583
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,367
Max?

584
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,370
Max?

585
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,253
<i>Eagle Two coming left.</i>

586
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,172
<i>Heading two seven zero.
Clearing the airspace.</i>

587
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,091
<i>Copy that, Eagle Two.</i>

588
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,174
Mr. President.

589
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,131
General,
what are you doing?

590
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,716
Making an announcement.

591
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,800
Well, with respect,

592
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,344
we agreed to coordinate
our response.

593
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,973
This is my country
and now my presidency.

594
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,057
I'll say what I want.

595
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,534
I stand before you...

596
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,581
on the saddest day.

597
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,834
I've just been informed

598
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:06,798
the helicopter carrying
Presidents Warner and Daoud...

599
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,218
has been shot down.

600
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,888
Both Presidents are dead.

601
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,310
That was an assassination

602
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,354
ordered by Haissam Haqqani,

603
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:25,191
carried out by Taliban forces

604
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,193
<i>under his command.</i>

605
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,864
<i>Haissam Haqqani,
the very man</i>

606
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:35,535
<i>with whom
President Warner and Daoud</i>

607
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,871
<i>thought they could make peace.</i>

608
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,333
<i>They trusted him.</i>

609
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:48,506
They trusted
his so‐called cease‐fire.

610
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,344
He betrayed them both.

611
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:58,349
The first duty of any President

612
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:02,729
is the safety of his citizens.

613
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:08,526
<i>Therefore I have declared
martial law.</i>

614
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,947
<i>I have ordered my army
on the streets</i>

615
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,784
<i>to round up the Taliban...</i>

616
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,119
<i>to hunt down...</i>

617
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:22,206
<i>the terrorist Haqqani...</i>

618
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:27,253
<i>and bring him to justice.</i>

619
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,681
QRF just reached the site.
It's been totally destroyed.

620
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,477
What about the men
from Steedley?

621
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,979
Well, seven of them
got picked up.

622
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,063
Three are confirmed dead.

623
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,695
‐ That's all?
‐ That could be identified.

624
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:35,988
‐ Max?
‐ Yeah.

625
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,949
Oh, thank God,
thank God, thank God.

626
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,910
Tell me you have the black box.

627
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,263
‐ It's orange.
‐ Max, do you have it?

628
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,499
<i>Yes.</i>

629
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,792
<i>You need to come get us.</i>

630
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,044
<i>We're back
at the first crash site.</i>

631
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,796
It's only me and Soto.

632
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,549
We left DaSilva
and Gonzales here alive,

633
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,217
but now they're dead.

634
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,181
‐
‐ Max?

635
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,183
Max, talk to me.

636
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,396
Max, what's happening?

637
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,526
<i>Max, tell me
what's happening.</i>

638
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,242
<i>Max?</i>

639
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,535
<i>Max, talk to me.</i>

640
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,927
I'm not armed.

641
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,239
<i>Max, tell me
what's happening.</i>

642
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,602
Can you hear me?

643
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,485
Try to stay where you are.
We'll come get you.

644
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,149
<i>Max?</i>

645
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,109
Max?

645
00:44:56,305 --> 00:45:56,538

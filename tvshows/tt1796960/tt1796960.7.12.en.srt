Previously on <i>Homeland</i>...

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:08,583
I know you're working
with Saul Berenson.

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,583
I also know he just took
a group to Moscow.

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:11,959
Why are they there?

5
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,250
To retrieve Simone Martin.

6
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,125
Imagine Simone Martin
saying that publicly,

7
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,792
that everything we've
been blaming on Keane

8
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,875
- is actually Russians.
- A few words

9
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,000
to the Russian ambassador,
and Saul's mission fails.

10
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,117
Plan "A" at the dacha
went to shit.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,617
Team walked into a trap.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,367
Explain to me how you used
the 25th Amendment

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,741
to oust a President
who is not in a coma,

14
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,950
not in any way disabled,

15
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,575
clearly in possession
of her faculties.

16
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,741
Elizabeth Keane
is no longer President.

17
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,117
Whatever authorization
we had has vanished.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,866
There are divisions on their
side we can use against them.

19
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,200
What do you want?

20
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:56,200
I want Simone Martin.

This whole crazy thing is you.

25
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:08,825
The Kremlin has lost control.
You are the problem.

26
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:12,367
What do you think they'll do?
You are expendable.

Yeah.

Keep down, okay?

Yeah.

38
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,458
Was that always the plan?

39
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,250
More or less. Difference
being we didn't expect

40
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,125
- to have Yevgeny on our ass.
- Well, we don't.

41
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,709
Not yet, anyway.

42
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,875

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
of the GRU...

46
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,625
...Russia's main intelligence
directorate, where personnel...

47
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,125
...are being dragged outside,

48
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,500
beaten, and held at gunpoint
by members of the SVR,

49
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,583
the Russian
foreign intelligence service,

50
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,875
a modern successor...

51
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,709
What is this? What's going on?

52
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,542
Apparently, the Russians
are fighting each other.

53
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,208
Bullshit. It's Saul Berenson,
and you sent him there.

54
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,208
You thought what?
I wouldn't find out?

55
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:58,375
I wouldn't notice you sent
a damn time bomb to Moscow?

56
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,083
What is he doing?
What's the mission?

57
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,291
He's...

58
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,000
discussing Russian
active measures

59
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,000
with members of
their intelligence community.

60
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,375
Really? That is "discussing
active measures"?

61
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,417
You don't wanna answer
my questions? Fine.

62
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I'll pull him from
the field right now.

63
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,250
Don't do that.

64
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:29,000
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

65
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,500
Why shouldn't I?

66
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,166
- Simone Martin.
- What about her?

67
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,959
I told you
she's a Russian operative.

68
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,542
- Was a Russian operative.
- No.

69
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,959
She's alive in Moscow.

70
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,166
Saul has gone there
to bring her back.

71
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,792
Simone is GRU.
That's GRU headquarters.

72
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,083
So we assumed it was
part of Saul's mission,

73
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,291
but obviously,
something has gone wrong.

74
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,166
You think?

75
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,959
I should've been
briefed on this.

76
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,375
- You should've briefed me.
- I couldn't take that chance.

77
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,000
What chance?

78
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,583
That I would compromise

79
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,333
an American operation
in progress on the ground?

80
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,667
Yes.

81
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,458
Why on earth
would I do that?

82
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:22,500
For the same reason you stuck
a knife in my back two days ago.

83
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,750
Saul.

84
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,250
They have the package.

85
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,458
Listen up.

86
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,709
We're going home.
We leave now.

87
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,458
Don't go to your rooms.
Go straight to the parking garage.

88
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,500
Colonel.

89
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,792
Mr. Berenson,
has something happened?

90
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,291
What you predicted.

91
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,041
All the changes in Washington.
I've been recalled.

92
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,041
You're not National Security
Advisor anymore?

93
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,875
I said recalled, not fired.

94
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,375
New President wants
to consult with me.

95
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,750
He also said I must invite
you and General Yakushin

96
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,458
to Washington to continue
our discussions there.

97
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,125
I'd like that.

98
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,875
This is Saul Berenson.

99
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,709
Get her in the van.

100
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,583
Are we good?

101
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,500
Police escort is waiting outside.
Plane is standing by.

102
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,125
- Thanks, Jim.
- Don't thank me yet.

103
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,644

110
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,458
Stop! Stop!

111
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,500
What's wrong?

112
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,834
I want everyone
out of this van.

113
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,417
- Excuse me?
- I said everyone out!

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,792
Colonel, calm down.

115
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,208
Turn off the car!

116
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,458
Please, you're making
a fool of yourself.

117
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,166
I am?

118
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,291
Da?

119
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,875

120
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:11,505

123
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,236
_

124
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry. Misunderstanding.

125
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,625
Have a good flight.

126
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,834
Who keeps calling you?

127
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,834
- It's nobody. No, don't!
- Hey!

128
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,959
Clint. Who?

129
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,375
It's... Janet. She works
for Senator Paley.

130
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,417
Tell me.

131
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,709
She came to my house

132
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:07,792
to find out what
Saul was doing.

133
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,834
I have no idea how she even
connected me to it.

134
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:18,041
She threatened you?

135
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,709
And you told her about the plan
to exfiltrate Simone.

136
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:23,291
That's why the Russians were
waiting at the dacha.

137
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,208
Saul's en route
to the airport.

138
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,792
Have you said
anything to anybody

139
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,458
- about what's happening now?
- No, nothing. Not a word.

140
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:35,542
It's why I'm not
answering the phone.

141
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,375
So she doesn't get any ideas
and try to find us.

142
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,875
I'm really, really sorry.

143
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,625
I'm sorry, too. But right now
I can't let you out of my sight.

144
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,250
Come on. Come.

145
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,250
Sit with me, okay?

146
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,625
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

147
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,125
- Max, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

148
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,542
We're cut off from the Embassy.
Where's Saul?

149
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,375
He left the hotel five minutes
ago with the package.

150
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,792
We have to buy time.

151
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,166
40 minutes, maybe an hour,
till they're in the air.

152
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,208
- Where are you going?
- They know the car.

153
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,083
- I have to go on foot.
- I'm not leaving you.

154
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,500
No, it's not up for discussion.
I agreed with Saul.

155
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,834
If things go wrong,
this is the plan.

156
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,583
What, to allow them
to fucking catch you?

157
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,250
No, to buy time for
what really matters,

158
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,792
which is not me,
it's Simone.

159
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,000
They've seen us.

160
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,583
- What station is that?
- Checking.

161
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:39,333
Remember, we're a bunch
of diplomats heading home.

162
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,834
So you know who you are.

163
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,291
Carrie Mathison.
Your favorite.

164
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,792
- What's happening with her?
- Don't worry about it.

165
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,709
She came over the roof
to get me.

166
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,667
Did you know that?

167
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,792
You're just going
to leave her here?

168
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,542
_

169
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:37,342
_

170
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:39,582
_

171
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,886
_

172
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,823
Saul.

173
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,709
What do you think
you're doing?

174
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,875
This is a diplomatic vehicle.

175
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,125
- You. Out.
- Nobody's going anywhere.

176
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,667
- This man is murderer.
- You're mistaken.

177
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,792
We're United States diplomats.

178
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,959
This man's wanted
by the police.

179
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,917
Killed someone
in Sergiyev Posad.

180
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,667
That's the dacha.
They have a photo.

181
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,166
We have diplomatic immunity.

182
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,083
His orders are
to make an arrest.

183
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,000
No, that's not gonna happen.
We have diplomatic immunity.

184
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,208
We're protected
by international law.

185
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,667
Fuck off, asshole!
Lock it! Lock it!

186
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,208
Get me the Embassy. Now.

187
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,875
Mr. President,
I have Mr. Berenson for you.

188
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,500
He says it's urgent.

189
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,917
Put him on.

190
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,250
- Mr. Berenson.
- Mr. President,

191
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm at Ostafyevo Airport
outside Moscow

192
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,792
on a diplomatic mission
initiated by President Keane.

193
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,875
- I'm aware.
- Then you're aware

194
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,542
of the importance
of our work here.

195
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,792
What do you want?

196
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,500
The guards are refusing
to let us board our plane.

197
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,458
I need you to contact
the Russians and remind them

198
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,125
this is a diplomatic mission,
that all of us

199
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,875
have diplomatic immunity
and must be allowed to board.

200
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,458
Why are they holding you?

201
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,709
Police claim a member
of our group

202
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,166
is wanted in connection with
a homicide outside of Moscow.

203
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,250
- And was he involved?
- No, sir. Mistaken identity.

204
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,083
And has the mission
been a success?

205
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,875
- Sir?
- You heard me.

206
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,291
Has the mission
been a success?

207
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:17,625
Yes, it has.

208
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,375
But if our situation here
isn't resolved soon,

209
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,834
that will change.

210
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,542
I'll have to
get back to you.

211
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,166
He's got her,
doesn't he?

212
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,125
Simone Martin.

213
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,375
So you know she's alive?

214
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,166
Yes.

215
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,500
And not a victim of
Keane's reign of terror,

216
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,625
- as you've been saying.
- No.

217
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,166
But that's not
the issue now.

218
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,291
And what is the issue?

219
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,583
If Saul Berenson returns
with Simone Martin

220
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,291
to the United States,

221
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,792
Keane'll be sitting behind
this desk again,

222
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,625
feeling vindicated
and vindictive.

223
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,709
You'll be back
to opening State Fairs

224
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:10,250
and Boy Scout jamborees.

225
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,166
- What do you advise?
- The Russian Ambassador was

226
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,166
waiting in the Roosevelt Room
when I came in.

227
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,166
Said he's been asking
to see you all morning.

228
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,458
Tell him the truth.

229
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,250
Which is?

230
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,917
You didn't send Berenson
to Moscow.

231
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,542
You didn't cause
all this unrest.

232
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,041
You are not responsible

233
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:33,166
for Elizabeth Keane's
brinksmanship.

234
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,417
_

235
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,752
_

236
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,875
- Max, are you there?
- Yeah.

237
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,917
Please tell me
Saul's on the plane.

238
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,083
No. There's a problem
at the airfield.

239
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,667
They're not being
allowed to board.

240
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,458
Jesus.

241
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,637
_

242
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,088
_

243
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,388
_

244
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,333
Mr. President.

245
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,208
Mr. Ambassador,
sorry to keep you waiting.

246
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,458
It's been a hell of a morning.

247
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,542
Forgive me for getting
straight to the point,

248
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,083
but events in Moscow are
causing us great concern.

249
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,500
Mm, as they are me.

250
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,208
Especially because we have
clear evidence

251
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:15,083
they were instigated by
members of your own--

252
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,458
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think we have this

253
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,875
the wrong way around.
I asked to see you,

254
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,834
because right now
there's a situation

255
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,000
developing at
Ostafyevo Airport.

256
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,166
Your security forces
are preventing

257
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,542
Saul Berenson and his team
from leaving the country.

258
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,333
In fact,
they're being detained.

259
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,083
I want them released
immediately.

260
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,041
Mr. President, this is not
at all what we discussed.

261
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,792
Let me finish, Senator.

262
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,500
Mr. Berenson is there
on a diplomatic mission

263
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,000
and therefore
has diplomatic immunity...

264
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:47,041
- But he has flouted--
- ...no different than you.

265
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,458
And if he and his people aren't
allowed to board their plane

266
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:54,083
in the next five minutes,
I will close your Embassy

267
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,875
and I will detain
every single Russian diplomat,

268
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:00,417
starting with you.

269
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,917
Call Moscow.

270
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,959
Let Mr. Berenson go.

271
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,542
And you, Senator,

272
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,625
you can get the fuck
out of my White House.

273
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,000
- Carrie.
- Yeah?

274
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,792
Anson made it
into the Embassy.

275
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,583
Oh, thank God. What about Saul?

276
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,333
Not yet.

277
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:34,750
Saul.

278
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:01,458
Max, I haven't got
much longer.

279
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,917
I'm with you, Carrie.

280
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,500
Drive.

281
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,458
You.

282
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,417
Carrie, Saul is away.

283
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:43,111
_

284
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,875
Security is
unusually tight today

285
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,417
ahead of Simone Martin's
testimony

286
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,583
before the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

287
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,709
testimony widely expected to be

288
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,333
a complete vindication
of Elizabeth Keane,

289
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,875
who was removed from office
five days ago.

290
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,000
Senator Sam Paley,
who led that effort,

291
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,542
was himself arrested
Tuesday morning

292
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,750
in a dawn raid by the FBI

293
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:12,166
and charged with criminally
conspiring with a foreign power.

294
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,834
His chief of staff, Janet Bayne,

295
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,667
is said to be cooperating
with investigators.

296
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,875
Meanwhile,
back at the White House,

297
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,250
Ms. Keane is scheduled to be
re-sworn into office

298
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,667
at noon Eastern Standard Time.

299
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,917
Sources tell CNB
her first official act will be

300
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,375
to sign a series
of executive orders

301
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:33,458
dramatically expanding sanctions
against Russia.

302
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,750
It appears Simone Martin has
just entered the hearing room.

303
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,959
Let's watch.

304
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,792
In accordance with
the practice of the committee,

305
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,208
will the witness please rise
and be sworn?

306
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:05,750
Do you swear that all
the testimony you will give

307
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,834
in this proceeding will be
the truth, the whole truth,

308
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,125
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

309
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,542
- I do.
- Be seated.

310
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,750
Would you state
your full name, please?

311
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,458
- Simone Marie Martin.
- Ms. Martin,

312
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:22,208
the Committee thanks you for
your appearance here today.

313
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,417
There's a lot riding on
what you have to say,

314
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,542
so I'd like to just jump right
in, if that's okay with you.

315
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,417
Will you tell
the American people

316
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,625
what the GRU is?

317
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,500
The GRU is a foreign military
intelligence agency

318
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,333
of the general staff
of the armed forces

319
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,000
of the Russian Federation.

320
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,000
What is your relationship
to that organization?

321
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,667
I'm a Captain in the GRU.

322
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,625
That one's for you, Carrie.

323
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,000
Could you describe
for us, please,

324
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,125
what a Captain does exactly?

325
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,083
Different things.

326
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,792
Me, I'm an operations officer.
I work in the field.

327
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,291
Ms. Martin, what was
your most recent operation?

328
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:12,834
I was part of a team
sent here to disrupt

329
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:15,083
the American political system.

330
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,000
How?

331
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,417
By any means necessary.

332
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,041
Give me an example
of what you tried to do.

333
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,959
Come on, baby,
just say it.

334
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,667
We tried to compromise
your President

335
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,709
and push her out of office.

336
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:38,041
Yes!

337
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,959
Feels good, doesn't it?

338
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,667
To finally hear the truth.

339
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
- Yeah.
- Sure does.

340
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,875
You have no fucking idea.

341
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:04,250
So this is the room
where it happened.

342
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,500
Well, I wanted to come
and meet you all

343
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,166
and say thank you.

344
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,083
So thank you.

345
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,083
You guys kicked ass.

346
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,917
I also wanted to tell you

347
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,417
that I am doing
everything in my power

348
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,875
to bring
Carrie Mathison home.

349
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,250
Everything.

350
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:41,291
You have my solemn promise
on that.

351
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,709
Come on, Saul.
Introduce me to everybody.

352
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,333
- Sandy Langmore.
- It's an honor to meet you,

353
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,959
- Madam President.
- Clint Prower.

354
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,083
- Hi.
- Hi.

355
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:56,959
Max Pietrowski.

356
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,917
Hi.

357
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,041
How's the book?

358
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,959
It's good.

359
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,250
Passes time.

360
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:29,583
Yes. Thanks for
letting me have it.

361
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,755
Come.

362
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,041
Right. Of course.

363
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,542
I guess this means
Simone's already testified,

364
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,250
or is about to.

365
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,709
Sit down.

366
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,834
Well, I'm not gonna save
your asses now by reading

367
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:34,458
some stupid statement saying
this was all a CIA plot.

368
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:38,333
Oh, I think you will.

369
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:41,583
What's the point anyway?

370
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,709
People will know
the statement was coerced.

371
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:46,166
- No one will believe it.
- They don't have to.

372
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,083
As long as the seed of doubt
is planted,

373
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,750
that's all I need--

374
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,917
something to water
and let grow.

375
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,959
More reason
not to do it.

376
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,333
Your medication.

377
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:10,083
Your new medication.

378
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,333
Yes, I know all
about that.

379
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,000
Am I supposed
to be impressed?

380
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,083
No, you're supposed
to ask yourself

381
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,667
how do you want to spend
the rest of your days here--

382
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,125
reading nice books
that Aleksandr brings you

383
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,166
and exercising in the yard,

384
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,375
or gone mad,

385
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:33,125
locked up in an asylum?

386
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,959
Make the statement.

387
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:41,083
Admit your guilt,
apologize to the Russian people,

388
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,875
and the pills are yours
as long as you need them.

389
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,709
I said no.

390
00:28:56,792 --> 00:29:01,583
It will be months, Carrie.

391
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,959
Maybe longer.

392
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,291
Very powerful men
are upset.

393
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:10,125
They're not gonna exchange
you soon, or for nothing.

394
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:23,125
Think about it.

395
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,250
You have till tomorrow
to decide.

396
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,959
Aleksandr!

397
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:50,950
Not yet.
Still a work in progress.

398
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:53,034
Tell them they'll get
the full draft

399
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:54,909
three hours before air.

400
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:00,742
Well, that's up
to the President.

401
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,200
Hold on. I'll ask her.

402
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:07,117
Reiko's wondering
if she should mention that

403
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,742
you chose tomorrow night
for the address

404
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:14,658
because it's the anniversary
of Andrew's death.

405
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:18,617
You know the answer to that.

406
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,450
My son's off-limits.

407
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,909
That would be a "no."

408
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:28,658
And, uh, I'll get back
to you on the other thing.

409
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:33,825
What about me?

410
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:36,034
When do I get
to see a draft?

411
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:39,909
When I'm ready
to show it to you.

412
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:59,159
Also, the Vice President's
been asking

413
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,742
for a moment of your time
after the reswearing in.

414
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:04,200
- What for?
- No idea.

415
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:08,117
Well, find out. Then put him
back in his doll box

416
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,075
and close the lid.
I'm done playing with him.

417
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:05,742
Thank you.

418
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:09,783
- Hello, Ralph.
- Madam President.

419
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,867
Not quite yet.

420
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,325
- Thanks for holding down the fort.
- It was the honor of my life.

421
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:23,366
And to all of you
for having my back...

422
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,825
Thank you.

423
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:27,450
Mr. Chief Justice.

424
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:28,366
Ma'am.

425
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,283
- Whenever you're ready.
- Now's good.

426
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:36,241
Excuse me.

427
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:39,867
Please place your left hand
on the Bible

428
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,825
and raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

429
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:45,200
Is it the same oath I swore
a hundred days ago?

430
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,075
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,117
Then I'm pretty sure
I got it down.

432
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:58,617
I do solemnly swear that
I shall faithfully execute

433
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,366
the office of the President
of the United States

434
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,783
and will, to the best
of my ability,

435
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:09,450
preserve, protect,
and defend

436
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:13,117
the Constitution
of the United States.

437
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,658
Hear, hear.

438
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:36,950
Aleksandr...

439
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:39,909
I need to ask you something.

440
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:42,408
Of course.

441
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:44,200
Come in a second.

442
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,950
Yevgeny has
a bottle of pills--

443
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,909
the medication I take.

444
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:01,117
Without it...

445
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,992
I'll lose my mind,
I'll... go insane.

446
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,783
I would do anything,

447
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:14,408
anything...

448
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,700
I don't know
if it's possible.

449
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,450
I will try.

450
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,200
We need
the transition protocols...

451
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:53,159
- David said you wanted a word.
- I do.

452
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,408
Please.

453
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:59,366
Is it true about
the new round of sanctions

454
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,283
you're planning to announce
tomorrow?

455
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,700
It is. Am I overplaying?

456
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:07,533
Not at all. The American
people need to know

457
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:10,700
exactly where you stand
on Russia and why.

458
00:35:10,783 --> 00:35:12,408
What then?

459
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:15,283
The policy isn't the problem.
The method is.

460
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:19,200
Executive orders
governing by fiat.

461
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,450
I think you're-- you're
missing an opportunity here.

462
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:23,658
How so?

463
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:27,491
The Russian rebuke is
the perfect bipartisan issue.

464
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,450
Instead
of acting unilaterally,

465
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:32,617
why not bring Congress in
as a partner?

466
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:40,075
Because it's handing our agenda
over to a legislative body

467
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,325
that has forgotten
how to legislate.

468
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,909
You're right, of course.

469
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:47,200
It's not with--
without its risks.

470
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:51,075
But the upside is huge.

471
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,533
Build a bridge now

472
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,075
and push our domestic program
across it later.

473
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,325
Exactly.

474
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,575
I'm not sure
the timing is right.

475
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,950
In this town,

476
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:12,241
it's never a bad time to try
a new way of doing things.

477
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,700
Otherwise, it's just Democrats
and Republicans,

478
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:17,992
Republicans and Democrats,
whipsawing the country to death.

479
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,950
Tell you what, Ralph.

480
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:22,783
Let me think about it.

481
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,200
Of course, Madam President.

482
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,450
- David.
- Thank you.

483
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,575
I can't believe you were
going for that.

484
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:40,241
Oh, I don't know.
It didn't sound like such

485
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:43,117
- a terrible idea to me.
- Come on.

486
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,450
The man has instincts,
Elizabeth, and skills.

487
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,283
Even the other side
likes him.

488
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:49,783
But it's our foot on
their throats for once.

489
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,658
I think that's his point.
Sooner or later,

490
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,491
someone's gonna have to stop
this vicious cycle

491
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:58,117
of partisan advantage
and start exercising

492
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,034
- some restraint when in power.
- Does it have to be me?

493
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:06,491
Okay, okay.

494
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,909
I said I'll think about it.

495
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,450
I will.

496
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:42,366
What else?

497
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,783
Did I hear you say that
Paley's been asking to see me?

498
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:47,283
I'll just tell him
to piss off.

499
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,783
Actually, no,
don't do that.

500
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:53,867
Him, I might want
to talk to.

501
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,150
I see three names,
but no Alexei Gorin.

502
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:22,233
Gorin's a deal-breaker.

503
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:23,483
If she's really
that valuable...

504
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:28,025
I told you, I can't make Gorin
happen even if I wanted to.

505
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,609
Too bad.

506
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:35,817
Chrissake.
I'm offering you three

507
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,567
of the highest-level captures
in the last decade.

508
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,983
No one back in Moscow is much
in the mood to negotiate anyway.

509
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:44,609
Maybe it's better
if you wait a few months.

510
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:45,734
I can't wait a few months.

511
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:49,650
I don't even know if she'll
be alive in a few months.

512
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:52,859
Then... put Gorin back
on the list.

513
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:02,983
_

514
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:10,609
Come on in.

515
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,983
Madam President.

516
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:35,775
I let a terrible thing happen.

517
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,525
People died.

518
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:40,567
I beg your forgiveness.

519
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:46,692
I'm not asking for me.

520
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:51,275
I know I'm not getting out
of this place anytime soon.

521
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,775
I'm asking for my family--
my wife, Sally,

522
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:59,775
my boys, Harry and Sam Jr.,

523
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:02,525
all blameless.

524
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:10,983
I've been in public life
for 40 years.

525
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:14,108
My first job--
Animal Control Lieutenant,

526
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:18,817
Pima County, Arizona.
Literally the dog catcher.

527
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:25,108
I haven't spent a day
in private sector.

528
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:29,191
Never used any of my positions,
including United States Senate,

529
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:31,400
to enrich myself.

530
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:33,275
Maybe it's hard
for you to believe,

531
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,900
but... I'm not a wealthy man.

532
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:40,400
And without my pension,

533
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:43,609
my family won't-- won't
have enough to live on.

534
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,692
Sally... you know...

535
00:40:50,775 --> 00:40:53,483
is not well.

536
00:41:20,692 --> 00:41:22,941
Elizabeth...

537
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:27,025
please, I'm begging you.

538
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:30,525
Punish me, not them.

539
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:42,525
For God's sake,
say something.

540
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,066
Dinner.

541
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:15,233
Cauliflower
and carrot stroganoff.

542
00:43:15,317 --> 00:43:17,817
It is not horrible.

543
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,483
Thanks.

544
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:29,983
Thank you.

545
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,025
Welcome.

546
00:43:35,483 --> 00:43:38,567
Come back later tonight?

547
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,900
Reschedule for
our first press conference,

548
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,066
and Todd will take care
of that...

549
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,567
Let's go, guys.
Mic check. Where's the stand-in?

550
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,567
- What's going on?
- POTUS changed her mind.

551
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:13,150
- I thought you knew.
- Where is she?

552
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,734
In the residence.
She asked not to be disturbed.

553
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,692
Come in.

554
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:30,400
Um... could-- could
we have a moment, please?

555
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:31,900
No, stay.

556
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,325
Don't look so worried, David.

557
00:46:38,117 --> 00:46:40,450
We discussed this--
the East Room,

558
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:42,075
the power walk to the podium,
you're always better

559
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:44,408
- in front of a live audience.
- I'll be fine.

560
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:48,700
Don't tell me you'll be fine.
Tell me what's going on.

561
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:50,825
You're the one who wanted me
to listen to the Vice President.

562
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:55,159
- Well, I have.
- Okay.

563
00:46:55,241 --> 00:46:58,200
That's why I'm moving
the speech to the Oval.

564
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:01,491
I wanna sit down
and speak directly

565
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:03,909
to the American people
from the heart,

566
00:47:03,992 --> 00:47:06,909
- like I did after Lucasville.
- Well, that is hardly the speech

567
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:08,575
that's on the teleprompter
right now.

568
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:09,700
I'm not going to use
the teleprompter.

569
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:12,909
- What?
- You heard me.

570
00:47:12,992 --> 00:47:16,241
I'm gonna wing it,
let the spirit move me.

571
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:18,533
You're kidding.

572
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:20,950
I'm not.

573
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:22,034
You're prepared to blow
your one chance

574
00:47:22,117 --> 00:47:26,700
to reintroduce yourself
to the country?

575
00:47:26,783 --> 00:47:29,575
There is still time.

576
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,617
Let me and Josh
whip something up for you.

577
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,909
No.

578
00:47:36,034 --> 00:47:40,241
Trust me, David.
I got this.

579
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:12,992
Well?

580
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:14,783
What?

581
00:48:14,867 --> 00:48:17,325
Time's up.
You gotta decide.

582
00:48:18,283 --> 00:48:21,992
I told you. I'm not doing it.
No statement.

583
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:25,658
Shame.

584
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:28,533
I was really hoping you'd
make it easy for both of us.

585
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:30,491
Tough shit.

586
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:34,325
You know, it's really not
that much to ask.

587
00:48:34,408 --> 00:48:36,533
Surely I can
change your mind.

588
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:40,200
Not a chance.

589
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:44,533
Even if I told you that
Aleksandr has been reassigned.

590
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:47,658
Consular security in Zurich.

591
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,283
Aleksandr!

592
00:48:57,825 --> 00:49:00,200
You should congratulate him.
It's a promotion.

593
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:03,825
Congratulations.

594
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:07,075
And that pill

595
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:09,950
he brought you last night?

596
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:12,909
Sugar.

597
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,117
I'm sorry to play with
your emotions like this,

598
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
but I hope you can see
your situation

599
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:23,575
a lot more clearly now.

600
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:27,491
Fuck you.

601
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:32,825
Last chance.
Read the statement.

602
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:35,117
I won't ask again.

603
00:49:38,034 --> 00:49:39,450
Go to hell.

604
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:41,450
No.

605
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:47,700
I believe that's where
you're going.

606
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:23,025
Of course, yeah.

607
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:25,983
Is the script good
to go? She's gonna be using it?

608
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,609
Standby studio, 15 seconds.

609
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:40,317
Okay, everybody,
settle down now.

610
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,233
Nice and quiet.
Eight seconds to air.

611
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:46,692
Five, four,

612
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:49,609
three, two...

613
00:50:49,692 --> 00:50:51,442
Ladies and gentlemen,

614
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:53,191
the President of
the United States.

615
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:56,775
Good evening.

616
00:50:56,859 --> 00:50:59,609
I was going to read
a prepared speech tonight

617
00:50:59,692 --> 00:51:04,525
about how Russia has waged
a covert war on my presidency

618
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:07,108
and on our country.

619
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:09,859
Those of you who watched
the Senate hearings yesterday

620
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,358
know what I'm talking about.

621
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:14,692
You should also know
that none of this is new.

622
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:18,025
We have been under one form
of Russian attack or another

623
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,609
since the 1950s.

624
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:21,859
What's different today

625
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:24,734
is what an easy target we are,

626
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:27,775
as deeply divided a nation

627
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:30,066
as I can remember.

628
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:34,983
For this, I must share
some of the blame.

629
00:51:35,066 --> 00:51:37,400
The attack on my life
earlier this year...

630
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:42,692
It scared the hell out of me.

631
00:51:42,775 --> 00:51:47,358
Then it made me really angry,

632
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:49,066
and then I tried to get even.

633
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:52,734
I wasn't above using
the power of this office

634
00:51:52,817 --> 00:51:55,817
to lash out at my enemies.

635
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,650
I don't believe
it was against the law,

636
00:51:57,734 --> 00:52:01,859
but it was wrong.

637
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:04,275
For over 200 years,

638
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:09,775
we have had an angel on
our shoulder in this country.

639
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:11,775
Lately...

640
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:14,941
I've been wondering
where she's gone.

641
00:52:15,025 --> 00:52:16,983
Look around.

642
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:20,150
We're in trouble.
Our democracy is.

643
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,817
And it is not Russia's fault.
It is ours.

644
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,025
We are the ones killing it.

645
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:28,400
When we think
of democracies dying,

646
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:30,108
we think of revolutions,

647
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:32,567
of military coup d'etats,

648
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,734
of armed men in the street.

649
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:38,442
But that's less and less
how it happens anymore.

650
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:41,525
Turkey, Poland, Hungary,

651
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:44,692
Nicaragua, the Philippines...

652
00:52:44,775 --> 00:52:47,775
democracies now die
when we're not looking,

653
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:50,900
when we're not paying attention.

654
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:54,650
And the end rarely comes
in an instant,

655
00:52:54,734 --> 00:52:58,609
but arrives slowly,
like twilight.

656
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:01,442
And at first,

657
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:04,609
our eyes don't notice.

658
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:12,191
I spent much of the afternoon
with Vice President Warner,

659
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:16,692
who I have come to know as
a deeply honorable

660
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:18,317
and decent man.

661
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,025
He and I agree, our country
is at a crisis point,

662
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:25,108
locked in
an existential conflict

663
00:53:25,191 --> 00:53:29,317
over race and identity
and culture.

664
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
The signs are everywhere

665
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:33,817
and flashing red.

666
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,483
Something must change.

667
00:53:36,567 --> 00:53:39,983
Something bold must be done.

668
00:53:40,066 --> 00:53:44,525
I don't pretend
to have all the answers,

669
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:49,191
but I do know I have become
part of the problem.

670
00:53:49,275 --> 00:53:50,941
I open my mouth,

671
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:54,275
and half of you
hear only lies.

672
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:57,025
That's not only unacceptable,

673
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:02,233
but unlikely to change
anytime soon.

674
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:09,859
No single leader
can save a democracy,

675
00:54:09,941 --> 00:54:12,150
but without a leader
you can trust,

676
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:15,859
no democracy can be saved.

677
00:54:15,941 --> 00:54:18,900
For that reason,
effective midnight tonight,

678
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:22,941
I hereby resign the Presidency
of the United States.

679
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:26,150
The Vice President
will be sworn in as President

680
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:29,400
at that time in this office.

681
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,983
People will say I'm stepping
down because I'm weak.

682
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:37,567
I'm not.

683
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,650
I am as strong
as I have ever been.

684
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:45,108
People will say
it's because I'm a woman.

685
00:54:45,191 --> 00:54:47,650
Well, if it takes a woman
to shock this country

686
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:51,066
back to its senses, so be it.

687
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,609
So let's make a promise
here tonight--

688
00:54:58,692 --> 00:55:00,900
an American promise

689
00:55:00,983 --> 00:55:03,150
to each other--

690
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:06,734
That instead of scorching
the earth between us,

691
00:55:06,817 --> 00:55:09,734
we will try every day

692
00:55:09,817 --> 00:55:11,734
to find common ground.

693
00:55:14,692 --> 00:55:17,817
There will be a new President
in the morning.

694
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,775
Help him.

695
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,817
Pray for him.

696
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,525
Our future depends on it.

697
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:31,233
Good night,
and God bless America.

698
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:09,296
_

699
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:29,479
_

700
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:40,025
They're moving our way.

701
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,650
Can we confirm it's her?

702
00:56:41,734 --> 00:56:43,400
90%.

703
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:48,150
What shape's she in?

704
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:49,567
Hard to tell.

705
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:06,233
Shouldn't we be moving, too?

706
00:57:06,317 --> 00:57:08,066
Not yet.

707
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,567
Wanna see her first
with my own eyes.

708
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:50,983
That's her.
Get the prisoners.

709
00:57:59,483 --> 00:58:01,567
Christ. Is that Gorin?

710
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:05,483
Yeah.

711
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,775
I had no idea.

712
00:59:20,941 --> 00:59:22,025
Carrie?

713
00:59:24,108 --> 00:59:27,191
Carrie. You all right?

714
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:29,025
Carrie.

715
00:59:36,483 --> 00:59:38,358
Carrie?

716
00:59:57,233 --> 01:00:02,788

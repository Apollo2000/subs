<i>Samira Noori.</i>

3
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,468
<i>She was married
for a few months</i>

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,469
<i>when G'ulom
killed her husband.</i>

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,721
She go running
back to her village? No.

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,848
She stayed here,
despite the danger,

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:15,724
<i>living as a single woman
in Kabul.</i>

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,268
I found this
in your apartment.

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,728
What do you want?

10
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,729
Your government and mine
are trying

11
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,314
to secure peace
with the Taliban.

12
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,399
<i>General G'ulom is standing
in the way of that.</i>

13
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,652
With this,
he'll have to back down.

14
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,486
We have a deal, then?

15
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,904
We have a deal.

16
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,948
And you'll declare an immediate

17
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,075
countrywide cease‐fire
as we discussed?

18
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,952
Starting tomorrow morning.

19
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,262
You're like a frosted
Lucky Charm, man.

20
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,914
<i>Haven't you noticed?
Dude's been here a week.</i>

21
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>Not a single IED, RPG,</i>

22
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,751
mortar, rocket,
sniper, nothing.

23
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,087
You reached across the aisle
to bridge the divide,

24
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,381
but those fault lines run deep.

25
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,566
<i>And Ben Hayes
is in the perfect position</i>

26
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>to exploit them.</i>

27
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,637
No vice president has ever
challenged a sitting president.

28
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,057
No vice president's ever been
from the opposing party.

29
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Is that you, Ms. Mathison?</i>

30
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>It is, sir.</i>

31
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,913
If we think she was
compromised in Russia...

32
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,605
Why would we give her
the go‐ahead

33
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,357
to meet with a Russian?

34
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,126
<i>To get her to
incriminate herself, right?</i>

35
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,861
<i>We need eyes and ears
on her the whole time.</i>

36
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,839
‐ Where are we going?
‐ We'll talk by the fountain.

37
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,074
<i>I want to make double sure
they can't hear us.</i>

38
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,200
Are you getting this?

39
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,302
I‐I can't make out
a word they're saying.

40
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,287
You really do not remember?

41
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,538
Remember what?

42
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,664
I saved your life...

43
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,749
for one thing.

44
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,500
How much of what they did say

45
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,210
are we gonna be able
to recover?

46
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,312
<i>I'll get the techs
working on it</i>

47
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,713
<i>once we're back
at the station.</i>

48
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,923
You said he was recruitable.
Is he?

49
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,134
He's feeling underappreciated.

50
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,969
He said that?

51
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,138
<i>Provided it's not all
some grand deception.</i>

No, don't fucking "ma'am" me!

115
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,839
Mr. Berenson's fully aware.

116
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,572
Bagram?

117
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,825
That's where we're going?

118
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,703
Yes.

119
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,710
You wanna tell me
where they're sending me?

120
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,958
‐ What a fucking day.
‐ Yeah.

Saul‐‐.

122
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,298
He's coming here,
the president is, in...

123
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,092
Jesus, four hours

124
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,219
to announce
a framework for peace.

125
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,114
He'll be met here
by the Afghan president.

126
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,515
There'll be a reception
at the presidential palace,

127
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,101
where the announcement
will be made.

128
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,812
So that's what the meeting was.

129
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,606
What meeting?

130
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,733
At the station,
everyone was preparing

131
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,610
for the president's arrival.

132
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,945
Oh, yeah,
sorry about the secrecy.

133
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,781
It's a mess getting
your clearance restored.

134
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:37,285
Carrie, president asked
that you be here when he lands,

135
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,245
wants to talk to you.

136
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,622
‐ About what?
‐ Not clear.

137
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,749
I guess you'll find out.

138
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,042
I gotta get to the reception,

139
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,394
make sure everything's
good to go.

140
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,978
You'll ride in later
with the motorcade.

141
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,130
We did it.

142
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,216
Step one, anyway.

143
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,512
I gotta go.

00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,973

What's going on?

151
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,540
A significant announcement

152
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,418
on the status
of the peace talks.

153
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,964
They've reached an agreement,
haven't they‐‐the Americans?

154
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,551
Without input from you or me,

155
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,803
but they expect us
to stand here

156
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,513
and applaud the result.

157
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,516
Who made the deal?

158
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,771
Till now, I assumed you had.

159
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,944
My prime minister
got a call last night

160
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,697
from the president
of the United States, no less,

161
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,659
threatening economic
and travel sanctions

162
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,535
if Pakistan
doesn't get on board.

163
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,455
On board with what, exactly?

164
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,623
Yeah, he wouldn't say.

165
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:34,504
My president just left
to Bagram Airfield

166
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:39,175
to receive a dignitary
coming in for the announcement.

167
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,972
I figure it must be

168
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,516
the secretary of state.

169
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,355
Do you think it's Warner
himself coming here?

170
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,858
I think they don't want us
to know.

171
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,495
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

172
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,579
I need my phone back.

173
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,665
‐ I'm leaving.
‐ Nope.

174
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,959
She'll be staying here
for the duration.

175
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,671
‐ You can't do that.
‐ Yeah, I can.

176
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,674
Go ahead, yell, scream.
I don't give a shit.

177
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,069
Let 'em all know you're still
doing everything in your power

178
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,679
to keep this day
from happening.

179
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,764
So the talks in Doha,
that was all a charade?

180
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,391
You made it a charade.

181
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,518
You snuck around
behind my back.

182
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,437
‐ No.
‐ You went to Haqqani.

183
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,439
Who you tried to kill.

184
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,817
Your ally, and you put a
grenade through his windshield,

185
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,445
which, to be honest, was
the only useful thing you did.

186
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,781
Broke the impasse.

187
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,278
Hmm.

188
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,661
‐ They here?
‐ Just landed.

189
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,120
At least I assume
that's them.

190
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,415
You really talking
to the president?

191
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,352
Did everyone know but me?

192
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,376
So you are, then?

193
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,462
We'll see.

194
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,172
They told me to be on deck
right here.

195
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,474
Mr. President,
been a long time coming.

196
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,185
Too long, sir.

197
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,020
Oh, yes, very good.

198
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,608
Guess you're on.

199
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,992
Oh. Excuse me.

200
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,371
‐ Carrie Mathison.
‐ Mr. President.

201
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,456
‐ It's an honor.
‐ Oh, for me, sir.

202
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,918
Well, no,
I definitely meant for me.

203
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,920
You know, I was thinking
on the flight over

204
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,173
just how much I was
looking forward

205
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,508
to meeting you in person,

206
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:17,138
considering what an important
part you've played in my life.

207
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,699
One could make a pretty good
case I wouldn't be president

208
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,017
if it weren't for you.

209
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,188
I read the reports
more than once.

210
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,525
What you went through
in Moscow,

211
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,569
your captivity there.

212
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,031
It's a profile
in the kind of courage

213
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,907
not many people
can even imagine.

214
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,119
And since I can't
thank you publicly‐‐

215
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,331
apparently there are
sources and methods

216
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,124
that need to be protected‐‐.

217
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,793
I‐I‐I wanted to do so now...

218
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,756
privately, face‐to‐face.

219
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,596
I don't know what to say.

220
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,766
Yeah, you don't have
to say anything.

221
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,018
I'm just glad you're here
to witness this thing

222
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,063
that you helped set in motion,

223
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,774
this ending of a war,

224
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,151
the longest in our history.

225
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,445
Kind of amazing.

226
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,950
‐ It is, isn't it?
‐.

227
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,203
Now, I, uh, want you
to let me know

228
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,347
the minute you get back
to Washington.

229
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,707
I wanna set up something
in the White House for you,

230
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,084
if you're open to that.

231
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,418
Mr. President.

232
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,337
Uh, what's going on, sir?

233
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,214
Oh, sorry,
more need to know,

234
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,423
the last leg in the journey.

235
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:39,428
President Daoud and I will be
flying up to a combat post

236
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,889
to announce the peace
to the soldiers

237
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,225
on the front line
who'll be going home.

238
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,977
And JSOC signed off on it?

239
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,856
First they whined like hell.

240
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,567
If it was up to those guys,
I wouldn't go anywhere.

241
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,904
Mr. President,
are you ready?

242
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,864
Ready, Chief.

243
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,473
So?

244
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,851
We're a decoy.

245
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,394
I should have known.

246
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,811
<i>Chalk One outbound.</i>

247
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,975
<i>Chalk Two outbound.</i>

248
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,440
Roger. Chalk One, squawk ident
zero‐zero‐five‐one.

249
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,152
Chalk Two, squawk ident
zero‐zero‐five‐two.

250
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,321
Cleared visual,
we are radar following.

251
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,454
<i>Speaking Pashto</i>

252
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,370
<i>speaking Pashto.</i>

253
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,354
So what'd he say?

254
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,359
The president,
what did he say?

255
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,612
Nothing, really.

256
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,574
Didn't look like nothing.

257
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,118
It looked, like, intense.

258
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,582
Was it classified?

259
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,958
No.

260
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,502
So?

261
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,882
It was personal.

262
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,886
Oh, if it was personal...

263
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,235
who you got to share it with
besides me?

264
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,647
He thanked me.

265
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,411
For coming here
and getting G'ulom in line?

266
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,944
No, no, it wasn't
about the peace initiative,

267
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,323
not... not mainly, anyway.

268
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,901
‐ He thanked me for Moscow.
‐ Hmm.

269
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,629
What I went through there.

270
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,383
He'd read the files.

271
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,769
Anyway, it was nice to talk
to someone who trusts me.

272
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,987
It's yours.

273
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,285
‐
‐ Samira?

274
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,703
You've got to help me.

275
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,913
What's wrong?

276
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,997
My brother‐in‐law...

277
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,667
<i>speaking Pashto.</i>

278
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,795
He came by with two friends,
Taliban,

279
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,755
<i>to force me to go back
to my village.</i>

280
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,966
‐ Where are they?
‐ <i>Here, right now.</i>

281
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,093
He wants me to be with him.

282
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,596
<i>Yelling in Pashto.</i>

283
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,433
You've got to come get me.

284
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,018
How far are we from the palace?

285
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,688
Twenty minutes out.

286
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,064
<i>Carrie.</i>

287
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,065
I'll be there as soon as I can.

288
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,501
You've got to come now.

289
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,571
I will. Just‐‐.

290
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:47,319
<i>Now!</i>

291
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,384
‐ Go straight.
‐ We can't.

292
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,945
This motorcade's a fake.
A woman's life is on the line.

293
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,097
We owe her.

294
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,389
Helicopters
are two minutes out.

295
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,515
This is bullshit, Sarge.

296
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,167
No VIP's gonna stick
his nose in here.

297
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,626
You done?

298
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,337
All good, Max?

299
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,092
All good?

300
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,386
Outside in two.

301
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,144
You know
who the big shot is, Maxie?

302
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,730
Some general,
isn't it?

303
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,733
How many stars?
One? Two?

304
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,485
Three?

305
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,862
Four?

306
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,823
Five.

307
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,292
Fall in!

308
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,833
<i>Chalk One on the ground.</i>

309
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,143
Okay, we got video feed
from Steedley now.

310
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,670
Put it up.

311
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,488
<i>Chalk Two on final approach.</i>

312
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:31,859
They've landed.
We have video.

313
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,236
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Pleasure to meet you, sir.

314
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,696
Yeah.

315
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,246
Ladies and gentlemen...

316
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,168
An hour ago,
President Daoud welcomed.

317
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,589
President Ralph Warner
to Bagram Air Force Base.

318
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,676
They will be here
to meet you all soon.

319
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,638
But first they wanted to send
a message about peace...

320
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,516
from the front line
of the war.

321
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,443
Hi.

322
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,279
Mr. Vice President,
they're ready for you

323
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,448
in the Situation Room.

324
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,366
You preempted every network?

325
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,490
<i>I'm reporting live outside
the Afghan Ministry of...</i>

326
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,955
We discussed it
before the president left.

327
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,249
As I said, everything's set up
in the Situation Room.

328
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,333
No, I'm good.

329
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,774
‐ Piotrowski?
‐ Yes.

330
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,526
That's your ride.
Have your shit ready.

331
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,610
It is.

332
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,032
Fuck me, it's the president.

333
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:02,908
Who's the dude with him?

334
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,452
The president of Afghanistan,
dumb-ass.

335
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,537
Oh.

336
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,423
<i>Good afternoon,
Mr. President.</i>

337
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:30,977
Bring 'em in, Lieutenant.

338
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,356
At ease, guys.
Bring it in tight.

339
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,654
Take a knee in the front.

340
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,852
Gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

341
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:54,001
to introduce my good friend
President Daoud.

342
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,587
It's an honor to meet you all.

343
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,671
<i>For both of us.</i>

344
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,014
When I told the military
and the secret service

345
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,933
I wanted to come up here,
they advised against it.

346
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,853
But you know what?

347
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,856
Thing about being
commander in chief,

348
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,190
you <i>are</i> the chief.

349
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,072
I'm sure you all know
how this base got its name,

350
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,534
from Corporal Brett Steedley
of Galesburg, Illinois,

351
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,830
killed in an ambush
March 13, 2007.

352
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,584
Two thousand seven...

353
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,667
when most of you men were
still in the fifth grade.

354
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,344
<i>Since then, this base has
suffered more casualties,</i>

355
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,514
<i>endured more pain,
and demanded more courage</i>

356
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,640
<i>than anywhere in the world</i>

357
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,685
<i>where our troops
have to fight.</i>

358
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,230
<i>You hold the line.
You don't back down.</i>

359
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,984
<i>"I'm sure you often
ask yourselves, "Why?</i>

360
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,403
Why do we have to risk
our lives,

361
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:07,074
spill our blood and treasure
for a tiny outpost

362
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,034
"7,000 miles from home?"

363
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,997
We're here to tell you why.

364
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,751
<i>Your courage and sacrifice</i>

365
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,921
<i>and the sacrifices of those
who held this post before you</i>

366
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,564
<i>have convinced the enemy
that he cannot,</i>

367
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,592
<i>he will not win this war.</i>

368
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,553
<i>After 18 long years,</i>

369
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,932
<i>he has agreed
to negotiate for peace.</i>

370
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,029
‐ Samira?
‐ Yeah.

371
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,215
They're pressuring her
to leave.

372
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,573
She can't stall much longer.

373
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,952
Look at that.

374
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,787
He's doing it.

375
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,789
Peace is really happening.

376
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,209
Hey, Amin,

377
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,585
we gotta get through this.

378
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,612
<i>Gentlemen, I wanna
tell you one more thing.</i>

379
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:13,890
<i>I‐I‐I know folks back home
in America are watching too.</i>

380
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,478
<i>Before I left Washington,
I had a phone call,</i>

381
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,021
<i>a long phone call</i>

382
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,858
<i>with Taliban leader
Haissam Haqqani,</i>

383
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,609
<i>and we spoke about
how we can bring peace</i>

384
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,319
<i>to this beautiful country.</i>

385
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:30,073
<i>We have our differences still,</i>

386
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:33,285
<i>but we agreed
on two fundamental things:</i>

387
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,871
<i>No terrorist group
will ever find refuge</i>

388
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,831
<i>in this country again,</i>

389
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,916
<i>and the people of Afghanistan
will be free</i>

390
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,419
<i>to live the lives
they all wanna live‐‐</i>

391
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,962
<i>man, woman, and child.</i>

392
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,674
Jesus, I'm weeping
all over my shoes.

393
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,218
Look at him,
grandpa in a flak jacket.

394
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,805
It's all about winning
a second term, isn't it?

395
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,349
It's about ending the war.

396
00:32:56,433 --> 00:33:01,188
<i>And this is what Emir Haqqani
and I really agree on,</i>

397
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,107
<i>and it is the best guarantor
of peace between us.</i>

398
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,737
<i>Neither one of us are prepared</i>

399
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,964
to send any more
of our countries'

400
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,698
sons and daughters
to die for us here.

401
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,910
Enough.
We end it now.

402
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,829
Time for you to come home.

403
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,913
Yeah!

404
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,228
Lieutenant... well done.

405
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,938
‐ Mr. President.
‐ Soldier.

406
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,123
You mind if I take
a picture?

407
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,507
Thank you.
Oh, please, let's do it.

408
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,947
<i>‐ Where are you from, soldier?
‐ Washington, sir.</i>

409
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,366
<i>‐ Oh, close to the power.</i>
‐.

410
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,077
He needs to get a move on.

411
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,995
Twelve minutes behind schedule.

412
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,964
So what's the plan?

413
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,692
Brother‐in‐law and two Taliban
in the apartment,

414
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,052
could be armed.

415
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,349
We try to extricate Samira,
they probably resist,

416
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,102
which could mean gunfire,
which is the last thing we want

417
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,187
in Kabul right now,
breaking the cease‐fire.

418
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,066
So what's the plan?

419
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,406
‐
‐ Carrie?

420
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:58,263
Max, you don't get it.
You can't leave.

421
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,682
You heard him.
You're all going home.

422
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,267
When?

423
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:02,851
You hear him say that?

424
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,020
We could be here months.

425
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,646
Nothing happens quickly
in the army.

426
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,982
Piotrowski!

427
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,921
Come on, Piotrowski,
we're out of here.

428
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,032
Hey.

429
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,701
I'm not going.

430
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,874
Suit yourself.

431
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,916
Mr. Vice President.

432
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,796
‐
‐ Oh, thank you.

433
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,968
Thank you, bless you.

434
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,153
- ‐ Thank you.
- ‐ Thank you.

435
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,617
Thank you for everything
you've done.

436
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,471
- ‐ Just amazing, Saul.
- ‐ Aw, bless you.

437
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,765
‐ Just amazing.
‐ Thank you.

438
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,129
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

439

<i>Speaking Pashto.</i>

00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,885
Don't fucking move.

‐
‐ It's all right.

445
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,788
You're safe now.

446
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,501
It's okay. It's okay.

447
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,054
Our allies the Americans
have treated us

448
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,766
with their usual courtesy.

449
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,969
Do you know what I found
interesting about the speech?

450
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,815
Warner said they'd been
talking to Haqqani

451
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,167
and would be meeting him
very soon,

452
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,485
which must mean here in Kabul.

453
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,157
I thought you controlled
Haqqani.

454
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,690
I thought you controlled Kabul.

455
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,167
You'll excuse me, ma'am.
Saul, will you come with me?

456
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,881
Wanna tell me what's up?

457
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,466
Not here.

458
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,077
Well?

459
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,537
Bagram ATC got a report

460
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,747
from AWACS shadowing
the Steedley mission.

461
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,208
Four minutes ago,

462
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,019
the president's helicopter
disappeared off radar.

463
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:39,919
Jesus Christ.

464
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,171
Did it crash?

465
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,923
It's unknown.

466
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,592
What's the escort helicopter
say?

467
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,093
‐ Didn't see it.
‐ Didn't see?

468
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,096
Isn't that their sole
fucking job to keep an eye?

469
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,721
Holy fuck.

470
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,641
Two presidents...

471
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,019
I know.

472
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,770
Two presidents on board.

473
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,109
‐ Where we going?
‐ CIA station.

474
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,737
It's closer than Bagram.

475
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,698
We have fighter cover
overhead.

476
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,493
Every available air asset
is heading to the area.

477
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,329
Quick Reaction Force
is en route.

478
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,664
CIA officers have been
recalled from the field.

479
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,837
What's that mean, "RTB"?

480
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,466
Return to base immediately.

481
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,050
‐ Because of me?
‐ No, no, no.

482
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,718
It's something else.

483
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,095
What?

484
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,682
I don't know.

485
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,520
What are we looking at?

486
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,606
Camera on Chalk One,
the escort.

487
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,437
Got something,
three o'clock, low!

488
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,232
Wreckage spotted:
Victor Lima

489
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,860
one‐five‐four‐two‐
zero‐five‐five‐eight.

490
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,541
Is the White House
seeing this?

491
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,624
Yes, sir.

492
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,512
- ‐ Please.
- ‐ Sir.

493
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,826
- ‐ Who's in charge?
- ‐ What, here?

494
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,454
Technically, you.

495
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,477
No, there.

496
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,788
Search and rescue is being run

497
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,147
out of Kabul Station, sir.

498
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,857
That's where Saul Berenson is,

499
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,900
and General Owens
is the ranking officer.

500
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,152
Was it shot down?

501
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,408
Well, was it?

502
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,242
The cause of the crash
is unknown, sir.

503
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,160
Aren't they gonna land

504
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,912
to see if he's...

505
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:20,788
to see if anyone's...

506
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,352
The incline's too steep
for a landing.

507
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,420
Well, can you
fast rope down?

508
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,255
Negative, too much tree cover.

509
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,424
We need to find an LZ.

510
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,507
On it.

511
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,189
Amin will take care of you.

512
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,361
How long will you be?

513
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,696
I'll be back as soon as I can.

514
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,615
You're safe here, I promise.

515
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,142
Saul?

516
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,393
What's happened?

517
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:28,189
President's helicopter's down.

518
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,110
How?

519
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,111
Chalk One, possible LZ

520
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,322
one nautical mile,
bearing zero‐nine‐zero.

521
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,075
Roger, one nautical mile,
heading zero‐niner‐zero.

522
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,181
Hey, this work?

523
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,561
Perfect!

524
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,688
On approach.

525
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,067
What the fuck?

526
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,069
Taliban.

527
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,946
Targets, two o'clock!

528
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:17,572
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

529
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,491
Chalk One, break contact.

530
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,529
RPG on your six.
Clear to engage.

531
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,891
Chalk One,
this is Flight Ops.

532
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,350
Do you read me?

533
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,480
<i>Repeat, Chalk One,
do you read me?</i>

534
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:53,776
Tony.

535
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,112
Chalk One?

535
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:59,668

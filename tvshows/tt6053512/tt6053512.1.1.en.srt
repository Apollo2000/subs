1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,766
<i>I'm a reporter.</i>

2
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:20,896
<i>I know it seems weird, but I've beenlike this for as long as I can remember.</i>

3
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,245
<i>I think if they cut me open,I would bleed ink.</i>

4
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>My dad is a reporter too.</i>

5
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,627
<i>My mom says we're like Holmes and Watson.</i>

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,014
<i>My dad says that finding the truthis what makes everything work right.</i>

7
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,774
<i>I need to know the truth.</i>

8
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,279
<i>But since I'm a kid,people lie to me all the time.</i>

9
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,533
<i>So I learned how to look at thingsand really see them.</i>

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>I write my own paper.</i>

11
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,330
<i>And self-publish.</i>

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,338
<i>My sister thinks it's a joke.</i>

13
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,676
<i>But it's my way of figuring outwhat's real.</i>

14
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,224
<i>My dad told mewe have to move across country</i>

15
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:43,437
<i>so he can work on his book,but I know it's because he lost his job.</i>

16
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:53,572
<i>He's trying to be happy to make it seemlike everything's gonna be okay.</i>

17
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,284
<i>But I know that he's sad.</i>

18
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,633
<i>So we're going to stayat my grandpa's house,</i>

19
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,551
<i>since he moved to an old folks' home.</i>

20
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,262
<i>My mom and dadsay we're there to be near him,</i>

21
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>but I think it's because it's free,and we don't have anywhere else to go.</i>

22
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,937
<i>I'm sad to inform youthat this will be the last editorial</i>

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>for </i>The Bed Stuy Beat.

24
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,946
<i>I'm moving to a place called Erie Harbor,where my dad grew up.</i>

25
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,491
<i>They say it's pretty and perfect...</i>

26
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>but I know that nothing ever is.</i>

27
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,051
All right, let's go unpack. You okay?

28
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,386
Okay, guys. We're here.

29
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,268
All right, let's do it.

30
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,524
Hilde, you okay? I got ya.

31
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,570
Why do people think New York's so scary?

32
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,031
At least in an alley,someone might hear you scream.

33
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,825
Why would anybody need to hear you scream?

34
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,203
I don't know.Like if you get mugged or something.

35
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,414
There's no mugging in Erie Harbor,or honking or pollution.

36
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,625
That is why we are here.It'll be an adventure.

37
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,211
-A vacation.-A vacation. Yeah, you said that.

38
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,796
But we don't go to school on vacation.

39
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,339
You probably would.

40
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,594
Just be honest.We're not going back to Brooklyn, are we?

41
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,471
Yeah. Of course we are.

42
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,431
-Yeah, in a couple of months.-Yeah.

43
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,558
You know, you kidswill see out the school year and--

44
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,894
-And we will regroup, yep.-Exactly. We'll regroup.

45
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,481
Yep. Last one to pick out a bedsleeps in the basement.

46
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,367
Hey, you.

47
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,083
Hey, you know,I think it's gonna be nice here.

48
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,710
I mean, look at that.You got a front yard to play in.

49
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:58,799
You know, I'll get a ton of work done.Yeah. It's gonna be nice.

50
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,929
You said the word "nice" twice.Say it again and I'm calling the police.

51
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,975
Hey, what were you writing in the car?

52
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,227
Can I take a look?

53
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,105
Let's see.

54
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,485
Hilde. Come on. It was just a yard sale.

55
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,613
-But she didn't have any customers.-Well, so what?

56
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,282
What about the guy with the shovel?

57
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,701
Do you thinkhe was digging something up or burying it?

58
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,663
He was probably just planting something.You know, people plant.

59
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,914
I mean, they really do.

60
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,250
All right, listen up, you.

61
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:39,256
Life is not alwaysabout chasing the story, okay?

62
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,259
You got to enjoy yourself. It's okay.

63
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,844
You understand?

64
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,470
You sound like Mom.

65
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,890
-Yeah. Well, you sound like me.-You're cold.

66
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,934
I know. Well, don't be like me.You don't wanna be like me.

67
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,025
Help me up.

68
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,903
-Dad.<i>-Richie!</i>

69
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,988
Dad? Dad?

70
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,243
Yeah. Yeah, come on, come on.Let's get inside

71
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,996
before this peace and quietdrives us both insane, right?

72
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,089
Give me back my camera.

73
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,802
It's weird. Stop.

74
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,599
-"Look at it"? I'm not gonna break it.-Sorry.

75
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,649
...go and hike in the woods.Hike in the woods.

76
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,816
How fun is that?

77
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,027
Love you.

78
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,406
Stop.

79
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,203
Oh, my God.

80
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,457
Maybe you should reach out to your editor.

81
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,793
So he can fire me again?

82
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,127
I'd rather not.

83
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,047
You know, besides,I'm done reporting the news.

84
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,050
Okay. Well, maybeI should go back to work.

85
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,095
Between your dad's careand what we ran through in New York,

86
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,513
I think I might have to.

87
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,808
It helps that we can live here for free.

88
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,436
Yeah, well, if we couldlive anywhere else,

89
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,564
believe me, we would.

90
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,108
Hey.

91
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,652
Hey, come here.

92
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,155
I'm okay.

93
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,828
Look, I know this is notwhat you signed up for.

94
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,580
-Yeah.-And I'm sorry.

95
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:41,461
I promise that I'm not gonna let anythingcome between us again, okay.

96
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:52,134
-Izzy!-Breakfast! Sorry, babe.

97
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,179
Did anyone see the caroutside our house last night?

98
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,680
And here we go.

99
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,973
Why? Where was it?

100
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,476
Street side. Rolled off at about 4:32 a.m.

101
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,228
"About 4:32 a.m."

102
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,939
Whoa, whoa, whoa.No, no. You were awake?

103
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,775
Okay, well.We all excited about our first day?

104
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,820
Are we all excited about our first day?

105
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,614
-Yes.-Yes. Are we?

106
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,241
-Why are you deflecting?-What? I'm not deflecting.

107
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,619
-What's deflecting?-No one's deflecting.

108
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,162
We're just talking, okay?

109
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,874
-Why do you always ask so many questions?-That was a question.

110
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,001
You can neverjust let anything go, can you?

111
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,212
Of course I can.

112
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,339
Really? Go ahead. Let it go.

113
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,883
Let's just have a super chill breakfast.

114
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,426
Come on. It'll be fun.

115
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,472
Look at her. She's just eating.

116
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,724
Just enjoying her food.

117
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,894
Not thinking about anything else.

118
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,563
Nothing else. Just her food.

119
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,657
This looks great.

120
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,451
I think it was an undercover cop car.

121
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:02,037
It had those hubcapsand spotlight on the driver's side,

122
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,872
-and I was like, "Oh--"-See? I told you.

123
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,207
-Hey.-Can you tell her to stop being

124
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,584
-such a nosy little S-H-I-T?-Language.

125
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,838
I'm a journalist. I can spell.

126
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,382
Okay, Hilde.The journalist thing's not a thing.

127
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,343
She had a hundred "perscribers"in Brooklyn.

128
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,428
"Subscribers," but thank you.

129
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,014
Hilde, I thought you said you weregonna stop this once you got here.

130
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,724
You know, so you can be normal.

131
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,893
I never said that. You said that.

132
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,145
Well, what are you gonna report onin Erie Harbor anyway?

133
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,690
An American flagthat beats up an apple pie?

134
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,192
Mom, stop.

135
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,946
Look, I'm just saying, that guy outsidelooked like he wanted to...

136
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,868
M-U-R-D-E-R us.

137
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,703
-I can too.-What?

138
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,371
-Spell.-Yeah. Okay.

139
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,998
-Time-out, guys.-No.

140
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,877
You know, everything's--everything's gonna be fine, okay? Yes?

141
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,044
-It's gonna be awesome.-Yeah.

142
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,296
-Yes?-Yeah.

143
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,630
All right. Thank you.

144
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,382
-Here you go.-Will you have some fruit, please?

145
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,857
-Great. I'll pick you up at 3:00---Bridget, don't pull all the way to the--

146
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,234
-God. Never mind.-Honey. I'm not even--

147
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,319
Bridget.

148
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,821
Take care of your sister,and my name is Mom!

149
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,870
Okay. Okay, give it back.

150
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,708
Did you see his outfit?

151
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,557
It's snowing! Don't freeze to death.

152
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,767
Yeah.

153
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,269
Okay. Be very serious.

154
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,439
No laughing. Snow.

155
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,191
Don't freeze.

156
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,570
Okay. Grab all the snow.Grab all the snow.

157
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,615
It's freezing out. Two. Yeah.

158
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,909
But be very serious. No laughing.

159
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,536
No laughing. Very serious.

160
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,665
Let's make snow angels. Ready?Snow angels.

161
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,355
Watch the viburnums.

162
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,482
Sorry.

163
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,537
Where are the prices?

164
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,038
For what?

165
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,875
Anything. Like, what about this?

166
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,836
You drink coffee?

167
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,506
I love coffee,but my parents only let me drink decaf.

168
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,095
Take it. Welcome to the neighborhood.

169
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,014
How'd you know we just got here?

170
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,850
Small town.

171
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,310
Well, why are youhaving a yard sale right now?

172
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,813
-Everyone's busy.-You're here.

173
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,606
But grown-ups have all the money.

174
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,525
Do you have a yard sale every day?

175
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,778
I'm a reporter.

176
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,576
So, you are Matt Lisko's kid, aren't you?

177
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,871
Your dad and I used to be friends.

178
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,164
Haven't seen him for a while.

179
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,793
He okay?

180
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,338
Why wouldn't he be?

181
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,259
When he left, he always saidthat he would never move back here.

182
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,887
He did? How come?

183
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,224
You wanna know the best wayto keep a secret?

184
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,894
Pretend there isn't one.

185
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,901
Can you do me a favor?

186
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,310
Ooh. Can I play?

187
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,063
Hey. Hey, how was school today?

188
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,523
How was writing today?

189
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,484
-Yeah. Okay, touché, touché.-What does that mean?

190
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,737
That means I'm tryingto change the subject.

191
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,449
That's what that means.It's French, and it's fancy.

192
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,868
All right, you. All right, it's late.

193
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,996
Look, I'm glad you're out exploring,

194
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,790
but I need you to be homebefore it gets dark, okay?

195
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,086
It's called magic hour, okay?

196
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,799
Then why would I wanna come home?

197
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,720
Well, because it is a new town,and because I asked you to.

198
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,307
It's okay. The ladywith the weird yard sale walked me home.

199
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,433
Ms. Gillis.

200
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,521
-Wait. What?-Yeah. Ms. Gillis.

201
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,690
She told me you used to be friends.

202
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,068
-Penny Gillis?-Yes.

203
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:54,324
Yeah. Yeah.We-- We went to high school together.

204
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,453
Yeah, and she left somethingout on the lawn for you.

205
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,304
Let's hit the jumps.

206
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,769
Richie!

207
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,528
Oh, I thought you'd like it.

208
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,573
I do.

209
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,243
I do. I-- I love it.

210
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:43,207
What did she say, Ms. Gillis,when she gave that to you?

211
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,460
She said thatyou'd be happy to have it back.

212
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,214
And that she has something else for you.

213
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,716
Okay.

214
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,054
Wow.

215
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,118
<i>You know the resultsof the latest Gallup poll?</i>

216
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:23,163
<i>Half the country nevereven heard of the word Watergate.</i>

217
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,831
<i>Nobody gives a shit.</i>

218
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,335
<i>You guys are probably pretty tired, right?</i>

219
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,046
<i>Well, you should be. Go on home.</i>

220
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,675
<i>Get a nice, hot bath.Rest up 15 minutes.</i>

221
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,302
<i>Then get your asses back in gear.</i>

222
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,264
<i>We're under a lot of pressure, you know,and you put us there.</i>

223
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,978
Nothing's riding on this except forthe First Amendment to the Constitution,

224
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,815
and the freedom of the press,and maybe the future of the country.

225
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:24,433
Follow me.

226
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,026
Time of death, 9:08 p.m.

227
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,495
Hey. Hey.

228
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,081
You need to get outta here, now.

229
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:51,376
But I know Ms. Gillis.I was just with her today.

230
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,462
-I got this.-Yeah.

231
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:57,883
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.Well, she had an accident.

232
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,635
No. Hey, hey.

233
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,304
Look, this is an active investigation,sweetheart.

234
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,972
You could disrupt evidence.

235
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,725
Of what? You said it was an accident.

236
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,439
It's late. Shouldn't you be asleep?

237
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,443
-What's your name?-I'm Hilde Lisko.

238
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,028
Sheriff?

239
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,908
Heard it on the scanner.

240
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,537
Penny Gillis fell down a flight of stairschanging a light bulb.

241
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,413
Any signs of foul play?

242
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,999
No, come on. In Erie Harbor? Come on.

243
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,504
It's just a shame she lives alone.She probably would've been all right.

244
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,759
Man, it's like this family is cursed.

245
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,261
Yeah.

246
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,518
She had an accident, you understand?

247
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,354
There's nothing to be afraid of.

248
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,540
-Yeah?-Hi. I'm a reporter for the news.

249
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:44,489
<i>Nothing's riding on this exceptthe First Amendment to the Constitution,</i>

250
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,659
<i>freedom of the press,and maybe the future of the country.</i>

251
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,797
-Principal Collins.<i>-Have you read this?</i>

252
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,633
<i>My child thinksthere's a murderer in Erie Harbor.</i>

253
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:45,717
I'm reading it.

254
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,313
-What did you do?-I'm a journalist.

255
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:01,567
-No, you're a fourth grader.-You sent this to the whole effing school?

256
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,694
Izzy, language.

257
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,947
-Technically, effing isn't---Hilde, not now.

258
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,491
Look, you left the housein the middle of the night?

259
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,828
-Come on. What were you thinking?-Mom said we could have more freedom here.

260
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,538
Yeah, well, that's gone now.

261
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,583
Someone we know got murdered last night.

262
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,585
Okay. Come on, Ginny. Screen time.

263
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,922
Okay, first of all, you don't know that.

264
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:26,008
The shed was ransacked.There are weird footprints,

265
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,552
-signs of forced entry. There was---Yeah, it could have been the paramedics.

266
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,263
You think about that?No, you-- You know what?

267
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,724
I'm not-- I'm not going there with you.

268
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,310
She was your friend.Don't you wanna know what happened?

269
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,777
I don't understand.You used to take me out

270
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,739
and cover homicidesin the South Bronx all the time.

271
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,783
Yeah, well, that's 'causewe couldn't afford a babysitter, okay?

272
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,827
I don't believe you.How is this any different?

273
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,414
All right, look, this is a small town.You know, and New York was bigger.

274
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,042
Nobody was keeping trackof what crime was happening and when.

275
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,710
Here, everyone knows everything.

276
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,338
Here, everyone's hiding everything!

277
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,883
I'm not gonna just make nice,if that's what you're asking me to do.

278
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,426
Come on. That's not what it is.

279
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:14,014
Okay, maybe it is a little bitof what it is, but that's not the point.

280
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,851
Ever since we got here,you've been acting weird.

281
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:21,230
And this house?There's stuff I've never noticed before.

282
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:23,440
Oh, God, just go to school.

283
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:26,652
Come home. Do your homework.Eat, sleep, rinse, repeat.

284
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,362
It's not that hard.

285
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,700
You'd have never let a story like this go.

286
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,369
Damn it, Hilde!

287
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,497
Why can't you just be a little kidfor once in your life?

288
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,415
Huh?

289
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,717
It's okay, Dad.

290
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,136
I know you didn't mean it.

291
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,014
God.

292
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:03,480
Hey. Hey, hey.

293
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:04,648
I'm sorry.

294
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,277
Okay? That wasn't cool.I didn't mean that.

295
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,778
-Yeah.-Hilde-- Hilde.

296
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,833
Help your sister out a little.Help your sister!

297
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,710
Okay. I heard you.

298
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,587
Have a great day, honey. Love you.

299
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,671
Yep.

300
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,948
I mean, she just comes hereand starts shit out of nowhere.

301
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,450
There she is.

302
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,586
What a weirdo.

303
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,881
I've had 20 calls this morningfrom angry parents.

304
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,800
I don't know what things are likein New York, but this is a quiet town.

305
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,262
And it's developmentally inappropriatefor her age.

306
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:20,474
Yeah, with all due respect,Hilde is an unusual case.

307
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:24,061
With all due respect, every parentthinks their child is exceptional.

308
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,439
But at this school,Hilde is like any other kid.

309
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:30,901
If she breaks the rules,she has to face the consequences.

310
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,445
Listen, I may have yogurt on my shirt,

311
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,366
and I look like I haven't--I haven't showered in a week because,

312
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,201
you know, I haven't.

313
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:43,455
But I'm also a former public defender,so I know a thing or two about rules,

314
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:45,958
and my daughter has not brokenany of them.

315
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:52,089
I'm sure her extracurricular activitieshave been inconvenient for you,

316
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:56,343
but my guess is that you're firingthis trumped-up warning shot across my bow

317
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,470
so that when you feel likepursuing disciplinary action,

318
00:27:58,554 --> 00:27:59,763
you'll have a proper paper trail.

319
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,515
-Is that about right?-Mrs. Lisko.

320
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,891
Bridget.

321
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:06,019
Hey. What are you in for?

322
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,815
-I'm---Just-- Just kidding.

323
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,192
I totally read your article. I'm Donny.

324
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,487
-I'm---But maybe we should pretend

325
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,824
you don't know me for a couple of days,maybe a week, you know?

326
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,325
Until this whole thing blows over.

327
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:23,745
Fair enough.

328
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:27,040
What about you? What'd you do?

329
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,966
You feelin' the wiggle?

330
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,052
That's the best part. That's the stuff.

331
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:42,222
You and I both know that the worldisn't always kind to troublemakers.

332
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,849
Especially little girls.

333
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:46,435
If a little boy did what Hilde did,he wouldn't be in trouble.

334
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:47,811
He would be the school president.

335
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,857
Your daughter made up a storyabout a woman being murdered.

336
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,736
My daughter writes a newspaperin her spare time.

337
00:28:56,361 --> 00:29:01,366
She is nine years old,and she has a passion in life.

338
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,703
She has work that she lovesmore than anything else.

339
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,413
I never had that,

340
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:09,708
and I am guessing by that half-assedinspirational cat poster

341
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,876
that you didn't either.

342
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,378
You mean the poster my colleaguesgot me as a present

343
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,547
when the school board finallygave me this job

344
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,383
after offering it to two menwho were far less qualified than me?

345
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,678
So, yeah, I know all about being a girl.

346
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,059
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,604
You're right. But you don't know Hilde.

348
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,691
She's not like any other kid.She's my kid.

349
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,735
And I'm her mom.

350
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:39,363
So no matter how tired I am,

351
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,241
or how exhausting it can beto deal with someone

352
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,118
who is so tiny and so driven,

353
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:49,081
I am going to make damn surenobody crushes her dreams.

354
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,381
Well, both problem setswere exactly the same.

355
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,799
Because she copied off me.

356
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,510
Yeah. I'm gonna sayyou copied off her, okay?

357
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:05,639
Thanks, Baby Einstein.You can leave now. Bye!

358
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,558
But it's not the truth.

359
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,686
Who cares? What are you gonna do about it?

360
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,813
Write an article about mein your stupid little paper?

361
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,066
You know what? Go ahead.Any press is good press.

362
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,368
Hilde.

363
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:43,135
<i>Life is not alwaysabout chasing the story, okay?</i>

364
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,596
<i>Hilde, I thought you said you weregonna stop this once you got here.</i>

365
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,139
<i>You know, so you can be normal.</i>

366
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,640
<i>Hilde, not now.</i>

367
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,602
<i>Why can't you just be a little kidfor once in your life?</i>

368
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,902
<i>You guys are probably pretty tired, right?</i>

369
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,988
<i>Well, you should be. Go on home.</i>

370
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,575
<i>Get a nice, hot bath.Rest up 15 minutes.</i>

371
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,785
<i>Then get your asses back in gear.</i>

372
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,232
My name's Hilde Lisko.

373
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,401
Sergeant Miller's kid already came bywith the Thin Mints.

374
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:45,531
No. I wanna see a copyof the police report

375
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:48,867
for the incident at 215 Oakdale Ave.

376
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,787
Uh-huh. You need to settle down.

377
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,791
Why can't I see the police report?It's a matter of public record.

378
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,251
Why aren't you at school?

379
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,878
Because crime doesn't careif it's third period.

380
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,880
Hello again, little lady.

381
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,466
I'm not going away.

382
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,470
Can someone deal with this?

383
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,348
I warned her. I explained to her--

384
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,642
Nevertheless, I persisted.

385
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,479
Okay, Senator. Come with me.

386
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:26,405
All right. So, sit.

387
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,658
Hold on. Let me get this for you.

388
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,911
Sit right there. Sit.

389
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,544
You know you can get into a lot of troublesaying something is murder when it isn't.

390
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:44,381
Well, by the way people are acting,looks like I was right.

391
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,595
I need to see the Penny Gillis file.

392
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,100
No, I can't do that.

393
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,853
You girls crack the case yet?

394
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,445
You know what? I changed my mind.

395
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,489
I'm gonna get you that file.

396
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,827
I can't show you everything,but here's what I got.

397
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:39,895
Something's missing.

398
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,106
It was a machine on the table,

399
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,402
and it was, like, right here.

400
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:51,865
It looked like...

401
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:54,576
this.

402
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,287
A VCR?

403
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,330
Yes.

404
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,457
What's a VCR?

405
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,544
-It's horrible.-It's not good.

406
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,630
"This article, or paper,or whatever you call it, is so lame."

407
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:07,756
Oh, that's not good.

408
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,971
-Keep---"Doesn't this girl have parents?"

409
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,931
I mean, come on.You know what? Turn off the comments.

410
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,475
She doesn't need to see this.

411
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,145
Look, I'm gonna print it out first,just in case.

412
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,605
In case what?

413
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:26,859
Well, remember whenI got all those death threats?

414
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,737
Yeah, you taught me,always hold onto corroborating evidence.

415
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,739
Death threats?

416
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,408
Matt, this is our kid.

417
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,620
You know, maybe we just needto tell her she needs to stop doing this.

418
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:41,790
Bridge, come on.That's not gonna do any good.

419
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,625
Look, you know she's gonna do it anyway.

420
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,004
I'll just tell her nobody commented. Okay?

421
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,840
You know what? I'm done.

422
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:54,887
Lisko. I know that name.

423
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,806
My dad's a reporterfor the<i> New York Sentinel.</i>

424
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:02,811
Well, was. He was covering this caseabout a missing girl.

425
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:05,063
Just couldn't let it go.

426
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,608
I think that's why he got fired.

427
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:11,320
He's always been--Well, he used to be like me.

428
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,448
Can't let something gountil he figures it out.

429
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,077
Well, I wonder if he lived here in '88.

430
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:20,996
What do you mean?

431
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,625
Well, it was before I came to town,but I heard about it.

432
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,085
The mayor's kid went missing.

433
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,837
His name was Richie Fife.

434
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:39,014
<i>He was abducted one nightwhile he was riding his bike home.</i>

435
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,850
<i>Everyone started locking their doors.</i>

436
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,310
<i>People moved away.</i>

437
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,437
<i>I mean,they caught the guy who did it, but...</i>

438
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,899
<i>they never found outwhat happened to Richie.</i>

439
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,237
What do the cops think happened?

440
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,031
I don't know.

441
00:35:56,865 --> 00:36:00,494
They never released the file,and once it was in the past,

442
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,539
folks around herewanted it to stay that way.

443
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,958
Well, do you thinkthey caught the right guy?

444
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:17,219
Actually, the person they arrestedfor Richie's murder...

445
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,098
that was Penny Gillis's brother.

446
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,396
Keep diggin'.

447
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:34,069
Hey. Everything I said here...

448
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:37,698
You do knowwhat an anonymous source is, right?

449
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:42,369
Don't worry. I've seen<i>All the President's Men</i> 36 times.

450
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,371
I won't quote you.

451
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,000
Why are you helping me?

452
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:52,713
I don't likewhen they pat me on the head either.

453
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:20,449
Dad?

454
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:24,745
Dad?

455
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:27,664
Dad.

456
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,128
All right.

457
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,045
Hey. Hey, what are you doing up?

458
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,381
You told me there were no comments.

459
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:19,925
Oh, sweetie.

460
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:24,638
Look, I just didn't want youto get hurt, okay?

461
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,394
But it-- it's so mean.

462
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,522
Look, I know. I know, I know.

463
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:36,275
Look, when people don't haveto say things to your face,

464
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:40,153
like on the Internet, yeah,they can be really mean.

465
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:42,281
All right?

466
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,285
I was talking about you.

467
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,039
I thought we didn't keep secrets.

468
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,045
Oh, my God. How embarrassing.

469
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:34,309
"This article, paper, or whatever it is,is so lame."

470
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:40,732
"Go home. You're a loser."

471
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:52,619
"Perhaps you're too young to understandthe words 'sensationalist' and 'trash.'"

472
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,498
"Cute little girlsaren't supposed to be journalists.

473
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:58,166
Stick to tea parties."

474
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,380
Freak.

475
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,760
You're probablynever gonna talk to me again.

476
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:17,519
"Keep it up. Maybe somedayyou'll write something intelligent."

477
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,771
"Maybe Hilde killed her."

478
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:24,401
"See, this is whyyou shouldn't educate girls."

479
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:26,695
"I hate whoever wrote this."

480
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,994
"Who even let this little girlon the Internet?"

481
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,663
"Hate to break it to you, but you suck."

482
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:39,041
"You're ugly."

483
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,959
Well, that felt off-topic.

484
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,758
"You're just a stupid little girl.

485
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,843
Why don't you learnto keep your mouth shut?"

486
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,095
Excuse me, ladies.Do you want to sit down?

487
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,139
A friend of mine once said

488
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:58,644
that the best way to keep a secretis to pretend like there isn't one.

489
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:05,108
Well, I thought she said it, but thenit turned out to be Margaret Atwood.

490
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:09,613
I don't like secrets.And I don't like pretending.

491
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:13,075
You asked who cares about the truth.

492
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:14,868
I do.

493
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,872
'Cause if the truth doesn't matter...

494
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:21,708
nothing ever will.

495
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:43,856
No, no, no!

496
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,579
Hi. I'm Donny.

497
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,168
I'm Spoon. Wesley Witherspoon.

498
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:06,003
I'm Izzy, Hilde's sister.

499
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,005
Stop!

500
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:09,756
You.

501
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:26,440
Hilde Lisko, come with me.

502
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,111
Sit.

503
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,741
I have a change of clothes in my car.Don't move.

504
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:38,660
Yes, Principal Collins.

505
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:49,231
Money.

506
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,623
What are you doing?

507
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,334
I get sweaty when I'm nervous.

508
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:17,009
You are your father's daughter,aren't you?

509
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:19,761
Isn't everybody?

510
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,107
<i>Today I'm gonna show youhow to hook up your VCR.</i>

511
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:37,029
<i>There's two slots.One is your out, and one is your in.</i>

512
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:38,989
<i>You're gonna want to go from your out,</i>

513
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:43,827
<i>plugging the color-coded yellow cableinto the slot there.</i>

514
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,623
I don't understandwhy some old VCR is so important.

515
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:52,211
<i>And you'll have to findthe appropriate source on your television.</i>

516
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:54,963
<i>Typically it's called video one.</i>

517
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:56,298
Hilde?

518
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:01,970
Iz. Iz, you guys here?

519
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,422
<i>I mean, mine would stick better, but...</i>

520
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:40,717
<i>Oh, yeah, right.I'm definitely gonna need a new tire.</i>

521
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,511
<i>-Yeah.-Yeah, probably a new bike.</i>

522
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:51,895
<i>-Come on!-Grandma, today!</i>

523
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,690
<i>Half an eternity later. Yeah.</i>

524
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:58,944
<i>You're so slow. Can't make it up the hill.Oh, 'cause of my broken bike.</i>

525
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,820
<i>Hey! No!</i>

526
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:43,280
<i>Stop! Help!</i>

527
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:44,656
<i>Get off Richie!</i>

528
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:48,911
<i>No!</i>

529
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:51,788
<i>Richie!</i>

530
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,459
<i>Richie!</i>

531
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,212
<i>Help!</i>

532
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:16,563
Is that Dad?

533
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:24,988
Hilde.

534
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:28,450
We just got here, okay?Dad's acting weird enough already.

535
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:31,119
You can't show him that tape.Not right now.

536
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:33,455
Maybe this is why he's been sad.

537
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:37,918
Look, you don't even know if it is him.And if it is, then that's really serious.

538
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:40,963
I wanna help him.

539
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,714
Then don't go up there.

540
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,319
Hey.

541
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:08,156
Hey.

542
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,786
Hey, what's this for?

543
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:14,955
It's just...

544
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:19,001
I love you,and I want everything to be okay here.

545
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:22,713
Well, thank you, scout.

546
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,215
Hey, you know what?

547
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,843
I think I love you too.

548
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,181
You know, I'm pretty sure I do. Yeah. Wow.

549
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:37,269
Bye.

550
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:39,104
Hey, where are you going?

551
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:43,901
I'm going to make it right.

552
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:46,653
Make what right?

553
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:50,199
I'm going to figure outthe Penny Gillis case.

554
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,159
I know there's something more here.

555
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:56,538
Look, Hilde, I know what happenedto Penny was-- was terrible, but--

556
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:59,333
Look, you gotta let it go.

557
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:03,545
I don't think you hidthose comments from me

558
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,672
because you didn't want me to get hurt.

559
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:11,470
I think you did itbecause you don't want me to stop.

560
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:16,683
Look.

561
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:21,772
I know that you don't thinkthat you're a journalist anymore...

562
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:23,857
but I don't believe it.

563
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,570
So you can come back when you're ready.

564
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:31,281
But until then...

565
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:37,663
I'm gonna find out the truth,for both of us.

566
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,262
Hilde!

567
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:56,807
Get back here.

568
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:16,368
Be smart.

569
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,209
I'd rather be brave.

570
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:28,130
Yeah. Well, be both.

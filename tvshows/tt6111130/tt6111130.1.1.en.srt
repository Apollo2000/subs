1
00:00:11,893 --> 00:00:16,495
1-Adam-13, show us code
six on citizen flag-down.

2
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:20,438
There's something going on in there.

3
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,890
Cops!

4
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:37,163
Shots fired! Shots fired!

5
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:40,613
Officers need help! Roll SWAT now!

6
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,719
We got five, six active shooters.

7
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:54,802
We're gonna be a code six.
We need to initiate an HRT.

8
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:57,632
Everyone knows their positions.
Keep it clean.

9
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:58,886
Make it a work of art.

10
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,633
All right, 15 seconds out.

11
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:03,029
- Lakers play tonight?
- Golden State.

12
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:05,171
Let's clean this up in
time for the second half.

13
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:06,608
All right, I want you
to fill the gaps,

14
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,584
stay liquid.

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,724
- You with us, Hondo?
- Fill the gaps,

16
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:11,592
stay liquid. You say
it so damn much, Buck,

17
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,316
I finally got it tattooed on my ass.

18
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,194
All right, here we go!

19
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,013
Officer down!

20
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,913
Officer down!

21
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:47,009
We got rabbits!

22
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,016
You all right?

23
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,641
He took one in the arm.

24
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,063
Ambulance is on the way.

25
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:59,077
Move! Move!

26
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:24,735
Mama, fireworks!

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,360
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.

28
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:28,430
Go inside, hide.

29
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,004
I got him!

30
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,775
Hondo, suspect left.

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,477
Luca, with me.

32
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:26,196
Get out! Get out!

33
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:27,203
Situation's going south.

34
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:28,937
We got to shut this down.

35
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:31,397
- Get out of the car!
- I got the guy with the beard.

36
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,047
Yeah, I got Justin Bieber.

37
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:34,809
We're a gun short here, Hondo.

38
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:40,356
I'll be there! Start the countdown.

39
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,744
All right, we'll go on my count.
On three.

40
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:45,370
One...

41
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,027
Take the dude with the beanie, Hondo.

42
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,776
Two...

43
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:52,646
Three.

44
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:14,138
Get down!

45
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,899
Oh, God.

46
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:47,773
Civilian is down. I
repeat, civilian is down.

47
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:48,719
I need backup.

48
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,765
Hey. We got help coming.

49
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,000
All right, stay with me.

50
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,941
Stay with me.

51
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:55,270
You're okay.

52
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,480
Just stay with me.

53
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,347
You're all right, stay with me.

54
00:04:58,372 --> 00:04:59,550
I got it, Buck.

55
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,268
Hey, kid. Look at me, talk to me.

56
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,593
Talk to me, what's your name?

57
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:07,184
- Raymont.
- Raymont?

58
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,616
All right. You live here?

59
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,494
Yeah? Me, too.

60
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,052
I grew up four blocks that way.

61
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,154
I kissed my first girl, Yvonne
Thomas, behind that rec center.

62
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,857
Huh? Come on, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

63
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,536
They still making out over there?

64
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,895
Huh? Talk to me.

65
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,042
Stay with me. They still
making out over there?

66
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:26,746
Yeah. I don't got a girl.

67
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,304
Okay, okay, that's cool. That's
cool, don't even worry about it.

68
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,740
You wait till the girls see this
new scar you're about to have.

69
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,831
You're gonna have your pick, trust me.

70
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,386
Ambulance went to the wrong spot.

71
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,996
They're still ten minutes out.

72
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:40,707
This kid doesn't have ten minutes.

73
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,069
Luca, get him on the truck. Let's go.
Let's get the doors.

74
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,109
Come on. Come on. Okay? Let's go.

75
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:47,508
He ain't no gangbanger!

76
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,335
I know you're probably scared
right now, and that's all right.

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,569
No, no, no, it's all right.

78
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:53,549
Scared is good.

79
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:54,840
It means your brain's working right,

80
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:55,897
it means your body's fighting.

81
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,357
You and me, we got this.

82
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,026
We both fight together.

83
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:17,089
I stopped the bleeding,
started a line.

84
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:19,392
Kid says he's O positive,
blood pressure's dropping.

85
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,984
We got it from here. Let's go.

86
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:36,035
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

87
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:01,588
What happened?

88
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,603
That neighborhood is all shot to hell.

89
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,619
Not our bullets.

90
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,196
What about the bulletin that kid?

91
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:07,838
Well, he's in surgery now, but...

92
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,792
Doctors say maybe yes, maybe no.

93
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,223
If it wasn't for Hondo,

94
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,611
he'd have been D.O.A.

95
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,536
Nice save.

96
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,777
Deacon, the team's yours

97
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,196
until Buck's cleared for duty.

98
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,984
Yes, ma'am.

99
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,169
All right, thanks.

100
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,771
What's the word, Hondo?

101
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,550
Raymont's still in surgery.
We'll know more in the morning.

102
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,375
- Man, poor kid.
- I mean,

103
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,216
- it was an accident.
- True or not, Luca,

104
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,608
there's too much bad history
for a lot of these folks.

105
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:59,749
Tomorrow's looking like a busy day.

106
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,879
Buck will be back.

107
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:03,337
Soon.

108
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,700
Until then, let's make him proud.

109
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:08,030
I'll see you in the morning.

110
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,124
You scared me.

111
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,407
You don't feel scared to me.

112
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:49,529
That neighborhood is so angry.

113
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,200
And it's only gonna mushroom.

114
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,478
Buck shot an unarmed kid.

115
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:56,313
It was a split-second call.

116
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:58,622
Bullets were flying.

117
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:03,627
Listen, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

118
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:08,110
What's that?

119
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,063
Us.

120
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:13,278
This is more than just
hooking up at this point.

121
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:16,869
You have a key, toothbrush,
change of clothes.

122
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:19,059
I'm about to get my own
coffee cup, right?

123
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,952
Hmm?

124
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:23,647
Think you've earned it?

125
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:25,429
You tell me.

126
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:29,654
Actually...

127
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,922
I meant this.

128
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,003
"Professional
relationship disclosure"?

129
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:47,387
This is a joke, right?

130
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,945
It's department policy.

131
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,960
It's a policy that everybody ignores.

132
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:52,249
I'm a woman.

133
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:54,335
I'm young. I'm an immigrant.

134
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:57,752
That's three strikes for
a lot of the brass.

135
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:04,143
You don't want to call it a
relationship, officially.

136
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:07,205
I like this, obviously.

137
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,631
But I'm not gonna lose
my career over it.

138
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:10,735
I spent the last 12...

139
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,260
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

140
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,219
I'll sign it.

141
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:17,325
You will?

142
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,635
Yeah.

143
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,924
Yeah, I know. We're changing now.

144
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,649
We're doing a live feed.

145
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,726
There you are.

146
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,327
Hicks needs you right now.

147
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:06,065
What the hell is this?

148
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,323
Just smile and nod.

149
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,669
We'll talk afterwards.

150
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,136
In the course of responding to
an attack on two police officers

151
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,762
last night, the SWAT unit

152
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:29,370
to my right killed four
suspects and rescued a family

153
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:31,358
who had been carjacked.

154
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:35,337
Well, sadly, a 17-year-old
young man, Raymont Harris,

155
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,268
was accidentally shot
and seriously injured

156
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:39,950
by team leader, Buck Spivey.

157
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:44,315
Now, this morning, I
terminated Sergeant Spivey.

158
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,191
SWAT demands the highest standards,

159
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:48,349
and Angelenos have the right to know

160
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,212
that actions have consequences.

161
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,714
Sergeant Harrelson, would
you please join me?

162
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:02,931
Today I am assigning
20-David designation,

163
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,766
the senior SWAT sergeant
and command of this unit,

164
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,272
to Sergeant Daniel Harrelson,

165
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:12,100
who exhibited immense
bravery under fire

166
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,891
to prevent last night's incident

167
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,404
from becoming far worse than
what it otherwise might've been.

168
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,010
So, please join me

169
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:22,200
in congratulating Sergeant Harrelson

170
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,331
on a well-deserved appointment.

171
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,366
Good work, gentlemen.

172
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,250
Hicks made the decision
himself this morning.

173
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,097
And he thinks

174
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:43,379
promoting a black man on
live TV is gonna fix that?

175
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:45,215
He thinks it's better
than doing nothing.

176
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,355
Come on, Jess.

177
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,803
The people there can see right
through this kind of BS.

178
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,537
They know the difference
between a press conference

179
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,982
and what really goes
down on the street.

180
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,209
How many times have you told me

181
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:54,672
there's a better way
to do things here?

182
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:57,156
Treat the community like
family rather than the enemy.

183
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,476
Now's your chance to prove it.

184
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:00,350
He doesn't want my ideas.

185
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,601
He wants a mascot.

186
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,165
He's giving you a team.

187
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,090
What you do with it is up to you.

188
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,648
Deacon was up next.

189
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,272
Deacon is a good man.

190
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:10,916
You lead, he'll follow.

191
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,376
All right, until I
can figure out a way

192
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,733
to get Buck back on this team,

193
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:14,626
give me Rankins.

194
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:15,850
You're getting Jim Street.

195
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,297
Who is Jim Street?

196
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:19,215
Transfer from Long Beach.

197
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,723
So now I got to break in a new guy?

198
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,472
We're starting you slow.

199
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:26,830
Hicks wants you at the protest rally.

200
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,355
Starts in an hour.

201
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,847
Thanks.

202
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,805
Crowd control. No.

203
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,095
I want to be out there
trying to get the guy

204
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,420
we just lost last night.

205
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,954
The gun dealer you caught
last night, Yorba Glennon,

206
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,907
was selling weapons to
the man who got away.

207
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:39,997
Doesn't know his name.

208
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:41,244
Okay, so we'll look into it.

209
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:42,952
Mumford's team is running point.

210
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,902
You're gonna give
Mumford the good lead?

211
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,826
And me community relations?

212
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:50,152
You know I'm not that guy.

213
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:53,106
If anyone can bridge the
gap between that community

214
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,335
and the police, it's you.

215
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:09,153
Buck got boned big-time.

216
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:10,576
How do we fix this?

217
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,101
They can't just fire him

218
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:13,640
without having done an investigation.

219
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,871
They just did.

220
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,731
And Hondo's great and all,
but that job's yours, Deac.

221
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,873
I mean, all the years that
you put in and waited.

222
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:21,731
- I mean, you earned it.
- No one knows

223
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:23,280
Buck got screwed more than me.

224
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:25,415
I learned everything I
know about SWAT from him,

225
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,617
so I'm not about to
switch up anything.

226
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:29,753
Now, we have to change
into our dress blues.

227
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:30,934
We're going to Avalon Park

228
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,962
to keep the peace.

229
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:33,220
We heading out a man down?

230
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:34,244
Nope.

231
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,500
Getting Jim Street.

232
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:37,265
Who?

233
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:10,248
Just leave the ticket on my bike.

234
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:14,677
I'm late for work! Sorry!

235
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,586
You Hondo?

236
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:20,837
Jim Street.

237
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,223
You're cutting it a
little close, Street.

238
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:26,445
Sorry, yeah, I, uh, hit,
like, a thousand red lights.

239
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,949
We don't do excuses here.

240
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:29,348
And you're in the wrong uniform.

241
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:30,895
Go get changed up. We're rolling out.

242
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,091
Music to my ears.
Don't worry about me.

243
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,654
You just point me in
the right direction.

244
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,748
Here to kick ass.

245
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,673
SWAT isn't about kicking ass.

246
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,443
It's about saving lives.

247
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,938
Yeah, which sometimes requires

248
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,930
kicking a little ass.

249
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:45,820
Right?

250
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:48,488
Hey-hey! If it isn't

251
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:49,886
America's top cop.

252
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,076
Did you drive into work this morning

253
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:52,133
or swing from building to building

254
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,424
like Spider-Man?

255
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,538
Spider-Man.

256
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,202
"Those were Hick" words, not mine.

257
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:59,023
I miss some kind of
drama or is this guy's

258
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:01,419
default button just set on dick mode?

259
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,873
Don't know who your new smart-ass is,

260
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:05,140
but good luck with that.

261
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,571
We're on our way to find the guy

262
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:08,093
that Buck let get away last night.

263
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:10,118
Later.

264
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,158
Hondo.

265
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,516
How you doing, brother?

266
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,841
Doing good.

267
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,601
So you here for business or pleasure?

268
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:39,883
Here on business, Dale.

269
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,888
But also making sure that you're
not stealing too many hearts

270
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,392
from all these fine ladiesout here.

271
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:47,822
So, I saw on the TV that you
got some big promotion.

272
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:49,026
Does that mean that you can do

273
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,969
something about what's going on?

274
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,638
I aim to try, Dale.

275
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,696
Well, I'll be watching.

276
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,554
We all will be.

277
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,521
Say hi to your aunt and nieces for me.

278
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:05,237
I'll see you around.

279
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:06,917
What color you supposed
to be, brother?

280
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,524
Black or blue?

281
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,565
You gonna have to pick.

282
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,267
I saw your K-9 patch.
Where's the mutt?

283
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,345
Champ? Just retired.

284
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,204
His hip started to go.

285
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:19,539
I got him at my place.

286
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,359
I'm getting ready to train a new dog.

287
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:22,984
You pick one out yet?

288
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,708
Nope. Still choosing.

289
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,266
Maybe, uh,

290
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:30,092
off-duty, you could
teach me a few tricks.

291
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,890
I like dogs, not dawgs.

292
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:37,614
Hey, texted with a buddy
down in Long Beach

293
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,882
about you, Street.

294
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,866
Sounds like it ended
pretty rocky down there.

295
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:43,155
Anything we should know?
Nothing stays secret

296
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,887
too long in SWAT.

297
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,529
I plan on keeping any
secrets from you guys,

298
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:49,054
I'll let you know.

299
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,474
Hey, Deac.

300
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:58,419
I was thinking me and you could
go grab a beer one night.

301
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,289
Talk about ways to make
the team more efficient.

302
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,754
Depends on the night.

303
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,756
I'm Gerald Ewing,

304
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,591
and Raymont Harris is my cousin.

305
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,179
Raymont's a straight "A"
student at his high school.

306
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:17,556
Last night, picking up some groceries,

307
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,881
a cop shot him.

308
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:21,856
This is the third police shooting here

309
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:23,770
in the last six months.

310
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:26,729
You don't see them shoot
people in Brentwood, do you?!

311
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:28,464
- No!
- Bel Air?!

312
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:29,378
No!

313
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:31,103
How many times are we gonna

314
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,721
let this happen before some...

315
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:46,356
The roof! Northeast!

316
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:53,383
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go!

317
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,054
Hey! You crazy?!

318
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:22,972
Nothing.

319
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,840
Nope. Nada.

320
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,130
Hey. You're a hot mess.

321
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,865
You're out of position,
you're moving too fast.

322
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,162
They teach you anything
down in Long Beach?

323
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:31,387
Moving too fast?

324
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:33,170
I was trying to get to the
shooter before he got away.

325
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:34,859
By running through the middle
of the park with no cover?

326
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,156
I got here before
anyone else, didn't I?

327
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:40,680
Lesson one, Street.

328
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,972
Never be in a hurry to die.

329
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:01,476
Dead cop. Dead civilian. Both white.

330
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,790
Someone knew what they were doing.

331
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:04,954
Expert shot, line of
sight, escape route.

332
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,641
Best we could do from
security cameras.

333
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,673
No I.D.

334
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:09,643
We know the shooter's black...
racial payback

335
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,031
for the Raymont Harris shooting.

336
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:12,393
Robbery-Homicide found some

337
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,744
unusual shell casings.

338
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:14,940
Might track back to the sniper.

339
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:15,909
Best lead we have.

340
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:18,283
Couple different ways I can
think of to track that down.

341
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:20,174
Coordinate with RHD, take point on it.

342
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:20,829
You bet.

343
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:22,767
Hondo, your team will pick
up any spillover duties.

344
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:25,099
At least until there's
another press conference?

345
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,008
These are outstanding
warrants for felons

346
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,272
in a three-mile radius
of the park shooting.

347
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,275
Coordinate with South
Bureau's Gang Enforcement.

348
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,878
Start knocking some doors down;
I want to see what oozes out.

349
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,338
I want to make that neighborhood hurt.

350
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,597
Those are proud people

351
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:41,276
who usually get the
short end of the stick,

352
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:42,527
and you want to make them hurt?

353
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:44,285
They started a war with us, Hondo.

354
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,319
Black on white. Maybe you noticed.

355
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:48,642
So we're gonna squeeze 'em,
until someone tells us

356
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,982
who did this. Clear?

357
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,827
- Crystal.
- Pick out the promising ones,

358
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,796
give the others to Hondo.

359
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,422
Don't come back empty-handed.

360
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,653
Be careful, but be quick.

361
00:20:58,678 --> 00:21:00,707
We already had a bank robbery
we couldn't respond to

362
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:02,666
because of this shooting.

363
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:09,727
Hey. Guess who's in the locker room.

364
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,085
Get out of here, Hondo.

365
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,571
You don't want to be around my stink.

366
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:17,805
We're gonna fix this. I'm
gonna push Hicks and Cortez.

367
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,009
This is not the end, Buck.

368
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:21,167
Stop. All right, it's over.

369
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,478
I was chasing a white suspect,

370
00:21:22,502 --> 00:21:24,969
end up shooting an unarmed black kid.

371
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:27,222
- Not exactly protocol.
- It was an accident.

372
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:28,940
Not one that I would
tolerate on my team.

373
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,815
Buck, this is wrong.

374
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:32,777
Look, you and Jenny,
come over the house,

375
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:34,468
I'll make that gumbo you
like, and then we'll...

376
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:37,273
Jenny... Jenny left.
Four, five months ago.

377
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,672
How come you didn't say anything?

378
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,406
Because I wasn't looking for sympathy.

379
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:42,176
I wanted to do the job.

380
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:43,534
It's your job now.

381
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,123
This is some job.

382
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:47,485
Hicks got me running around,
just smiling for the cameras,

383
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,408
and now he sandbags me and puts
this Street kid on the team.

384
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,143
I asked Hicks to put Street
on the team in my place.

385
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,107
Why? What do you even
know about the guy?

386
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:56,668
Yeah, I've been watching
him for a while.

387
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:57,988
I think he's got potential.

388
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,488
I can't be here to help him,

389
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,433
- I'm-I'm hoping you will.
- I got enough troubles

390
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,240
without trying to get
this kid over the hump.

391
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,198
Here's a dirty little secret.

392
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,490
I had no idea what I was
doing half the time.

393
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:08,693
You know, I mean, I think the key was

394
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,318
to not let you clowns realize it.

395
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:13,666
Don't run the team the way
that I would. Be Hondo.

396
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:17,115
You find your own way.

397
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,548
Stay liquid.

398
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,597
Warrant bingo.

399
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,415
Great.

400
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,315
Needle-in-a-haystack time.

401
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,841
Hey, we don't write the
music, we just play it.

402
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,515
It's wrong.

403
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,649
Taking the fight to South L.A.
is just wrong.

404
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:40,274
- It won't work.
- Well, those are the orders.

405
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:44,488
And this is my team.

406
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:46,252
Hicks wants to fire me,

407
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,044
let him fire me.

408
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,478
But we're gonna go a different way.

409
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,515
Which way is that?

410
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,212
We treat 'em like family.

411
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,941
Excusez-moi.

412
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:17,765
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey.

413
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,469
One for each of us.

414
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,032
Ooh, and one for Denise.

415
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,368
Hondo.

416
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,955
Don't tell me, you finally came
down here to propose to me?

417
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,330
Come on now, Bree, I done
told you a thousand times,

418
00:23:36,355 --> 00:23:38,232
you way too much woman for me.

419
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:39,893
Only one way to find out for sure.

420
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,643
Girl, you don't ever quit, do you?

421
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:45,171
Not till you come to your senses.

422
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:47,430
I got to talk a little business.

423
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:49,874
We're looking into that park shooting

424
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:51,789
down the block, and we both know,

425
00:23:51,814 --> 00:23:53,766
don't nothing happen in this zip code

426
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,271
that doesn't get
discussed or dissected

427
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:57,029
by the ladies up in this room.

428
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:03,901
I'm not sure it'll help,
but maybe talk to Jemele.

429
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,409
Jemele, you got a little
something I can use?

430
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,238
My friend Penny,

431
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:14,166
she has this ex who's always
trying to get back with her.

432
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:15,766
Texted her this
afternoon, talking about

433
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,059
he saw the shooter driving
away from the park.

434
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,284
Now, Penny figured it was
just another one of his lies,

435
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:22,217
but, well, you know how that go.

436
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:24,850
You think you can get
this Penny on the phone?

437
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:28,110
Of course I can.

438
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:37,860
What's up, Shorty? You're
a hard man to find.

439
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:39,395
I know you?

440
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:45,151
Dogs for all my guys, please.

441
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:49,767
You know, when you witness a crime,

442
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,511
you're supposed to tell the police.

443
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,972
- Brother, I ain't seen no crime.
- Oh, yeah?

444
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:57,168
Then why'd you text
this to Penny girl?

445
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,496
You talk to Penny?
What she say about me?

446
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:03,268
Come on now, you know you got
to say something to me first.

447
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,365
What'd you see, Shorty?

448
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:09,820
I was setting up down
the road from the park.

449
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:11,861
Figured I'd make a couple
dollars, you know,

450
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,206
'cause the rally was going on.

451
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:15,226
Heard some shots, 30 seconds later,

452
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:16,972
tow truck came ripping right past me.

453
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:19,030
Tow truck? Wait, so you didn't
actually see a shooter?

454
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:21,270
Not sure if it was the
shooter or not, but...

455
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,935
he was driving fast, like
he ain't want to be there.

456
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,513
Did you see who was behind the wheel?

457
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:26,751
You see a name on the truck?

458
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:29,073
No, just a logo, like, like
an anchor or something.

459
00:25:29,098 --> 00:25:31,012
That sounds like Hook & Go Towing.

460
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:33,138
Used to be Old Man Roger's
place before he died.

461
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,362
I'm not sure who owns it now.

462
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,841
Guess we better find out.

463
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,663
Ooh.

464
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:39,900
Mmm.

465
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:42,124
So what Penny got to say about me?

466
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:45,609
I think it's time for you to
look for other options, Shorty.

467
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:47,199
You sure?

468
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:48,977
Damn sure.

469
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:15,783
Can I help you?

470
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,808
Tell him we're looking
for a black guy.

471
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:20,755
- Yeah, are you the owner here?
- Yeah, that's right.

472
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:22,631
We're Metro SWAT. We're
talking to people

473
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:23,950
in the neighborhood about
the park shooting.

474
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:25,458
Anyone take that tow truck out today?

475
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,050
Yeah, Luis ran some errands
earlier this afternoon.

476
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:30,042
You buy this place
from Old Man Rogers?

477
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,767
My uncle did. I run it now.

478
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,887
What's your name?

479
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:35,707
Why?

480
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:37,138
Did I do something wrong?

481
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,301
How 'bout you cops go roust
some actual criminals?

482
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:40,161
How 'bout you show

483
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:41,973
a little respect? Answer the question.

484
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,215
Why don't you take your
question and shove...

485
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,426
Hey-hey-hey, chill out. Chill out.

486
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:45,513
Chill out.

487
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,204
Talk to me.

488
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:49,678
So no one else has access to
that tow truck out there?

489
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:53,271
No. Just the two of us.

490
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:55,215
20-David, 20-David,

491
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,254
50-David in need of
immediate assistance

492
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,989
at the intersection
of 22nd and Hooper.

493
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,960
- Let's go.
- On our way.

494
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:03,114
Nice chatting.

495
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:04,719
That's what you doing!

496
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:06,438
Here we go again!

497
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:08,126
Stop and look what they doing!

498
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:09,423
We'll take care of this!

499
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:10,775
You got to stay calm.

500
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,502
I need you to stay calm.

501
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:15,060
This will be over soon.

502
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:17,096
Please, just stay calm and let us...

503
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:18,783
Really? Really?

504
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,999
Everybody! Everybody, back up!

505
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:26,897
This does not need to escalate!

506
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:29,374
- Them boys didn't do nothing!
- Two of them have warrants!

507
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,677
- What about the other two?
- Resisting.

508
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:33,732
- You always say-they're resisting!
- Hey, hey! Calm down! Calm down!

509
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,817
I need you all to allow these officers

510
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:37,286
to take these men into custody.

511
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:40,631
- Men? One of them is 16!
- Listen to me!

512
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,162
Listen to me!

513
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:45,076
You have my word they'll
be treated respectfully.

514
00:27:50,644 --> 00:27:54,073
Now, let 'em through. Let 'em through!

515
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:56,120
Back up, please. Back up, please.

516
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,868
_

517
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,381
You can't just ignore Hicks's orders

518
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:10,321
and expect me to cover for you.

519
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:12,346
There are better ways
to find the shooter.

520
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:13,636
Now Deacon says you're going

521
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:15,549
down to the hospital
to see Raymont Harris.

522
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,024
He's out of surgery, he's conscious.

523
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,377
- I want to pay my respects.
- No.

524
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:20,434
We both know there's a lawsuit coming.

525
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:23,027
So you can't see that kid.

526
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:26,958
Hey.

527
00:28:28,262 --> 00:28:30,835
Been trying to read your
tone the last 24 hours.

528
00:28:31,214 --> 00:28:33,541
Not exactly sure where
you and I are at.

529
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,776
You're under my direct command now.

530
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:38,142
No relationships allowed.

531
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:41,302
You're saying maybe we
should discuss this

532
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:43,612
a little further later
tonight, at your place?

533
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:45,428
No.

534
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:48,811
You saying tomorrow night, then?

535
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,055
Hondo, don't make this hard, okay?

536
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:57,862
If we want to stay together,

537
00:28:57,887 --> 00:28:59,872
it means one of us has
to give up our job.

538
00:28:59,897 --> 00:29:02,043
Well, I'm not letting you give
up yours; you work way too hard.

539
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:04,235
And I'm not letting you give up yours.

540
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,685
What you're doing is too important.

541
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:09,627
Guess that settles that, then.

542
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:16,547
See you tomorrow, boss.

543
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,132
Hey.

544
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:33,857
Hey.

545
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,731
Thought I'd, uh, get an early start.

546
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:44,776
Yeah, me, too.

547
00:29:58,124 --> 00:29:59,590
Hey, Street.

548
00:29:59,786 --> 00:30:02,065
You want to know how you
ended up on my team?

549
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,656
How's that?

550
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,387
Buck Spivey recommended you.

551
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:08,401
Yeah?

552
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,600
How far you and Buck go back?

553
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,347
Since I was a kid.

554
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:16,933
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,195
What, he coach your
Little League team?

556
00:30:20,294 --> 00:30:23,645
He, uh... he knew my mom.

557
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,036
He date her or something?

558
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:26,848
Put her in prison.

559
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:33,487
- Is she still there?
- Yup.

560
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:35,446
Next question.

561
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:41,507
Look, kid,

562
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:43,405
when I was new to SWAT,

563
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:46,221
I prided myself on being
the first one in the door,

564
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:47,806
never scared of nothing.

565
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:50,309
But then Buck sat me down,

566
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:53,349
and he said whatever
anger is motivating me,

567
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:55,063
I better find someplace
else to put it,

568
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:58,524
or it might be the person
next to me that I get killed.

569
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,712
I got no idea what's
going on in your life.

570
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,837
But whatever it is, I'm telling you,

571
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,536
find someplace else to put it.

572
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:36,270
This isn't your place.

573
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:39,363
I know it isn't.

574
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:42,270
None of us should be here right now.

575
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:44,927
Ma'am, would you mind if I said

576
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:47,282
just a few words to your son?

577
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:55,540
You were the one that saved me.

578
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,233
His partner was the one

579
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,058
that tried to kill you.

580
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:04,916
The surgeon saved you, Raymont.

581
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:06,956
I just helped you get
here in one piece.

582
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:08,872
I want you to know

583
00:32:08,897 --> 00:32:10,184
how sorry I am this happened to you.

584
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,989
Nobody on the force wanted this.

585
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:20,316
Look, the truth is...

586
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:24,906
when I was younger, I got
into it with the cops.

587
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,253
I didn't do nothing wrong,
but somehow I still ended up

588
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,190
with a broken arm and my
face down in the pavement.

589
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:35,410
I went home, and for weeks,

590
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,914
I was bitching about the
cops this and the cops that.

591
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:40,135
But finally, my daddy
looked at me, and he said,

592
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,328
"Boy, if you really want
to do something to change

593
00:32:42,353 --> 00:32:44,520
the police, join them."

594
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:47,509
And I did.

595
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,812
My point is, you're the type
of kid that I promised myself

596
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,765
I would always try to protect.

597
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:59,908
Thank you.

598
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,233
You get better.

599
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,976
What?

600
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,179
It was opened in our
mailroom 30 minutes ago.

601
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:28,688
The writer vows to kill two
African-American children

602
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:31,408
in Los Angeles as they leave
school this afternoon,

603
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:34,487
in retaliation for the
two white victims killed

604
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,901
at the rally in Avalon Park yesterday.

605
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:42,696
Don't let those guys catch up.
Come on now.

606
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:44,788
- That's my son!
- Back up. No, no, no.

607
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:46,805
So you go. Perfect.

608
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,031
There we go. Find any seat

609
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,639
on the bus, okay?

610
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:53,194
You got it. Come over here, buddy.

611
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:55,116
Here we go, love.

612
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,307
Let's go. On the bus.

613
00:34:01,598 --> 00:34:03,832
Keep going to the back.

614
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,238
You're Raymont's cousin, right?

615
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:11,920
Yeah.

616
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:13,078
What's up?

617
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:15,617
Hey, look, man, I'm no snitch.

618
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,129
Sure. I see that.

619
00:34:18,154 --> 00:34:20,129
But I appreciate what you
said in the hospital.

620
00:34:20,278 --> 00:34:22,083
And I see what you're doing here.

621
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:23,871
I get you're different
than the rest of them.

622
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,502
So this is just us
talking, not me snitching.

623
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:27,879
Of course.

624
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:29,965
I had this friend that I grew up with.

625
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,057
Good cat.

626
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:32,315
Funny.

627
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,450
Joined the Army.

628
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:35,460
I didn't see him for a while.

629
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:39,185
Came home a couple months ago,
talking all this nonsense

630
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,133
about needing to tear down the system.

631
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,444
Just last week I saw him,
and he was talking like

632
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,498
things were happening and I was
never gonna see him again.

633
00:34:47,523 --> 00:34:50,157
The thing is, what he did in the Army,

634
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:52,534
he was a sniper.

635
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,475
I don't know if that's
got anything to do

636
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,345
with what went down
in the park, but...

637
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:58,181
What's his name?

638
00:34:58,206 --> 00:35:00,155
Daronte Drummond.

639
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,616
Where does he live?

640
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:04,092
Said he and these white
dudes from his unit

641
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:06,730
were sharing a crib in Echo Park.

642
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,082
Street!

643
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:33,760
Stay down.

644
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:36,119
Runner!

645
00:35:47,273 --> 00:35:48,631
Right side clear!

646
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:50,255
Left side clear!

647
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,554
Room clear!

648
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,152
There's no Daronte.

649
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,958
Boss!

650
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,167
Check it out.

651
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,941
That's Daronte

652
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,948
with our two guys from
Hook and Go Towing.

653
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:12,632
And that's the guy Buck was
chasing the other night.

654
00:36:13,974 --> 00:36:15,740
This is all connected.

655
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:17,356
- How?
- I don't know.

656
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,621
But Street, Tan, grab Deacon,

657
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:20,598
get down to that garage. Go!

658
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,403
This rooftop.

659
00:36:22,428 --> 00:36:23,537
Chris, where the hell is this?

660
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:25,256
That's downtown by 4th and Fig.

661
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:27,772
All right, let's move.

662
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,139
What'd he say?

663
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:34,678
Not much. Our gunrunner
Yorba confirmed

664
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:37,265
he was selling weapons to a
group of ex-military guys.

665
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,890
No. Something doesn't add up.

666
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,984
Why is a black guy
threatening black schoolkids

667
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:43,102
as payback for two white
people that he killed?

668
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:44,470
Daronte and those guys

669
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,306
from Hook and Go were
discharged from the Army

670
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,796
after posting online about
overthrowing the government.

671
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:51,444
They bought the guns
from Yorba's crew.

672
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:52,452
When Raymont Harris

673
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,725
gets accidentally shot,

674
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,132
they take advantage of all the anger.

675
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:57,062
Drummond shoots the two
people at the rally

676
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:58,709
to get this city to turn on itself.

677
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,366
This isn't racial.

678
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:02,491
It's political.

679
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,778
What was his plan? They can't shoot

680
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:39,936
- any schoolkids from here.
- So what's the target?

681
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,616
Get me through, get me through.

682
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,546
Left side clear.

683
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:45,952
Right side clear.

684
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:47,934
Room clear.

685
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,593
"And the dead officers are
proof of your stupidity.

686
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:57,250
"The money we took from your
bank will go towards destroying

687
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,258
the corrupt system you
foolishly worship."

688
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:00,484
Dead officers?

689
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:02,735
I don't think we were
supposed to find that yet.

690
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:04,168
Let's roll out.

691
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,515
Hondo.

692
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,540
They're planning on
taking down some bank.

693
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,345
Is that Mumford and his guys?

694
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,517
Yeah. What the hell?

695
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,092
Cortez!

696
00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:16,806
What's 50-David doing downtown?

697
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,952
There's a silent alarm
at First Finance Bank.

698
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:20,905
Mumford's team was the
only one in the area.

699
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:22,718
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

700
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:25,036
Didn't you say there was
a bank robbery during

701
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:27,279
the rally shootings and most of
the cops in the city were there?

702
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,248
That's right.

703
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,545
And now there's another bank job.

704
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,005
And all our cops

705
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,459
are watching the schools.

706
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,055
These are the same guys.

707
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,213
It's an ambush.

708
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:37,955
Cortez. We need...

709
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:50,078
Go! Go!

710
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:57,204
Deac, there's a robbery going down

711
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:58,962
at First Finance Bank on Grand.

712
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:00,186
Head straight there.

713
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:01,945
You heard him.

714
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,113
Their cars got trashed.

715
00:39:20,302 --> 00:39:22,424
Get back!

716
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:27,909
I got the rabbit! Get Mumford!

717
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:45,886
Take care of business, fellas.

718
00:39:52,779 --> 00:39:54,807
Why'd we let him drive?

719
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:57,851
Come on, come on!

720
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:04,446
Quit shooting, get inside!

721
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:10,951
Street.

722
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,675
Street!

723
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:14,830
Street!

724
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,300
Rick, get up!

725
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:10,100
Hey.

726
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:12,825
I would've had him.

727
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,832
No catch? All I got to
do is not get pinned

728
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:23,363
inside a second,

729
00:41:23,388 --> 00:41:25,229
- cash is mine.
- That easy.

730
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:26,654
Beautiful.

731
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,045
All right.

732
00:41:28,678 --> 00:41:30,178
One...

733
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:31,738
two...

734
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:32,839
three!

735
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,961
Luca's department champ,

736
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:37,290
three years running.

737
00:41:37,315 --> 00:41:38,884
That's the easiest money ever.

738
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:40,718
Better luck next time, Long Beach.

739
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:41,758
- Anyway.
- Hey, man.

740
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,383
Congratulations, Luca.

741
00:41:43,408 --> 00:41:44,574
Here's your cut.

742
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:46,149
- Really?
- Here's your cut.

743
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:47,807
Where you going?

744
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,042
Nobody likes the boss messing
up a perfectly good party.

745
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:54,507
Hey!

746
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:56,681
Good work today.

747
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:59,019
I'm out. All right.

748
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:00,310
Have a good one, boss.

749
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:01,835
Night.

750
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,092
- Deac.
- Ah!

751
00:42:10,342 --> 00:42:12,806
I forgot my toothbrush.

752
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,830
You disobeyed my order not to
see Raymont in the hospital.

753
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:28,519
I'm sorry.

754
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,285
We're up!

755
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,218
Ooh!

756
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:38,480

1
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:07,716
Chrissy.

2
00:00:56,884 --> 00:01:00,019
Do you know who the hell
you're stealing from?!

3
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:13,561
We'll find you.

4
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,229
We'll find you!

5
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,422
Everybody good?

6
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:39,150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:41,964
Damn, that was fun!

8
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:43,031
Looks on their faces!

9
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,533
Should've put 'em on Instagram.

10
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:46,835
Hey, someone get my short ribs?

11
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:49,905
Sorry, Luca! I didn't have time
to sit down and grill!

12
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,527
Did get you a lifetime's supply

13
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,574
of fentanyl, though.

14
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:54,576
At least you got one order right.

15
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:56,284
20David to Command,

16
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,213
my team is safe, and we got the goods.

17
00:01:58,215 --> 00:01:59,014
Good job, guys!

18
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:00,482
- Yeah, baby.
- Booyah!

19
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:13,932

20
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:42,257
That's how you get it done!

21
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,256
Yeah!

22
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:48,059
- In and out without a single shot fired.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,393
Stellar work.

24
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:52,063
Well, what can I say?
We got a soft touch.

25
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:54,065
Hondo, if that's your idea
of a soft touch,

26
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,700
I'd hate to see your hard one.

27
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:58,803
One hell of a haul.

28
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:00,571
Street value for fentanyl just peaked

29
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:02,106
at a half a million a kilo.

30
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:03,074
- Wow.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,842
Cho, grab a field kit

32
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,410
- and get these bricks tested.
- Right away.

33
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,913
- Yes.
- Here we go, let's do it.

34
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,247
We smoked 'em, man.

35
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:11,849
- Yeah, you did.
- Commissioner.

36
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,085
Sergeant Harrelson. You and your team

37
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:15,853
- just wrap up a drug seizure?
- Actually,

38
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,087
we just pulled off a rip.

39
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:18,860
That's when cops get
to pretend to be robbers.

40
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:21,425
SWAT is currently part of a
DEA joint task force,

41
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:23,984
and Hondo's team just
executed a sealed warrant.

42
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,130
Agent Katrina Walsh, DEA.

43
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,598
We're targeting a huge

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,234
fentanyl operation
being run out of Koreatown.

45
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,503
Fentanyl? It's all over
the latest commission updates.

46
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,038
Record overdoses. And it's, what,

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,906
- 50 times more potent than heroin?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,675
You touch the pure stuff without
wearing gloves, say good night.

49
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:40,011
Golden Boys,
Koreatown's most violent gang,

50
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,846
are the streetlevel players
running point.

51
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,881
But we're trying to
shake out the top dog,

52
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:46,283
the person actually
financing the operation.

53
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,786
So we have wiretaps
on all the GBoys' cell phones.

54
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:50,221
Because of the rip, they'll panic,

55
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,822
place calls up the ladder,

56
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:54,058
hopefully ending
on whoever the real boss is.

57
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,693
We call it “tickling the wire.”

58
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,495
This is why I love hanging out at SWAT.

59
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,263
Learn something new every day.

60
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:01,732
Well, then let me show you what
a real wire room looks like.

61
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,701
- I'd love that.
- All right.

62
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,102
I heard Annie left the hospital,

63
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,771
- is back home.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:09,040
- How's she doing?
- Like a champ.

65
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,908
- So far, so good.
- Well, that's good to hear.

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,877
You make sure Deacon takes
whatever time he needs.

67
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,979
I told Deacon I just want him home,

68
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,580
feeding Annie ice cream in bed.

69
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:18,816
All right.

70
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,526
Put word on the street.

71
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:30,861
There's a bounty
for the crew that did this.

72
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,908
You get anything yet?

73
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,743
GBoy phones are lighting up like crazy.

74
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,411
And they're mostly all speaking Korean.

75
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,246
You think I brought you along
'cause you're cute?

76
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,316
Start translating the calls and
get us some transcripts ASAP.

77
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:53,985
Impressive.

78
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:57,822
Come on, now. You're the one
with the photographic memory.

79
00:04:57,824 --> 00:05:00,020
You tell me.
How many stings is that for us?

80
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:03,060
Over the past ten years, 11.

81
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:04,395
- Whoa.
- Combined total

82
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:06,597
of 364 kilos of dope

83
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,499
- off the street.
- Well, damn.

84
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,501
- Time sure flies, doesn't it?
- It does.

85
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,069
Hey, how's my little dude, Calvin?

86
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:13,170
You know, I haven't seen him

87
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,772
since we won that peewee
football tournament.

88
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,173
That youngster right there is a natural

89
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,157
at toting that rock.

90
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,944
Well, I got him into
private school in the Palisades.

91
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,346
- The Palisades?
- Don't ask about the price tag.

92
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:23,533
Believe me,

93
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:25,249
- it's worth it.
- Aw!

94
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,485
Look at him. Little man is sharp.

95
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:28,938
But he's not a Crenshaw Cougar anymore?

96
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,688
He is a Palisades Pelican now.

97
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,323
So you gonna make me drive

98
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:33,791
all the way through traffic

99
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,292
from the south side to the Palisades

100
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,247
just so I can yell plays
at my football godson?

101
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,581
Think of it as a seaside getaway.

102
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,549
All right, all right.

103
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:42,351
You know you can count me in.

104
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:44,153
I don't know if you're ready
for this, though.

105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,520
That right there

106
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:47,521
is tofu stirfry.

107
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,258
High protein, low calorie...

108
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,425
all net.

109
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:51,713
And why

110
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,262
- aren't you married yet?
- Come on, K.C.

111
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:54,863
Too busy chasing bad guys.

112
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:56,932
You know, next month, I hit my 20th.

113
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:59,902
Been thinking about cashing
in my pension early,

114
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,676
so I can be there, watch Calvin grow up.

115
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:06,441
Wait a minute, Killer K.C.
is gonna turn in her shield?

116
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:08,777
But you know what?

117
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,612
I feel you.

118
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,272
Well, if this is your last one,

119
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:13,857
we got to make it count.

120
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:18,854
You all good?

121
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:21,256
This is dessert muffin week.

122
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:23,218
It might be really difficult
getting the piping...

123
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,762
We don't have to watch this.

124
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:29,564
No, I love<i> Muffin Fights.</i>

125
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,072
<i>Muffin Wars.</i>

126
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,269
Matthew and Lila are
all tucked in. Finally.

127
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:37,806
And I read Sweetie Pie to sleep
with a little James Ellroy.

128
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,899
You having an affair I should know about?

129
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,097
That you should know about? No.

130
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,817
Hondo and the team just pulled
a drug rip in KTown.

131
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,319
David, just go in already.

132
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,687
No, you just had brain surgery.

133
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:52,654
Two weeks ago.

134
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:53,789
I'm not leaving your side.

135
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,807
I just think we need to get back
to life as usual

136
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,660
- at some point, and...
- And you're starting

137
00:06:58,662 --> 00:06:59,795
to drive her a little nuts.

138
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:01,129
She's just too afraid to tell you.

139
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,230
- Mom.
- What?

140
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:03,445
I think he should take the hint

141
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:04,833
and vacate the premises.

142
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:06,401
Right, Sergeant?

143
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:08,296
You got her?

144
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:09,931
I've had her for 37 years.

145
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,499
I'm not giving her up now.

146
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,334
You sure?

147
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:14,435
- Yeah.
- Okay.

148
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:15,737
Bye.

149
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,205
All right.

150
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:23,845
Hey, Deac! Man, I missed you, buddy.

151
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,513
- How's Annie doing?
- She's good.

152
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:27,515
She's so good, she kicked
me out of the house.

153
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:30,318
She wanted to, thank you all
for the flowers and the cards

154
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,153
and cupcakes.

155
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,055
And the police officer strippergram.

156
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,556
Was he awesome?

157
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:38,393
Let's just say he was welloiled
and completely inappropriate.

158
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:40,795
But I haven't seen her laugh
like that in a long time.

159
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:42,597
Awesome.

160
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,899
Deac. Good to have you back, man.

161
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,334
Ready to rock.

162
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,869
- What do we got?
- Results from the field kit

163
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,905
came back. Fentanyl tested at 90%.

164
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:53,374
Purest I've ever seen.
As expected, the GBoys

165
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,543
are reaching out to various contacts,

166
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:58,813
but the one person a few
of them called was Eddie Rhee.

167
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,848
Rhee's vice president
of the Wilshire Hope chain of banks.

168
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,850
He's got financial ties in South Korea

169
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:05,186
and the ability to transfer
large amounts of cash overseas.

170
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,889
He's also got two mansions
in Hancock Park...

171
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:09,824
one for his wife and their kids,

172
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:12,226
the other for his mistress
and their kids.

173
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:15,086
And guess who's on the payroll
as Rhee's private bodyguard.

174
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:16,219
Peter Kwon.

175
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,554
Head of the Golden Boys.

176
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:19,589
Recently paroled from Soledad
after doing eight years

177
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,958
for assault on an LAPD motorcycle cop.

178
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:24,194
He's dangerous, so on your toes.

179
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:29,032
That right there...

180
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,868
best black noodles joint
in the city, hands down.

181
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,137
Never knew you were such
a connoisseur of Korean cuisine.

182
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,473
Fresh out of the academy,
I spent my first two years

183
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,942
in KTown. I'm like an
honorary Asian around here.

184
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,377
Heard that
from white cops before.

185
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,114
Then we go out drinking,
they don't know soju from sake.

186
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,116
Yeah, well, both rice wines, grasshopper,

187
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:49,152
but soju's Korean at 21% alcohol.

188
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,354
Sake's Japanese at only 15%.

189
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:54,218
So you picked up
a few things in KTown.

190
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,226
I did a year undercover in Chinatown.

191
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,461
Dude, L.A.'s Chinatown
is, like, two blocks.

192
00:08:58,463 --> 00:09:00,497
If you lasted a year undercover,
you must've been wearing

193
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,900
one hell of a fake mustache.

194
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:05,301
He got you on that one, Tan.

195
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,739
Let's make this an easy inandout.

196
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:16,012
Eddie Rhee,

197
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,514
we have a warrant for your arrest

198
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,715
for the distribution of.

199
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:19,916
Schedule 1 narcotics.

200
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,217
Narcotics?

201
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:24,954
- ThThat can't be right.
- I'm sure

202
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:26,823
you don't want to cause a scene
in front of your customers,

203
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,358
so I suggest you turn around.

204
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:35,965
Take that piece and lay it on the floor

205
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:37,834
right now! Before you have a problem.

206
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:40,403
You got a warrant for me?
I know you're Peter Kwon,

207
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,771
and you like to go after cops.

208
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,706
So drop the gun now!

209
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,108
Come and take it.

210
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:59,100
It's okay, folks. It's okay.

211
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:00,823
Got him. They got him.

212
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,032
Street.

213
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,559
Letting a trashtalking

214
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:06,993
roughneck get in your head

215
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,695
makes you the fool, not him.

216
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:10,063
That bullet could've hit a civilian.

217
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:11,598
Or one of your teammates.

218
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,767
Some days you just seem to forget

219
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,001
the golden rules of SWAT.

220
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:16,169
What's rule number three?

221
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:17,559
Always keep your cool.

222
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:26,513
This proposal outlines
what I called an ethics panel,

223
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:28,448
which would be made up
of seven members...

224
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,617
four civilians and three officers.

225
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:31,952
With seven, there's never a deadlock.

226
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:33,987
And all useofforce cases moving forward

227
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:35,422
will be reviewed by them,

228
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:36,423
so people can't say

229
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:38,286
the LAPD ever covered up
a police shooting.

230
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,330
And with real teeth in the
penalties, any bad cops...

231
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,562
Will think twice now
about breaking the law.

232
00:10:42,564 --> 00:10:45,198
The rank and file will see this

233
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,500
as a politically correct move to
reduce the police union's power.

234
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:50,570
Good cops will grumble,
but they'll go along with it.

235
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,305
And bad cops will get drummed out.

236
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:54,641
I think it's worth any grief I might get.

237
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,440
The panel would also
be made up of volunteers.

238
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,593
There's no compensation for any position.

239
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:00,995
So the department pays zero

240
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,897
- for better relations with the public.
- Not to mention

241
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,331
the tens of millions
it could potentially save

242
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,599
in lawsuits against the city.

243
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,134
This is great.

244
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,168
I got to run.

245
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,138
I got a school board
meeting in 30 minutes.

246
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,974
LAPD. The L.A. school board.

247
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,676
You're a busy man, Michael.

248
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,645
And you're a rising star.

249
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,481
You know, this city's never had
a female police chief.

250
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,850
Just saying. I'll look this over,

251
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,167
circle back.

252
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:31,025
It wasn't a rival crew that
ripped your keys, Eddie.

253
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,526
It was us.

254
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:34,662
So it looks like
you only got one play here.

255
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,497
Admit the fentanyl is yours,

256
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,532
and the U.S. Attorney will
take that into consideration

257
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:39,861
during sentencing.

258
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:42,169
Sounds like a deal to me,
considering all the poison

259
00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:43,236
you smuggled into L.A.

260
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:45,339
How does a wellrespected banker
get wrapped up

261
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,674
in dealing narcotics?

262
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,342
You start living beyond your means?

263
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,978
Paying for two McMansions
and two different families?

264
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,513
Your wife and your little sidepiece,

265
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:53,714
do they know about each other?

266
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,049
I mean, because where I'm from,

267
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:57,211
they would have burned
each other's houses down by now.

268
00:11:57,753 --> 00:11:59,346
Sorry, but we need to wrap it up.

269
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:00,613
We just brought him in,

270
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:02,338
and his bail is $2 million.

271
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,858
It's been paid.

272
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,125
Any further questions,

273
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,428
the DEA can reach me at that number.

274
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:13,133
I tried stalling as long as I could.

275
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,401
Rhee's Maserati.

276
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:15,644
Are they gonna release it

277
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:17,238
- to him from the impound lot?
- Yeah.

278
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,806
His lawyer said
it wasn't officially listed

279
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:19,974
on the warrant.

280
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:21,709
All right, before Rhee
signs off on his ride,

281
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:24,111
we stick on a GPS tracker,
see where he goes.

282
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,981
Three cars on a revolving tail.

283
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:28,349
Follow a hundred yards back,

284
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,017
take turns in his rearview.

285
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,453
If Rhee gets anywhere near
a GBoy connected to the drugs,

286
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,989
we revoke his bail. Let's ride.

287
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,933
Right there's Mr. Pak's.

288
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:48,602
Kickass tailor. He alters my dress blues

289
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:50,304
but only charges halfprice.

290
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:53,107
And that spa right there
is open 24 hours.

291
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:54,742
Man, I pulled my hamstring
chasing a banger

292
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:56,410
dusted on PCP.

293
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,979
<i>The hot steam room in there cures all.</i>

294
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:01,248
I get it, Luca. You know KTown.

295
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:05,653
Damn, KGirls. You ever date one?

296
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:07,588
Most Asian girls I know
remind me of my mom,

297
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,156
so not really.

298
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:11,358
I'm seeing this blonde
down in Venice right now.

299
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,227
She listens to Suicidal Tendencies,

300
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,628
loves cheap beer.

301
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,716
She doesn't give a damn
my family isn't rich.

302
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:19,600
Man, you don't see many blondes
on the arm of an Asian dude.

303
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,910
My man flipped the fetish.

304
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:28,442
Rhee's just pulled into a
parking garage off St. Andrews.

305
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,311
They got two entrances.
We'll cover the front,

306
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:32,309
and I'll get another
car to cover the rear.

307
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,617
He told me to meet here.

308
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:37,818
Put it in park.

309
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,193
This is 20David

310
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:21,028
to all Dteams. Rhee is on the move.

311
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,096
We do not have eyes yet.

312
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:26,333
That Chrysler.

313
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:27,868
That's our signal,

314
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,837
but that's not Rhee's Maserati.

315
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,372
Listen up, we got a GPS switch.

316
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:33,040
It's a Chrysler 300.

317
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:36,944
Plate number three, zero, one,
Paul, Charles, Edward.

318
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,746
Luca, you and Tan sit on the garage,

319
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:39,780
see if Rhee comes out.

320
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:41,382
Roger that.

321
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:42,449
Deac, the car's headed south on Kenmore.

322
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,084
- I need you to cut it off.
- On it.

323
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:55,129
Lower your window, let me see your hands.

324
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,506
All clear. No sign of him.

325
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:07,508
- Where's Eddie Rhee?
- Who?

326
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,976
- Who do you work for?
- Uber, man.

327
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:10,611
II picked up extra shifts
'cause my wife,

328
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,312
she lost her job.

329
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:17,885
Luca, tell me you and Tan got
eyes on Rhee in that garage.

330
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:19,033
Negative, boss.

331
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,121
Just searched it. Rhee's gone.

332
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:22,489
Well, he didn't just vanish.

333
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,992
Let's fan out, find that Maserati.

334
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,718
How did Rhee find the GPS
tracker on his whip that fast?

335
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,234
My friend in organized crime, he
says that there's nobody better

336
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:35,502
at countersurveillance
than Korean criminals.

337
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:36,704
Wait, wait. Hold up.

338
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:38,305
Hold up, hold up.

339
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:41,549
You see what I see?

340
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,812
Hondo, we got eyes on Rhee's ride.

341
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:54,395
Step out of the car right now!

342
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,092
He said out of the car! Now!

343
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:00,401
Luca.

344
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,900
Damn.

345
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,135
Korean choker.

346
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,037
That's serious old country.

347
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,689
Chain saw blade and a padlock.

348
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,741
Poor bastard asphyxiates
and bleeds to death

349
00:16:13,743 --> 00:16:14,859
at the same time.

350
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,226
Means someone thought he'd talk.

351
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:18,812
Which means Rhee was never
the top dog in KTown.

352
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:20,314
Well, whoever he is,
he's gonna be looking

353
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:22,049
to get rid of anyone
he thinks is a loose end.

354
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:23,083
Annie?

355
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:24,551
David,

356
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,086
- it's Mary Beth.
- What's wrong?

357
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,821
Annie got up and wanted to take a walk.

358
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,423
She made it ten feet and collapsed.

359
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,258
They're putting her in the ambulance now.

360
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,459
David,

361
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:33,660
it's bad.

362
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:34,862
Deac, what is it?

363
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:36,196
It's Annie again!

364
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,160
They said that if she
got through the first week

365
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:42,129
without any relapses, that she'd be fine.

366
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,625
She's supposed to be past this.

367
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,874
With the type of surgery your wife had,

368
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,994
there was always a concern
of a blood clot forming.

369
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:49,187
Our oncall surgeon will
be here in a half an hour.

370
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,651
A half hour? II know you're upset.

371
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,321
We have her stabilized now,

372
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,313
so I'm having the OR prepped as we speak.

373
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,332
Yeah.

374
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,016
How is she?

375
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,946
What happened?

376
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:01,719
It's aa blood clot now.

377
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,888
Excuse me. You're SWAT, right?

378
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,223
Yes.

379
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,792
Before I was an RN, I worked as an EMT.

380
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,004
Had my share of calls

381
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,661
where you guys walked me through gunfire

382
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,056
to help a patient.

383
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,999
From one first responder to another,

384
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,434
II hate to say this, but...

385
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,502
What? Hate to say what?

386
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,972
The oncall surgeon is okay.

387
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,740
But if someone I love
needed this procedure,

388
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,309
I'd want the vascular specialist,

389
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,078
- Evan Chandler.
- Okay, where's he?

390
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,046
Celebrating his 20th wedding anniversary.

391
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,481
Is there a way to reach him?

392
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,285
Maybe not, but...

393
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,953
if I was you,
I would try whatever I could.

394
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,558
I'll talk to the hospital
director, see what we can do.

395
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,230
Rhee's dead. Probably at the
hands of someone higher up

396
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,166
who's afraid of where we've been looking.

397
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,110
We've pored over all the wiretaps.

398
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,607
As far as we can tell, Rhee
never called anyone above him.

399
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,906
All right, let's split up and
round up the rest of the GBoys.

400
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,341
We hit them hard enough,
someone's gonna talk.

401
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,044
Hondo, any word on Annie?

402
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,179
She's critical.

403
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,413
Hospital's trying to get in touch

404
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,614
with the specialist she needs.

405
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,082
How's Deac holding up?

406
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,951
- I can only imagine.
- Anything we can do for him?

407
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,186
The best thing we can all do

408
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,321
is just keep sending positive thoughts.

409
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,367
Hello, Calvin.

410
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,469
- Who are you?
- Call me Halmoni.

411
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,537
It means grandmother.

412
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,939
I got a grandma that picks me up.

413
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,340
She couldn't make it,

414
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,042
so she asked me to bring you home.

415
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,744
Okay. But first, you got
to tell me the code word.

416
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,847
I don't get in a car with anyone
who doesn't know the code word.

417
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:39,750
Calvin,

418
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,319
if you don't get in,

419
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,154
I promise we'll kill her.

420
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,488
You want to be the boy

421
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,290
who got his grandmother killed?

422
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,370
Hey. Hi.

423
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,650
All right, you all got addresses
of your targets.

424
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,085
Let's hit the GBoys hard and fast.

425
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,219
Hey, Sarah.

426
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,681
What's going on?

427
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:25,649
Calvin...

428
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,965
They took him.

429
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,143
Tell me you got something.

430
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,778
Agent Walsh, your mother is fine.

431
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,614
One of our unis found her on
foot near Sunset and the 405.

432
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,849
She was carjacked,
but her purse and phone

433
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,409
were inside, so she couldn't call you.

434
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,305
What about Calvin?

435
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,053
We've got a dozen units
canvassing the area.

436
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,354
You got cameras all around the perimeter.

437
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,489
You download the footage?

438
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,157
We did, but the vehicle
didn't have plates.

439
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,759
We issued an AMBER Alert,

440
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,995
- but without a license number...
- All right.

441
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,032
K.C., look at me.

442
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,133
We'll find him.

443
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:06,515
Hello?

444
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:07,772
We have your son.

445
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,774
Walk away from any police right now,

446
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,737
and make sure you're
the only one who can hear this.

447
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,113
Okay. I'm listening.

448
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,282
If you want your son back alive,
you'll meet us alone...

449
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,052
no other DEA agents or police...

450
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:21,807
and return the drugs you stole from us.

451
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,254
What are you talking about?

452
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,522
Do not play games with us.

453
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,991
Okay.

454
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,459
But I can't.

455
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,361
I don't have the authorization
to do that.

456
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,330
If you want money, I can get you money.

457
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,931
We only want what is ours.

458
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,534
We will call you back
in two hours with a location.

459
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,437
If you bring anyone else,
your son's throat is cut.

460
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,905
Okay.

461
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,813
Who was that?

462
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:51,749
That's where we're at. The caller says

463
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,851
they want their 50 kilos back
in exchange for Calvin.

464
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,175
Well, you know we can't do that.

465
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:56,587
We'll get him back,

466
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,041
but we got to do it a different way.

467
00:20:58,043 --> 00:20:59,957
What if we put GPS chips

468
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,126
inside the kilos,
so we know where they go?

469
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,562
We've already seen how
GPS trackers worked before.

470
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,197
- They'll be looking for them.
- All right, fine.

471
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,999
If we can't use the real keys,
then we mock up 50 fake ones.

472
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,068
K.C. shows up to the meet
while we lay back.

473
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,237
When those kidnappers show up,
we take them down.

474
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,773
I've done enough of these deals
to see how they go down.

475
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,908
They're gonna bring a chemist
to vet the purity.

476
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,979
If the fentanyl comes back
baking soda, Calvin is dead.

477
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:26,317
I'm sorry, Agent Walsh.

478
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,952
But what Hondo just pitched,

479
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,987
that's the only legal
option we have here.

480
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,123
What if it was your child?

481
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,726
I'd be as sick about it as you are.

482
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,463
You know how I feel about Calvin.

483
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,965
You got to trust me on this one.

484
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,533
We'll make it work.

485
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:48,339
Let's... let's get some fake keys bundled

486
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,127
before these bastards call back.

487
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:07,485
Hey. I called your office.
They said you were here.

488
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,787
I signed off on every detail.
It just needs our signatures.

489
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:12,392
- That sounds... great.
- I'm sorry.

490
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,450
Am I... am I missing something?

491
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,922
- Is that Sergeant Kay?
- His wife needs emergency brain surgery.

492
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:21,124
I've been trying to get ahold of
the specialist she needs,

493
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:22,992
but he's not reachable.

494
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,594
Anything I can do?

495
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:27,063
Is there any chance
you know Dr. Evan Chandler?

496
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:28,998
His name doesn't ring a bell.

497
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,169
Annie... she's...

498
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:35,754
more than just one of the wives.

499
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,257
She's my friend.

500
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,978
Doesn't mean I don't know
someone who knows him.

501
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,947
Let me make a few calls.

502
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:45,306
Appreciate it.

503
00:22:53,397 --> 00:22:55,625
The old fentanyl switcheroo.

504
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,460
All right, get these bagged up.

505
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:59,542
They should be calling with
the drop zone any minute.

506
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:02,791
Agent, you seen K.C.?

507
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:05,468
Said she was stepping outside
to call and check on her mom.

508
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,637
Tminus five minutes
till that incoming call.

509
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,747
Five minutes to go, and
she's not here, ready?

510
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,599
K.C.

511
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,605
K.C. took the real fentanyl
out of the evidence locker.

512
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,459
She must be headed to the meet alone.

513
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:45,577
My God.

514
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:46,919
I can't believe she did this.

515
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:48,731
If anyone else finds out,
she will go to prison.

516
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,080
- So, what are we gonna do?
<i>- We</i> aren't gonna do anything.

517
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,715
I'm gonna track down Walsh

518
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,409
- before her and Calvin end up dead.
- And what

519
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,753
are we supposed to tell Hicks
if he strolls past the evidence

520
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:59,190
and notices $25 million worth
of fentanyl's gone AWOL?

521
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:00,223
He won't.

522
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:01,351
The fake keys we just packed...

523
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,484
I put 'em in the cage
in place of the real ones.

524
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,367
Listen, what she did was real stupid,

525
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,835
but me and K.C. go way back,

526
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:07,768
and Calvin is like a son to me.

527
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,036
I'm gonna do whatever I got to do me.

528
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:09,998
I'm gonna do whatever
I got to do to protect them.

529
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,239
But that does not involve

530
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,018
any of you risking your jobs.

531
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,913
The less you know, the better.

532
00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:22,736
Hondo?

533
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:28,029
Tech agent says the kidnappers
haven't called in yet.

534
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:30,301
They want their drugs, they'll
call when they're ready.

535
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,379
In the meantime, Agent Walsh just texted.

536
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:33,554
Said she got word from a C.I.

537
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,348
from a C.I.

538
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,082
with a possible lead
on Calvin's location.

539
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,818
I'm on my way to meet her now.

540
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,178
- When was I gonna be informed?
- I'm informing you now, sir.

541
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:42,605
- Where's your team?
- They're on standby.

542
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,927
Once I know more, I'll call 'em
from the road with details.

543
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,167
What are y'all doing?

544
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,241
- Look, I told you...
- Yeah, yeah. Plausible deniability.

545
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:56,623
Yeah. We heard you the first time.

546
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,745
Just got a ping on Agent Walsh's
phone and location.

547
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,015
You want to tag along,

548
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,242
we got room in the backseat.

549
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:06,847
Let's go.

550
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,458
Arms up.

551
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:00,233
I'm a federal agent.

552
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,924
I don't shower without a piece.

553
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:04,905
- I told you we'd find you.
- Where's Calvin?

554
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,522
First we get the bricks,
then you get your son?

555
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,573
That's it... all 50 keys.

556
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:45,679
I guess you can see him now.

557
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:47,614
He's in our trunk.

558
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:56,790
No.

559
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:06,038
Metro SWAT!

560
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,260
Drop the weapons!

561
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:08,623
- On the ground!
- On the ground!

562
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:10,639
- On your stomach!
- On the ground!

563
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:12,316
- On the ground, on the ground!
- Stop it!

564
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:14,608
Command, roll an ambo to 3600 Wilshire.

565
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,167
Drop it, on the ground! On the ground!

566
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:19,266
Where's my son?! Where is he?!

567
00:27:19,293 --> 00:27:20,773
- Where's my son?!
- K.C., let go!

568
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:22,889
Let him go!

569
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:25,641
Where's the boy?

570
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:26,574
Where's the boy?!
It's not my job to know.

571
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:29,173
It's not my job to know.

572
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,461
Street, take him.

573
00:27:33,974 --> 00:27:35,145
What the hell is wrong with you?

574
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:37,016
Hondo, if they were gonna kill me,

575
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,181
- what have they done with Calvin?
- K.C., listen to me.

576
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:42,119
Whoever's behind this won't get
rid of their insurance policy

577
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:43,754
until they have the kilos in their hands.

578
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:46,273
Calvin's got to be alive.

579
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:48,912
I want to believe you.

580
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,484
You know, when we first got married,

581
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:58,895
Annie was in her second year
of law school at Loyola.

582
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,082
She never told me that.

583
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:02,415
She was concentrating
on environmental law.

584
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:05,108
She wanted to save the world
and every creature in it.

585
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,292
Sounds just like her.

586
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:08,395
At the time, I was trying out for SWAT.

587
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:11,512
I was doing extra training
after my patrol shifts...

588
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,808
'cause I knew I had to... be the best

589
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,400
if I wanted to make the cut.

590
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:19,335
Annie dropped out.

591
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:25,078
She wanted to be home
every night... for me.

592
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:27,087
She said

593
00:28:27,112 --> 00:28:29,112
it was only gonna be
for a couple semesters, but...

594
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,338
Next think you know, I make SWAT.

595
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:37,853
Ten years have passed.

596
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,000
She's raising three kids.

597
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:50,200
You know what this is, right?

598
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:54,233
It's a sign from God
that I'm a selfish prick.

599
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:58,996
He's testing me
to see if I even deserve her.

600
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:03,117
Deac, Annie loves the life
you guys have built together.

601
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,719
She put down all of her own dreams

602
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:10,807
to support me.

603
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,092
And not once in ten years have I had

604
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:18,013
to sacrifice anything important for her.

605
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,836
Hey.

606
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:28,270
Michael?

607
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,272
This is Dr. Chandler.

608
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:32,433
Annie's husband? The SWAT sergeant?

609
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,799
Yes, sir.

610
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:35,847
I looked at your wife's MRI
on the way in.

611
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,413
I won't lie, it's not pretty.

612
00:29:37,415 --> 00:29:38,873
But she's prepped for surgery

613
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,483
and I'm ready to operate immediately.

614
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,418
You don't know how much
you showing up means to me.

615
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,765
Excuse us.

616
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:47,056
Sergeant, I'm gonna tell you what I tell

617
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,912
all the loved ones of my patients.

618
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:52,062
My only guarantee is I will
do everything in my power

619
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:53,496
to get her through this.

620
00:29:54,738 --> 00:29:55,738
Thank you.

621
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,114
How'd you get him?

622
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,005
Important thing is he's here.

623
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:05,616
I love L.A. bars.

624
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:07,503
No signs in front
so you can only find them

625
00:30:07,545 --> 00:30:09,141
if you're a hipster.

626
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:11,047
- I feel cool.
- What's your contact's name?

627
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,852
Kayla Song. She owns the place,

628
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,210
KTown born and raised.

629
00:30:14,986 --> 00:30:16,118
Hey.

630
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:19,372
- We're closing.
- Kayla, please...

631
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,035
You got some nerve texting
me after all this time.

632
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,067
You know blue eyes here
took me to Burning Ma.

633
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:24,271
A couple years ago, then ghosted me?

634
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:26,825
Listen, I don't got time
to walk down memory lane.

635
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:30,477
Look, I need your help.

636
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:32,034
- Yeah, sure.
- Hey.

637
00:30:32,642 --> 00:30:35,571
This is Calvin Walsh, son of a DEA agent.

638
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:37,207
He was abducted
by a Korean woman in her 60s

639
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:38,641
connected to the Golden Boys.

640
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,610
It's a personal favor if you can help us.

641
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:42,523
You know what'll happen to me
if the GBoys find out I talked.

642
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:44,179
This is a little boy's life.

643
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:46,359
I promise anything that you tell us

644
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:47,617
won't blow back on you.

645
00:30:49,754 --> 00:30:52,263
Peter Kwon, head of the GBoys.

646
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,223
Yeah, we ran into him
at the bank earlier today.

647
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:58,534
His mother, Sang Kwon,
she runs their slave trade.

648
00:30:58,663 --> 00:31:01,014
She brings in girls from Seoul
and pimps them out.

649
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:02,363
They call her Halmoni.

650
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,841
Any idea where she keeps these girls?

651
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:06,496
Sang runs a massage place
on Serrano and 6th.

652
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,181
First floor's legit,
but that second floor

653
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:09,939
is all sex rooms and God knows what else.

654
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:12,031
Thank you. You better call me.

655
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:13,622
I'm single again, so you know it.

656
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,255
Guess being an honorary Asian pays off.

657
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,191
What do we got?

658
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:24,298
Name on the deed is Sang Kwon
and the property's listed

659
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:26,849
as a clinic
for therapeutic touch therapy.

660
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:29,192
They got security cameras
on every corner,

661
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:30,293
so we're gonna have to cut the power.

662
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,894
Yeah. Ready when you are, boss.

663
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,201
All right. Luca, Tan, and Chris,

664
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,765
cut the lights, take the threeside.

665
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,990
Me and Street will take the front.

666
00:31:37,014 --> 00:31:38,500
Go ahead. Street, strap up.

667
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:40,302
I'm right behind you.

668
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:41,626
No. No, you're not.

669
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:43,016
You tried it your way

670
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,841
and you almost got yourself killed.

671
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:46,275
Now we're gonna do it my way.

672
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:48,309
You stay here and watch the perimeter.

673
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,800
That's my boy in there, Hondo.

674
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,504
I know it is... and I won't forget it.

675
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,922
Let's go, Street.

676
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:28,852
Left side clear!

677
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:29,919
Right side clear!

678
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:31,571
Everyone against the wall!

679
00:32:36,094 --> 00:32:38,402
Stay down! Let me see your hands! Now!

680
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:41,381
Hands behind your back! Now! Stay down!

681
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,134
Luca, you got a rabbit headed your way!

682
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:50,973
- Come on!
- Left side clear!

683
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:52,141
Stay down!

684
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:56,602
- Street, stay with him.
- Got him.

685
00:32:58,983 --> 00:33:01,326
Metro SWAT. Inside.
Get inside. Stay down.

686
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:03,906
Get on your stomach.
Turn around! Turn around!

687
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,354
- Hands behind your back!
- Keep it down!

688
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:06,484
- Go, go, go.
- Stay there.

689
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:10,692
Mom?

690
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:12,161
Calvin?!

691
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:13,095
- Left side clear!
- Right side clear!

692
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:13,128
M? Calvin?!

693
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,130
Calvin?!

694
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,233
It's a connecting door.

695
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:20,874
- On three.
- Okay.

696
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,422
One, two, three.

697
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,516
Right side clear. Left side clear!

698
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,252
Calvin?

699
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:39,855
Calvin.

700
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:42,520
Chris, give me your rubber bullets.

701
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:49,398
All right.

702
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Chris, kick it.

703
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,529
Luca, what's she saying? She says.

704
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,077
- Luca, what's she saying?
- She says

705
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:04,223
she's not gonna let him go
unless we don't arrest her.

706
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:05,808
You tell her that's not how this works.

707
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,088
Calvin. Come on, Calvin.

708
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:15,076
Get out of here. Come on.

709
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:19,228
My gun has real bullets.

710
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:23,399
Calvin!

711
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,068
My God.

712
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,552
Are you okay, baby?

713
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:39,783
I knew you'd come.

714
00:34:40,557 --> 00:34:43,540
I missed you so much.

715
00:34:53,164 --> 00:34:54,830
Let's go. Move it!

716
00:35:10,648 --> 00:35:12,848
We know you and the GBoys
were just muscle.

717
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,684
So who hired you to snatch up Calvin?

718
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,686
Who had Eddie Rhee killed?

719
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:21,424
She says take her to jail.

720
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:24,527
You tell me who hired you
to kidnap Calvin and maybe

721
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:26,913
you don't live out the rest
of your days in Chowchilla.

722
00:35:27,331 --> 00:35:28,764
Lawyer.

723
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:30,222
So you do speak English.

724
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:32,129
Lawyer. Now.

725
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,171
Get her out of my face.

726
00:35:41,303 --> 00:35:42,870
Chris, Street.

727
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:46,378
Get Walsh's car back to HQ,

728
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:48,317
swap out the real kilos for the fake ones

729
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:50,475
- before Hicks realizes what's up.
- Okay.

730
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:53,856
Hey. So gangster granny
doesn't want to talk.

731
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:55,882
We still got Walsh and
the kid back in one piece.

732
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:57,859
And all 50 keys of the fentanyl.

733
00:35:57,962 --> 00:36:00,129
What we didn't get
is the top dog of KTown.

734
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:02,431
Whoever they are,
they're still out there.

735
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:03,433
Okay.

736
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:15,193
Still in surgery.

737
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:17,926
It's been two hours.

738
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:19,572
Annie's strong. If anybody

739
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:20,877
can pull through this, it's her.

740
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:23,298
Sergeant.

741
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,035
Took a little longer than usual,

742
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,036
but I was able to remove the blood clot.

743
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:30,584
As of right now, your wife
is in stable condition.

744
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:32,618
I don't mean to sound pessimistic,

745
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:35,606
but I was in this exact
same place two weeks ago.

746
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:38,724
So, please, will you tell me
your honest prognosis for her?

747
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:40,059
With proper aftercare,

748
00:36:40,084 --> 00:36:41,983
I don't see any reason why Annie won't be

749
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:45,557
back to her normal self in a few months.

750
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:47,522
I think we have it handled this time.

751
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,859
- Can I see her?
- Of course. She's right down the hall.

752
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,082
The nurse will show you where.

753
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:53,305
- Thank you.
- Sure.

754
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:55,586
Doc.

755
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:56,762
Thank you for making the time.

756
00:36:56,786 --> 00:36:58,000
Absolutely.

757
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,369
Listen, if you ever need a favor,

758
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,137
this is my number.

759
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,850
Seriously, use it. Well, I appreciate it,

760
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,641
but Michael Plank's got me covered.

761
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:11,384
Well, all of us at SWAT
greatly appreciate it.

762
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:13,024
Yes, we can't thank you enough.

763
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:14,544
Anything for LAPD.

764
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:15,979
Now, if you'll excuse me,

765
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:17,930
I'm late for a glass of
champagne with my wife.

766
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,089
- Good night.
- Good night.

767
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:22,774
Wow.

768
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,816
The commissioner went
above and beyond on this one.

769
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:26,894
Yes, he did.

770
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:33,669
<i>I just got off the phone</i>

771
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:34,903
with the DEA director.

772
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:35,937
He declared the task force a success.

773
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:36,338
Ho success.

774
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,574
How is it a success, sir,

775
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:40,642
when the real top dog
who kidnapped Walsh's son

776
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:42,536
isn't even in custody? We just took

777
00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:43,397
tens of millions of dollars worth

778
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:44,986
of fentanyl off the street.

779
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:47,293
SWAT dismantled a major L.A. street gang.

780
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:48,817
It's a huge win.

781
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:51,022
Whoever's behind this
had inside intel on this case.

782
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:53,808
They knew Calvin was the son
of a DEA agent in charge.

783
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,643
- They knew where he went to school.
- Hondo.

784
00:37:55,645 --> 00:37:56,892
We're SWAT.

785
00:37:57,265 --> 00:37:58,427
We strike targets.

786
00:37:58,429 --> 00:38:00,887
We don't lead longterm investigations.

787
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,498
You have any idea who it might be?

788
00:38:07,322 --> 00:38:09,838
From K.C.'s tech guy.
After Calvin was kidnapped,

789
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,678
two calls were made from a burner phone.

790
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:15,585
Sang Kwon had on her
to that guy, Jae Kim,

791
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:17,980
who didn't come up on the
DEA's list of suspects.

792
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:19,892
- Jae Kim, New Seoul Properties?
- That's right.

793
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,327
Each call lasted only a minute,

794
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:23,015
made directly to his office line.

795
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,649
Kim's one of the largest
real estate developers

796
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:26,003
- in the city.
- What better way

797
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:28,748
to wash dirty drug money in L.A.
than real estate?

798
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,292
The head of Narcotics, we
worked Hollenbeck together.

799
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:37,067
I'll make sure this
file lands on his desk.

800
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:39,532
At the bottom of the pile
with the backlog of cases.

801
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,825
Narcotics already has?

802
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,724
We'll hand the intel
off to the detectives.

803
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:43,969
If they find dirt on Kim,

804
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,474
I'll see that you get to cuff him.

805
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:56,330
You know, K.C., what happened...

806
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,260
it might take a while
for Calvin to shake off.

807
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:02,457
I know. He's a tough kid.

808
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:04,450
Well, he gets that from his mother.

809
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,371
I'm so sorry. I know what I did.

810
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:10,848
It put you and your team at risk.

811
00:39:11,006 --> 00:39:12,253
I wasn't thinking straight.

812
00:39:12,278 --> 00:39:14,132
You were thinking about your son.

813
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:15,658
You best believe I'm gonna find out

814
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,000
who was really behind all this.

815
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:19,905
Hondo, all I care about right
now is that I got Calvin back.

816
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:23,142
I'm handing in my papers tomorrow.

817
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:25,077
I can't be on the job anymore,

818
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:27,213
not after what I did.

819
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:30,201
All I want to be now is a mom.

820
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,354
Well, you tell Calvin he better be ready

821
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:34,854
to play some ball next month.

822
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:36,213
- Okay.
- Hey,

823
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:38,447
if you need anything,
I got you. You know that.

824
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:39,827
Thank you.

825
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,203
- Street.
- Yeah?

826
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:50,494
Where are you going?

827
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,602
Sam's Houfbrau.

828
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:53,207
It's Tuesday. They got halfoff beers

829
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:54,716
and this dancer who breathes fire.

830
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:56,178
All right, well, tickle your
vices later, all right?

831
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:58,896
Right now you're rolling
with me. Let's go.

832
00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:04,915
With the new MTA expansion along
Pico Boulevard from West L.A.

833
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,142
to downtown already approved,
we will be breaking ground,

834
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,617
on retail and residential properties.

835
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,771
All of you courageous enough
to invest early with me

836
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,538
will reap the rewards.

837
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,197
<i>Geonbae.</i>

838
00:40:19,222 --> 00:40:20,443
<i>Geonbae.</i>

839
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:26,421
Officers?

840
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:27,812
Mr. Kim.

841
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:30,511
This is Eddie Rhee,

842
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:33,403
VP of Wilshire Hope Bank
who handles your accounts.

843
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:35,398
We found him strangled to death

844
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:36,486
in his car yesterday.

845
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:43,497
Mr. Rhee's death came as a shock
to many of us in our community.

846
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:45,549
But I'm not sure I can help you.

847
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:47,043
I only met him a handful of times.

848
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,665
But enough times for you to be aware

849
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,297
that he's part of a major drug ring

850
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,604
smuggling fentanyl into Los Angeles?

851
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,179
If I had any knowledge of such a thing,

852
00:40:53,204 --> 00:40:55,137
I would've reached out to Commander Dorin

853
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,837
of Wilshire Division.

854
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,332
He's a personal friend.

855
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:02,989
How about Sang Kwon?

856
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:04,094
She a personal friend, too?

857
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:05,515
She called your office

858
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,931
twice last night from an illegal brothel,

859
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:09,092
while harboring a kidnapped child.

860
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:11,262
I manage millions of
dollars worth of real estate.

861
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:13,714
All sorts of tenants call
my office at all hours

862
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:16,667
with demands, complaints,
even a few compliments.

863
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:18,287
If she only called you once,

864
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,767
I would buy a wrong number,
but she called you twice.

865
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:24,524
You went after a mother and son
who are like family to me.

866
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:29,858
Officer, there's obviously
some sort of misunderstanding.

867
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,507
If you give me your name
and your badge number,

868
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,967
I can call the chief right now
and we can clear this all up,

869
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,846
If any more harm

870
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:41,635
comes to Agent Katrina Walsh
or her son, Calvin,

871
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,675
I will come after you
personally, on my own time.

872
00:41:44,727 --> 00:41:47,759
Hey. Hondo.

873
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:50,283
Remember that golden rule?

874
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:18,667
As I was saying,

875
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:21,978
with the new MTA expansion,
we have an amazing opportunity

1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:02,813
Previously on S.W.A.T.

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:05,386
I'm your boss now.

3
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:07,233
Being together will cost our jobs.

4
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,006
It's stupid department law.

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:10,293
Is dangerous

6
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,174
It's sucking up to Michael Plank.

7
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:12,999
I know that name.

8
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:13,933
President of the police commission?

9
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:14,934
Commissioner Plank.

10
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,335
So, I wanted to ask you if you had

11
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,604
any thoughts or suggestions
on my policing proposals.

12
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:21,374
So, this proposal outlines
what I call an "ethics panel."

13
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:23,576
I think you're gonna need
my help to get these approved.

14
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,012
The reason why I didn't forward
your proposal to Plank before

15
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:28,347
is because it's gonna turn
a lot of good cops against you.

16
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:29,582
I think she's destined

17
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,050
for bigger things than just SWAT.

18
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:11,757
What about her?

19
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:13,893
Him.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,982
Ella está hecha de viento,

21
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:40,953
<i>de fuerza que ningún
hombre puede igualar.</i>

22
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:43,255
<i>Ella está en riesgo.</i>

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,857
<i>Porque ella es fuego.</i>

24
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,092
<i>"Es fuego."</i>

25
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:49,028
A poem my mom used to say to me.

26
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,097
The woman is born of fire,

27
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:53,332
and society wants to tame her.

28
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,034
Tame her?

29
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:56,969
Why would they want to do that?

30
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:07,546
Hicks wants your team on
an ICE raid in Van Nuys.

31
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:08,848
They move in an hour.

32
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:10,483
I thought our policy was hands-off

33
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:12,551
when it comes to federal raids.

34
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:14,820
Target's an I-2D gang member.

35
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:15,988
Toro Ochoa.

36
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:17,955
ICE is asking for support.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,126
Time to go.

38
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,565
Mmm.

39
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,406
Oh, this isn't good.

40
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:36,265
Oh, no. We've been found out.

41
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,488
Someone leaked

42
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:41,494
the accountability proposal to the press.

43
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,683
My name, Commissioner Plank's,

44
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,651
our review panel on "use of force."

45
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,125
You weren't planning to go wide yet.

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,587
I wanted to sell it to the rank and file

47
00:02:48,622 --> 00:02:49,655
before it went public.

48
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,099
Some cops might feel blindsided.

49
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:53,025
Michael took a chance on me, on my ideas

50
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,676
to reform the department.

51
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,583
You and Michael seem like
you've been working pretty hard.

52
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,098
But it won't matter if we can't
get the department on board.

53
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,866
This could ruin everything.

54
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:02,535
Okay, stop, Jess.

55
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,834
Don't worry about it.

56
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,173
Everything's gonna be okay.

57
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,172
One problem at a time.

58
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,512
Thanks.

59
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:15,381
- Mm-hmm.
- Be safe.

60
00:03:18,635 --> 00:03:19,772
Piece of cake.

61
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:32,431
Federal agents! This is a raid.
We want Toro Ochoa.

62
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,566
All right, get 'em up! Let's go!

63
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,067
Federal agents.

64
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:36,068
Outside!

65
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:38,604
We want Toro Ochoa.

66
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:40,039
All right, let's go.
Get moving. Let's go.

67
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,741
Hey. Hey!

68
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,075
On the ground!

69
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,076
Stay right there.

70
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,178
On your knees.

71
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,815
Stay right there.

72
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,417
Hey. Hey!

73
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:55,221
Get on the ground.

74
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:56,922
Get on the ground.

75
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:58,791
Toro Ochoa.

76
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:01,060
You seen him?

77
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:02,142
He around?

78
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,396
How about you?

79
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:05,931
Sir, the apartments

80
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:07,133
are all cleared.

81
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:10,336
There's no sign of Ochoa.
Start checking IDs.

82
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,505
Stop!

83
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,740
This is Agent Jones.
We have a breach. Ten...

84
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:15,841
12 suspects.

85
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,109
Roger that. Perimeter's covered.

86
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,142
- You ready?
- Set.

87
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:21,480
There!

88
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,315
LAPD! Stop right there!

89
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,984
On the ground!

90
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:29,648
Get on the ground now!

91
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,591
We got two rabbits.

92
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:34,627
LAPD, don't move!

93
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:36,195
Street, let's go. Deacon, cover him.

94
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,261
I got beanie boy.

95
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:50,376
Chill out!

96
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,744
You're done.

97
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,047
LAPD! Stop!

98
00:04:58,351 --> 00:04:59,718
Give me your hands!

99
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:02,288
- I got the runner.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

100
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:04,089
- Shouldn't have run, then.
- Good work, officer.

101
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,727
You have any ID on him?

102
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,335
Metro pass.

103
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,037
Carlos Acosta.

104
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,039
- You know Toro Ochoa?
- No, sir.

105
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,841
I just live in the building.

106
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,409
I have nothing to do with criminals.

107
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:24,977
You a UDA? Undocumented alien?

108
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:26,712
Thought so.

109
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:27,746
Give him to me.

110
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:35,020
I thought we were supposed to
be going after gang members.

111
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,422
He look like one to you?

112
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,157
No.

113
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:40,492
But this is ICE's op, Street.

114
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,528
And we follow the law.

115
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,662
Let's get out of here.

116
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,901
Hondo. Heard we're taking over

117
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,103
- an ICE case.
- Toro Ochoa.

118
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,005
L-2D wanted for murder.

119
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,341
ICE's intel didn't pan out,
so they're moving on.

120
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,775
Now they want us to track him down.

121
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,244
Our city, our problem?

122
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:00,346
They're gonna coordinate with Cortez.

123
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,714
Sure she has time,

124
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,616
or is she too busy
making things hard for us?

125
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,719
Stricter rules on cops.

126
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:09,355
Who the hell does she think
the bad guys are?

127
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,056
Look, I haven't read all the details,

128
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,559
but it seems to me any officer
who does their job right

129
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,194
shouldn't have any issues.

130
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,862
If Cortez thinks the problem

131
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:18,430
between the police
and the community are the cops,

132
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:19,765
I got news for her.

133
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,066
All right, let's just take a beat.

134
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:22,635
Hear Cortez and Plank out.

135
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,103
Yeah, remember that
when you're being reviewed

136
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:27,072
and someone like Ochoa kills somebody.

137
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:28,622
Hey, Hondo.

138
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:30,776
Our boy's on the news.

139
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,378
In a raid this morning,

140
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,440
an LAPD officer is seen here handing

141
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:37,663
a suspect's ID
over to a federal official.

142
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,719
My brother Carlos is a good man.
He is not a criminal,

143
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:43,256
and he is not in a gang,
and now because of this officer

144
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,957
he's being deported?

145
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,759
I thought the police were different here.

146
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:49,328
By arresting my brother,
they've broken their promises

147
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:50,596
to this community.

148
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,064
Officer Street.

149
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,266
Did you unilaterally decide

150
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:55,834
to change city policy

151
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,937
in regards to how the LAPD
interacts with locals?

152
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,071
- No.
- Really?

153
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:00,339
Because up there, it looks like

154
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:01,840
you're handing over a man's ID

155
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,288
to a federal officer.

156
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,444
Los Angeles is a sanctuary city.

157
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:06,979
Don't have to agree with it,

158
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:09,315
but that's the playbook
the mayor drew up.

159
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,215
Now, we all know why she did that, right?

160
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,375
The UDAs in the city

161
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,153
will be afraid to come forward
and report their crimes.

162
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:15,287
It's close to a half a million people.

163
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:16,522
And we need their trust.

164
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:18,257
Now, I got five city council members

165
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,326
on my phone sheet. They're pissed.

166
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,281
Think we violated community loyalty.

167
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,029
ICE asked me for his ID.

168
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:25,533
What was I supposed to do, tell him no?

169
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:26,932
Sir, the immigration beef

170
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,835
between the Feds and the
locals is way over our heads.

171
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,704
Yeah, well, this city
has a delicate truce.

172
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:34,840
And now because of him,
they think we picked sides.

173
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:36,709
Get your team in order, sergeant.

174
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:38,711
And while you're at it, find Toro Ochoa

175
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:41,080
so the press has something else
to chew on.

176
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,658
Street.

177
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,622
You get the optics on this, right?

178
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:52,624
That lady on the news,
what it looks like to her.

179
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,026
We didn't raid the place.

180
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,694
- The Feds did.
- The Feds are gone, Street.

181
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,563
That leaves just us to take the heat.

182
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:05,170
Hey. Listen, we got a situation

183
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,438
going on here.

184
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,015
Where are you?

185
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,544
What?

186
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,080
All right. Stay right there.

187
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,583
All right, listen, you
guys dig into Ochoa.

188
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,385
I'll be back as soon as I can.

189
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,189
I saw the news about the raid.

190
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:27,326
I was headed into the office
when I found my car like this.

191
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,361
I doubt it's a coincidence.

192
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:32,664
The same day the anti-bias
proposal was leaked.

193
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,733
You think a cop did this?

194
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,001
I know there'd be pushback, but...

195
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:37,269
We'll get to the bottom of it.

196
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:38,404
I want to get you

197
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:39,538
some protection.

198
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:41,573
I can protect myself.

199
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,442
Hey.

200
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,477
I know you can.

201
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:07,985

202
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,742
So, here's what ICE sent over
on Toro Ochoa.

203
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,629
I don't get it. We provide support
for an op, provide backup

204
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,698
when they can't corral anyone,
I get in trouble?

205
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,199
Well, you're not in trouble.
A crime's a crime.

206
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,968
Carlos Acosta came to
this country illegally

207
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,437
- just like Toro Ochoa did.
- Oh, that's not in the same league.

208
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:49,139
House painter vs. murderous gang leader?

209
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:49,999
Yeah, no.

210
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,344
- Look, I'm not saying
that they're equal.

211
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:52,409
Carlos Acosta

212
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:54,611
broke the law by coming into
and staying in this country.

213
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:56,386
We only gonna enforce
some of the laws now?

214
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,600
All right, hey.

215
00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:58,882
Acosta's a thing,

216
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,450
but he's not our thing.

217
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:02,152
Now, we all can agree
that Ochoa is a criminal.

218
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,887
- Now, where are we at with him?
- Well, he's a recruiter

219
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,488
for Los Diablos Dormidos.

220
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,589
The I-2Ds.

221
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:08,434
The Sleeping Devils. They're bad news.

222
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,393
We didn't have those down
in Long Beach. Who are they?

223
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:12,073
See the world as their own personal hell.

224
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:13,987
Motto's "blood, rape, kill."

225
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:15,331
Most of them are undocumented.

226
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,666
They crossed in from El Salvador.

227
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,384
Ochoa uses that angle,

228
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,769
offers protection to the recruits

229
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:21,604
to get them into the fold.

230
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,406
Oh, look at that.

231
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,674
One of the guys that we swept up today

232
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,813
wants to talk.

233
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:26,976
Deacon, you're with me.

234
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,173
The rest of you dig into Ochoa's jacket.

235
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:30,165
Got it.

236
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,514
Everything okay?

237
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,249
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

238
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,185
It's just Cortez is
catching a lot of flack

239
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,020
for her new reform proposals.

240
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,156
Tan, you got a new girl?

241
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:42,492
Street does. Lots of them. He's trending

242
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,529
Yeah, way to go, player.

243
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:47,797
You're the early leader

244
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:50,200
for the next Jackass of the Month Award.

245
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,302
- Heh. He's a shoo-in.
- Start saving your money, Street.

246
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,670
Yes.

247
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,506
Before I narc on Ochoa,
I want protection.

248
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:59,609
I want to know that I'm not
going back to San Sal.

249
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:01,917
Only the Feds make
those kinds of deals, Messa.

250
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,181
Come on. I came here to get
away from guys like Ochoa.

251
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,484
I was only with him 'cause he
would've killed me if I wasn't.

252
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:08,618
Right.

253
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:11,320
And... he made me do things.

254
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,189
Like killing that city
worker on the street?

255
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,949
Hey, Lepo, he helped me with that, too.

256
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:19,893
Look, just keep me away from Ochoa, okay?

257
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:21,865
Only if you got something for us.

258
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:28,771
If you're looking for him,
he likes music.

259
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:34,310
All right, thanks.
Hey, Ochoa is a metalhead.

260
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,513
That's what this guy told Hondo
and Deacon? How's that help us?

261
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:37,747
Heavy metal's dead in I.A.

262
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,447
Not in Pico/Union, it's not.

263
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,152
Yeah, downtown, East Side,
that's Los Dormidos territory.

264
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:43,853
Right, I worked a Vice sting at a bar

265
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,221
for metalheads a couple years ago.

266
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,923
Maybe someone there
crossed paths with Ochoa

267
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,044
or knows where he's hiding.

268
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,326
All right, I'm texting the boss.
It's worth a shot.

269
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:55,031
Hey, shout outs from, uh,
pro-cop groups, badge bunnies,

270
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,433
and... oh, there's a swastika in
this one's profile pic.

271
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:58,601
Yeah, never mind.

272
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,203
We need to shut this down.

273
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,238
Shut it down? Face it,
Street, you're viral.

274
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,940
You have to stop caring what
people think about you.

275
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,575
I don't. But this throws
shade at all of us.

276
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,277
No, that's why we keep
our heads down. Do the work.

277
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,511
We were doing the work.

278
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,013
Street, you know what I'm saying.

279
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,600
I know, okay, the city needs to see

280
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,116
- we're there for them.
- So let's show 'em.

281
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,552
We belong! Justice! We belong!

282
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:19,455
- Justice! We belong!
- Justice! We belong!

283
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,791
Justice! We belong! Justice!

284
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,594
We belong! Justice! We belong!

285
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:26,529
Justice! We belong!

286
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:28,933
Think I don't see you, Officer?

287
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:32,568
My brother is innocent.
You arrested an innocent man.

288
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,784
You have any idea what it's like

289
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:41,793
to have someone you love
taken away from you?

290
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,579
Car.

291
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,819
Look, the Feds won't tell me where he is.

292
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,888
Do you know? Did they tell you?

293
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:53,489
Ms. Acosta, I want to help you.

294
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,558
I wish I could, but this isn't our fight.

295
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:57,627
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,366
You see the protest going on outside?

297
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,136
Yeah. We'll keep an eye on it.

298
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:08,838
Hicks have any leads on your car?

299
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,741
No. I'm not sure he's
my best ally right now.

300
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,910
Let me know when you get
something on Ochoa.

301
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:15,545
All right.

302
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,780
Michael.

303
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,240
Is there a place we can talk?

304
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,684
I've been trying to call you.

305
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,253
Did you see the proposals were leaked?

306
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:25,788
We have a bigger issue.

307
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:28,691
Is there something you want to tell me

308
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,692
about you and Sergeant Harrelson?

309
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:31,605
Oh, just now in the hall?

310
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,829
He's concerned about my car

311
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:35,531
- because it was vandalized this morning.
- Your car?

312
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,600
Yeah, it might be backlash
from the proposals.

313
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,093
I'm not sure yet.

314
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,015
How would you describe your
relationship with Hondo?

315
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,011
He's a great cop.

316
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:50,438
I trust his opinion a lot.

317
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,883
In fact, given how quickly
he was thrown into his job

318
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,486
as team leader,
he's exceeded my expectations.

319
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,499
Did he exceed your expectations

320
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,856
when he was kissing you this morning?

321
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,559
I was in your neighborhood
meeting with an outreach group,

322
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,827
saw the proposals hit the press,

323
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:06,296
wanted to try to strategize with you.

324
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,031
Michael, whatever you think you saw...

325
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:10,041
I saw you being intimate with
one of your subordinates.

326
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:17,106
Have you disclosed this
relationship to the department?

327
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:20,810
This is none of your business.

328
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:22,637
Have you?

329
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,349
No.

330
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:28,217
Of course not,

331
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:30,153
'cause then one of you
would have to transfer.

332
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:32,021
We thought if we never let it
interfere with work...

333
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:34,257
which it hasn't, ever.

334
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,326
- I promise.
- Really?

335
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,728
We've co-authored controversial proposals

336
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:40,396
to hold cops accountable
for their actions

337
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:42,398
and you're engaged in unethical conduct.

338
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,667
- I wouldn't consider it unethical.
- Of course you wouldn't.

339
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,336
But your bosses would.

340
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,970
And anyone else who wanted
to kill these ideas would.

341
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,542
Do you understand what
you've done to me here?

342
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:56,579
You and I both know these proposals

343
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,247
will be better for the city,

344
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,385
but our enemies will look
for any edge they can get.

345
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,786
And you're in a relationship

346
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,388
with an officer under your command?

347
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:07,190
And now what? Y-You
expect me to cover it up?

348
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:08,458
Hmm?

349
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,093
Take the fall with the two of you

350
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:12,161
when it eventually all
comes out, which it will?

351
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,148
I made a mistake.

352
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,484
And I'm sorry.

353
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:25,308
Who else knows about this?

354
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,659
No one.

355
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,036
No one.

356
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,875
What do you want me to do?

357
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,252
You can't have both.

358
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,887
It's the proposals or him.

359
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,989
You decide what you want to do.

360
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,838
Guess music really
does bring people together.

361
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,041
_

362
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:05,631
_

363
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:12,221
_

364
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:15,014
_

365
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,192
The last time you said that,

366
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,460
you drank a bottle of our best Patrón,

367
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:19,362
and then arrested half of our customers.

368
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,997
Yeah, we only want to arrest one more.

369
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,817
Toro Ochoa. Has he been in here?

370
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,201
We think he's hiding in the neighborhood.

371
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,836
You heard anything?

372
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,038
- We don't know where he is.
- Come on, ladies.

373
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,973
Guys like Ochoa give metalheads
a bad name.

374
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,443
I recognize you. From the news.

375
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:35,812
- You giving the cops a good name?
- I will if I get Ochoa.

376
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:41,759
All right, mister.

377
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,486
I'm-a tell you something,

378
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,822
- and then I want you the hell out.
- I'm all ears.

379
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,971
He brought a girl in, a <i>xe.</i>

380
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,826
They were in a couple nights ago.

381
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,661
Laurisa. A prostitute.

382
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:53,463
Works South Fig.

383
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:55,512
Calling Hondo.

384
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:56,745
Maybe he can bring this Laurisa in.

385
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,167
Thanks.

386
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:02,538
I don't know Toro Ochoa.

387
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:04,757
Don't even know how to spell it.

388
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,153
We got witnesses who say that
you're his squeeze, Laurisa.

389
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:11,946
They're wrong.

390
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,650
Who gave you that artwork on your neck?

391
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,486
Pretty, isn't it?

392
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,487
You're protecting him?

393
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,091
Ochoa is a paranoid son of a bitch.

394
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,294
You kill enough people,
the ghosts come out to play.

395
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:29,599
Laurisa,

396
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,300
I get that you're scared of him.

397
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:35,111
But maybe you'd feel better
with him behind bars

398
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:36,714
for the rest of his life.

399
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,344
No one will ever
know that you spoke to us.

400
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:44,146
We won't even remember
how to spell <i>your</i> name.

401
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,518
He's got a hideout...

402
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,563
a couple blocks from here.

403
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:14,670
Ochoa's squeeze said they
went into apartment 8B.

404
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:22,818
Ladies, come this way. Come this way.

405
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,920
Street, Chris, get 'em out.

406
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:25,788
- Move, move, move, move.
- Stop moving.

407
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,423
LAPD. Drop the weapon!

408
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:29,134
- Drop the weapon!
- I got a conceal and carry permit.

409
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:30,893
- Drop the weapon!
- Put it down now!

410
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,662
- I have a permit. Okay.
- Drop your weapon.

411
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,597
- I have a permit.
- Then you should know the law.

412
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:36,299
- On your stomach! Stomach!
- Okay. Okay.

413
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,633
- Face down! Down!
- All right.

414
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:39,402
- Give me your hands.
- You all right?

415
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:41,348
Yeah, yeah. Tell them to take
it easy, he's my brother.

416
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:43,906
It's not what it seems.
Ochoa shot at us first,

417
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,508
and then took off, like, two minutes ago.

418
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,609
- You doing business with him?
- No.

419
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:48,010
No. We're law-abiding citizens.

420
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,208
Then how do you explain all of this?

421
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,361
Hey, we're all in this together, man.

422
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,480
We want the same thing.

423
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:53,616
- What's that?
- To arrest Toro Ochoa.

424
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:04,020
So, Scott and Andy Clarke,
out of Medford, Oregon.

425
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,319
Why are you playing cops in our city?

426
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,821
We got a lead on Ochoa.

427
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,355
Attempted to make a citizen's arrest.

428
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,231
We're Promise Guards.

429
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,693
We monitor federal websites,
share intel with each other,

430
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:15,988
use vacation time to hunt
undocumented aliens.

431
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,889
You know, most people come
here to go to Disneyland.

432
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,758
Well, thank God for the Constitution.

433
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:21,605
Know what I mean?

434
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,397
You put innocent lives at risk.

435
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,966
If you knew where Ochoa was,
why didn't you call the police?

436
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,802
A dangerous guy like that out
there... we didn't want to wait.

437
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,058
How'd you know where to find him?

438
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:35,073
Bunch of us who are in town
had a chat with some I-2Ds

439
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,050
at a housing project in Van Nuys.

440
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:39,986
Oh, L2-Ds just offered up the
information, is that right?

441
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,219
Or did this little chat happen at the
end of your guns?

442
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:44,223
Let's just say we don't
have to deal with all those

443
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:46,559
pinko city council rules
that hold you guys back

444
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:49,562
- from doing the job.
- It's why the illegals are taking over.

445
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:51,464
Do you know that it
costs more for a citizen

446
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:53,527
to go to college then
it does for an immigrant?

447
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:54,855
That's not actually true, Mr. Clarke.

448
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,070
- Sure it is. Look it up.
- No, it's not.

449
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,883
I mean, I get that you have to say that.

450
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,121
But it's not worth arguing about.

451
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:03,661
The important thing is

452
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:06,829
Ochoa is still out there,
looking to hurt people.

453
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:08,021
All right, you know what?

454
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,758
I think we should work together.

455
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,326
Why don't you guys keep talking,

456
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,627
and I'll check back?

457
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,324
Your boss?

458
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,070
Yep.

459
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:23,630
So...

460
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:25,374
what else you got on Ochoa?

461
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,999
You won't believe who these guys are.

462
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,464
We need to talk first. In my office.

463
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:43,798
What's going on?

464
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,634
Michael knows.

465
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,283
Michael Plank? Wh... Knows what?

466
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:48,970
He saw us outside my place.

467
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,059
He was watching us?

468
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,475
He was there to check on me
after the article leaked.

469
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:56,630
He says we've put the proposals at risk.

470
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:59,047
And because of us, he's not
gonna move them forward.

471
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:01,056
Well, Jess, he's not
gonna let that happen.

472
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:02,023
His name's on them, too.

473
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:04,026
What happens now? Do I quit? Do you?

474
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,527
- Okay, slow down. Slow...
- We were naive to think

475
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:07,363
- we could get away with this.
- No, no.

476
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:09,231
We decided it wasn't the
department's business

477
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:11,086
what we do in our personal time.

478
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,070
He says I can't be trying
to reform the department

479
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:18,154
at the same time as I'm ignoring
a police regulation.

480
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,580
And he's right.

481
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:22,778
All right, look, you're
not alone in this.

482
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:24,146
Let me try and talk to him.

483
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,914
No, I'm the problem here.

484
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:27,883
- It's worth a try.
- And say what?

485
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,618
We knew we were risking
the department's rep,

486
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,382
but can you look the other way?

487
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,091
There's got to be an answer here.

488
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:37,593
I just need to figure out what.

489
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,061
Cortez,

490
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:41,563
protest outside is growing.

491
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:43,577
Captain, I'll keep you apprised on Ochoa.

492
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,136
- Sir.
- Hondo.

493
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,104
We need to diffuse it. Things are getting

494
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:52,841
out of hand. Rumor is they
want a rally at Grand Park.

495
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:56,912
Justice! We belong!

496
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:59,748
Justice! We belong! Justice!

497
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,650
We belong! Justice!

498
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:04,319
We belong! Justice! We belong!

499
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:05,954
Justice! We belong!

500
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:07,289
Ms. Acosta?

501
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,026
I'm Captain Cortez with the LAPD.

502
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:13,028
- Can we talk?
- What do you want?

503
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:15,364
They sent a Hispanic woman
out here to shut you up.

504
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:18,183
- I'm here to help.
- Are you an immigrant?

505
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:20,636
Yes. I moved here when I was 15,

506
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,137
became a citizen when I was 22.

507
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:23,972
Then which side are you on?

508
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:25,874
Yours, hers,

509
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,609
the city's.

510
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:29,178
What a bunch of political BS.

511
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:31,504
Just give me five minutes.

512
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:35,212
Here.

513
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:38,187
We belong! Justice!

514
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:40,622
We belong! Justice! We belong!

515
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:42,124
All right, listen up. There's a bunch

516
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:43,826
of Promise Guards in town.
They've been uploading

517
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,161
surveillance of undocumented
aliens to their Web site.

518
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:48,630
Guys we just interviewed said
that they got footage of Ochoa.

519
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:50,766
Here's the URL and the password.

520
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,906
Why aren't these guys in custody?

521
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,476
Well, they didn't do anything
illegal. I spoke to the DA.

522
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,412
Their gun permits checked out.
They didn't disrupt our raid.

523
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,047
So, it's cool to terrify people
by shooting up

524
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,049
- an apartment building, right?
- Self-defense, yeah.

525
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,851
And Ochoa and no one else
is gonna press charges.

526
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:10,819
Probably 'cause they're all undocumented.

527
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:12,094
Crime's a crime, Chris.

528
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,084
And a lot of people don't
agree with sanctuary cities.

529
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,232
Do you?

530
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,693
I don't know, I think
it makes our job harder.

531
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:19,261
Tan?

532
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,864
Got a cousin who enlisted
to get citizenship.

533
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,232
Blown to pieces in Iraq.

534
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,733
System needs to be reformed.

535
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,236
Look, it's a tricky subject, but we can

536
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,738
debate it later over beers once
we get Ochoa into custody.

537
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:32,418
- Check it out.
- All right, so, Ochoa was at

538
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,376
that housing project
when the ICE raid went down.

539
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,023
Who's he talking to there?

540
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:39,727
Where's Street?

541
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:44,157
Ariana Acosta,

542
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,354
Officer Street.

543
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,456
What's happening outside isn't

544
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,525
helping Carlos or this department.

545
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,059
We need to calm things down.

546
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:52,920
To do that, both sides need to be heard.

547
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:54,363
You don't want to hear me.

548
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:56,265
You just want to stop me
from getting people's attention.

549
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,699
Try us.

550
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,756
Okay if I step out while you two talk?

551
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:04,907
Just...

552
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:07,342
listen to each other.

553
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,312
You're a monster.

554
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:18,438
My brother is completely innocent.

555
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:20,725
Easy to have a problem
with a cop until you need one.

556
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:23,667
Honestly, we were there to help.

557
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:26,094
And then, one of ICE's guys got stabbed,

558
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,330
and then, all of a sudden, there's

559
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:29,965
all these people running,
and you don't know who's who.

560
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,400
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

561
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:33,735
Officer,

562
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,971
my brother is not Toro Ochoa.

563
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:37,379
He's not a criminal.

564
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:39,608
Well, he was acting like one. He ran.

565
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:42,941
And I arrested him as
peacefully as possible.

566
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:46,481
And we are just trying
to keep the city safe.

567
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:50,652
Your turn, I guess.

568
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:54,803
How could you possibly understand?

569
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,642
Try me.

570
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,695
Well, to start, you arrested my hero.

571
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:01,997
Carlos risked his life

572
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,199
so we could escape the gangs
in El Salvador.

573
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:07,202
I was 12, he was 18.

574
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:09,137
When we got here,

575
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:13,976
he worked as a day laborer
so he could pay rent, feed us.

576
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,039
He sacrificed for me.

577
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:19,781
I'm a medical student at UCLA now.

578
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:21,450
I'm going to be a pediatrician.

579
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,619
Impressive.

580
00:25:23,653 --> 00:25:25,168
Because of him.

581
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:28,633
And he's nothing like the trash
that is Toro Ochoa.

582
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,846
Are you sure about that, Ms. Acosta?

583
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,998
That's your brother, chatting it up

584
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:37,866
with Toro Ochoa.

585
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:44,239
What's the deal with this?

586
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:46,581
Um... I don't know.

587
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:47,660
Okay.

588
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:49,198
Then we're gonna need to find out.

589
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,976
You told ICE that
you didn't know Toro Ochoa.

590
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,185
I live in

591
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,354
the same building as his crew.
You can't always avoid him.

592
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,856
That don't look like casual conversation.

593
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,324
I'm not a gang member.

594
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:03,926
I don't like I-2D's talking to me,

595
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,394
- but it's better than pissing them off.
- You know

596
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:07,353
something about Ochoa,
it could help your case.

597
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:09,336
Why should I help you? You put me here.

598
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,266
Think about your sister.
She's worried about you, Carlos.

599
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:13,116
I am. I'm trying to protect her!

600
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:14,640
Your sister in some kind of trouble?

601
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,707
She's DACA, a Dreamer.

602
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:21,109
With all the politics,
she could get deported.

603
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:23,545
What's that got to do with Ochoa?

604
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,584
About a week ago, he heard me
talking to someone on the phone

605
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:31,086
about a place to hide Ariana
if someone ever came for her.

606
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,726
There's an underground...

607
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:40,562
members of temples

608
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:43,532
and congregations that help hide
undocumented workers.

609
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,067
They make their homes available.

610
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:46,435
To keep families together.

611
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:48,215
There are thousands of Arianas.

612
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,406
If the Feds find out about the network,

613
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:53,626
those families won't have
any place to go.

614
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:55,644
You think Ochoa's hiding from us
in this underground?

615
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,169
He said someone was after him

616
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,951
and he needed a place to lay low.

617
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:04,690
I told him I wouldn't help.

618
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:07,823
Two days ago,

619
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,591
someone broke into my apartment,

620
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:13,261
went through all my stuff,
stole my cell phone.

621
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,299
In it... was Ariana's contact.

622
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,734
He could be there.

623
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:20,002
What's this contact's name?

624
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,970
Gregory McGahan.

625
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:31,337
_

626
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:33,837
_

627
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:35,859
_

628
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,571
_

629
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,726
_

630
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:47,963
Ochoa's inside, I'm pretty sure
he's armed. McGahan's scared.

631
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,537
Move in now. Keep it quiet.
Keep it contained.

632
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:55,470
Luca?

633
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:57,005
Almost there.

634
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:02,706
Now.

635
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,183
- In position.
- On my count.

636
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:17,448
_

637
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:18,365
One.

638
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,271
_

639
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:21,190
Two.

640
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:22,383
_

641
00:28:22,823 --> 00:28:23,830
_

642
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:25,267
Three.

643
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,807
Left side clear!

644
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:34,876
Right side's clear!

645
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,847
- Give me two!
- Two! Two!

646
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:42,384
We got you.

647
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:50,816
Give me your arm. Give me your other arm.

648
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,061
Relax, Mr. Ochoa.

649
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:55,497
_

650
00:28:55,765 --> 00:28:57,232
Save the street poetry for the Feds.

651
00:28:58,101 --> 00:29:00,035
Street, we good?

652
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,264
We're good.

653
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:09,550
<i>Ochoa's headed</i> to a deportation facility.

654
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:11,209
ICE'll take it from there.

655
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:13,765
Sir, is there anything
we can do for Carlos Acosta

656
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,085
since he helped us catch this guy?

657
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,136
I'll ask. Meantime,
we got another problem.

658
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:18,838
The protestors moved to Grand Park.

659
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:20,987
Inciters on both sides.
It's getting noisy.

660
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:22,575
Better treat everybody with kid gloves.

661
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,910
Don't want to end up in front
of the captain's firing squad.

662
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:27,580
Want to discuss policy in our
free time, I'm happy to do it,

663
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:29,382
but right now, focus on the job.

664
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:31,117
All I want to do <i>is</i> the job.

665
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:34,453
Start crowd control protocol.

666
00:29:34,488 --> 00:29:37,690
Deacon, get the team ready
in case we have to go in.

667
00:29:37,724 --> 00:29:39,010
Hello?

668
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:41,260
Commissioner, good.

669
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:42,962
Brought him in hoping
he could work something

670
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:44,530
from the community angle.

671
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:46,232
I made a few calls. People are angry.

672
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,767
Feel like the cops betrayed
them on this issue.

673
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,950
- It's more complicated than that.
- Sergeant,

674
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:52,238
given Acosta's arrest, I'm not
sure SWAT's the best idea here.

675
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,141
If we don't go in, and things turn bad,

676
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:57,109
we'll catch the heat for not showing up.

677
00:29:57,144 --> 00:29:58,611
Maybe.

678
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:00,746
Captain, what do you think?

679
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:03,750
I agree with Hondo.

680
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,947
We need to be ready to go in. Everyone

681
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:07,420
in Class C uniforms.

682
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:09,479
Less confrontational.

683
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:11,038
I'll keep on my contacts,

684
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,919
see what I can do to calm things down.

685
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:15,839
Excuse me, sir?

686
00:30:17,174 --> 00:30:18,597
I think we need to talk.

687
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,766
I'm sure we do.

688
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:22,668
Sergeant, sorry if you disagree,
but your team's

689
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:24,639
not the best face
for the department right now.

690
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:27,639
What exactly do you know about tactics?

691
00:30:27,664 --> 00:30:28,908
Not much.

692
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:30,943
But I know a show of force
by the same cops

693
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:32,445
who caused this outrage
isn't the best option.

694
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,080
- Cortez solved that.
- For now.

695
00:30:34,114 --> 00:30:36,300
See if she made the right call
when things get more heated.

696
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,912
Is that really where your head is at?

697
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:38,919
What?

698
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:40,619
I'm just trying to figure
out why you're spying

699
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:43,116
on Captain Cortez and me
in front of her apartment.

700
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:45,191
Hmm?

701
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:47,460
What's your deal?

702
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:54,002
I'm jealous.

703
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:57,672
The two of you are very lucky.

704
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,142
You're in a line of work

705
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:06,681
where you know who the bad guys
are and who the good guys are.

706
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:11,050
See, in politics, if someone
doesn't like your ideas,

707
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:12,785
they don't attack them, they attack you,

708
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,620
smiling at you the whole time.

709
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:16,655
That's why you always have
to make the first play,

710
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,652
stay ahead of your foes.

711
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,326
Like you did with your reform proposals.

712
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,374
Excuse me?

713
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,896
You leaked 'em to the papers, didn't you?

714
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,198
I had to,

715
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,901
before the rank-and-file killed
the whole thing internally.

716
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:31,070
If I had known the two of
you were screwing one another

717
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:33,117
and the department, I
wouldn't have wasted my time.

718
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:34,844
Nobody knows about us but you.

719
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,134
The more Cortez is out there,
publicly pushing this agenda,

720
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,478
the more people focus on
every detail of her life.

721
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:40,880
You'll both be exposed.

722
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:45,050
- So, wait. You're looking out for us?
- Not you.

723
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:46,919
Just Jessica.

724
00:31:46,953 --> 00:31:48,754
She's smart.

725
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,856
She'll go places if she
doesn't get dinged by this.

726
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:55,027
What hasn't sunken in for her
yet is the double standard.

727
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:58,901
See, if a man wants to shake
things up, make 'em stick,

728
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:00,987
he can probably get away

729
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:02,401
with an intern on her
knees in the White House,

730
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:04,739
or a tryst with Russian call girls,

731
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,158
but not a woman.

732
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,010
Jessica can't ignore
department regulations

733
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,745
and sleep with one of her subordinates

734
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,747
while lecturing other
cops on how to behave.

735
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:16,882
That's what the story will be,

736
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:19,351
not what Jessica's trying
to do for this city.

737
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,856
You're asking me what my
deal is, Sergeant Harrelson?

738
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:26,511
What's yours?

739
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:31,897
Because if you cared
about Jessica at all,

740
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,600
you'd want to protect her.

741
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:50,382
What's going on, Mr. Clarke?

742
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:51,784
It's just you and me out here. What's up?

743
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:54,544
- You see that rally we're starting up?
- Sure.

744
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,158
- What about it?
- I got to thinking,

745
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:58,257
after you and I talked.

746
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:59,925
Thinking about a lot of stuff.

747
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,327
Yeah? Like what?

748
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:02,964
My brother, you know,

749
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,064
Andy and the rest of those guys
that are in town,

750
00:33:05,098 --> 00:33:06,966
they're against illegal immigration

751
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,734
like the rest of the
counter-protesters out there.

752
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,402
But they...

753
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,391
They're planning on taking it too far.

754
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,137
I signed up to bag criminals, you know?

755
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:19,439
Illegals, like we talked about.

756
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,281
But I don't think she qualifies.

757
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,136
Who?

758
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:25,961
Hondo.

759
00:33:25,996 --> 00:33:27,655
Promise Guards are at the rally.

760
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,455
They're targeting
Acosta's sister, Ariana.

761
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:30,738
Wait, what?

762
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:32,191
Clarke said that they want to
make an example out of her.

763
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:34,193
Take her to the border
and throw her on the other side.

764
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:36,028
- The border?
- Tan, pull up their Web site.

765
00:33:36,062 --> 00:33:38,020
Get photos of these guys. Why this girl?

766
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:39,567
She's a name now. She's been on TV.

767
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,294
She represents a lot to a lot of people.

768
00:33:41,328 --> 00:33:44,206
Right now, she needs our
help. Remember these faces.

769
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:46,839
They're our targets. Let's move.

770
00:33:50,543 --> 00:33:51,626
We belong here!

771
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:52,778
We belong! Justice!

772
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:54,747
Justice for Carlos Acosta!

773
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:57,950
We want justice!

774
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,318
His sister, Ariana Acosta.

775
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:01,887
Please, welcome her.

776
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,220
We belong! Justice! We belong!

777
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:17,543
My brother didn't hurt anyone.

778
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:19,558
He shouldn't have been arrested.

779
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,260
And as an upstanding member
of this community,

780
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:25,813
he has rights. He has a voice.

781
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:27,600
Let the police and the Feds know

782
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:29,668
that what they've done is wrong.

783
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:31,036
Carlos doesn't deserve

784
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,363
to be deported!

785
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:33,643
This is his home!

786
00:34:33,677 --> 00:34:35,025
Park bench, 12 o'clock.

787
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:37,163
My home! Your home!

788
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:38,849
Chris, Rocker, go left.

789
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,784
Deacon, Mumford,
take the boys and go right.

790
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:42,753
Tell the Feds and police they're wrong!

791
00:34:42,787 --> 00:34:44,854
Look, this fight isn't just for Carlos.

792
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:47,391
This fight is for all of us.

793
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:50,437
We all have a voice! We all belong here!

794
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:51,971
Three o'clock and they're armed.

795
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,244
All of 'em.

796
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:54,331
The hell you think you're doing,

797
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:55,376
showing your face around here?

798
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:56,431
Step aside.

799
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:01,609
- Let us do our jobs. Come on.
- Hey, man.

800
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,307
You heard what he said.

801
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:05,676
We're taking you back
to the border, bitch.

802
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:14,151
We lost her.

803
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:15,018
Anyone have eyes?

804
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,424
They're headed towards a blue pickup.

805
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,154
- South side of the park.
- Let 'em go.

806
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:23,527
Away from the crowd. Copy.

807
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:24,898
We need breathing room, Deac.

808
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:27,231
Two more suspects.

809
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,159
Hey!

810
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:35,472
Stay back!

811
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:36,607
- Stay back!
- Stay back!

812
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:38,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stay back!

813
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,176
Back, back, back!

814
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,523
Stay back!

815
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:42,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

816
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:48,952
It's okay.

817
00:35:48,987 --> 00:35:50,721
Stay back! Back! Back!

818
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:52,723
- Stay back!
- Hey, hey, hey.

819
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:54,531
Take it easy!

820
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:56,360
Take it easy and stay calm!

821
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:58,695
Listen to me, we hear you!

822
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,330
You have the right to protest!

823
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:02,866
But you will be arrested
if you don't step back!

824
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,168
We're directing you to disperse!

825
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:05,702
We want to keep everyone safe!

826
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:06,949
Give us some room!

827
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:09,206
Please! HONDO: Step back!

828
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:11,642
Step back now!

829
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:22,214
You all right?

830
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,274
Yeah, I think so. Thank you.

831
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:46,226
- How's the team?
- They're good.

832
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,795
Tired, but they're good.

833
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:52,365
I called Agent Jones
to follow up on Carlos Acosta.

834
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,100
See if we can stop his deportation.

835
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:56,203
Well, the fact that he helped us
take down a killer

836
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:57,270
should mean something.

837
00:36:57,305 --> 00:36:58,741
We'll hear soon.

838
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,476
I hate this.

839
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:06,040
Yeah, I know.

840
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,877
But I think maybe we both know
what the deal is.

841
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,631
Jess, after everything we just
went through at that rally,

842
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:16,608
there's still a long way to go
to improve relations

843
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,136
between the cops and the community.

844
00:37:19,727 --> 00:37:22,028
And you have an opportunity
to change things.

845
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:24,731
I can't turn my back on that.

846
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:26,499
No, you can't.

847
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,501
You need the space to do the great things

848
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:29,769
that I know you're gonna do.

849
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:31,438
- Hondo...
- Jess, come on now.

850
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,640
Right now,

851
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,642
I'm in the way.

852
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:39,032
The timing isn't right.

853
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:42,148
You got to do you.

854
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:44,384
And you can't do that with me.

855
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,357
Maybe down the road it could be right?

856
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:55,495
I believe that.

857
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:58,384
Yeah, maybe.

858
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:07,185
I never said it before, but...

859
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,774
I love you.

860
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:20,448
I love you, too.

861
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:27,327
Okay.

862
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:38,972
Hello?

863
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:11,338
I know this is difficult

864
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:13,006
and I don't want you to lose hope,

865
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,774
but your brother
has been transferred by ICE

866
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:16,710
to an Arizona facility.

867
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:18,494
They're moving ahead on deporting him.

868
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,913
Okay, so what do we do now?

869
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:22,382
It's out of our hands.

870
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:24,303
What, so we just give up?

871
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:28,521
I appreciate you for trying,
Captain Cortez.

872
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:30,523
But I'm going to bring him home,

873
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:33,126
with or without your help.

874
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,067
Ms. Acosta?

875
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,700
Ariana?

876
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,135
Wait.

877
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:44,104
Look, you don't have
to worry about me anymore.

878
00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:46,072
No, it's because of me he's
headed back to El Salvador,

879
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,589
- right?
- You were doing your job.

880
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:48,708
You didn't know who Carlos was.

881
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:50,276
Well, you tried to tell me.

882
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:51,611
I mean, you were yelling.

883
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:53,613
But you tried.

884
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:57,217
Please. Please. I'm sorry.

885
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:00,360
I'm sorry for my part in this.

886
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,555
I hope you get him back.

887
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,510
And I want to try to help you.

888
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:09,262
I, um, have this.

889
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,465
This is the number
for an immigration attorney.

890
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,467
He's supposed to be great.

891
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,169
Does pro bono work.

892
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,858
And, uh, that's my number.

893
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,508
If you need something,

894
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,011
anything, please call.

895
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,780
Okay.

896
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:28,326
Thank you.

897
00:40:44,852 --> 00:40:46,286
Come in.

898
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:55,842
It's done. We broke up.

899
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:58,111
As far as anyone else is concerned,

900
00:40:58,145 --> 00:41:00,113
it never happened.

901
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,515
We can move forward with the proposals.

902
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:06,977
Two of you can hold to that?

903
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:10,857
Michael, my priority is to
this department, to this city.

904
00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:13,526
Anything else would be selfish.

905
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:21,295
You all right?

906
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:24,549
I'm good.

907
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:43,823
Another SWAT day is a good day!

908
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:45,492
Let's make it count!

909
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,494
It's too early for the enthusiasm, Luca.

910
00:41:47,528 --> 00:41:49,162
Yo, man up, Tan.

911
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:50,830
Street, you ready?

912
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,332
Yeah, let's do it.

913
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:57,170
Everything all right today, boss?

914
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,572
Yeah.

915
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:01,241
Oh, yeah. I'm great.

916
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:29,899

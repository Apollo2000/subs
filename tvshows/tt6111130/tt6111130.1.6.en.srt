1
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,266
Out. Now.

2
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:03,036
- Move!
- Okay, okay.

3
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:06,911
On your knees.

4
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:13,580
One, two, three. Eyes on me.

5
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:15,081
Stop!

6
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:23,957
Why the hell did you kill him?

7
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,092
I didn't like how he looked at her.

8
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:27,327
You told me I was gonna race the winner.

9
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:28,928
Not watch you cap some trucker.

10
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,598
And you told us you
wanted to do business.

11
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,333
Now we got blood ties.

12
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:53,352
Okay.

13
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:55,368
GPS systems are off-line,

14
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:57,370
just killing the cell interfaces
and we're good to go.

15
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:58,731
You're a genius, Whip.

16
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,541
If I warned you, you wouldn't have come.

17
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,077
You want us to trust you? We
needed to know that you legit.

18
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,578
I'm just here to cut a deal, okay?

19
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:07,132
- I didn't sign up for murder.
- Our broker

20
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,215
isn't a man eager to meet new people.

21
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,151
And like I said, he's already
got a buyer for China.

22
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:12,366
Then why the hell am I here?

23
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,220
We're sticking our necks
our for you on this.

24
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:17,290
- Try to appreciate it.
- You make the deal happen,

25
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:18,858
I'll make sure everybody gets paid.

26
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:25,131
Wait for a call from Juergen.

27
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,233
Be ready to go where he tells you.

28
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:29,302
Juergen Richter?

29
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:31,437
- That's your broker?
- I told you.

30
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,106
We ain't messing around.

31
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,521
What's up, youngster?

32
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,023
Looking good, Raymont.

33
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,825
How are you healing up?

34
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,161
I'm all right.

35
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,329
My mom call you or something?

36
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:57,330
She did.

37
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,032
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,266
I guess so.

39
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,834
Mom!

40
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,804
How's school? Getting any love
for that scar?

41
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:06,773
Nah. Just questions.

42
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,775
All right, wait till you get to college.

43
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:10,977
Story like that, you're gonna be
big man on campus. Trust me.

44
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,912
If I still decide to go.

45
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,515
Hondo.

46
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,356
Thanks for coming by.

47
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,719
Raymont, get your books for school.

48
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:21,226
You are gonna miss home room.

49
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,727
Little rough lately?

50
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:33,366
When your boy gets shot by SWAT,
you don't expect it to be easy,

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,834
but Raymont is sliding.

52
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,170
I mean, physically, he's doing great.

53
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:38,471
Mentally, it takes time.

54
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,073
Raymont doesn't have time.

55
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:42,041
He's got college applications, exams.

56
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,509
The way I see it?

57
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:46,346
Your people did the
damage inside and out.

58
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,981
Your job to make it right.

59
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:50,650
100%. I'm not gonna
let him slide off track.

60
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:52,098
He barely eats.

61
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,320
Nightmares.

62
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:57,423
And yesterday I found this.

63
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,292
Under his bed.

64
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:03,196
He know you found it?

65
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:07,639
It's loaded.

66
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,773
The numbers are scratched off,
which means he bought it

67
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,942
on the street from people he
shouldn't be associating with.

68
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:17,777
The son I knew before he was shot

69
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:19,279
would never bring home a gun.

70
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:20,880
Okay, okay. I understand.

71
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,382
But listen to me.

72
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,916
I'm gonna hold on to this.

73
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,685
And I know he's got to get off to school,

74
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:28,121
but you bring him by SWAT
afterwards and I'll talk to him.

75
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:29,889
Thank you.

76
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,591
He likes you.

77
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,660
Not just because you saved his life.

78
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:37,397
He thinks you're good people.

79
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,744
Yeah. What's up, Street?

80
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,080
If I'd gotten there ten seconds
sooner, I could've stopped it.

81
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:55,715
What were you doing there
in the first place?

82
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:57,230
It's an old undercover
gig from Long Beach.

83
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,025
He told me about it a half hour ago.

84
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,420
I was working these street racers.

85
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:01,954
The ones jacking luxury cars?

86
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:04,290
I read about it in your file.

87
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:06,459
- I thought that case went cold.
- It did.

88
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:07,927
I'd sold myself as a buyer

89
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,429
looking to ship the rides to China.

90
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:10,763
Then they told me their broker
had another guy.

91
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,435
I didn't hear from them
for a couple months.

92
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,833
I thought it was dead.

93
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:16,235
And then last night, they
spot me at this bar I like.

94
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,638
It's a miracle my cover
held, and they tell me

95
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,752
they got a deal that I can't pass up.

96
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,575
So, Street decides that leaping in

97
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:24,110
without notifying anyone
was a smart plan.

98
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:25,445
I didn't have time.

99
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,513
What was I gonna do?
Call with them watching?

100
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,082
And now you've witnessed a murder.

101
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:30,817
So, why isn't this crew in custody?

102
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,019
Because of who they're in business with.

103
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:35,930
Juergen Richter.

104
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:38,791
The Juergen Richter.
If I'd known he was tied in,

105
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:40,760
I would've never let the case go cold.

106
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:43,596
Guy is top dog in high-end stolen goods.

107
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,587
Cars, art, diamonds.

108
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,667
- Moves more volume than Amazon.
- I know him.

109
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,794
SIS has been trying to build
a case for years.

110
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:51,398
Yeah, along with FBI, DOJ

111
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,972
and every other agency with initials.

112
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:54,559
Yeah, but nothing sticks.

113
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:57,110
He's smart, Street.

114
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:58,811
He keeps a tight circle.

115
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,947
Anyone he thinks might
flip on him gets got.

116
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,115
Except me.

117
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,950
You haven't met him yet.

118
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:05,718
The last guy the feds
were working for intel...

119
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:07,387
rumor is, Richter gutted him.

120
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:08,988
Personally.

121
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,123
Some people think he's got connections

122
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:11,858
inside the department.

123
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:13,427
Tip him off when the heat's on.

124
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,934
Well, then now's our chance.

125
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,996
No one outside SWAT knows about this,

126
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,499
and any minute he's gonna
call me to set a meet.

127
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,301
I agree to take the cars,
we nail him at the buy.

128
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,470
Richter will pick a spot
that he's already staked out.

129
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:26,139
That won't give us time
to set up anything,

130
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:28,246
and we'll be lucky
to keep eyes on Street.

131
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:31,082
I know I've had a bumpy start here.

132
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,913
Let me make up for it.

133
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:36,015
I'm giving you a chance

134
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,089
to bust Juergen Richter.

135
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,354
You're really gonna say no to that?

136
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,356
Give us a minute.

137
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,500
- Richter's major.
- No doubt.

138
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,669
But there's a lot of variables
in this we can't control,

139
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,104
the biggest one being Street.

140
00:06:58,138 --> 00:06:59,405
You don't think he's up for it?

141
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,008
I think he's come a long way.

142
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,743
I think he's smart,
but he's way overconfident,

143
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,278
unpredictable, and a gig like this

144
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,013
can go sideways real fast.

145
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,348
If it were you going in,

146
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:10,983
you'd still be against it?

147
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,121
I'll clear it with Long Beach,

148
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:16,923
but won't mention Richter to be safe.

149
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:18,224
You're asking a lot of this kid.

150
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:19,625
Street is SWAT.

151
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,694
I have to trust my people in the field.

152
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,199
All right, I'll coach him up.

153
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,973
I'll get him ready.

154

00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:32,495
Nice climb.

156
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:35,806
Thanks, back there.

157
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,008
You think he's gonna pass us?

158
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,213
Photos were pulled from failed
cases against Richter.

159
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,282
This dude is slippery as hell.

160
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,885
Everybody knows he's dirty, but
no one's been able to prove it.

161
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,354
He's made a career
out of escaping police stings.

162
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:51,677
Sergeant Harrelson?

163
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,118
Warren, what's up, man?

164
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:55,512
Warren here was Richter's
parole officer years back.

165
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:56,712
Only man we've been able to track down

166
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,214
who had in-person contact.

167
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,049
I work private security now.

168
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,219
Never forgot Juergen Richter,
though. Strange dude.

169
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,465
Warren, what can
you tell us about Richter?

170
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,487
Smart as hell.

171
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:07,756
But he's into this Brazilian
spiritism thing.

172
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,258
- Oh, like a religion?
- More like a cult.

173
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,160
He talked about things

174
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,103
like his spirit crew and
human sacrifice rituals.

175
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,635
Yeah, well, that's not spooky at all.

176
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,499
You want to get into
business with Richter,

177
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:19,535
you have to let him think he knows you.

178
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:20,869
Okay. How do I do that?

179
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,271
Eye contact.

180
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:23,572
He likes a lot of it,

181
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,152
like he can read you somehow.

182
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:26,853
And he'll try and see if he can
make you slip up,

183
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:29,189
so expect a lot of awkward pauses.

184
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,590
Kind of like a typical day for you.

185
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:31,958
Except, don't drink.

186
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:34,494
Richter doesn't respect people
who poison their bodies.

187
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,436
Yeah.

188
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:41,940
I'll be there.

189
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:46,639
Jake and Ike's in an hour. The cop joint?

190
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,875
Probably gets off knowing they can ID him

191
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,877
but don't have the dirt to arrest him.

192
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:52,479
And a diner full of police is
the last place

193
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:54,314
- an undercover would want to meet.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:57,784
It's your first test.

195
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,323
All right, Tan and Luca
will have your tail.

196
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:04,824
If you get into trouble,
they'll bail you out.

197
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,126
Ah, relax, boss.

198
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,694
I'm bringing my spirit crew as backup.

199
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:09,129
You're gonna need more than a few jokes

200
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:10,697
to pull one over on this guy, Street.

201
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:12,365
I logged a lot of hours in plain clothes

202
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,034
and I know how easy it is
for things to go sideways.

203
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:15,835
I worked some covert in Long Beach.

204
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,670
- I've done this before.
- Not on my team you haven't,

205
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,602
and not up against somebody like this.

206
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:22,061
Okay.

207
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,144
- Any advice? I'm all ears.
- First,

208
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:26,579
lay off the humor. A guy who
makes light of everything

209
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,748
usually has something to hide,
and don't go running your mouth.

210
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:30,683
The more you talk, the
more chances you have

211
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:32,218
of making mistakes.

212
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:33,653
You're really worried about this.

213
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,388
Richter is no joke.

214
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:36,890
This is as real as it gets.

215
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:38,391
If you think you're in trouble, you are.

216
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,759
Don't wait around to be sure,

217
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:40,994
you get the hell out of there.

218
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:42,095
I won't let you down.

219
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:45,732
I know you won't.

220
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,434
Cortez and I wouldn't be putting you in

221
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:49,048
if we weren't sure of it.

222
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:56,277
Not easy

223
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,737
staying behind
while other people head off

224
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,243
into danger, is it?

225
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:02,937
Oh. Thanks.

226
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,726
Mr. Cooper.

227
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:28,028
Kind of you to join me.

228
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,630
I appreciate you making the time.

229
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:30,564
Beer?

230
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,732
No, thank you.

231
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,866
I'm having one.

232
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,035
No offense, but I'm here to do business,

233
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,904
not to get buzzed.

234
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,875
Tell me, how is it that life...

235
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,645
brings you to this restaurant?

236
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,214
Certainly there were other things

237
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,359
you could have chosen
to do with your life?

238
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,653
Why this?

239
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,587
My mother.

240
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:56,423
- So this is a family business.
- No.

241
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,792
But she always had survival skills,

242
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,995
and I've done my best to learn from them.

243
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,297
I knew from a young age,
if I was gonna get ahead,

244
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,932
I have to pick what game to play

245
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,001
and figure out how to bend
the rules to my advantage.

246
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,003
- And you picked this one?
- It picked me.

247
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,677
Always dug cars.

248
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:11,972
Love the adrenaline.

249
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:12,925
And how does

250
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,775
- your mother feel about that?
- Hey, Jimmy.

251
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:17,645
Wallace!

252
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,279
Hey, man. How long's it been?

253
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,850
Interesting meetup spot.

254
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:24,251
I feel safer

255
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,286
surrounded by L.A.'s finest. Don't you?

256
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,921
Depends on the circumstances.

257
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,390
I suppose it does.

258
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,460
You were just about to tell me

259
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:35,763
if you and your mother are still close.

260
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,931
She died when I was 12.

261
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,334
My father finally got the better of her.

262
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,870
But I still turn to her for advice.

263
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:45,205
She's still part of
every decision I make.

264
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,207
So, in that sense, yeah, we're close.

265
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:53,547
If I provide transportation

266
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:55,466
to the harbor,

267
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,519
do you have a ship ready

268
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:00,220
to receive your purchase?

269
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:02,181
Absolutely.

270
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,795
Well, damn.

271
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,730
You bite that thing any harder,
it might just bite you back.

272
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,636
I read your Climbing Cadre evaluation.

273
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,504
Nothing new, I just...

274
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:18,505
just have to push myself

275
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,973
harder next time.

276
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,371
Deac.

277
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:29,650
Says she alternated between

278
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,251
indecision and recklessness.

279
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:33,654
- Took unnecessary risks.
- Come on.

280
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,988
We've seen her climb. She's good.

281
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,423
Yeah.

282
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,092
You know this instructor out of Metro,

283
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,426
- Tom Cole?
- Sure.

284
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,861
Yeah, he's tried out for SWAT
a couple times.

285
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:41,862
He never made it.

286
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:43,397
But he's always been cool to me.

287
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,032
Feel him out, will you?
See if you can find out

288
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,100
what happened on that wall.

289
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:48,088
Hondo?

290
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,436
Luanne.

291
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:50,855
Hey.

292
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,673
What's up, kid?

293
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,842
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Why don't I leave

294
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,711
- you two to catch up a bit?
- All right, sounds good.

295
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,279
I'll bring him home
when he gets sick of me.

296
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:00,180
Thanks.

297
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,407
Hey.

298
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,217
You hungry? Want something to eat?

299
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,553
Raymont.

300
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:07,688
I'm Deacon.

301
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,595
It's an honor to meet you.

302
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,525
If you ever need anything,
you got every officer

303
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,060
in this department at your service.

304
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,801
You know you're lucky, right?

305
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,871
I don't share my lunch with just anybody.

306
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:26,874
All right, so what's this

307
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,909
about you maybe not going to college?

308
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:30,853
Just haven't decided yet.

309
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,814
You know you want that.

310
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,444
Raymont, you got the grades.

311
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,488
Wasn't college always the plan?

312
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:44,792
I get it, you've been through a lot,

313
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,426
and it takes time to adjust.

314
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:48,962
But you can't let life's punches
knock you off track.

315
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,731
They're not.

316
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,634
You want to tell me about the gun, then?

317
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:56,403
She found it?

318
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,638
Mm-hmm.

319
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:02,576
Look, I know my mom thinks you can help,

320
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,755
but I don't need it. I'm good.

321
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,847
You're a 17-year-old kid
sleeping with a loaded gun

322
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:07,848
under your bed.

323
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:09,850
It's all right to admit

324
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:10,983
you're scared after being shot.

325
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,493
That's got nothing to do with it.

326
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,854
So, what do you plan
on doing with the gun?

327
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:15,189
Somebody giving you problems?

328
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,427
Street's back. The buy's
going down in two hours.

329
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,595
Go ahead.

330
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,931
I need to start my homework, anyway.

331
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,701
To be continued.

332
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:35,130
This is a scenario Richter's
played out a thousand times.

333
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:36,264
The vehicles will arrive

334
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:37,477
preloaded in a shipping container,

335
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:39,061
so we shouldn't have rabbits
in race cars.

336
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,335
We need more time to plan this.

337
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,536
Two hours is all I could get us.

338
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,704
But Richter's in.

339
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:44,302
This is our shot at him.

340
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:47,308
All right, we cover the ins

341
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:48,343
and outs.

342
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:49,711
Chris, you're Sierra One here.

343
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,780
Tan, Sierra Two here.

344
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:52,981
<i>You set up sniper positions,</i>

345
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,182
<i>wait for my command.</i>

346
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,383
<i>Deac, Luca.</i>

347
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:56,885
<i>You're in the Charger here.</i>

348
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,219
<i>I'll be on the ground right here.</i>

349
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,287
<i>We set up a code five for the area.</i>

350
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:02,015
Mumford, you and your team
maintain a perimeter.

351
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,825
- Could use some unis to tighten the net.
- No.

352
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,061
We can't take the chance
Richter spots them. We hold

353
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,529
until Street makes the exchange.

354
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:09,798
We go on my signal. Any questions?

355
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:11,499
- How big a crew are we expecting?
- Minimal.

356
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:12,701
Richter keeps things tight.

357
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:14,135
- Three, maybe four guys.
- That said,

358
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,503
it's risk management time.

359
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:17,205
They are not gonna be
happy when they see us.

360
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,929
Job one is getting Street out safe.

361
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:20,075
 Chris and Tan.

362
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,176
You see any weapons

363
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,177
swing his way, you take down

364
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:23,211
whoever's got 'em.

365
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,779
- Understood.
- Let's do this.

366
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:15,597
Weapons, phones.

367
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,799
Anything with a chip, a blade

368
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,272
or a trigger.

369
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,970
- Sweet ride.
- Customized

370
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,072
to make 840-horsepower.

371
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,092
Not exactly street legal,

372
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:28,309
so don't tell anyone. I always dreamt

373
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:30,712
of taking a car like that out for a spin.

374
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:33,848
You know, some things in life
are simply out of reach.

375
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:41,122
Everything exactly as promised.

376
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:42,590
And the payments?

377
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,713
On my go.

378
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,098
- Luca, roll in!
- Get in the car.

379
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,400
Who the hell are these guys?

380
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:54,569
Some other crew's shooting up the place.

381
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:55,870
Richter's getting away with Street.

382
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,086
Luca, you on Street?

383
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,855
Negative. I don't know
what he's got under that hood,

384
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:15,690
but I lost him out of the lot.
Never had a chance.

385
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:16,825
Mumford, anything?

386
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:17,926
Negative, Hondo.

387
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,394
Didn't come our way.

388
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:23,607
The gunmen were Rosemead Mafia,

389
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,546
part of the Chinese crime syndicate.

390
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,151
Best guess is Richter
was selling wheels to them

391
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:30,010
before Street showed up
and squeezed them out.

392
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,470
Mumford, coordinate with Gang Task Force.

393
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:34,773
- Get me the Rosemead leader.
- I'm also gonna find out

394
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,107
who tipped them off and if they know

395
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:37,475
where Richter's hiding.

396
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,677
Whatever it takes to get our man back.

397
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,212
Come on.

398
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,214
We've also sent unis to look for the crew

399
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:45,016
Street was with when
they killed the trucker,

400
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,151
see how they tie in.

401
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:47,452
He launders money
through legit businesses,

402
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:48,787
so we try and track him through those.

403
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:50,288
He moves a lot of stolen cars.

404
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:51,723
If he held on to any,

405
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,992
- we might find him that way.
- SIS is making a list of vehicles

406
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,360
they think he's had his hands on.

407
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:56,661
So, why aren't we wide with this?

408
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:58,196
Every cop in the city looking for him.

409
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,664
Far as we know, his cover's holding.

410
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:01,900
We go wide, it only takes one
cop in Richter's back pocket

411
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,201
to expose Street.

412
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:04,302
There are plenty of whispers

413
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:05,503
about his connections to the police.

414
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:07,839
They say we're the best.

415
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:09,374
Time to prove it.

416
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,209
<i>Just let me</i>

417
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:13,711
contact my people. I can prove
I had nothing to do with this.

418
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:15,647
I have my own ways of determining

419
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:17,982
who's responsible, Mr. Cooper.

420
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,484
Is he the reason we're here?

421
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:20,585
If Cooper screwed this up...

422
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,020
Shut up.

423
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:24,656
Ten years,

424
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,024
not one incident.

425
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:28,059
And now Rosemead and cops show up

426
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:29,861
on the same deal?

427
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:33,531
Until I connect the dots, no one leaves.

428
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,723
That mother you turn to for guidance...

429
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,607
what's her name?

430
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,876
Alice.

431
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,346
Your mother's name is Alice Cooper?

432
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,048
She was born before
the singer got famous.

433
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:53,300
- What do you care?
- Maybe she can be of assistance.

434
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,245
Say hello for me.

435
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,097
Anything?

436
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:03,899
If I had something, I would've told you.

437
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,269
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,138
I'm sorry. We just keep
running into walls.

439
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:16,774
Richter owns two shipment
companies, but the offices

440
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:18,476
are in Miami and Sao Paulo.

441
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:20,211
He's got no car registration,

442
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:22,413
- no local addresses...
- Hey.

443
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,792
Guy doesn't even file taxes
in California.

444
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:28,653
No good news on my end, either.

445
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,222
Metro can't locate
a single one of the crew

446
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:32,957
that was with Street
when the trucker got killed.

447
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:34,559
Richter's probably got 'em,

448
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,261
trying to find the rat
who blew up his sale.

449
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:38,429
At least that means
he doesn't suspect Street yet.

450
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,666
And <i>I</i> am the one who's sorry.

451
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,502
- I sent him in against your advice.
- You trusted an officer

452
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:46,604
to do his job. I'm the one
who lost him in the field.

453
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:47,939
You walked into an ambush.

454
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,874
It's my job to expect surprises.

455
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,611
How are you holding up?

456
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,071
I'm not too good at the sitting
and waiting thing.

457
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,917
I saw a kid in the kitchen

458
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:01,653
who's been lost in his homework
for the past few hours.

459
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,454
He could use your help.

460
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,601
- Calculus, huh?
- I'm working through the proof

461
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:19,504
to V = 4/3 pi r squared.

462
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:21,673
Volume of a sphere.

463
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:24,683
I always loved math.

464
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,978
English, I mean,
that class drove me crazy,

465
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:29,614
but math was always...

466
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,482
reliable.

467
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:33,351
I like it, too.

468
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,621
That's the same kind
as the one you took in the back.

469
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,732
It's amazing how something so tiny

470
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,458
can cause so much damage.

471
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,071
But carrying a gun doesn't
always make you safer, Raymont.

472
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,340
In fact, the opposite is true.

473
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,624
You carry one.

474
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,377
And I get shot at a lot, too.

475
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,229
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

476
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,354
It's not your job to fix me, okay?

477
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:11,956
Just let me do my homework.

478
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,730
Tommy Cole.

479
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,164
How you been?

480
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,407
Hey, Deac.

481
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,334
Just congratulating Baker here

482
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,603
- on his climbing certification.
- Well done, Baker.

483
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:27,505
I hear Cole's tough
on you guys out there.

484
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,107
Yeah, he puts us through our paces.

485
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:30,499
I got to run.

486
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,012
Good kid.

487
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:35,913
Could lead his own team one day.

488
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:38,182
If they ever get back to giving
20-Davids to guys like him.

489
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:40,084
- Well, time will tell.
- You know,

490
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,253
a lot of us don't think
what they did to you was right.

491
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:43,855
Promotion should have been yours.

492
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:46,190
I appreciate that,
but, uh, I'm doing okay.

493
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:48,259
For what it's worth, I feel your pain.

494
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,894
Most of the officers

495
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:51,596
that were promoted to SWAT over me?

496
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,464
Let's just say
they check all the right boxes

497
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:54,565
in the mayor's office.

498
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,301
Hmm. So, uh, what happened

499
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,970
to my girl out there? Saw you dinged her.

500
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:00,638
She had a shot.

501
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,306
She took too many chances on the wall

502
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,242
trying to make up
for physical limitations.

503
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:06,210
They want me to grade everybody

504
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:07,445
on the same scale, so...

505
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,713
But she passed Explosive Breach

506
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:09,981
and Sniper Cadres just fine.

507
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,082
Pulling triggers

508
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,550
and setting bombs doesn't call

509
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:13,885
for the same physicality.

510
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,119
You know what I mean?

511
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,088
Look, I don't get to wear

512
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:18,589
the SWAT uniform like you do,

513
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:20,158
but that doesn't mean
I don't do what I can

514
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,794
to protect what it stands for. Right?

515
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:27,598
Right.

516
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,270
Bad news.

517
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,941
It appears one of you
is not who you claim to be.

518
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:39,577
The spirits sensed it

519
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:41,445
and I confirmed it.

520
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:45,240
Dennis "Double Clutch" Collins.

521
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:47,151
San Dimas High School

522
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:48,744
class of '08.

523
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,955
And Katrina Fisk,

524
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,992
the 2009 Miss Teen San Gabriel.

525
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,295
What a lovely couple.

526
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:01,599
Luke Denning.

527
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:04,677
Expelled from Berkeley
for hacking the school server

528
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,105
and changing grades.

529
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,181
He had a full ride, too.

530
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,776
Mr. Cooper.

531
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:13,811
Our newcomer.

532
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,849
According to the records

533
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:20,785
of Mercer High School
in Trenton, New Jersey,

534
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,221
you dropped out

535
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,030
in tenth grade.

536
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:28,059
You never told me you were a dropout.

537
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:32,230
I couldn't find your mother, though.

538
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,998
She liked living off the grid.

539
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,203
Which leaves...

540
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:41,130
Mr. Huntley.

541
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:46,677
You know, there are
15 Ben Huntleys in the country,

542
00:24:46,712 --> 00:24:48,713
and not one of them is you.

543
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:51,215
I knifed a guy
in a bar fight when I was 19.

544
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,084
I-I was facing more time
than I could handle,

545
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,352
so I jumped bail.

546
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:56,754
I-I've been Ben Huntley ever since.

547
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,856
I swear I had nothing to
do with any of this.

548
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:02,226
But who am I actually looking at

549
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:03,394
right now?

550
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:04,862
Kevin Barnes. From Phoenix.

551
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,597
I sure wish

552
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,323
you hadn't lied to me...

553
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:10,835
Kevin Barnes

554
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,036
- from Phoenix.
- Please.

555
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,437
I swear I had nothing...

556
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,239
A liar is a liar...

557
00:25:15,274 --> 00:25:18,109
Kevin.

558
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,011
Anyone else have a secret

559
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,079
they would like to share?

560
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:23,748
'Cause I still have a lot

561
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,483
of unanswered questions.

562
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:30,667
It's the list of cars
SIS thinks Richter stole.

563
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:32,440
But they all went dark
the day they were heisted

564
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:33,526
and never came back on.

565
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:35,051
OnStar, LoJack, all that on alert?

566
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:36,271
- Yep.
- Anything?

567
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:38,120
Nothing but crickets.

568
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,041
So, I ran into our friend Cole.

569
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,343
He's, uh, pretty old-school.

570
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:45,212
I don't think he's a fan
of women in SWAT.

571
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,898
He said that?

572
00:25:46,932 --> 00:25:48,204
Well, he let it be known in his own way.

573
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:49,328
He's still in the building?

574
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:50,506
What are you guys talking about?

575
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,930
I asked Deacon

576
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,620
to look into your climbing eval.

577
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,568
Look, I don't think Cole
gave you a very fair shake

578
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:59,070
- out on that wall.
- No way.

579
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:00,504
Next you'll tell me
there's no Santa Claus?

580
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,906
Don't worry about it.

581
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,441
- I'm gonna have a little chat with him.
- You mean, like,

582
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:05,582
man-to-man? Tell him to stop
picking on little girls, right?

583
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:07,345
He misevaluated a member of my team,

584
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,746
- and I'm not having that.
- How do you know?

585
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,081
You weren't there.

586
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:11,449
You think I'm not used to this game?

587
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:12,750
I don't need him to tell me

588
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:14,251
what I'm capable of,
and the last thing I want

589
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,187
is him thinking that
I came crying to you about it.

590
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,122
She's right. Confidence is silent.

591
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:19,623
Insecurity is loud.

592
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:21,692
- See? The shrink gets it.
- All right,

593
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,094
I hear you, I do.

594
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:25,817
In my hood, we used to say
"real Gs move in silence."

595
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,432
I'm just not sure this is the
right time for all that, Wendy.

596
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:30,167
I got your message about the boy.

597
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:34,105
Trauma like he went through
affects brain chemistry.

598
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:36,807
It reduces cortisol levels,
hippocampal volumes.

599
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:38,542
He's wrestling with a lot.

600
00:26:38,577 --> 00:26:40,211
Are you saying he needs medication?

601
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:41,591
Not necessarily.

602
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,415
If he can recognize the symptoms
and face them head-on,

603
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,385
his brain should recover
back to baseline on its own.

604
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,120
He's pretty closed up about it.

605
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:51,389
Do you mind if I introduce you,
let you feel him out a bit?

606
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,391
Well, I got no cops with daddy issues

607
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,559
until tomorrow morning, so sure.

608
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:58,162
Come on.

609
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:04,502
Raymont.

610
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:06,003
I want to introduce you

611
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,506
- to an old friend of mine.
- Hi, I'm Wendy.

612
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,408
Listen, I'm gonna be
caught up for a while,

613
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:12,576
but Wendy here has PS4 in her office.

614
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:14,278
- Says you can use it.
- I play a pretty mean

615
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:16,638
<i>NBA 2K</i> if you're interested.

616
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:18,983
- You like a therapist or something?
- Guys around here

617
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:21,352
need someone to talk to
every now and then.

618
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:23,120
I mostly just listen.

619
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:24,355
I don't need a head doctor.

620
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,656
I ain't saying you do.

621
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,462
Wendy's the only one with <i>2K,</i> so...

622
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:29,760
take it or leave it.

623
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:30,995
Hondo.

624
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:33,427
Got you a present.

625
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,534
Leader of the Rosemead Mafia.

626
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,137
Hey.

627
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:42,373
I got ten bucks says you can't beat her.

628
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,114
I found this punk at his sister's.

629
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:51,816
Wasn't exactly hiding, either.

630
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,884
Was arming his crew for battle.

631
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,853
Getting ready for when Richter comes?

632
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,488
No idea what you're talking about.

633
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:58,856
Look, man, you can play stupid

634
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,458
if you want to, but you better understand

635
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:02,226
that Richter's
not gonna come at you head-on.

636
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,561
You sent shooters to try and kill him.

637
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:04,895
You pissed him off.

638
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,797
He's gonna want to make you hurt.

639
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,699
He'll go after your family.

640
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:11,502
How many kids you got?

641
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:12,703
Or did God do everyone a favor

642
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:13,871
and make you sterile?

643
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:14,972
Tell you what.

644
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,207
You help me find Richter,

645
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:17,408
I'll take him out for you.

646
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:18,876
Or we can just wait

647
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,011
till he slaughters you
and all your loved ones.

648
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:23,712
Either way, I get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

649
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:25,583
We know you and your boys
crashed his buy.

650
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,189
Now, how'd you find out about it?

651
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,389
Off the record?

652
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:35,693
This ebony-ivory couple

653
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,027
comes to me this morning

654
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:39,396
saying they source for Richter

655
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,232
but they'd rather do business with me.

656
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,367
I tell 'em to get lost,

657
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:46,003
but then they say Richter's
planning to cut me out.

658
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:47,838
Say he's dealing with some new guy.

659
00:28:47,873 --> 00:28:50,007
- Cooper.
- Okay, so, what's the deal?

660
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,408
You take Richter and the newbie out,

661
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:52,776
and they start sourcing cars for you?

662
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:54,044
I thought they were full of it,

663
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,513
but the details tracked, so...

664
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:56,947
Tracked how?

665
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:59,116
Same MO and same part of town

666
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:00,584
as the deals I made with Richter.

667
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:03,187
Santa Fe Springs, Pico Rivera.

668
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,955
Richter got a place out there?

669
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,757
He's got a spot he calls the <i>Templo,</i>

670
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,292
but no one's seen it.

671
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:10,027
Or, if they do,

672
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,630
they never make it back to talk about it.

673
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,812
I'm guessing none of this
is what you signed up for?

674
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,714
- Is he gonna do that to us, too?
- Want the truth,

675
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:32,249
or you want a bedtime story?

676
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:34,818
Unless we find a way out of here,

677
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:36,086
we're all gonna die.

678
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:39,557
Okay, what do we do?

679
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,258
Start by calming down.

680
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:42,927
You should tell me
how you got the name "Whip."

681
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:44,461
My brother.

682
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,163
He used to make me do his homework.

683
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,932
He'd say, "Come on,

684
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,066
"you're smart as a whip.

685
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,768
Whip it out.
Whip out that homework, Whip."

686
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:52,002
- He sounds annoying.
- Yeah.

687
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,066
He is.

688
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:55,527
But he looks out for me.

689
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,809
Even told me hooking up
with this bunch was a bad idea.

690
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:00,244
I never had a big brother,

691
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:01,645
but I got this guy I work with,

692
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,314
likes to act like one.

693
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:05,316
I get the feeling he's not too crazy

694
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,205
about me getting into
this whole mess, either.

695
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:10,254
You know what he'd say if he was here?

696
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:11,822
That you should have
finished high school?

697
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:13,324
That I should trust my gut.

698
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,292
And right now my gut tells me

699
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:17,795
that you're the only one
who can get us out of here.

700
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:21,094
See that car at the end of the building?

701
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,097
There's a GPS unit, yeah?

702
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,171
Any way to hack it? Get a message out?

703
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:28,351
Not like an e-mail.

704
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,842
But there should be
a built-in distress signal.

705
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:34,511
You get the car back on line,
activate the signal.

706
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,814
But someone has to be looking for it.

707
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:39,049
Someone's looking.
How long would it take?

708
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:40,517
You serious about trying this?

709
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,120
I'm gonna tell you something
that could get me killed.

710
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:44,788
But if you trust me, I can get us

711
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,323
both out of here in one piece.

712
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:47,625
It was you?

713
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:49,827
You tipped off the Rosemead Mafia?

714
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:51,795
I'm pretty sure it was them.
They had the most to gain,

715
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,998
and they've been acting guilty
this whole time.

716
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:55,866
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I'm a cop.

717
00:30:57,902 --> 00:30:59,236
Those police that were there today,

718
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:00,592
they were with me.

719
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,973
I'm SWAT.

720
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:05,009
Now, you can blow my cover

721
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,806
and watch me die,

722
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:09,747
or you can help me get us out of here.

723
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:15,619
Okay.

724
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:19,778
Be ready to move.

725
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,496
You know I'm gonna have your ass
for getting me into this, right?

726
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,530
What did you say?

727
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:27,598
You're the one who sicced

728
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:28,699
those Rosemead punks onto us.

729
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,267
You wanted Richter's business
all to yourself.

730
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:31,535
You better shut your mouth, son.

731
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:33,337
Tell me it isn't true. I'm not dying here

732
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,705
for a couple of double-crossers.

733
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:44,996
Enough.

734
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,518
I want to see Richter.

735
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:49,186
These two are the rats.

736
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,387
Say that again and I'll kill you.

737
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:51,685
Sit down and shut up.

738
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,272
Where's the kid?

739
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,863
We can thank Mumford

740
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,565
for our first good lead
on finding Street.

741
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,867
Just want the kid back.
Miss giving him crap.

742
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,869
These dots are where
Richter made the deals

743
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:06,963
with the Rosemead Mafia.

744
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:08,867
His <i>Templo</i> ought to be
somewhere around here.

745
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:11,075
Any of that paperwork link
to buildings in this area?

746
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:13,215
Don't think it has to.
One of, uh, Richter's cars

747
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:15,814
just came back on line,
and it's right here.

748
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:17,548
Right in the middle of the hot zone.

749
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:18,816
Let's go get him.

750
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:27,817
All right, we got three loading
docks flanked by service doors

751
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:30,186
along the front wall.
One dock with a ramp.

752
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:32,622
- No points of entry on the other sides.
- Means we got to go in hot.

753
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:34,290
- And blind.
- I could scale it,

754
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:36,087
drop in through one of the
skylights, get eyes in there.

755
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,155
It's a 30-foot wall.

756
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,711
- No gear, no harness.
- And?

757
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:41,531
Unless you agree with Officer Cole.

758
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,340
I found him hiding behind your car.

759
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,010
So much deceit.

760
00:32:54,497 --> 00:32:57,080
It's impossible to separate the lies.

761
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:02,185
And so,

762
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:04,354
I've made my decision.

763
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:08,762
Equal punishment...

764
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,294
for all.

765
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:31,448
<i>You were just gonna</i>

766
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,370
drive off in my car?!

767
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:37,957
I made him do it.

768
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,723
Told him the car was bulletproof,

769
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:42,625
if he got it started,
we could bust out of here.

770
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,095
Kid's innocent. He doesn't belong here.

771
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,468
You disappoint me, Mr. Cooper,

772
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:54,204
roping in a child to do your dirty work.

773
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:56,706
That earns you special treatment.

774
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,781
You won't believe how much
that hurts in a minute.

775
00:34:09,705 --> 00:34:12,922
He's just a scared kid. He had
nothing to do with any of this.

776
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,393
Hey!

777
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:19,362
They did.

778
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:25,668
In position. On my go.

779
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:27,303
You have proof?

780
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:28,438
Hell, no!

781
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,808
I know you're gonna kill us all.

782
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:33,309
Just don't start with the kid.

783
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:35,378
Please.

784
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:39,727
As you wish.

785
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:47,641
Luca, go!

786
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,764
LAPD SWAT. Get down!

787
00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:56,633
Whoa! Police! Hold it right there!

788
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,134
Get down!

789
00:34:58,169 --> 00:34:59,369
Get down!

790
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:02,872
SWAT! Get down!

791
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,151
Stay right there.

792
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:28,361
- Owe you one, buddy.
- 30-David to Command.

793
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:30,003
- Street.
- All secured.

794
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:33,236
Hey.

795
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:56,971
Hey.

796
00:35:57,962 --> 00:35:59,229
Good job.

797
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,403
Nice to see you back in one piece.

798
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:05,665
Yeah, kid tried to get himself killed.

799
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,737
- Couldn't even do that right.
- Give him time.

800
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:10,073
Hey, here's our friend Officer Cole.

801
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:11,541
Want me to talk to him, tell him how

802
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:13,042
Chris kicked ass today?

803
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:14,510
Nah, he's a waste of breath.

804
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:15,912
He's on my list, though.

805
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,280
He'll be seeing me soon enough.

806
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:18,615
Congrats.

807
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:23,219
Hey, uh, Richter's high-end rides...

808
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:25,521
when are they getting
transferred to the impound lot?

809
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:26,789
Tomorrow morning. Why?

810
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:29,759
I just want to get a couple pictures.

811
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:32,395
On a cop's salary, it's probably
as close to one of those

812
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:34,030
as I'm ever gonna get, you know?

813
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:35,732
Hey, boot?

814
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:36,966
You might want to hit the ATM.

815
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:38,534
You're gonna buy a few rounds tonight.

816
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,704
Yeah! Get to it!

817
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:42,772
You got it!

818
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:43,805
All right.

819
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,141
Get over here.

820
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:50,733
You got him back.

821
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:53,983
Thanks for making me look
like a good captain.

822
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,823
Richter wouldn't be in jail
if you hadn't made that call.

823
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,422
Thanks for trusting my team.

824
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,736
How'd you get that shot off?
I always block those.

825
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:15,638
You're too aggressive on D.

826
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:19,061
I just Eurostep. Double-tap X, no turbo.

827
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:21,144
Come on now, Wendy. Don't tell
me you're letting the kid win.

828
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:22,979
Didn't warn me he's a hustler.

829
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:24,514
Sorry I left you hanging so long.

830
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:26,416
- You owe me ten bucks.
- Okay.

831
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,951
Grab your stuff. I got to get you home.

832
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,773
You owe me a rematch.

833
00:37:34,692 --> 00:37:36,459
You know you shouldn't be
beating up on girls.

834
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,599
Hmm.

835
00:37:43,634 --> 00:37:45,001
You learn anything?

836
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:47,036
He's got a lot going on inside.

837
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:50,173
Trouble is, he thinks that's
where it's supposed to stay.

838
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:53,009
You know, he kind of
reminds me of someone.

839
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:55,311
Real Gs move in silence, right?

840
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:57,680
Touché.

841
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,483
I appreciate you taking the time.

842
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:12,462
Awfully quiet over there.

843
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,398
You have a good talk with Wendy?

844
00:38:15,432 --> 00:38:17,333
Nah, we just played.

845
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:19,635
Said you've known each other
a long time, though.

846
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:21,904
That we have.

847
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,706
She helped me through a really rough time

848
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:25,308
when I was new to the force.

849
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,913
What happened?

850
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:31,047
I didn't start out in SWAT.

851
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:33,249
Nobody does.

852
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:35,685
First few years in uniform,
you got to pay a lot of dues.

853
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:38,020
Spend a lot of hours in a squad car,

854
00:38:38,055 --> 00:38:39,634
and you write a gang of tickets.

855
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,060
But I was pretty lucky 'cause...

856
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:46,729
I got to ride around
with one of the funniest cats

857
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:49,332
this world has ever known...
my partner Robbie.

858
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:51,981
I mean, this dude...

859
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:53,903
This dude could make you laugh.

860
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:56,109
He'd make you laugh on your worst day.

861
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:00,710
One day, we were writing
citations on Venice Boulevard.

862
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:02,865
We had a guy pulled
over for expired tags.

863
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:06,549
Trust me, that's the type of
thing every cop hates doing.

864
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,749
Robbie was at the driver's side window.

865
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,590
I was at the passenger rear.

866
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:19,465
And this black truck...

867
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:23,720
just came flying into the
right lane and hit Robbie.

868
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:27,069
Clipped him at 60 miles an hour.

869
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,704
He die?

870
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,340
Right in front of me.

871
00:39:34,147 --> 00:39:35,778
Raymont, you wear a gun and a badge,

872
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:37,747
you expect to be in danger, but...

873
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:39,360
we were just writing tickets.

874
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,818
So, did you get the guy in the truck?

875
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:43,753
No.

876
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,922
He got away?

877
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,357
And that haunted me.

878
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,761
So what did you do?

879
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,729
I suffered...

880
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,668
till it damn near broke me.

881
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,734
But then I did the one thing

882
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:01,758
that guys like you and me
are taught to never do.

883
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:04,761
I asked for help.

884
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,277
Wendy's the one who gave it to me.

885
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:16,519
I have dreams where I never make it.

886
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:22,959
I'm just lying there on the street, shot.

887
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:24,906
Bleeding.

888
00:40:27,197 --> 00:40:29,699
And I know I'm gonna die.

889
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,504
That's why I got the gun.

890
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,668
It just feels safe to have it there,

891
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:40,880
and I don't want to die.

892
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,451
Wendy used to tell me that the pieces

893
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:50,987
that were hurting inside
worked like broken bones.

894
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,026
If you treat 'em right, they'll heal.

895
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:07,031
If you don't, that pain's
only gonna get worse.

896
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:11,410
I'm not sure I'm up for
sitting around with a shrink.

897
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:14,580
How about sitting around
with me from time to time?

898
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:19,849
Okay.

899
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,420
Yeah?

900
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:24,590
Okay.

901
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:30,826
Hey,

902
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:32,515
go hug your mom.

903
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:24,480
Nothing's out of reach,
you cocky son of a...

904
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:33,073

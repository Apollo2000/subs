1
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:11,702
All right, listen up. My CI says

2
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:13,660
the heroin drop happened last night.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,354
Supplier rented an Airbnb
to cut and package it.

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,398
Three, maybe four guards.
Be ready for surprises.

5
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:19,420
Venice Beach.

6
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:20,346
Gentrified.

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:22,808
- Houses stacked like Legos.
- No breathing room for us.

8
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,460
Or mistakes. Day raid.
People everywhere.

9
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,856
SWAT's about saving
lives, not kicking ass.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,166
What? Nobody thinks I listen?

11
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:32,626
Hey, rook. You haven't
been around long enough

12
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:35,112
to quote Scripture.

13
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,299
Check it out.

14
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:44,210
Not again.

15
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:46,459
Found Luca on the couch
in HQ this morning.

16
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,039
All his stuff with him.

17
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:50,620
We shut this drug op down, then
we deal with Sleeping Beauty.

18
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:52,856
- Here we go!
- Fill the gaps. Stay liquid.

19
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,506
Fill the gaps! Stay liquid!

20
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,736
Go, go.

21
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,917
Position one. Set.

22
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:23,337
Two. Set.

23
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:24,468
On three.

24
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:27,539
One, two, three.

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,648
Gun!

26
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:44,180
Go, go, go, go!

27
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,251
Luca, initiate!

28
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:11,108
Go!

29
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:21,304
Deacon, go!

30
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:25,023
Suspect down!

31
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:32,055
Stop! LAPD!

32
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:54,129
Cover them. I got him!

33
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:04,859
No, stay.

34
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:13,554
Stay!

35
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:18,263
Chris hooked the rabbit.

36
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:25,773
There's no sign of the "H."

37
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:27,398
You sure your CI's reliable?

38
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,674
Take it easy, you're safe.

39
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,186
I promise you, you're safe.

40
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,642
He's speaking Tagalog.
There are a couple

41
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,816
Filipino families in my church.

42
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,707
Sir, you speak English?

43
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:06,239
What's your name?

44
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,774
Javier.

45
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,393
Javier, are there any
drugs in this house?

46
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:13,370
No.

47
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,541
Are you and your friends okay?
Your lips look...

48
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:17,689
We don't want trouble...

49
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:24,861
Med pack!

50
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:26,221
Man down!

51
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,080
We need paramedics at
the Venice op now!

52
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:30,139
Deac, we're gonna need
more than one bus.

53
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:32,498
They got heroin inside of them.

54
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,587
Any second, they could
all end up like him.

55
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:35,986
Sir, stay with me.

56
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,653
- Stay with me.
- It's okay.

57
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:39,567
Come on, now.

58
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,885
It's okay.

59
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:48,944
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

60
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:20,234
How's he doing?

61
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,759
Javier is unconscious but stable.

62
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:23,417
We're observing the others.

63
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,431
- Any we can talk to, Doc?
- I'd rather you wait

64
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:26,495
until the drugs pass.

65
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,159
I need them calm, not agitated.

66
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,324
Even then, it's not a great idea.

67
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,478
Hondo, Captain Cortez,
this is Father Guzman.

68
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:34,097
One of my staff called him.

69
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:36,221
Let you know when I have
an update on Javier.

70
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:37,745
Thanks, Doc.

71
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,147
What's your interest here, Father?

72
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,971
These people are my<i> pamilya.</i> My family.

73
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:43,083
Nothing's more important.

74
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,357
I run the rescue mission

75
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:46,462
at Trinity Fellowship in Filipinotown.

76
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,654
Immigrants don't always
understand their rights,

77
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,474
get taken advantage of.

78
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:52,438
I make it my business to help them.

79
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:53,929
They won't talk to police.

80
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,543
Are they scared to be deported?

81
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:56,858
They're here legally,

82
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:58,358
as licensed nurses.

83
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,829
Then why won't they talk to us?

84
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:01,643
The situation in the Philippines.

85
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,207
The police there...

86
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,266
People are dying.

87
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,444
Or they paid for their trip here

88
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:06,959
by swallowing bags of heroin.

89
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,357
Someone forced them.

90
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:09,815
Either way, the traffickers
need to go down.

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,163
These people can help us.

92
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:12,421
That's your job.

93
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:13,705
They don't have to help you do it.

94
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,799
And that's your call?

95
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:18,422
Sometimes you have to help those
who can't help themselves.

96
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:20,704
All right, Father.

97
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,949
We'll be back later when they're
healthy enough to talk.

98
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,673
They can be friendly witnesses

99
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,864
or they can be charged
as drug smugglers.

100
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,396
I'll let you explain that to them.

101
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,748
What's the word on Javier?

102
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,139
He's gonna make it. The others, too.

103
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,816
Man, locking people up like that...

104
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:44,435
Holding them till they pass the drugs.

105
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,779
Takes a certain kind of animal.

106
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:46,874
It's not the first time.

107
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,688
Won't be the last. Detective Marcus

108
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,390
wants to talk to you about this case.

109
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,797
From Homicide?

110
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:54,477
I haven't seen him since that task
force in Pico-Union last year.

111
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:55,959
What's he into

112
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:58,376
- that's got to do with this?
- I'm not sure.

113
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,434
You gonna get that, champ?

114
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,225
One sec.

115
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,158
One of the girls from the roof?

116
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:08,283
Nah, they were staring at me.

117
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:10,598
An inmate from

118
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:12,580
a Los Angeles County
Correctional Facility...

119
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:13,870
Karen Street.

120
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:15,817
Is attempting to contact you.

121
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:17,027
Will you accept this call?

122
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,451
Yes.

123
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:23,286
Jimmy, baby.

124
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,010
Hey, Mom.

125
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:33,315
Hondo. Congrats on the cush promotion.

126
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:35,574
What do you need, Marcus?

127
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,666
Homicide found three gutted Filipinos

128
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,844
over the last couple of months.

129
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:41,732
SLUGS thinks it was some sicko, but now

130
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:44,116
I'm thinking it's connected
to the mules you found.

131
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:46,490
Hoping your loser could
tell us something.

132
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:50,113
The guard you guys caught, Viper Estes,

133
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,702
lawyered up before he could
hit the holding cell's bidet.

134
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:54,234
Lawyer's no pushover.

135
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,751
- Nice suit.
- Yeah.

136
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,195
He'll keep his client quiet.

137
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,862
Our victims aren't talking, either.

138
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:00,720
Heard you guys met Father Guzman.

139
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,168
Spoke with him, too.

140
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:03,826
He used to be a Sandista.

141
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:06,304
Brother got killed by a cop,
or something like that.

142
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:07,334
Think he's involved?

143
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,495
After his gang days, he
found God or whatever.

144
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,861
So, maybe.

145
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:11,849
Any leads?

146
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,079
Your mules,

147
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,737
my dead bodies,

148
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,796
were all Filipino nurses here legally.

149
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,894
Only, yours were lucky
you found them first.

150
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,474
Mine... I think

151
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,033
they were murdered because
they couldn't pass the heroin,

152
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:26,540
or maybe the bad guys
just got impatient

153
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:28,565
and cut it out of 'em.

154
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:31,156
I hate people.

155
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,323
Where do you want to start?

156
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:35,182
If you're an immigrant
and want to work legally

157
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,402
in this country, you need a sponsor.

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,772
Hi, Jimmy.

159
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:50,740
Hey.

160
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,524
Oh...

161
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:56,998
I hope I didn't cause you

162
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:59,031
any trouble with your new job.

163
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,355
No, no, no. It's fine.

164
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,901
I mean, we're on something.

165
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:03,625
I-I, uh, I got to be back soon.

166
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,783
Mm.

167
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:06,123
It's good to see you.

168
00:09:06,148 --> 00:09:07,664
It always is.

169
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:08,921
You, too.

170
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:13,847
New paint?

171
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,282
Uh, yeah.

172
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:16,318
Some shrink told the warden

173
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:18,768
lime green is soothing.

174
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,093
What is he, in therapy?

175
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:21,899
He should be.

176
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:23,442
He's a little bit uptight.

177
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:33,450
Oh, honey.

178
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:34,742
It's okay.

179
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,834
A few more months, it'll all be over.

180
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,192
You shouldn't be here.

181
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,009
Always looking out for me.

182
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:44,295
Even with your father, you
never would back down.

183
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:46,865
I don't know where you got that.

184
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:49,123
Not from him.

185
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:52,994
You remember the time
he came home drunk

186
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:55,966
and started chasing me
around with a hammer?

187
00:09:57,283 --> 00:09:59,265
You were right there.

188
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,087
But he can't hurt us anymore, can he?

189
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,322
We just have to keep moving forward.

190
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:08,730
Um...

191
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,522
when you called, you
said it was urgent.

192
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,964
Ye... Um.

193
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,012
A friend of mine,

194
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:19,440
Diedra Caldwell, she's
getting out next week.

195
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,283
Her ex is a hitter like your dad was.

196
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:27,582
I just, I don't want to see
her end up like me or worse.

197
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:33,834
Look, maybe if her ex
sees that you're a cop...

198
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:36,116
I mean...

199
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,007
I mean, if you could just warn him,

200
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:40,633
tell him to stay away
from her for good,

201
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,662
you know?

202
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:46,478
Is it wrong?

203
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:48,609
Nope.

204
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:49,933
Maybe it is.

205
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,728
It is, it's-it's wrong to ask you.

206
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:53,512
I shouldn't have called.

207
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,814
I have no place asking
you for anything.

208
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,421
You got every place to ask
me whatever you want.

209
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:01,981
Jimmy, you don't owe me anything.

210
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,840
I owe you everything.

211
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,298
I chose

212
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:07,634
to stay with your father
when things got ugly.

213
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:10,187
And you made the right
choice in taking him out.

214
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:13,838
I don't know.

215
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,958
- It was so long ago.
- Mom.

216
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:18,823
Listen to me.

217
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:22,241
No one was there for us.

218
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,496
Neighbors, teachers, the mailman...

219
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:28,075
Everybody turned their backs.
Everybody looked the other way.

220
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:30,285
We were alone.

221
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:34,175
You did what was necessary.

222
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,483
Okay?

223
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,976
What's this guy's name?

224
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,721
Baby, listen to me...

225
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,779
What's his name?

226
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,229
Look, guys,

227
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,514
you know how it goes.

228
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:53,493
I need a place to stay tonight.

229
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:54,928
So cut the suspense,

230
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,570
tell me whose car to throw my stuff in.

231
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:57,992
Not me. Sorry, Luca.

232
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,385
I took him last time. Deac?

233
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,701
No way. New baby.

234
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,140
End of story.

235
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:04,409
What's going on?

236
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:05,354
Luca got kicked out

237
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,776
of his apartment by his girlfriend.

238
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,135
- That's three in as many years.
- Yeah.

239
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,439
Someone from the team
has to take me in.

240
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,604
Till he gets on his feet.

241
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,186
What is that? Like,
some kind of Bro Code?

242
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:15,910
No, SWAT Code. Far more sacred.

243
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,297
Wait, wait, wait.

244
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:20,165
So, you break up, and the
girls get your apartment?

245
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,536
You need a new lawyer.

246
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:23,538
Look, Street.

247
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:25,432
I'm a good guy, all right?
And I always warn them

248
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:27,440
at the beginning, "If you
expect me to settle down,

249
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:29,524
forget it. I'm married to SWAT."

250
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,552
- They just never believe me.
- That's hard-core, Luca.

251
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:33,526
Well, it's in my DNA.
Three generations:

252
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,003
my grandpops, my pops and me.

253
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:37,164
- Kind of a holy trinity.
- And just as badass.

254
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,494
All right, listen up.

255
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,102
Cortez's INS contact ID'd
the nurses' sponsor.

256
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:43,089
Robert Miller.

257
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,105
What's the business?

258
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,329
Employment agency.

259
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,205
Recruits workers for
nursing homes around town.

260
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,501
That's a good cover.

261
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:49,840
Deac, Luca, Tan,

262
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:50,932
you're with me on the corporate office.

263
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,066
What about us?

264
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:53,541
Marcus is bringing some
nursing home employees

265
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,793
and residents here.

266
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:56,224
He needs help interviewing them.

267
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:57,645
That'll work.

268
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,441
Maybe you can explain it to us,

269
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:02,740
Mr. Miller.

270
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,831
I run an employment
agency in Santa Clarita.

271
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:06,541
Not some drug operation.

272
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:07,842
Sir, nurses you sponsored

273
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,910
from the Philippines
were used as drug mules

274
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:10,960
and held prisoner.

275
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:12,627
A few of them have died.

276
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:15,200
I had no idea.

277
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:17,096
That's horrible.

278
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,922
Uh, look, my wife is Filipino.

279
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:21,328
It's a travesty what's happening...

280
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:22,597
All the violence there.

281
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,105
The people are desperate.

282
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,432
I'm just trying to help
as many of them as I can.

283
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,035
By finding them work in nursing homes?

284
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,821
Yes.

285
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:31,222
I work with Filipino nursing
schools to find people

286
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,511
who are willing to care
for our aging population.

287
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,680
There's not a lot of people
here who want to clean bedpans.

288
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,101
For a green card, they'll do it.

289
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,592
When you bring them over, what happens?

290
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:40,777
You pick them up from the airport,

291
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:41,768
you find them housing, what?

292
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,473
No, see, I'm-I'm just the middleman.

293
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:45,620
I-I file the permits,
I do the paperwork.

294
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,179
I never even meet them face-to-face.

295
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:48,571
Who does?

296
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:52,178
I hired this guy about a
year ago, a recruiter.

297
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:54,903
He speaks fluent
Tagalog, and he's cheap.

298
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,001
He's the one who manages the
nurses when they get here.

299
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:00,699
His name is Julio Arvado.

300
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:10,744
Julio Arvado?

301
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:16,369
Clear.

302
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,496
No sign of him, boss.

303
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,062
Got something.

304
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,718
Condom balloons and duct tape.

305
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,633
All the tools.

306
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,715
Well, he didn't try very hard
to hide the merchandise.

307
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,090
All right, Tan, take pics, document it,

308
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:29,196
but leave it all here.

309
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:31,039
Yeah, don't want to spook this guy.

310
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:32,820
Let's figure out where he is.

311
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:35,862
Luca, we catch Arvado,

312
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,052
this place will have a vacancy.

313
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,868
Oh, yeah, sure. I've
always wanted hep C.

314
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,197
Admit it, Luca.

315
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,323
You're a terrible houseguest.

316
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,187
What are you talking about, Deac?
Your kids love me.

317
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,690
Yeah, well, you kept my son up
all night playing video games.

318
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:49,057
He slept through school the next day.

319
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,500
You ran up my Pink Dot bill.

320
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,831
Yeah, and Chris says that you
ate everything in her fridge.

321
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:53,555
Boss?

322
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,093
No way, Luca. You're like

323
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:57,409
a frat boy his first day away
from home; I need sleep.

324
00:14:57,434 --> 00:15:00,136
Okay, my brothers. There
are SWAT rules passed down

325
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,919
from generation to generation.

326
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,598
No officer left behind.

327
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,112
So I have faith that one of you

328
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,677
will come through for
me before tonight.

329
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,135
Arvado, man, it's Ross.

330
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,359
Open up.

331
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,432
Arvado's not here.

332
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:33,879
Where is he?

333
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:35,995
What do you need?

334
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,783
Something good.

335
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,407
How much you got?

336
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:41,227
20 bucks for a couple of bags.

337
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,258
Come on in, man.

338
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,690
I'm on a bad trip.

339
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:00,739
No, you're good.

340
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:04,887
It's nice to meet you, Ross,

341
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,080
uh, Martin.

342
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,372
Tell us all about Julio Arvado.

343
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,081
He's got a couple old
arrests for possession.

344
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,515
Hey, send me that.

345
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,575
I'm talking to a nurse
manager at one of the homes.

346
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,798
I'll see if she recognizes him.

347
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:18,575
Mm-hmm.

348
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,849
Meanwhile, you two can handle him.

349
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:22,906
Retiree, James Traylor.

350
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,661
Insisted on coming with said manager.

351
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:26,918
Hmm.

352
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,953
Quit flirting.

353
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:37,022
- Ask him out already.
- Hey,

354
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:38,950
you treat 'em like
family, like Hondo says.

355
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:39,852
Come on.

356
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,017
Sounds like a solo job, right?

357
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:45,759
Listen, uh,

358
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,797
I need you to cover for me,
just for, like, a half hour.

359
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,910
That's funny.

360
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,144
Let's go. You're on the clock.

361
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,427
I have an important errand
to run nearby for my mom.

362
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,309
I think you know her situation, okay?

363
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,410
No.

364
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,771
No. Hey,

365
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:02,142
absolutely not.

366
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,668
Text me if we're on the move.

367
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,239
Help you, sir?

368
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:21,325
Officer James Traylor, LAPD.

369
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,020
Class of '65.

370
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:24,067
Honor to meet you, Officer.

371
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:25,191
You, too.

372
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,103
You know,

373
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:32,124
we're not the reason all the
nurses at our home are scared.

374
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,331
- The police, I mean.
- Yeah?

375
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:36,790
You got some information
for me, Officer?

376
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,718
Trey Smith?

377
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,030
Yeah.

378
00:17:58,123 --> 00:17:59,991
I'm here about Deidra.

379
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:04,555
What about her?

380
00:18:04,644 --> 00:18:06,172
Need you to stay away from her.

381
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,548
For good.

382
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,220
Understand?

383
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:12,485
What's SWAT got to do with any of it?

384
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,443
You hear what I said?

385
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,195
Sure, Officer.

386
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,003
- Insurance.
- This a game to you?

387
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,036
Business.

388
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:26,935
Yeah?

389
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,148
You stay out of mine,
I'll stay out of yours.

390
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,378
That what you call what you
do with her? Business?

391
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,899
Well, what do you call it, tough guy?

392
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:36,138
You sure you want to
talk to a cop like that?

393
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:38,662
I don't think you're here as a cop.

394
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,975
Just stay away from her.

395
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:43,819
Or what?

396
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:45,585
- Or you'll regret it.
- Yeah?

397
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,066
Where can we find Julio Arvado?

398
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:58,409
Okay. Here's what we're
gonna do, all right?

399
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:00,001
I-I got to get out of here.

400
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:03,182
I start work in an hour, but, um...

401
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:08,700
Did-did Arvado leave any
"H" lying around here?

402
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:09,961
Or...?

403
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:11,637
We're not dealers.

404
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:13,427
Right, but there's got to be room...

405
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,505
for some negotiation here.

406
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,270
Yeah, this is Hondo.

407
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,442
What?

408
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,091
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

409
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:25,315
What?

410
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,368
Street just got himself arrested.

411
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,569
We got this. Go.

412
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,247
Realized he's one of yours, Hondo.

413
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:40,544
I thought it best to call.

414
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,368
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

415
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,167
So, what are we doing?

416
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,661
You want to press charges?
Make this a thing?

417
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,981
No.

418
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:07,417
What about you?

419
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,403
Turn around.

420
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:19,239
Get out of here.

421
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:33,137
We are hunting a human
trafficker, a murder suspect,

422
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:36,295
and you just up and leave your post?

423
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,473
Street, I have been giving you rope.

424
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:46,011
Plenty of it, because of Buck.

425
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:48,324
But I'm not doing it anymore.

426
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:52,781
This has something to do
with the visit to your mom,

427
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,272
doesn't it?

428
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,579
Look at me.

429
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:01,607
You got to pick one boat.

430
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:03,509
One boat?

431
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:06,309
You are a SWAT officer, or you
are a loose cannon, your choice.

432
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,716
Look, it was a favor to my mom.

433
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:08,991
It was to protect a friend of hers.

434
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:10,770
How was I supposed to tell her no?

435
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:16,985
She's on my list now, too,

436
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,590
because of you.

437
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:20,912
Oh, crap.

438
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:23,504
I really can't believe

439
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:24,466
you signed off on this, Chris.

440
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,901
It wasn't her fault.
She tried to stop me.

441
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,774
Oh, so now you want
to be a team player?

442
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:30,403
You're right, boss.

443
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:32,339
I should have made him stay.

444
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,790
It won't happen again. I promise.

445
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,810
I found something on the
trafficker, I think.

446
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:41,106
All right, it'd better
be good enough to get me

447
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:42,559
out of my bad mood. What do you got?

448
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:43,520
Retired LAPD

449
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:45,829
heard a couple of nurses
talking about Arvado.

450
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,103
He's got something over them.

451
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:48,694
It's the reason why
they're afraid to talk.

452
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:50,254
Kept saying "pamilya."

453
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,466
Family.

454
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:54,547
The traffickers are
threatening your families,

455
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:55,879
aren't they, Javier?

456
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,552
Is this man... Julio Arvado...

457
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,137
Is this the reason why
you won't talk to us?

458
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:01,822
Look, if that's true, you
can't help them a world away.

459
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,009
We don't think they're
in the Philippines.

460
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:04,066
We think they're here.

461
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,380
I called DHS on the way over,

462
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:07,047
got some names from
the flight manifest.

463
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,313
One name is Paul Sanchez, 19.

464
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:12,971
Same last name as yours.

465
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:15,129
Is Paul your son?

466
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,247
No police.

467
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,978
Holding family members is a
common tactic with traffickers.

468
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,000
But if that's what's happened,
you-you can't ask him...

469
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:26,144
ask any of them to risk the
lives of their loved ones.

470
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:28,324
We're trying to save their loved ones.

471
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,311
Father.

472
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:39,122
Javier is scared.

473
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,529
But you're the one who
doesn't trust us.

474
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:44,666
I had my reasons not
to trust cops once,

475
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:46,332
but one did right by me,

476
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,759
changed my view.

477
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,197
Give us a chance.

478
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,715
Javier...

479
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:25,559
This man,

480
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,348
he divided us up.

481
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,122
Said he would

482
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:32,931
kill the others if we talked.

483
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:37,535
Said he would kill my son.

484
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:48,394
There's a second group of drug
mules being held hostage.

485
00:23:48,657 --> 00:23:51,607
Six people. And we
think Arvado has them.

486
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:54,493
Javier said they started as
one group in the Philippines.

487
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,426
Armed men forced them to
ingest the "H" before

488
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,913
they boarded the plane to come here.

489
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,234
Yeah, they arrived a couple days ago,

490
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:01,277
Arvado splits them into two groups.

491
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:03,153
Threatened that if anyone from
one group called the police,

492
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:04,849
a family member from the
other group would be killed

493
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:05,927
and vice versa.

494
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:07,359
Keeps everyone nice and cooperative.

495
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:08,784
Don't anyone from the missing group

496
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:09,841
to O.D. like Javier.

497
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,049
Yeah, or worse.

498
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,368
What about Robert Miller? Can
we get something else from him?

499
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,966
We're reviewing his financials.

500
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:15,747
So far, nothing.

501
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:16,871
We might have something else.

502
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,033
That tweaker from Arvado's house, Ross,

503
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,132
said that Arvado's got a
girlfriend: Leila Garcia.

504
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:22,948
Works in Hollywood at Club G.

505
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:24,044
Yeah, we can talk to her.

506
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,418
Good. Take Street.

507
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:27,317
Chris, Tan, keep working
the Miller angle.

508
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,567
Let's get him this time. Let's move.

509
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:32,125
At least you could have gotten
away with whatever it is

510
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,651
that you were doing.

511
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:35,923
What? I should see the other guy?

512
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,569
Hey, what happened to him?

513
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:43,716
Hondo, I oversee this team.

514
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:46,262
I'm his direct supervisor.

515
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,708
After the times I've backed you?

516
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,448
You want to go to the Man
about who's in charge here?

517
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,772
No. No, not here, I don't.

518
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,156
Jess, I get it.

519
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:58,621
Street is a new SWAT member.

520
00:24:58,646 --> 00:24:59,645
That's time, that's resources.

521
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,996
I get it. Look,

522
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,377
I want to tell you that
the kid's worth it,

523
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:04,011
I just don't know right now.

524
00:25:04,384 --> 00:25:06,464
I have no idea what he's going through.

525
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:09,367
I could use your help finding out.

526
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:12,313
All you had to do was ask.

527
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:13,784
What do you need?

528
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:23,671
Nobody else until these three.

529
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:25,941
Ah.

530
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:27,534
I got this.

531
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:31,622
Luca, you know better. This
is not the dress code.

532
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,927
Alexander, L.A.'s personal stylist.

533
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,801
I thought you were still
working over at Cobalt.

534
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,995
- Too retro.
- Yeah?

535
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,463
And this establishment's up to code.

536
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:41,299
This, however, isn't.

537
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:42,780
So sad.

538
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:44,965
Now, you.

539
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,545
You've got potential.

540
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,599
Once whatever this is clears up.

541
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:50,449
We're looking into a
human trafficking ring.

542
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,907
A guy named Arvado.

543
00:25:51,932 --> 00:25:53,255
We'd like to talk to his girl Leila.

544
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,309
Ah, she's on her lunch
break in the alley.

545
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,717
All right, thanks, man.

546
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:02,989
Arvado was in earlier tonight.

547
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:05,136
He left about two hours ago.

548
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,923
Did he say where he was going? Nah.

549
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:10,294
He just pops in whenever he's
looking to scratch an itch.

550
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,919
Listen, this guy is bad news, okay?

551
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,684
You don't want to be protecting him.

552
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:14,991
Maybe I'm protecting myself.

553
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:17,475
Look, we got a father who's
looking for his kidnapped son.

554
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:19,508
Arvado knows where he is.

555
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:23,001
Well, my father was a drunk
who was never around, so...

556
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,793
sorry if I'm not feeling you.

557
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,246
Arvado used you, too, didn't he?

558
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,524
Hmm?

559
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,792
How old were you?

560
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:37,311
15? 16?

561
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,063
You supposed to care?

562
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,845
They tell me it's my job.

563
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,679
- Messed up job.
- Yeah.

564
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:46,432
- Might not have it much longer.
- Yeah?

565
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:47,371
Why is that?

566
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:49,584
Uh, I, uh, I messed up today.

567
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,509
Pretty bad.

568
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:56,157
What do you say you help me
go out with a bang? Hmm?

569
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:00,246
One screwup to another.

570
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:10,063
Arvado recruited me when I was 13.

571
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,535
For sex.

572
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,167
Well, now he's making
people smuggle drugs.

573
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:19,974
We think he's murdered some of them.

574
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:25,856
I overheard him earlier today.

575
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:29,267
He's got a big sale planned tonight.

576
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:31,222
Unloading all of his heroin.

577
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:33,036
That means he's got to go back
to his house to get his stash.

578
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,097
I'll call Hondo.

579
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:37,016
Thank you.

580
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,578
It's been over an hour.

581
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:50,490
We play this out.

582
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:53,662
Arvado's our link to
Javier's son and the others.

583
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:55,857
Let's get him easy,
let's get him alive.

584
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:06,660
Man of the hour. 12 o'clock.

585
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:09,257
Let's go.

586
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,884
Check him.

587
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:25,659
Arvado's dead.

588
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,165
We need this guy alive!

589
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:48,702
Where are the hostages?

590
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:56,460
You get anything from Arvado's killer?

591
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,834
Murdo Wick, hit man on the cheap.

592
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:01,333
Murderer's name is Murdo?

593
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:02,938
I guess his mama was psychic.

594
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:05,066
Lawyered up like the other guy.

595
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:07,441
Whoever's running this thing
knows how to cover their tracks.

596
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:09,286
That takes serious cash.

597
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:10,924
Yes, it does.

598
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,312
Nice suit.

599
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:13,940
Just like the other guy.

600
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:16,868
Okay.

601
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,424
Same A-list law firm.

602
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:20,538
Attorneys for the guy we
grabbed at the drug house

603
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:21,619
and Arvado's killer?

604
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,884
Question is, who's paying the bills?

605
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:27,073
Our middleman Robert
Miller's bank statement.

606
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,401
He paid that firm a retainer fee.

607
00:29:29,426 --> 00:29:30,793
Arvado was the recruiter,

608
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,239
but Miller was the money.

609
00:29:32,264 --> 00:29:34,437
He used the nurses as a
pipeline for the heroin.

610
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:35,594
I'll get a warrant.

611
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:38,506
Hondo, something else.

612
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:40,950
Trey Smith, the guy
Street got into it with.

613
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:42,653
Yeah.

614
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:49,005
You want me to...

615
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,206
No.

616
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:53,398
No, I'll deal with it.

617
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,811
Why risk your career for him?

618
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:59,013
I've been there, Jess.

619
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:01,846
Not with SWAT, just...

620
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,059
Things can grab ahold of you

621
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,182
and make you feel like
you can't trust anyone.

622
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,168
Until you learn to again.

623
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:12,058
I'll let you know when we get Miller.

624
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:21,683
Is my husband in some kind of trouble?

625
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,635
We need to talk to him
about murder, heroin

626
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,596
and human trafficking.

627
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:26,152
So, maybe.

628
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:28,547
Is this a joke?

629
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:30,480
I swear, Mr. Miller isn't here.

630
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:31,948
Well, where is he, then?

631
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:34,897
I don't know. He left a
couple of hours ago.

632
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,643
Trust me, I would never lie to SWAT.

633
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:45,205
You know, you got all the moves
in the field; people like you.

634
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,530
Seriously, if you'd stop
shooting yourself in the foot,

635
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,184
you'd be really good at all of this.

636
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:50,658
I know.

637
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,381
At least you're humble.

638
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,043
Hondo, he's not around.

639
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,668
All right, thanks.

640
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,159
Your husband's not at the office.

641
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:03,248
He's not here, either.

642
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:04,982
- Yeah, nothing.
- Nope.

643
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:06,989
Where is he, ma'am?

644
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:09,326
This is a mistake.

645
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:11,081
Robert would never...

646
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:12,555
He's a good man.

647
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:16,032
And these things... a-and to my people.

648
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:17,819
It's not possible.

649
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,690
His name is Paul.

650
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:21,065
His father Javier brought him here

651
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,615
for a better life, and
now he's missing.

652
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,427
Your husband knows where he is.

653
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,682
Robert has a private cell, just for me.

654
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:31,407
Why don't I-I just call him?

655
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,399
Show you that you're wrong about him?

656
00:31:36,238 --> 00:31:37,942
Just ask him where he is.

657
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:39,408
Put it on speaker.

658
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,129
Hello.

659
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:43,567
Robert?

660
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:48,122
English, Mrs. Miller.

661
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:49,656
At the country club.

662
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:52,716
Uh, sorry. Y-You're breaking up. Where?

663
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:55,122
The country club. Drinks
with some investors.

664
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,923
- Thought I told you.
- Okay.

665
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,681
I'll see you when you get home.

666
00:31:58,713 --> 00:31:59,971
I love you.

667
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:01,829
Love you, too. See you soon.

668
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:03,163
What's the name of the club?

669
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:05,089
Valencia. Let's go.

670
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:06,079
See, I told you.

671
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:08,061
This is all just a big mistake.

672
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:09,937
My dealer's dead, I got
a bunch of immigrants

673
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,521
with heroin inside 'em,

674
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,969
and I go out for drinks
at a country club?

675
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:14,705
- Miller thinks he's untouchable.
- Also has the means

676
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,393
to hire firepower, a hit man.

677
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:17,567
We find him, watch yourselves.

678
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:19,498
Yeah, you don't want to end
up looking like Street.

679
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,649
Can't miss that face.

680
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:22,622
What happened to him?

681
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:24,386
He piss off the wrong retiree?

682
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,669
I wish it was that simple.

683
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,212
Your husband's neck deep in all this.

684
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:32,825
Why should I believe you aren't?

685
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,671
Detective, I'm going to
help you with everything.

686
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:37,537
Can I make us some coffee, tea?

687
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:39,183
No, no.

688
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,830
Do you two have any other properties?

689
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:42,644
Not that I know of.

690
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:46,189
Does he have a storage
locker, safety deposit box?

691
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,901
We have a home safe,

692
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,860
uh, for paperwork, passports.

693
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:54,817
If there are any other
properties or storage lockers,

694
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:56,688
the information will be here.

695
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,208
And how much do you
two discuss business?

696
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:11,990
Marcus is conscious, but
he's in rough shape.

697
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:14,222
Paramedics made it in time.
Listen to me,

698
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:15,746
we need to find out where
the Millers are headed.

699
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:17,004
We're raking the office.

700
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,677
Come on, now, we got six
missing immigrants.

701
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:19,968
Our only leads are on the run.

702
00:33:19,994 --> 00:33:21,470
We'll find something.

703
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:22,807
Check this out.

704
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:24,129
Hang on.

705
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:25,867
Numbers, flight coordinates.

706
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:27,192
Pilot's logs.

707
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:28,691
Hondo, Miller's a pilot.

708
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:29,911
Looks like a Cessna.

709
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:30,836
Want us to alert the airports?

710
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:32,461
No, wait a minute, wait
a minute, hold on.

711
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:33,618
When Adele called her husband,

712
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,061
she said something like "San-see."

713
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:36,290
- So?
- San-see.

714
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,759
SAN C.

715
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:39,953
That's the call tag for the
Santa Clarita Airport.

716
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,088
All right, we're on the move.

717
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,176
- Were you followed?
- No.

718
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:48,748
Get in the plane.

719
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:54,453
Go, go, go!

720
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:17,996
Don't do it!

721
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,384
Tell me where the nurses are right now.

722
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,752
Get off me!

723
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:54,408
Stop! Stop!

724
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:55,989
I said stop!

725
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,328
Robert, don't say anything.

726
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,769
Look, this was never supposed

727
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:07,396
to happen, not like this.

728
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:08,620
You just wanted to
make some easy money.

729
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:09,964
I-I didn't even have to be involved.

730
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:11,887
I just find the nurses
jobs, and Arvado would...

731
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:13,762
Shut up!

732
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:16,629
Look, she's the one who
introduced me to him... Arvado.

733
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,813
You listen to me.

734
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:20,707
You both are gonna go down for murder.

735
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,942
Now, here's where you get to
decide who gets it worse.

736
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:24,895
Where are they?

737
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:29,814
I'll tell you.

738
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,048
You...

739
00:35:39,278 --> 00:35:40,828
Luca.

740
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:51,134
<i>Pamilya.</i>

741
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,622
<i>Pamilya.</i>

742
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,005
<i>Pamilya.</i>

743
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,739
You're safe.

744
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,585
Your family is safe.

745
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:02,047
Get 'em out of here, go, go.

746
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:13,985
There you go.

747
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,136
I got someone here who's gonna
be really glad to see you.

748
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,117
Hey.

749
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,714
Let's get them some water.

750
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:47,848
Thank you for finding him.

751
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:51,545
Be well.

752
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,548
Let me just get you over here.

753
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:56,123
I want to get him checked out, okay?

754
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:02,214
You changed some minds today.

755
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:04,179
Sometimes you got to take care

756
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,646
of those who can't take
care of themselves.

757
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:07,421
All the time.

758
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,938
Okay, all right, thanks.

759
00:37:43,216 --> 00:37:45,216
I don't want to lose this job.

760
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:49,364
I'm gonna need to see
some improvement, then.

761
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,099
You will.

762
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,176
I'm not gonna let it
go without punishment.

763
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,353
I know.

764
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,609
What am I looking at?

765
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,101
You got to let Luca stay with you

766
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:04,901
until he finds another place.

767
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,018
That doesn't seem like
much of a punishment.

768
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:09,842
Trust me, it will.

769
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:12,247
Oh, there he is now.

770
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:14,606
Luca.

771
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:16,063
Yo, what's up?

772
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:17,979
You're bunking at Street's.

773
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,084
Ah, just under the wire.

774
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:22,223
I thought I was gonna have
to get a hotel tonight.

775
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:23,982
I knew you guys would come through.

776
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:25,495
Hey, Street, you live
near the beach, right?

777
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,771
- Uh...
- You got a board?

778
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:27,630
- Uh...
- No worries.

779
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:28,752
I got an extra one.

780
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:30,377
Best waves are at 5:00 a.m.

781
00:38:30,402 --> 00:38:32,210
You got Xbox or PlayStation?

782
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:33,752
- PlayStation.
- Beautiful.

783
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:35,686
You pick the game, I
kick your ass, buddy.

784
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:38,614
We're gonna get some sleep
at some point, right?

785
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:50,514
Who are you?

786
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:52,805
Name's Hondo.

787
00:38:53,149 --> 00:38:54,449
I work with your son.

788
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:55,640
Oh, Jimmy?

789
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,575
- Mm-hmm.
- Is he okay?

790
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,832
He's fine.

791
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:04,720
Have a seat.

792
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:11,108
Um, is he working out?

793
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,042
The-the job, I mean?

794
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:16,912
He's got the makings of a good one.

795
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:21,535
You have no idea what
he's had to overcome.

796
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:23,762
I'm really proud of him.

797
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:26,208
You tell him I said so, okay?

798
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:30,685
Karen, your son's not gonna
visit you for a while.

799
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,561
You had me.

800
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,707
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

801
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:42,099
I thought you were serious.
I'm thinking,

802
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:44,656
"Did I do something wrong?
Is Jimmy mad at me?"

803
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:49,089
You are a real player, aren't you?

804
00:39:51,546 --> 00:39:53,975
I'm not letting him get played anymore.

805
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,185
What?

806
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,157
The guy you sent your son
to meet, Trey Smith,

807
00:39:59,182 --> 00:40:00,894
he's your go-to for contraband.

808
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,619
Phones, cigarettes, pills.

809
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:04,215
That's the type of stuff
that can give you a lot

810
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,773
of control over what goes on in here.

811
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:08,467
Only, he's been selling to
another inmate... Deidra...

812
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,426
Probably because she's willing
to give him a bigger cut.

813
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,122
You have no idea how hard it is

814
00:40:12,147 --> 00:40:14,177
and the things that you
have to do to survive.

815
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:15,977
You used your son to send a message:

816
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:17,547
"Stay away from the competition."

817
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:18,983
Jimmy wanted to help me.

818
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:20,618
Oka... I-I need to talk to him.

819
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:21,554
That's not gonna happen,

820
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,702
not after I tell him
the truth about you.

821
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,225
Who do you think you are?

822
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,122
Black guy, hot shot, sitting
here, talking to me like this?

823
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:40,175
You mean

824
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,936
nothing to him.

825
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,871
You really think he's gonna trust you

826
00:40:43,895 --> 00:40:45,669
over me?

827
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:48,653
I saved that little ass of his.

828
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:51,148
I am here because of him.

829
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,140
Wow, lady.

830
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:57,961
You are a piece of work.

831
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,869
I wondered how Street
could be such a mess,

832
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:05,017
but now that I've met you,

833
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:09,125
I just got to wonder how he
managed to turn out so good.

834
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,024
I'm sorry.

835
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,568
I-I-I...

836
00:41:21,593 --> 00:41:23,618
I know that you're just trying to help,

837
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,989
and you're right about all of it.

838
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:30,553
Just, please don't tell him.

839
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,561
If you care about him as
much as I do, you won't,

840
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:41,040
'cause it'll crush him.

841
00:41:44,275 --> 00:41:46,408
Don't call him anymore.

842
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,625
You mess with him,

843
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,582
you're messing with me.

844
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:01,308
My family.

845
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:22,434

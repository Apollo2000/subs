1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,180
What is wrong with you?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,256
Your own damn fault!

3
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:06,507
You want sympathy?
Now you have to make it

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,476
look worse than it is. Nothing to say?

5
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:11,312
Screw you!

6
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:14,482
Stop. I will call the cops again!

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,960
What's that for?

8
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:44,128
It's to protect us.

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,765
But... I-I need your help, okay?

10
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,550
Stand right over there

11
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:52,136
and call him a coward, okay?

12
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:54,388
No. He'll hurt us.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,724
Not anymore. Just do it.

14
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:59,143
Why? I'm scared.

15
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,945
Don't be, baby.

16
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:03,731
Just trust me, okay?

17
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,566
Now, do it.

18
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:21,690
You're a coward!

19
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:24,502
What the hell did you say?

20
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:25,503
What the hell

21
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:27,171
did you just say to me?!

22
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:38,649
It's just you and me now.

23
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,710
Now, listen real close.

24
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,823
All you have to do is
tell them he came at you.

25
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,024
Okay?

26
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:49,743
Okay, just tell them he came at you.

27
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,912
And we're both gonna be okay, Jimmy.

28
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:54,582
We're both gonna be okay.

29
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,501
Jimmy?

30
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:59,370
Hey. ‭Thanks for coming.

31
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:00,955
Yeah, of course, Mom.

32
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:02,623
Everything's still on track

33
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,542
- for next week, right?
- Well, okay, here's the thing.

34
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:05,843
The city housing and the job

35
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:08,462
that my parole officer hooked up for me,

36
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:09,880
I declined it.

37
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:11,715
- Why?
- Because I don't want

38
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,717
to live all the way in Long Beach.

39
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,020
You know? And-and work at a food bank.

40
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:18,639
I want stay with you and work near you.

41
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,724
You can make that happen, right?

42
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,109
Yeah. I just...

43
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:23,710
Sit down for a sec.

44
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:26,447
I, uh...

45
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,700
I just have one of the guys
staying at my place.

46
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:31,402
I'd have to kick him out.

47
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:34,038
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
I know that. I just...

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,073
I'm really in a jam.

49
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:39,827
Jimmy, I really need you to come
through for me, or th-they're

50
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:43,522
not gonna finalize my parole,
and I'll be stuck here.

51
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:48,335
Honey, after 18 years,
I'm gonna need some help.

52
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,471
Okay. Listen,

53
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:52,006
don't worry.

54
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,924
I'm gonna take care of it.

55
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:56,343
We'll get you a gig somewhere near me,

56
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:58,846
start you off on the right foot. Okay?

57
00:02:58,848 --> 00:02:59,980
It's gonna be fine.

58
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,184
Sorry.

59
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:04,485
It's fine.

60
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,322
I'm really sorry, Ma. I-I got to go.

61
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:10,658
- I worry about you, sweetie.
- ‭Well,

62
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,027
I think, for this call,

63
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,613
it's the other guys got
to worry what's coming.

64
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:18,616
- Come here.
- ‭Mm.

65
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:20,117
I'll tell you more when
we finally get you out of here.

66
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,420
Love you. I love you more.

67
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,374
A lot of people were surprised

68
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:29,176
to hear that you were writing a memoir

69
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:30,878
at this stage of your life.

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
It's not a sign
that you're stopping, is it?

71
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:35,299
No, not anytime soon.

72
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:37,801
A lot of people keep asking me
what keeps me motivated...

73
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,887
25-David, your move.

74
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,305
Roger that.

75
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:44,308
And wherever you happen to be living.

76
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,444
Doing what I do, I have
to constantly be moving, yes.

77
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,813
Now, The Toll of Truth
is dedicated to all

78
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,782
the brave whistleblowers
you've worked with.

79
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:56,737
What?

80
00:03:56,764 --> 00:03:58,266
_

81
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,873
I don't speak Japanese.

82
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,997
Yeah. Neither do I.

83
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,917
I would argue the world needs
brave people more than ever.

84
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,087
And what's your next big exposé
about, Irina?

85
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:16,173
I wish I knew. Um, I'm just here
getting some sun in Los Angeles.

86
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:17,675
Thank you for being with us today.

87
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,350
26-David, target

88
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:27,667
is in motion.

89
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:31,689
Hey, guys, we got some room
service for Irina Zemanova.

90
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,024
She said it should be waiting
for her when she gets back.

91
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,276
Room service?

92
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:36,360
We know about this?

93
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,195
Back up, into the elevator.

94
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:39,246
You heard what the man said. Let's go.

95
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:40,998
In the elevator.
No one needs to get hurt.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're just going for a little ride.

97
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:48,672
Thank you so much.

98
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:50,207
Thank you all for coming.

99
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,375
Thank you.

100
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,095
30-David, target is moving up the stairs.

101
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:56,630
Losing visual.

102
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,716
- Accompanied by two bodyguards.
- That's her personal detail.

103
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:00,884
24-David, here we go.

104
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,224
Target's all yours once
we secure the elevator bank.

105
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,065
Event security, ladies and gentlemen.

106
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,234
Authorized personnel only
beyond this point.

107
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,902
What happened to Edgar?

108
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,571
He was supposed to meet me here.

109
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:22,823
Yeah, he's not answering his radio.

110
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:26,710
Kofi and Denis are gone.

111
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:29,580
What's going on? We should take
the service elevators to be safe.

112
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,107
It's you.

113
00:05:57,109 --> 00:06:05,118
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

114
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,875
Was all that really necessary?

115
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,127
I tried convincing you last
week before you got here,

116
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,295
but you still thought

117
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,338
your guys were better than us,

118
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,311
so I had no choice but
to show you that they weren't.

119
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:43,228
Plus, one of the guys on your team

120
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,397
just deposited $100,000
in a Swiss bank account,

121
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,316
which makes me wonder
if someone's paying him

122
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:48,767
to turn on you.

123
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:50,986
I don't want your help.

124
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,038
We managed just fine
in Rio and in Bruges.

125
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,408
You got lucky in Rio,
and people still got hurt.

126
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,077
Whoever's coming after you
doesn't give a damn

127
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,328
about collateral damage.

128
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,496
And since you're here in Los Angeles

129
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:01,964
for the next 37 hours,

130
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:03,666
the mayor's made it my job to keep you

131
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,551
and this city safe until then.

132
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,303
What exactly has the CIA told you?

133
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:09,838
They can't operate within
U.S. borders, so they have

134
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,173
local police do the job.

135
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,925
- What do they say?
- ‭I've been told

136
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:15,344
there could be an attempt on
your life here in Los Angeles.

137
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,513
You know, maybe pissing off
oligarchs, money launderers,

138
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:18,847
and drug kingpins by publishing

139
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,482
their dirty little secrets
has its drawbacks.

140
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:23,519
Maybe I enjoy getting under
the skin of powerful men.

141
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,572
You know, I give you props
for your bravery. I do.

142
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,691
But right now, you're my problem.

143
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,859
So why don't you just let us
stash you at SWAT HQ

144
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:33,779
- until your plane takes off tomorrow?
- ‭No, thanks.

145
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:36,198
Where I come from, the cops
are worse than the criminals.

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,251
I understand that mentality, but
we're not where you come from.

147
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:42,504
If I agree to your protection,

148
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,707
freedom of movement laws say
you have to accompany me,

149
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,342
not the other way around, right?

150
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:49,795
I have to meet a source
for a story, privately.

151
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:51,964
You said onstage you're
just here to get some sun.

152
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,215
Well, I guess I lied, didn't I?

153
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:54,717
Where's this meeting?

154
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,385
In the cafe downstairs.

155
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:59,104
And I can't have you and
your army scaring him off.

156
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:00,939
Okay, I'll tell you what,

157
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,558
you cooperate with us

158
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,727
and I'll put on my friendly face.

159
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:06,862
Luca,

160
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:08,397
I got to talk to you about something.

161
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,232
Look, if it has to do
with eating your leftovers,

162
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:12,451
don't worry, I was gonna go out
and buy some ground beef today.

163
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,153
No, it's...

164
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:16,572
I actually need you to find
another place to stay, man.

165
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:19,408
For real? Nah,
you're just messing with me.

166
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,709
I'm not.

167
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,795
I need you out by the end of the week.

168
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:24,496
This week?

169
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:27,216
Dude, you're the one who took me
in when I needed a place.

170
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,917
Talk about short notice.

171
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,387
So, what, your girlfriends can
kick you out with no warning,

172
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:32,388
but not me?

173
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,089
That's a low blow, man.

174
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:36,508
You're bringing up a lot
of relationship pain for me.

175
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,927
I'm sorry. It's just...

176
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,230
Man, it's been six months.

177
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,931
I thought you crashing was,

178
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,401
like, temporary until you found a place.

179
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:47,319
But we haven't even finished
our Call of Duty campaign.

180
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,105
Are we just gonna leave it
at 56% complete?

181
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:52,441
All right. Straight up...

182
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,610
I need the place for my mom.

183
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:56,195
She's getting paroled next week,

184
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,780
and I got to make space for her.

185
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,031
I hear you. Got you.

186
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,616
Family comes first.

187
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:01,617
Thanks, man. I...

188
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,202
All clear up ahead, Hondo.

189
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:05,287
...appreciate you understanding.

190
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:07,289
How do you communicate with this source?

191
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,291
With a Linux terminal on a secure Nmap.

192
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:10,676
And a burner phone.

193
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:12,594
So there's no way
for anyone to track you?

194
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:14,763
I know how dangerous mistakes are.

195
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:17,049
My fiancé was killed three
years ago because of a story

196
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,517
we were working on together in Minsk.

197
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,853
- I get it, Hondo.
- ‭Okay, okay, okay.

198
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:22,688
I heard about that.
But that's why you need

199
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,274
to trust me to do whatever
it takes to keep you safe.

200
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:27,609
The man who shot him was a mole
working for the government,

201
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:29,978
telling me the same things
you're telling me now.

202
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,363
That is not gonna happen here, Irina.

203
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,148
You have my word.

204
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,517
Okay, Hondo.

205
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm willing to trust you.

206
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,755
- I'll cooperate.
- ‭Good.

207
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:42,157
All right, listen, we're gonna
be rotating two three-man teams,

208
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,876
day and night, for the next...

209
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:45,661
36 hours and 14 minutes,

210
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:47,946
when I can put you on your plane myself.

211
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,166
What's your source look like?

212
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,668
I don't know. Never met him before.

213
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,336
Online, he goes by Shaolin.

214
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,555
- And you trust him?
- Whistleblowers risk more

215
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,006
than the journalists protecting them.

216
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,642
The important thing is that he trusts me.

217
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,346
Luca, take the left side.
Street and I got the right.

218
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,850
So, I hear you're
finally kicking Luca out.

219
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:10,402
Well, it's been six months.
Think I've done my time.

220
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:14,097
I heard your mom's getting paroled, too.

221
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,741
Street,

222
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,694
are you sure you don't want
to maintain a little distance?

223
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,245
I mean, just to start?

224
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:21,613
I hope your mom can turn things around

225
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:22,531
and I'm not saying she can't...

226
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,399
I don't really have a choice here.

227
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,785
I'm the only family she's got.

228
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:27,953
Hondo,

229
00:10:27,955 --> 00:10:28,989
I got it under control.

230
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,539
Street, I got to say it. I think

231
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,790
her living with you is a bad idea.

232
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,008
What, 'cause you still think
that she filed

233
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,426
that misconduct charge against you?

234
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:35,655
I explained that.

235
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:37,312
That was just some other woman in prison

236
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:39,214
trying to impress her. She had no idea.

237
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:40,883
So, look, either I help her out,

238
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:42,050
or she stays locked up.

239
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:43,302
And I can't have that.

240
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:45,387
Street, I love my mom,
too, so I understand.

241
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,856
I just don't want this
impacting you or SWAT.

242
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:48,923
It won't.

243
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,610
I got friends I can call.

244
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:53,028
We can pull some strings

245
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,897
and get her in a good
halfway house in Reseda.

246
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,398
That'll give her the space she needs

247
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,233
to find herself, solidify parole

248
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,868
and give you peace of mind.

249
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:03,539
Let me give it some thought, okay?

250
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,874
All right.

251
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:07,242
Hold up, hold up. Where's she going?

252
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,744
Where's she going? She's on the move.

253
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,078
Luca, she's on the move.

254
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,797
- Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me.
- Out of the way.

255
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,500
Excuse us. Move, move, move.

256
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:17,085
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Move aside. LAPD.

257
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:18,503
Move, move, move.

258
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,972
Door's locked.

259
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,089
She's gone.

260
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,307
She planned it.

261
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:23,926
I figured she might
pull a stunt like this,

262
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:26,061
so I had this pre-loaded.

263
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:32,601
You see her?

264
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:33,652
Right there. Right there.

265
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:35,020
Outdoor café.

266
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:37,034
_

267
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,529
Police! Everybody down!

268
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,233
Stay down.

269
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,901
Stay down!

270
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,571
Get up! Up.

271
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,407
On the ground.

272
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,502
Oh!

273
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:41,803
Miss, come here! Come here!

274
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,223
- Get out of the car!
- Move!

275
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,258
- Move!
- ‭Get out!

276
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,226
Get out!

277
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,074
You okay? You sure?

278
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:03,111
This is 20-David to Control.

279
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:04,776
I need an R/A at location.

280
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:05,994
I got two victims

281
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,030
with injuries, one suspect in custody.

282
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:09,698
Be advised, another suspect

283
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,199
last seen in a dark green Jeep

284
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,701
headed west on Hewitt.

285
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:14,369
All right, sit down. Sit down. Sit tight.

286
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,705
Help's on the way, okay? ‭Okay.

287
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:18,590
This is all on you.

288
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,125
- I can explain.
- ‭Oh, and you will.

289
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:22,594
Back at SWAT headquarters.
You just made yourself

290
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,546
a witness to a crime, so now I decide

291
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:26,348
where you go. You made your play.

292
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,766
Now I'm gonna make mine.

293
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:36,522
The mayor's curious
how a public café was shot up

294
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:38,096
with two civilians injured.

295
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,620
In case you're wondering, yes,

296
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,756
she did say the word "curious"
sarcastically.

297
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,257
She wants things locked down.

298
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,725
Tell the mayor I'm the one to blame

299
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:45,960
for Irina slipping away.

300
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,294
That's not the way it works, Hondo.

301
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:48,796
We all take responsibility.

302
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:50,631
But we can't let anything else
happen to Irina

303
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,466
or have any other collateral damage.

304
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:54,685
We don't wait for these shooters
to attack again.

305
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:56,637
We need to track them down first.

306
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,305
We're canvassing security cameras,

307
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:00,641
trying to find the stolen
Jeep the other suspect stole.

308
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,860
The guy we have in custody might
be able to help us ID him.

309
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,145
Well, so far he isn't talking,

310
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:05,646
and Irina's keeping quiet, too.

311
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:07,732
I'm gonna get answers. Trust me.

312
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:10,234
The people who are hurt,

313
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,486
are they going to be okay?

314
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:15,406
What, you mean the two women
in the ER right now?

315
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:16,824
Yeah, they'll live.

316
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,376
But you pretty much ruined their week.

317
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:19,660
I thought we were

318
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:21,629
on the road to trusting each other.

319
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:23,330
Guess you lied about that, too.

320
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:25,666
My source would have panicked
if he saw you all there.

321
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,334
I had to go alone.

322
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,170
- I have to leave here.
- ‭

323
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,838
- Try another one, lady.
- ‭You want me

324
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,890
to tell the whole world
you put a foreign journalist

325
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:34,175
under house arrest?

326
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:36,060
I thought this was L.A., not Moscow.

327
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:37,511
Local laws say I can keep you here

328
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:39,146
for 12 hours as a material witness.

329
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:41,315
That's the new plan. Get used to it.

330
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:43,851
You're no different
than the other police.

331
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:45,770
Using guns to get your way.

332
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:49,323
The difference is,
I'm trying to keep you alive.

333
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,275
This Russian cat we have in custody,

334
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:53,444
he's got no records, no history.

335
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:55,029
He's a ghost.

336
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:56,530
So what's he doing, Irina?

337
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:57,865
Is he here trying to kill you

338
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,283
for something you've already written

339
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:00,675
or something you're about to write?

340
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,838
What is this story
that you're working on?

341
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,256
I can't tell you.

342
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:06,674
I have to protect my source

343
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:08,902
- until I publish it.
- Okay, fine.

344
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:11,629
Fine, then you're gonna sit right here.

345
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:14,105
Let me know if you need
a book to read or something.

346
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:18,385
I've been working

347
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,187
for the last nine months on a story

348
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:21,889
about some very powerful people
from Russia

349
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:24,024
who are trying to smuggle machine guns

350
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:26,944
and fully automatic rifles into the U.S.

351
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:34,635
Why?

352
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:35,986
Why? What's the endgame?

353
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:37,371
- Money?
- ‭No.

354
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:39,039
They want to dump them here for free.

355
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,741
They want Americans killing each other

356
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:43,294
like people did in Ukraine, Georgia,

357
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,662
Syria.

358
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,080
They plan to start in Los Angeles,

359
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,998
then other big cities.

360
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Over 50,000 assault weapons.

361
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:51,135
The first shipments

362
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,803
are already on their way.

363
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:54,472
Do you know how they're moving them here?

364
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,973
No. I need to get

365
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:57,925
to my source to get the information.

366
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:00,728
Look, the first meeting
was to build trust.

367
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,930
If I don't meet with Shaolin today,

368
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:04,932
he'll get scared and go back into hiding.

369
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,016
And then we'll never find out

370
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:07,867
how these guns are being moved here.

371
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:12,990
I tried a little Russian
in Google Translate,

372
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:14,942
but he still hasn't bitten.

373
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:16,443
He definitely understands English.

374
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:18,279
Every time I say the words,
"You suck at your job..."

375
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:20,197
See? He twitches.

376
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,448
Engraving in Cyrillic on his ring

377
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,617
means "Pavel." I guess it's his name.

378
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,620
If you're a foreign spy

379
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:28,205
or wanted by Interpol,

380
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:31,175
you'll be looking
at federal prison for life,

381
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:32,793
unless you start talking

382
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,178
and tell us who hired you.

383
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:35,796
Or we can hand you over

384
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,381
to the CIA.

385
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,016
Let them deal with you.

386
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,187
What isn't the CIA
telling us, Agent Bishop?

387
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:45,723
We told you there might be a hit
on your journalist here in L.A.

388
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:47,474
That's all we're at liberty to say.

389
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:49,393
For deniability, fine. But why isn't

390
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:51,312
Homeland Security or the FBI involved?

391
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,313
Because now I know this is bigger

392
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,647
than you led us to believe.

393
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,566
The same Russians who tried to kill Irina

394
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:57,902
in Rio and Bruges are
coming after her here.

395
00:16:57,904 --> 00:16:58,986
A lot of chatter

396
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:00,287
is telling us the Russians

397
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,989
are pulling out all the stops this time.

398
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,324
Maybe that has something
to do with whatever story

399
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,408
she's working on.

400
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,659
Do you know anything about guns

401
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,912
- being smuggled into the country?
- No.

402
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:09,830
We think our suspect in custody

403
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:11,665
is a professional Russian mercenary.

404
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,885
No files on him anywhere,
but we think his name is Pavel.

405
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,420
What makes you say that?

406
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:18,145
The engraving on his ring.

407
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,675
- Does he wear it on his right thumb?
- ‭Yeah.

408
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:23,227
- Does that mean something?
- Means Pavel's

409
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:24,678
the name of his handler.

410
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,430
That ring is a membership band

411
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:28,182
for a bathhouse in Mid-City.

412
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:29,433
But he's not Russian intelligence,

413
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,151
or you could have picked him up.

414
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:32,853
All right, now that we're
out in the open about this,

415
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:33,854
you should know.

416
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:35,022
There's a nest here

417
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,907
in L.A. of ex-KGB agents

418
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:38,359
who have strong connections

419
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,194
with Russian oligarchs
and weapons dealers.

420
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:41,445
That bathhouse is probably

421
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:43,030
a place where the guy you got in custody

422
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:44,365
and others like him meet
with their handler.

423
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,532
Now, we've been casing them

424
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:46,951
for years but never
gotten enough evidence

425
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:48,285
to make any arrests.

426
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,170
Now, with his mercs going after Irina,

427
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,206
maybe you can help us out
in that department.

428
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,958
Because SWAT going after him
makes it appear

429
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,377
like a local crime, giving the CIA cover.

430
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,046
Listen, fact is, you getting
evidence on their handler

431
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:01,515
gives you the Russians
trying to kill Irina.

432
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:05,185
Hey.

433
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:06,520
Hey.

434
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:08,138
You know why, uh, Cortez

435
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,356
ordered us into civvies?

436
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:10,531
Not yet.

437
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,944
I, um...

438
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,946
I heard you kicked Luca
out of your place.

439
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:17,314
I know your mom's

440
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:18,899
getting paroled.

441
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,068
There's got to be a lot
weighing on you, Street.

442
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,487
- It's nothing I can't handle.
- Right.

443
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,072
'Cause you remember
when we both got reprimanded

444
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:26,657
when you went off-case

445
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:29,209
and you beat up that dude
for her? 'Cause I do.

446
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,130
Look, someone getting out
of jail seems straightforward,

447
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:35,416
but it changes your life, too.

448
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,085
I can keep trouble away from my mom.

449
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:42,890
I got you, but will she keep
trouble away from you?

450
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,846
Hey, guys. Short notice, I know, but uh,

451
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,180
I need a place to stay.

452
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:52,599
Street kicked me out. Any takers?

453
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,902
Well, you know I got
three kids, but uh, yeah.

454
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:56,020
If you want to share a bedroom

455
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,521
with a colicky baby, be my guest.

456
00:18:57,523 --> 00:18:58,489
I'm open to it.

457
00:18:58,491 --> 00:18:59,990
I'll have to ask Annie.

458
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,108
What about you?

459
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,110
Uh, no. Bonnie would hate me.

460
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:04,695
Who's Bonnie?

461
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:06,163
The girl I've been dating.
I've mentioned her.

462
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,915
She kind of stays at my place now.

463
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,366
Sort of getting serious. Sorry, man.

464
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,260
All right, I'll figure
something else out, thanks.

465
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:15,372
If we don't find that guy
a place to live,

466
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:16,707
he's gonna home-invade one of us.

467
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,375
Tell me about it.

468
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:19,621
According to the CIA,

469
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:21,545
our shooter's handler is Pavel Nobokov,

470
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:22,963
AKA "Melvin Norwood""

471
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,682
The data files in his air-gapped laptop

472
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:26,300
should hopefully get us
to the other shooters

473
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:27,634
going after Irina, and the money men

474
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,386
trying to smuggle guns into L.A.

475
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:31,638
Now, sealed warrant depends on
us downloading his hard drive

476
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,102
and getting out clean...
no margin for error.

477
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:36,443
So if we get caught, it's an
international incident, I'm guessing.

478
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:37,943
Pissed off congressmen,
a lot of people screaming?

479
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,476
I'd really hate to
disappoint a politician,

480
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,472
but our main concern is ex-KGB agents,

481
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,549
who are going to be on site.

482
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:43,917
And these guys are pros,

483
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,968
so we need to go in stealth.

484
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,920
- Hence the civvies.
- ‭Yeah.

485
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,755
That's, like, a real outfit
you're proud to wear, Street?

486
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:50,590
I don't have time to explain
style to you, Tan.

487
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:52,592
I'm assuming that going in there

488
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:53,977
and distracting the
target's my job, right?

489
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:56,062
Actually, no. Membership's men only.

490
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,765
Typically, the strong
and silent type, so...

491
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:01,768
Time to get your sneak on, Deac.

492
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,664
Good afternoon.

493
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,000
Uh, welcome.

494
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:18,835
Uh, write your name, please.

495
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:22,339
We're in.

496
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,087
He's with me.

497
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:45,145
All right, locker room's empty

498
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:46,813
and the receptionist is double checking.

499
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,649
- I'm cutting the power now.
- Uh-oh.

500
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:51,368
Hope no one's in the middle
of drying their hair.

501
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:56,413
_

502
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,132
- _
- _

503
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:04,464
Okay, four minutes until
DWP reroutes power

504
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:05,832
to the backup circuit breaker.

505
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,890
Should be enough time
to download the files,

506
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,337
assuming you can keep the target engaged.

507
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,839
All right, target last seen
in the sauna room.

508
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,175
Hondo, the receptionist
is heading your way.

509
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:18,562
What's going on with the power?

510
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:20,680
We've got rolling blackouts,
miss, I'm sorry.

511
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:22,482
We're doing the best we can.

512
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:24,267
It might be a little quicker if
we could get to your fuse box.

513
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:25,769
I-It's in the back hallway.

514
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:28,321
Okay, I'll be there
in a second. Thank you.

515
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,856
Tan.

516
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:38,031
You can tell your clients it'll
be about five minutes or ten.

517
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,366
No more than ten.

518
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:41,451
I'll let you know if I need 15.

519
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:49,376
Street. We've got eyes again.

520
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:51,544
All right, we're back in business.

521
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,181
I got it.

522
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:59,493
_

523
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:04,140
Whew!

524
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,563
Deacon's in the sauna with the target.

525
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,106
Luca, you're clear. Move in.

526
00:22:14,987 --> 00:22:17,037
You're looking for Norwood.

527
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,122
You got approximately two minutes.

528
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:23,043
That's some great ink.
Tell me you know an artist

529
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,411
on the west side.

530
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:28,164
- Of Moscow, yes.
- ‭

531
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:33,637
- Do I know you?
- No. I usually come mornings.

532
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:35,722
Me, too.

533
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,641
This is late for me.

534
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:41,761
All right, I'm starting the download now.

535
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:43,596
Looks like we've got info
on Melvin's shooters

536
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,265
and a whole lot more.

537
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,816
You got two minutes
till power changeover.

538
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:48,435
I'm gonna need more time.

539
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:50,437
I can hold the circuit breakers
for the building, Luca,

540
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:52,155
but the rest of the block will be online.

541
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:53,523
I'm going as fast as I can.

542
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:58,078
The block's coming back on now.

543
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:06,169
The receptionist is clocking it.

544
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:07,642
_

545
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:10,173
Just stay the course.
You hear me? Stay the course.

546
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,760
Okay, we've got 30% and counting.

547
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:15,211
Hey.

548
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:17,013
You're uh, Melvin, right?

549
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:18,214
Yes.

550
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:21,101
Now, who's asking? Who are you?

551
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:22,469
Just a friend of a friend.

552
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:23,844
Yeah?

553
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,681
Where did you get this ring?

554
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,143
You got to earn it, don't you?

555
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:34,197
The rest of the block has power,
why not here? What's going on?

556
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,949
I still need to reset your fuses, ma'am.

557
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,368
We're close.

558
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:48,745
There we go.

559
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:52,298
They got eyes on you, Luca.

560
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,883
I'm only at 60%.

561
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,845
If you could just sign
right here, please.

562
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:08,231
Done.

563
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:12,736
Thank you for your patience.

564
00:24:16,108 --> 00:24:17,490
You know my name,

565
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:19,576
but I never gave you that ring.

566
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,244
Tell me your name.

567
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:22,862
Dmitri.

568
00:24:22,864 --> 00:24:24,247
Deacon, Luca's clear. Get out of there.

569
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,582
I'll be right back.

570
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,246
_

571
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,246
_

572
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:07,670
You okay? Mm-hmm.

573
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,215
Your boss okay with you,

574
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,383
you know, stepping away?

575
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,768
Yeah, yeah.

576
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,103
We're rotating teams and our VIP's back

577
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:16,722
at HQ, so it's fine.

578
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,975
Jimmy, I am literally
counting the minutes.

579
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,694
I mean, you'd think after 18 years

580
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,229
that a few more days would be easy,

581
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,064
but I've never felt this on edge.

582
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,117
Yeah. Same here, Mom.

583
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:30,736
And y-you know,

584
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,155
I-I did want to ask you
if you wanted something

585
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:37,125
more spacious than just
my living room couch.

586
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:40,245
One of my colleagues can pull strings

587
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,080
at some good sponsored housing in Reseda.

588
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,749
A halfway house, Jimmy.

589
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,133
Well, it's a residence

590
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,636
where there is a caretaker person

591
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,922
and there's support groups
to help with the transition.

592
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,390
It's a halfway house.

593
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:53,397
I mean, am I half your mother?

594
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:57,646
No, it's just, it's actually closer

595
00:25:57,648 --> 00:26:01,560
to the job that I'm trying
to get lined up for you.

596
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,836
And this way you'd have
the space you need.

597
00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:07,382
What I need is to be with my son.

598
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,209
That's what's gonna help me.

599
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:12,137
I know.

600
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:15,297
You're right.

601
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,266
Do you not trust me out there, Jimmy?

602
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:19,218
Of course I do, Ma.

603
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,553
- What'd we find?
- ‭Melvin sent encrypted text messages

604
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,272
to these four numbers

605
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:24,690
within minutes of the attack on Irina.

606
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:26,475
One of the burner phones
belongs to the guy

607
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:27,726
you currently have in custody.

608
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:28,978
Let me guess: the other one belongs

609
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,729
- to the shooter who escaped.
- ‭Yep.

610
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:31,780
And the other two burners probably belong

611
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:33,232
to a pair of backup shooters.

612
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,200
Now, I've triangulated
the last known cell phone pings

613
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,819
to see if we can get a location.

614
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:38,904
So there's three men trying to kill me?

615
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:41,073
Looks like I'm barking up the right tree.

616
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:43,709
Don't worry, they can't get
to you as long you're here.

617
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:46,078
The problem is, Irina has
a speaking engagement tonight

618
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,247
and she can't miss it.
After the speech, her source

619
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:50,082
is gonna hand out
the final pieces of information

620
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:51,834
- about the guns headed to L.A.
- No.

621
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:53,719
Too risky. Irina is a walking target.

622
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:56,005
As long as those three
shooters are out there,

623
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,589
everyone around her is in danger.

624
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:59,224
Your source can give you

625
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,592
that information when you're out of L.A.

626
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:01,894
Captain, if Irina's right

627
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:03,479
about the assault weapons coming in,

628
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,064
we don't have that kind of time.

629
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,066
These guns weren't on the State
Department radar until now.

630
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:09,268
The intel looks like
it checks out so far.

631
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,820
Intercepting these weapons would be huge.

632
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,772
By the time I leave town,
it'll be too late.

633
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:16,775
Got a ping...
one of our three burner phones.

634
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:19,328
All right. Near an industrial
section of Huntington Park,

635
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,947
east of Hope Street... there's only one

636
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,282
apartment complex nearby.

637
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:25,534
Tenants. All with Hispanic names...

638
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:27,786
except one: Yuri Chernon.

639
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:30,456
- How do you want to do this?
- I'll split up my team.

640
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,374
I'll have Deacon and Luca
no-knock the apartment,

641
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:34,760
and we'll take Rocker
and couple of Mumford's guys

642
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:36,178
to the event with Irina.

643
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,430
Get them tac'd up and ready.

644
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:41,050
I'm going with you. If we're
gonna risk getting fired,

645
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:42,301
I'm gonna be there.

646
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,219
One bedroom,

647
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,472
Mar Vista, third floor,

648
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:47,806
newly carpeted.

649
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:49,525
Nah, it's not west-facing.

650
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,144
I need to see the
sunset... it soothes me.

651
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:54,646
All right, well, what about
a deluxe studio in Culver City

652
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,815
one block from downtown?

653
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:59,034
Fake marble... that's an HGTV no-no.

654
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:01,737
Okay. Okay, Luca, we got you.

655
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:04,540
Here we go. One-bedroom loft,

656
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,658
fourth floor, Hollywood and La Brea,

657
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,210
real marble, west-facing,

658
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:10,079
- and the kicker is...
- Fully furnished,

659
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:12,531
ready to move in this week. Boom, son.

660
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:13,799
I don't know, guys.

661
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,167
Look, if it sounds too good to be true,

662
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:17,636
it probably is.
Thanks for trying, though.

663
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,874
What's the deal?
It's got everything he wants.

664
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:23,509
Luca's a guy who's got

665
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:25,511
long-term monogamous
relationships that end.

666
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,012
But then he's eventually
bunking with one of us

667
00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:28,504
until he meets a new girl.

668
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:30,265
And then we're always telling him

669
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,650
he's moving in too early, right?

670
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,852
Well, this is a guy who knows

671
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:35,687
no place is ever gonna be good enough,

672
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:37,439
because he'd have to be there by himself.

673
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:39,191
Doesn't want to live alone. Sounds right.

674
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:41,443
So what do you suggest we do about it?

675
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:43,695
Time to go, Street.

676
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,531
You need help getting ready or something?

677
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,533
No, I don't need help getting ready.

678
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:50,702
But if you could help Luca find
a place, that'd be amazing.

679
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:53,122
Yeah, I'm-I'm working on that.

680
00:28:58,212 --> 00:29:00,546
I know you got mixed feelings
about your mom,

681
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:02,381
but just because she's your mom

682
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:04,600
doesn't mean you
have to put yourself out.

683
00:29:05,886 --> 00:29:07,973
What if I'm the reason
my mom's in prison?

684
00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:09,767
- Your mother killed your father.
- No.

685
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:11,023
That's why she's in prison.

686
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:14,276
No, my father was on track
to kill both of us.

687
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:15,694
Eventually.

688
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:17,613
But my mom

689
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:19,031
just...

690
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,116
she just stopped him from getting there.

691
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:23,368
- 12 jurors saw it differently.
- Yeah, but that's

692
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,737
because she had me lure him
into my bedroom

693
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:28,574
to set him up, and then she shot him,

694
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,909
and she told me to tell the cops...

695
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:32,794
that he just came after me.

696
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:35,631
- But you couldn't lie for her.
- No, because in my mind...

697
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:37,416
what she did wasn't wrong.

698
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:39,134
She was protecting us.

699
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:40,636
She was protecting me.

700
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:43,305
And I just trusted one cop...

701
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:45,424
enough to tell the truth.

702
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:46,425
Buck.

703
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,927
And I don't know why...

704
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:50,313
for some reason...

705
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:55,567
it was important to me that
he knew what really happened.

706
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:57,436
My mom,

707
00:29:57,438 --> 00:29:58,937
she saved my life, Chris.

708
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:01,607
I don't care what anyone says...
she saved me.

709
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:04,993
But the D.A. wanted to improve
his conviction rate,

710
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:06,371
so...

711
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,249
I'm the reason my mom spent
18 years in prison.

712
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:11,500
- No.
- ‭Yeah.

713
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,835
- No.
- ‭I could've kept her out, but...

714
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:19,208
I betrayed her.

715
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:22,010
I'm sorry, this is...

716
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:23,011
unprofessional.

717
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:24,513
No, it's not.

718
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:28,967
Listen.

719
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,388
I don't like opening up, either,

720
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,275
but it's good to do it sometimes.

721
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,561
Thanks for trusting me.

722
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:45,400
I can't even imagine what
that must have been like.

723
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,914
All I know is that it's made
you who you are today...

724
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:52,793
which is somebody I would
trust my life with.

725
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,329
And... look...

726
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:59,665
cards up, I, uh,

727
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,750
I went and I read the court transcripts

728
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:03,635
of your mom's case.

729
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:07,339
And maybe... what she did
was the right thing to do.

730
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:10,102
But making you a part of it wasn't.

731
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:15,264
Meet you outside.

732
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:17,109
Thanks. I'll be right there.

733
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,654
Irina?

734
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:25,023
All right, listen.

735
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:27,326
Chris, Street and I
are gonna be just offstage,

736
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:28,744
literally waiting in the wings.

737
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,280
‭You nervous?

738
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:33,448
About someone trying to kill me?

739
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,034
You're not going to let that happen.
‭Hmm.

740
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:39,538
Now, giving a speech in front
of hundreds of people, it's...

741
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,590
Trust me. Public speaking is
not my thing, either.

742
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:43,925
That's what you're scared of?
You risk your life every day

743
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,877
for people you don't even know.

744
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:48,380
How can you do that and not be afraid?

745
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:51,300
I just know it needs to be done.
We need to protect those

746
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:53,552
who can't protect themselves,
make sure they have a voice.

747
00:31:53,554 --> 00:31:56,690
I think you and I both know
what it's like not to have one.

748
00:32:01,562 --> 00:32:03,478
- Give me two!
- ‭Two!

749
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,013
Closet only!

750
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:08,066
The rich and the powerful
count on us being cowards,

751
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:10,235
being afraid.

752
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:13,010
But the more we stand up,
the more they have to listen.

753
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,377
And the more power we take from them.

754
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,712
- Closet only.
- Two, two.

755
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:19,514
Bathroom only.

756
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:21,883
It's not too late to fight back.

757
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,719
We all have an obligation to do our part.

758
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:26,271
Thank you.

759
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:31,309
Subject's moving off stage right.

760
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:32,727
20-David, you have eyes.

761
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,810
- It was a brave speech.
- Just doing my part.

762
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:39,367
My source texted that he'd find me

763
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:41,069
before I get to the green room.

764
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:42,570
We love you!

765
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,622
That means he could be
anyone in here. Hey.

766
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:46,074
Take it easy. Take it easy.

767
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:47,659
Irina, please sign my book?

768
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,160
Irina, this has to be quick.

769
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:50,662
It's okay.

770
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:56,584
30-David. Suspect's apartment's clear.

771
00:32:56,586 --> 00:32:57,919
No sign of our guy.

772
00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,921
But he did leave some goodies behind.

773
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:01,556
One at a time. One at a time.
Take it easy now.

774
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:02,924
Guys, step back.

775
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:04,426
Ma'am, excuse me. Step back, please.

776
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,011
One at a time. Easy.

777
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:08,229
Hey, bud, you got to wait
back in the press section.

778
00:33:08,231 --> 00:33:10,315
Oh, I'm sorry. Just want to
get a question in really quick.

779
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:11,433
Now is not a good time.

780
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:14,185
Would you sign my book, please?

781
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:23,278
Looks like our guy's a cooker.

782
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,447
One at a time. One at a time.
Take it easy now.

783
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:27,449
- One at a time!
- ‭Guys, step back here!

784
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:29,041
- No pushing. No pushing.
- Step back, guys.

785
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:30,452
One at a time.

786
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:32,287
Easy.

787
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,627
25-David, I got press

788
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:39,117
going behind stage left.
Let's check 'em out.

789
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,476
51-David, get the two side.
I'll take the four.

790
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,394
Step back, please.

791
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,397
Could you sign this, Irina?

792
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:59,786
The suspect left acetaminophen,
caffeine pills,

793
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,416
aspirin and a prosumer

794
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:02,976
- chem lab behind.
- Back up. Back up.

795
00:34:02,978 --> 00:34:05,249
Luca also found QL and sulfur
in the fridge.

796
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,168
He's making VX poison gas.

797
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,586
D-Team, be advised...

798
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,755
possible biological agents
in close vicinity.

799
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,470
I'll notify Central Division.
We need to lock this place down.

800
00:34:13,472 --> 00:34:15,310
Irina, that's enough.
That's enough. Change of plans.

801
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:16,762
We have to get you to the green
room right now. Street?

802
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:18,128
- Move 'em back! Move!
- All right, folks, make a hole.

803
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,463
- Back up. Make some space!
- Let's go. Back up, people!

804
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:21,131
We haven't found an activator,
but clearly...

805
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,967
- He's weaponizing it.
- The only way they could have gotten it

806
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,969
through security was if it could
pass through a metal detector.

807
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:28,105
I'm pretty sure pens could do that.

808
00:34:31,393 --> 00:34:33,477
Irina, your autograph, please.
Proceeds go

809
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,550
to Operation Underground.

810
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,304
One last thing, Hondo. This is important.

811
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:40,734
Please back off, okay?
Back off. Make some room.

812
00:34:40,736 --> 00:34:43,287
Hondo, we think they're
using pens to hide the VX.

813
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,239
Irina, don't touch that pen!

814
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:53,463
Street, Street, get the runner!
Street, the runner!

815
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,501
Chris? Chris?

816
00:34:57,503 --> 00:35:00,470
I got you, Chris. Chris?

817
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:03,173
Chris? This is 20-David
to Command. Officer down.

818
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:05,726
Exposure to biological agent VX.

819
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,933
Be advised. Code 3.

820
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,983
I repeat, officer down.

821
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:13,527
Deac? Deac, Chris got hit
with the VX. I need the atropine

822
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:15,385
in the med cache out of Black Betty now.

823
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:17,366
All units be advised, I need
all intersections cleared

824
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,774
from Huntington Park to downtown,

825
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:20,963
starting on Western to Exposition.

826
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,740
Code 3, I need an R/A at location.

827
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:25,042
- We'll be there in ten, Hondo.
- Make it eight,

828
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:26,794
- or she's gone, man.
- Tan and Rocker, status.

829
00:35:26,796 --> 00:35:28,662
We found our two backup
shooters. Kitchen has direct

830
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:30,915
access to the green room.

831
00:35:42,762 --> 00:35:45,062
‭

832
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:16,127
Give me your hands!

833
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:23,718
Right side clear.

834
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,603
Let side clear, Hondo.

835
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:27,471
Got your guy from the food court, Hondo.

836
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:35,813
I got the guy who dosed Chris.
Tan, take him

837
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,565
before I lose it on him.

838
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,867
25-David, all three shooters
are accounted for.

839
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:41,432
Go. I got this.

840
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:44,822
Stay in there, Chris. Chris?

841
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:51,996
You grab my hand, and you squeeze.

842
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:53,914
- Let's go.
- And just keep squeezing.

843
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,539
Do not stop. Do not let go.

844
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:57,468
Deacon, where are you?

845
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,386
We're two minutes out, Hondo.

846
00:36:58,388 --> 00:37:00,838
Here we go.

847
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,621
Hold on, Chris. You hear me? You hold on.

848
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:10,681
Stay with me, Chris.
I got you. I got you.

849
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:12,016
I'm right out front. I got her ready.

850
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:13,934
All right. The shot's prepped, Hondo.

851
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,853
Squeeze my hand. Stay with me.

852
00:37:15,855 --> 00:37:17,605
How long has it been?
Seven minutes and counting.

853
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,609
Chris, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

854
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:22,026
- Keep fighting. Come on, keep fighting.
- Come on now, Chris.

855
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,528
- Come on. Squeeze, Chris.
- Chris! Hey! Chris!

856
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,947
Hey, stay with me. You're good.

857
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,364
You're good.

858
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:28,949
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on. Come on.

859
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:31,702
Stay with us, Chris.
Come on now. Let's go! Move!

860
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:33,421
- Give me room! Give me room!
- Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

861
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:36,373
You got one shot
at the heart, Deac. Come on.

862
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:40,377
- Come on, Chris. Come on.
- Come on, Chris.

863
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,849
Come on, Chris.

864
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:47,718
Come on, Chris. Breathe. Hey.

865
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,638
- There she is.
- Oh... Hey.

866
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,056
You scared us.

867
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:53,557
Don't do that again, please.

868
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,109
You good?

869
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:57,945
Stupid question, I guess.

870
00:37:57,947 --> 00:38:00,481
- Oh, my God.
- ‭Hey, man...

871
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:05,202
And you thought what I did was brave.

872
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:08,720
Hmm. You know, sometimes
I do get scared, Irina.

873
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:10,889
Seeing Chris like that was one of them.

874
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:13,781
Hmm. They're lucky to have you
as their leader.

875
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:16,111
No. No. I'm lucky to have them.

876
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:19,322
You really think your
source is gonna show up?

877
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:23,902
I told him I trust you,
and so should him.

878
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:25,570
I appreciate you coming around.

879
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:28,156
I'm sorry for the trouble
I caused you, Hondo.

880
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,978
Let's just hope it was worth it.

881
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:41,252
I'm Shaolin...

882
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:42,929
your source.

883
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,977
Nice to finally meet you, Irina.

884
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,266
Federal authorities today seized

885
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:57,485
an estimated 50,000 guns

886
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,320
originating in Russia.

887
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:00,905
They were being smuggled into the country

888
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:03,525
through an elaborate tunnel
network from Mexico

889
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:05,827
through the southern border
of California.

890
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:07,028
Intelligence officials...

891
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,446
So glad the CIA is getting credit

892
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,843
for such a righteous bust.

893
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:13,835
Four Russians in custody,
a list of ex-KGB agents

894
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:15,420
snooping around in L.A...

895
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:18,122
The CIA wants me to
tell you, unofficially,

896
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:19,541
we've made them very happy.

897
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:23,127
So, I heard Chris got out
of the hospital already?

898
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:25,797
Yeah, she did. And she's good.

899
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,799
Actually,

900
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,018
she's back to her old ways.

901
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:37,141
Look, Luca, you got to
sleep somewhere tonight,

902
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:39,194
and if you say no to this place,
you'd be breaking a law.

903
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:41,696
To prevent that, we put down
the first month's deposit.

904
00:39:41,698 --> 00:39:43,147
You what? Guys, I...

905
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:45,316
We know you don't like
living alone, Luca,

906
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:47,535
- so we fixed it.
- Luca!

907
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:49,070
Meet your new roommate.

908
00:39:49,072 --> 00:39:50,455
Say what?

909
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:52,290
- Whose dog is this?
- Yours.

910
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,458
Hey...

911
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,660
Meet Duke. Recently retired from duty.

912
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:58,329
My friend Joe, with
Riverside PD, offered him up.

913
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,715
- He's gonna need a new home, too.
- Seriously, guys?

914
00:40:00,717 --> 00:40:01,824
Yep. And, your

915
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,479
- new place takes pets. ‭
- Hey.

916
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:05,862
You shouldn't have.

917
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:07,088
Aw.

918
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:13,645
Hey, uh, Hondo.

919
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,513
What's up, kid?

920
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:18,816
I, uh... I just wanted to say thank you

921
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:22,002
for offering to pull some
strings for my mom.

922
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,642
Of course. I'm happy to do it.

923
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:25,523
But, uh, she's gonna stay with me.

924
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:27,525
So... it's all good.

925
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,237
All right.

926
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,447
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- ‭Yeah.

927
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:46,427
Irina.

928
00:40:46,429 --> 00:40:47,545
So, I hear your guards have

929
00:40:47,547 --> 00:40:49,514
a good advance plan for Manila.

930
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:50,815
That's more like it.

931
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:52,717
They know they've got
a tough act to follow here.

932
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,602
Too bad you're not coming with me.

933
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:57,639
No. That sounds tempting,
but duty calls...

934
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:04,445
Wow. Uh...

935
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:06,147
What was that for?

936
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:07,782
I've learned that life is too short

937
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:09,784
not to do the things you want.

938
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:13,071
Maybe I'll be back
in Los Angeles one day.

939
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:15,123
Until then, you stay safe.

940
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:20,712
Bye.

941
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:45,248
Let's get out of here.

942
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,583
- Yeah?
- ‭Yeah.

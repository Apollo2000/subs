1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,213
- Previously on SWAT...
- Jessica can't sleep with

2
00:00:02,247 --> 00:00:04,188
one of her subordinates,
and if you cared about Jessica,

3
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,163
- you'd want to protect her.
- I hate this.

4
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:07,914
The timing isn't right.
You got to do you,

5
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:09,382
and you can't do that with me.

6
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:15,689
17-year-old young man, Raymont Harris,

7
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,658
was accidentally shot
and seriously injured

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,076
by team leader Buck Spivey.

9
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:22,946
Now, this morning,
I terminated Sergeant Spivey.

10
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:24,080
How far you and Buck go back?

11
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:25,749
He knew my mom. Put her in prison.

12
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:27,867
I've been watching Street, and
if I can't be here to help him,

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,069
I'm hoping you will.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,123
Come on, Boot.

15
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,208
Or is everyone from
Hollywood Division this slow?

16
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,093
I swear I trained him better than this.

17
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:38,545
Witnesses saw a girl

18
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:40,880
dragged from a car
registered to a Keri Sims,

19
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:42,632
22-year-old actress from Ohio.

20
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,434
She fits the profile
of his other victims.

21
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:46,302
The "Vanity Killer."
All the screenwriters in town,

22
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:48,304
they can't come up with
a better name than that?

23
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:49,606
- Buck.
- Sir.

24
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,391
Robbery-Homicide's on site
with more details.

25
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:53,059
- All right.
- We got to roll, people.

26
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:54,561
You can cross your T's in the truck.

27
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:56,279
Where we headed? Baldwin Village.

28
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,642
We get this done in time, we
can hit Phillips on Crenshaw.

29
00:00:58,644 --> 00:00:59,783
What's Phillip's?

30
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,317
Best ribs in I.A.

31
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,474
- How you know my spot?
- Girl's got to eat.

32
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:12,829
96 seconds. I think we can
get it down under 90.

33
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:15,882
Only two weeks on the job,
and already pushing for better.

34
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:18,251
I like the ambition, Cortez.

35
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:24,007
I've had eight bodies turn up

36
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,759
within a mile of this spot since August.

37
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:28,228
Don't know diddly about the
killer, but Forensics says that

38
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,263
all the vics were locked up
someplace damp,

39
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:32,599
cold and full of asbestos
before they died.

40
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:34,477
And you think this building's
where your guy's been keeping them?

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,152
The girl that was seen dragged inside

42
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:37,604
fits his M.O. to a T.

43
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:38,855
You couple that with the location,

44
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,273
the reinforced steel doors,

45
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,408
it's the best lead I've had so far.

46
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,896
- He expecting us?
- Shouldn't be.

47
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,970
We kept our distance.
Didn't want to spook him

48
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,953
- with a possible live victim inside.
- If he keeps

49
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:49,081
his prisoners alive for a while,
why not just wait him out?

50
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,615
He tortures his victims for weeks;

51
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:52,014
I got no proof he ever leaves them alone.

52
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,587
You really want to set up camp
while he slow kills an innocent?

53
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:56,956
We'll bring him down.
Thank you, Detective.

54
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,800
Okay, Hondo, Luca, Red Team,

55
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:01,127
you're with me. Deacon, you'rere
Blue Team with Chris and Tan.

56
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,613
Stay liquid, fill the gaps.
This is why we're here.

57
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:16,914
It's dark.

58
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,833
We got eyes, but it's dark on our end.

59
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:21,552
- Nothing moving.
- We're dark, too. Blowing the door.

60
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:22,720
Go!

61
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,257
Red Team is in.

62
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:28,592
Blue Team securing the rear.

63
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:33,156
Give me two!

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,983
- Left side clear!
- Right side clear!

65
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,935
Give me two! Give me two!

66
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,906
Right side clear!

67
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:42,940
- Left side clear!
- We're clear!

68
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:44,692
- Give me two!
- Let's go.

69
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:46,193
Going right.

70
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,947
- Left side clear!
- Right side clear!

71
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,910
Hands! Running!

72
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:55,559
- He's here.
- On my way.

73
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,254
Chris and Tan have the rear secure.

74
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:01,717
I got left!

75
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,761
- Hang on!
- I got right!

76
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:15,222
Luca, get her out of here.
Hondo, with me.

77
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,559
It's okay. I got you.

78
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:21,331
- It's Keri, right?
- Uh-huh.

79
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:22,522
You're gonna come with me, okay?

80
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:24,648
- Come on.
- No. What about him?

81
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:28,289
Trailers! I need trailers!

82
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,537
En route to assist.

83
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:30,738
Come here.

84
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:42,249
We got trip wire.

85
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,582
Yeah.

86
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,369
Hang on there, buddy.

87
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,237
He's got enough C-4
to blow the entire building.

88
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,187
Better back off.

89
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,970
Pull back.

90
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,068
Wire.

91
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:19,086
We got explosives! Evacuate!

92
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:21,038
Everybody out now!

93
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm waiting on trailers.
I got a second victim here.

94
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,375
Entering the building now.

95
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:27,011
Negative, Deac!
This place is about to blow!

96
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,611
Luca, get out, now!

97
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,231
Please. Help me.

98
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,967
Look, give me two minutes, okay?

99
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:36,103
In two minutes, you'll all
be charcoal. Evacuate now, Luca!

100
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:37,805
That's an order!

101
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:43,861
Hey. I'll come back for you.

102
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:46,647
I promise.

103
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:50,568
Come on. Come on!

104
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,290
I got a live victim
and a stack of explosives.

105
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:58,865
I need that bomb squad yesterday!

106
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:09,670
Hey. Come on! Come on! Let's go!

107
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:10,921
- I got her. I got her.
- You'll be safe here, okay?

108
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:11,972
I got her.

109
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:13,173
Luca, stop!

110
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:14,592
There's still a man in there!

111
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,280
Look, one bedroom, washer/dryer...

112
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:37,581
not that you'd use them.

113
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,999
Why are you so snarky?

114
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:40,534
It's not like your socks
smell any better.

115
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,253
Because I eat on that table, Luca.

116
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,338
It's been four months.
Don't you want your own place?

117
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,456
Ooh!

118
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,829
Benji's Bakery booth.

119
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,237
Their chocolate croissants

120
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,544
- will change your life.
- No.

121
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,262
Come on. It's my treat. I just want...

122
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,465
We're not stopping for pastries.

123
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,800
No. Forget the pastries. Follow me.

124
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:59,303
What's up? You want to
tell me what this is about?

125
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,188
Hey, remember a couple
years ago, that psycho that was

126
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,690
cutting up all the pretty people?

127
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,108
Yeah, his victims were all, like,

128
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,809
L.A. newcomers chasing
Hollywood dreams, right?

129
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,062
Yeah, exactly. "Vanity Killer."

130
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:09,980
What about him?

131
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:11,699
Namaste. Thank you.

132
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,486
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Sorry. Sorry.

133
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:17,288
Excuse me, excuse me.

134
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,744
That's him. Hey!

135
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:25,702
Hey!

136
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:33,504
Damn it!

137

138
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:10,656
Hey, Buck, it's Hondo, man.
I've left a few of these now.

139
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,715
Appreciate a call back.
I'm here at your house,

140
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:14,884
but it doesn't look like
you've been here in a while.

141
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:17,212
Let me know if you're out of
town or something, all right?

142
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:30,149
Buck?

143
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,708
Buck?

144
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,102
Hey, Luca. What's up?

145
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:57,404
Hey, you won't believe who I just saw.

146
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:59,689
Remember that sicko that
nearly blew us up two years ago

147
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,691
- in Baldwin Village?
- The serial killer?

148
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:02,826
He's alive, bro, and he's here.

149
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:04,361
- I almost had him.
- All right, wait a minute.

150
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:05,912
What happened?
What makes you think it was him?

151
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,697
No, I don't think. I know. Trust me.

152
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:08,915
I got his plate number.

153
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,917
We got to get with that
detective working the case.

154
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,336
- Text me his plate number.
- Okay.

155
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,510
Somebody get caught cheating
with their secretary?

156
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:22,095
Both single, but we'll probably find

157
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:24,053
a jealous somebody somewhere.

158
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:26,633
You were pretty cryptic on the
phone. What brings you to me?

159
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:27,934
I got a call from

160
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:30,220
one of my guys who swears he
just saw the Vanity Killer.

161
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:33,890
He blew himself up. Y-You were there.

162
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,975
He blew the building. Forensics
never found his remains.

163
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:37,360
Well, the killings stopped, didn't they?

164
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:39,229
My guy is not the type to cry wolf.

165
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,676
- Got a 20 on this guy?
- I just got a plate number.

166
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,234
Hondo, I got a backlog longer
than the lines at Disneyland.

167
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:45,618
I can't let warm bodies go cold

168
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,487
just 'cause your guy
thinks he saw a ghost.

169
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:49,239
I'm not asking you to do the legwork.

170
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,567
Just send over the Homicide case file.
Let me take a look.

171
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,126
Hell, if you want to play
detective on your day off,

172
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:54,411
I'll give you access to the whole system.

173
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:56,963
You get me a good lead,
and I'll make time to work it.

174
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,252
- All right. That's all I ask.
- All right.

175
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,534
Appreciate it.

176
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:07,090
Okay? So make sure
you keep your elbows tight

177
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,426
when you're going in for the clench.

178
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:13,012
Okay. Pair up and practice.

179
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:16,649
Hey.

180
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:19,068
- Hey.
- God, what an awesome surprise.

181
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,353
You're looking fierce.

182
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,938
- Do you want to help with some demos?
- No.

183
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,773
I'd love to, but I'm actually here

184
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:25,742
with some pretty serious news.

185
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,411
I saw him today.

186
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,664
Down by the marina. He got away.

187
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,765
Um, come here.

188
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,698
Um...

189
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,622
Like him, him?

190
00:09:39,624 --> 00:09:41,624
Yeah.

191
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,927
He's dead. We saw the explosion.

192
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,788
I don't know how, but... it was him.

193
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:50,407
Look, we're gonna be all
over this, I promise you that,

194
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,543
but it might be good if you hang
at the station till we get him.

195
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,795
If he thinks the heat's back on,

196
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:58,123
and he knows you can I.D. him...

197
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,959
It's just better to play it safe.

198
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:04,471
Yeah, of course.

199
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,507
- Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.
- Okay.

200
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,227
Wendy.

201
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,090
- Hey.
- Hey, Hondo.

202
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,949
- I thought your team was down today.
- Oh, we are.

203
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,479
I just came in to help Luca
with something. Listen, um...

204
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,193
I know Buck's been coming to see you

205
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,494
ever since the Raymont Harris shooting.

206
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:25,133
I'm just wondering
if he's doing all right lately.

207
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:26,175
I'm a little worried about him.

208
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,831
Well, the whole doctor/patient thing

209
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,833
keeps my lips pretty tight,
but I am getting concerned.

210
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:31,285
He was doing great,

211
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:33,420
then he missed his last
two therapy sessions.

212
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:34,455
Did he give you a reason?

213
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,373
Nope. He, uh, didn't cancel them.

214
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,176
He just didn't show up.
Haven't heard a word from him.

215
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:41,595
I was actually gonna ask you about him.

216
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,881
All right, thanks.
Will you let me know if he calls?

217
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,178
If you promise to do the same.

218
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,301
- Of course.
- Okay.

219
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:50,971
"You need to change your tune, lady,

220
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:53,051
before somebody gets hurt, like you."

221
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,643
Hmm. Where was this, exactly?

222
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,778
- Right here on my desk.
- Last week,

223
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,813
your car gets vandalized,
now you're getting threats.

224
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:01,315
You pissed a lot of people off

225
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,233
with that police accountability proposal.

226
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:05,953
No address, just my name on the envelope.

227
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,404
Someone delivered it personally.

228
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,156
Well, you were off yesterday,

229
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:10,708
so it was someone
who swiped into the building

230
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,909
in the last 36 hours.

231
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:13,627
Hard to believe one of our officers

232
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,080
would stoop to an anonymous threat.

233
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:16,463
I don't want to tell you
I told you so, but...

234
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:17,548
Sounds like you just did.

235
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,632
I'm gonna get threat management

236
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,000
to launch an investigation.

237
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:22,670
Meanwhile, I want
an R-100 security detail

238
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,024
shadowing you around the clock.

239
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:26,294
Sir, I'd like the chance
to address our teams first.

240
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:28,225
You already got a target
on your back, Jessica; you go

241
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:30,171
barking at the troops, you're
only gonna make it bigger.

242
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,312
I'm not asking you
to hold up the investigation.

243
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:34,848
Just keep things quiet
until the end of today.

244
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:39,019
All right, I don't want you leaving
the building without an escort.

245
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:41,155
I'm not taking any chances with this.

246
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,406
Understood.

247
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:50,197
Hey. I hope it's cool, I brought a guest.

248
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,282
This young lady is always welcome.

249
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:55,683
Keri, oh, how you doing?
I'm digging the new look.

250
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:58,505
Yeah, not after the same kind
of attention I used to be, so...

251
00:11:58,507 --> 00:11:59,840
Figured she'd be safer here with us.

252
00:11:59,842 --> 00:12:02,543
- Of course.
- So, you get with Detective Rose?

253
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,261
Yeah, yeah, but he's
stretched pretty thin,

254
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:05,929
so for the moment, we're flying solo.

255
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:07,765
What? How-how is this not a priority?

256
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,883
Once we get something solid, it will be.

257
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,468
Okay, you get anything off the plate?

258
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,353
Well, the license links to a bunk car.

259
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,045
It was impounded months ago.

260
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,274
But Rose plugged me into
his vehicle tracking system,

261
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:18,642
and I think I might have something.

262
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:19,860
All right, this system's pretty dope.

263
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:21,061
City's got cameras all over

264
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,063
that automatically record license plates.

265
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,822
- Like hidden cameras?
- Cameras in squad cars,

266
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:25,983
traffic cams,

267
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,868
those little parking ticket carts.

268
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,703
If you plug in a plate number
and a time frame,

269
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,822
the system will tell you
anywhere that car was recorded.

270
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:33,407
So I plugged in the plate Luca gave me,

271
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:35,325
and it actually came up a half
a dozen times this morning,

272
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,494
but it went silent an hour ago.

273
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:40,247
It was last tagged on a side
street in North Hollywood.

274
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,416
That means it's got to be parked
somewhere close by, then, right?

275
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,551
If the car's still moving, the
system should pick it back up.

276
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,503
Well, great. Let's call Rose.
Let's go get him, man.

277
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,806
Hey, Luca, slow down.
We got to get eyes on this guy

278
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:51,258
and be 100 it's him
before we go back to RHD.

279
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,594
I am a hundred.

280
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,580
All right, let's go get him.

281
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:01,844
Keri, is it cool if you
chill here for a bit?

282
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:05,118
- Yeah. Is it okay if I use your gym?
- Knock yourself out.

283
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:12,663
You know, Luca, that's quite an eye
you got, spotting him after so long,

284
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,198
especially when we all
thought he was dead.

285
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,532
No, I never thought that.

286
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:16,997
How come you're so sure about this?

287
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,920
Hondo, I had this guy's sketch
on my fridge for two years.

288
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:21,421
I'd know his face anywhere.

289
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:22,756
I would've put it up at Street's place

290
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,541
if he wasn't so touchy about his pad.

291
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:27,094
He's not an easy guy to live
with, by the way, trust me.

292
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,462
Oh, he's the pain-in-the-ass
roommate, not you?

293
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,297
Wait a minute. You're still
bunking at Street's?

294
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:32,216
- Yeah.
- Oh, I got to buy that kid a beer.

295
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:34,218
- He just set a new record.
- He plays like

296
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,519
he's done with it, but I don't think

297
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:36,887
he really wants me to leave.

298
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,274
How'd you find Keri so fast?

299
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:41,942
We keep in touch.

300
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:45,112
You know, I mean, we were both
pretty rattled after that night.

301
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:46,613
Changed her life.

302
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,895
Took that poor girl's dreams away.

303
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:52,190
Sometimes it's good
to talk to each other.

304
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,122
You know that bastard made her watch

305
00:13:55,124 --> 00:13:56,657
as he tortured the other guy?

306
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:59,293
He told Keri the only way that he'd stop

307
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,745
is if she killed the guy herself.

308
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:06,717
There. That's the car!

309
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:15,592
This is Sergeant Harrelson, requesting
assistance with a suspicious vehicle.

310
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:25,014
That you, Lance?

311
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:28,142
Stop playing around. You're late enough.

312
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,192
Wha...?

313
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:34,761
Guessing neither of you is Lance.

314
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:36,384
We're Metro SWAT. Who's Lance?

315
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,248
The-the guy I'm waiting to shoot.

316
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,700
Is he a big guy? Drives a gray SUV?

317
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:41,752
No, he's pretty and broke.

318
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:43,203
He drives an old beater.

319
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:45,505
He's also two hours late
and not answering calls.

320
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:46,790
He's not answering his phone?

321
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,042
Even his agent can't find him,
which is weird,

322
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,627
'cause nobody at his level
ignores their agent.

323
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,846
Right?

324
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,600
Name's Lance Roy.
I need a 20 on his cell phone,

325
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,719
personal vehicle,
whatever you can get me.

326
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,804
Guy must've seen me
clock him at the park,

327
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:02,389
ditched his ride to be safe.

328
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:05,058
Yeah, but not his plan
to snatch another victim.

329
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,277
Probably tracking this
Lance guy for weeks.

330
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,813
I'll bet he was in that yoga class.

331
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:11,531
The killer knew he'd be here, too,

332
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,984
so he kidnapped him in his own car.

333
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:17,738
You hear that?

334
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,706
Yeah.

335
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:31,335
- Luca.
- Yeah.

336
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:36,723
Yep, that's his agent.

337
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:42,630
I'm really starting to
wish you weren't right about this.

338
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:44,761
Yep, you and me both.

339
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,693
Any idea what this is all about?

340
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:56,759
No idea. But seems pretty major.

341
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,834
Luca told us what's up
with that psycho resurfacing.

342
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,361
Yeah. We want to help.

343
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:02,037
All of us. I knew you would.

344
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,423
I'll bring you all up to speed
when whatever this is wraps up.

345
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:05,841
Listen up!

346
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:07,560
Thank you for coming in,

347
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,847
especially those who were
scheduled to have the day off.

348
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:13,732
Unfortunately, we're here to discuss
the actions of someone in this unit.

349
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:17,186
This morning, Captain Cortez
found a letter on her desk

350
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:19,355
posing an anonymous threat to her safety.

351
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:22,158
Captain Cortez would like
to address you directly.

352
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,659
Captain.

353
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,865
Many of you don't agree with my recent
police accountability proposals,

354
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,333
and that's fine.

355
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:33,891
But first, I had my tires slashed,

356
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,255
and now I've been personally threatened.

357
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,374
I became a police officer

358
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,509
because I believe
in what that stands for.

359
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,045
I know most of you feel the same.

360
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:46,966
Most of you would have no tolerance
for something like this.

361
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:48,350
So here's my offer:

362
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:50,803
if the person who wrote
the letter comes forward

363
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:54,640
in the next hour,
we talk this out, one on one.

364
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:56,225
If not,

365
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,894
it becomes a criminal investigation.

366
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,569
Nobody liked those proposals,
but this is a disgrace.

367
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:08,487
Thought the captain handled herself well.

368
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,623
More tolerant than I would've been.

369
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,160
A threat from inside SWAT?

370
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:16,896
This is crazy.

371
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:19,798
You don't pull a stunt like that and
get to call yourself an officer.

372
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,917
You imagine what Buck would say?

373
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,087
He'd be the first one
wanting to swing the ax.

374
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,755
Have you heard from him lately?

375
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:30,392
Uh, we caught a pay-per-view
fight a couple weeks back.

376
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:32,811
- Why?
- No, it's probably nothing.

377
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:34,577
I stopped by his place,
but it looked like

378
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,982
he hadn't been there in a while.
He's not returning any calls.

379
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:39,068
- You try Long Beach?
- What's in Long Beach?

380
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,769
He's got, like, a couple hangouts there

381
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,988
he heads to when he wants to unplug.

382
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,573
That's mostly where I used to see him.

383
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:46,275
I just saw something
that's got me worried.

384
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,444
I think he might be having
some type of financial trouble.

385
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,029
Do you mind trying to find him?

386
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:51,030
Make sure he's all right?

387
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:52,531
Yeah, of course. Anything for Buck.

388
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,366
Okay.

389
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,953
Hey.

390
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:00,747
You okay?

391
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:03,592
Not exactly the way
I wanted to start my week.

392
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:05,427
Why didn't you tell me?

393
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:07,503
Because that's not who we are now.

394
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,049
Hey. A threat like this could
be really serious.

395
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,468
It's just a cop blowing off steam.

396
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,063
You don't know that.

397
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:16,019
Let me stop by after work
and check up on you.

398
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,607
I want to read this letter for myself.

399
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,394
You finally got it.

400
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:23,979
- SWAT eagle.
- Yeah.

401
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,948
I promised myself I would
if I ever made 20-David.

402
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,984
I just... wanted to make sure
I could hold on to the job.

403
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:34,823
Well, I guess you still need to pick
up your stuff from my place anyway.

404
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,041
I'll stop by later tonight.

405
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:37,960
Okay.

406
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:44,466
Trying to make the rest of us
look lazy, or what?

407
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:48,170
Just getting my sweat on.

408
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:50,055
Was that big meeting about our guy?

409
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:53,475
No, it was something else.
Um, we did get some news, though.

410
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:55,844
We think he grabbed someone new.

411
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,831
When? Today?

412
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,148
Couple hours ago.

413
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:04,320
I keep thinking, what if he sped things
up 'cause he saw me this morning?

414
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:07,573
No, Luca, you can't blame yourself.
It's all on him.

415
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,358
I just don't want him
taking another life.

416
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,860
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yeah, maybe.

417
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,037
If you're up for it.

418
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,365
We got your statement from the file,

419
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,201
but I know a lot of times, um,

420
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:21,253
details, they don't come back till later.

421
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,874
And I don't want to make you relive
anything that you're uncomfortable with,

422
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,710
but if you're willing,

423
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,678
we got someone you can sit down with.

424
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:32,464
You never know what you might remember.

425
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:36,602
Okay, Keri, this isn't official.

426
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:37,770
Absolutely no pressure.

427
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:39,722
Just share whatever you can recall

428
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,306
and whatever you're comfortable with.

429
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:43,452
Yeah, of course.

430
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:47,196
Maybe what we should do is start
from when you were first taken.

431
00:19:50,735 --> 00:19:53,786
Um, I was still new here.

432
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,739
I was still trying
to get my face on billboards,

433
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,791
you know, get movie roles.

434
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,411
Now half the time,
I wish I was invisible.

435
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,213
I was coming out of an audition

436
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:06,915
when he stopped me, and he said he was

437
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:10,192
with the casting director and
they needed an extra headshot.

438
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:15,924
Um, I thought that was weird,
but hopefully a good thing.

439
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:17,976
You know, had one in the car, so why not?

440
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:21,680
But when I opened the door,
he pointed a gun at me,

441
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:23,432
uh, told me to get in.

442
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:27,770
Uh, and then he handcuffed
my wrists and ankles,

443
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:29,271
and we drove off.

444
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:31,824
He kept me face down, in the back.

445
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:36,612
And I kept thinking, I should
have fought to get away,

446
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,805
I should have made him shoot me.

447
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,917
But it was too late.

448
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,830
He took me to a place

449
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:48,957
that smelled like... vomit.

450
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,960
There was a another prisoner
there, a man.

451
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:53,679
He was chained to a wall.

452
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,097
There were, um,

453
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,099
half-eaten burritos and-and gas station

454
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:58,517
food wrappers everywhere.

455
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,385
That's all he fed us.

456
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:02,938
He said he'd like to watch me eat,

457
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,432
but that tonight
we'd watch the man die instead.

458
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,562
He, uh, tortured him for hours.

459
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:13,449
I begged him to stop.

460
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:16,535
I'm sorry. I know
none of this is helpful.

461
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:19,002
No, no, no. You don't need to apologize.

462
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:21,073
Your bravery is an inspiration.

463
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:23,158
Thank you.

464
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,494
- You did great.
- Yeah.

465
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,412
You guys being here means a lot.

466
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:29,101
We don't get enough days off as it is.

467
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,456
I was knee-deep in diapers anyway.

468
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,667
Yeah, and if I have to hear about

469
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,502
my Uncle Wiso's plastic
hip one more time,

470
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:35,610
I might just have to break his other one.

471
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:38,474
Well, meanwhile, me and Luca spent
the morning chasing down his hunch.

472
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:40,726
And it turns out, it's a pretty good one.

473
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:43,948
A killer that we thought
was dead is still out there.

474
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,349
Now, we got to do whatever we can to find
this guy before he takes another life.

475
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:49,351
Did you get anything
off the SUV he ditched?

476
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:51,235
Forensics is swabbing
for DNA and fingerprints,

477
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:52,688
but that's gonna take some time.

478
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,239
Meanwhile, we think
the killer might be using

479
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:57,109
a 2001 CR-V registered to a Lance Roy.

480
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:58,777
Now, this Lance, he's good kid.

481
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,496
He was a volunteer firefighter
back in Iowa

482
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:01,997
before he decided to come to Hollywood

483
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,916
and try to be somebody in the biz.

484
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:05,951
Now, his car has no GPS,
and the plate tracker

485
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:07,336
hasn't dinged since this morning.

486
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:08,420
Anything else to go on?

487
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:10,829
I tracked the suspect's abandoned SUV

488
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,926
for the past two weeks, back
before he knew we were onto him.

489
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:15,210
He was rolling around during the day,

490
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,400
but he was also tagged days and nights

491
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,014
going in and out of Agoura Hills.

492
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,321
- Big area to canvass.
- We know anything about his habits?

493
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,215
Could be a regular
at a coffee shop or at a bar?

494
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

495
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:26,722
- How'd it go with Keri?
- That girl's a rock.

496
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:28,307
Can't imagine what she's been through.

497
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:29,351
What's this?

498
00:22:29,353 --> 00:22:31,977
We think our suspect might live
somewhere in this area. Nice.

499
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:33,529
I got something that might help.

500
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:36,231
Keri said that the guy only
fed the victims junk food

501
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:39,117
from, like, gas stations
or convenience stores.

502
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,094
Well, it's only convenient
if it's close to home.

503
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:08,096
You know, when someone
turns their phone off,

504
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,515
it's usually not code for,
"Hey, come find me."

505
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:13,058
- Maybe I'm just here to bowl.
- Nice shoes.

506
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:22,027
So, uh, how's tricks?

507
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,697
- Everything good?
- Oh, yeah. Never better.

508
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:28,283
Is that why you're bowling
alone in Long Beach?

509
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,369
It's a perk of retirement.

510
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:35,374
So, I see you still suck at this.

511
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:37,342
I had a horrible teacher.

512
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:41,385
Hey, uh, something going
on between you and Hondo?

513
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,765
He said that you're not
returning his calls.

514
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,636
I guess you two are getting on now?

515
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:49,137
Oh, what makes you say that?

516
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:50,973
Well, Hondo's not the kind
of guy to ask for help.

517
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,691
He wouldn't send you to find me
if he didn't trust you.

518
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:56,862
Unless he's just so worried
that he didn't have a choice.

519
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:58,360
Worried about what, exactly?

520
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,565
Just... how you're doing.

521
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,967
If you're getting by.

522
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:06,577
Maybe he thinks you're in
some sort of financial trouble.

523
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,073
There you go.

524
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:15,339
Guess I shouldn't have told him
where I keep the spare key.

525
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:16,999
Well, you disappeared.

526
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,483
Would you rather none of us cared?

527
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:30,846
- So, you want to tell me what happened?
- You bent your wrist.

528
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:36,328
Fine. Um...

529
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,280
So, I had a chunk of money

530
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:41,523
I wanted to be a little bit
more aggressive with.

531
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:43,358
Uh, had a clock on it.

532
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,347
You know, so I, uh...
I found a start-up company,

533
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:48,134
you know, looked promising.

534
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:51,140
I-I took a gamble on it,
and I, uh, I lost.

535
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:53,418
That's-that's the end of the story.

536
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,733
What do you mean it had a clock on it?

537
00:24:55,735 --> 00:24:58,623
You just don't let up, do you?

538
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,175
Somehow you love me for it.

539
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:02,010
I spent my life serving the city,

540
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:05,630
and I undid everything I had
accomplished with a single mistake.

541
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:13,972
Talking about that kid you shot?

542
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:15,640
Raymont Harris.

543
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:19,061
Yeah, I wanted to pay off
his college tuition anonymously,

544
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:20,896
but I-I screwed that up, too.

545
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:24,149
But, hey, I can still bowl a 200.

546
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:31,289
Did I ever tell you about the time

547
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:34,242
my mom shot my dad dead when I was 12,

548
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:36,745
and the arresting officer
sat me down for a little talk?

549
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,246
That where you learned to stick your nose

550
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:40,582
- in other people's business?
- Probably.

551
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:42,050
Anyway, he said something

552
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:44,920
that really, really stuck with me.

553
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:47,540
You're gonna throw my
own words back at me right now?

554
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:50,008
He said sometimes
you get kicked in the teeth,

555
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,977
and it hurts like hell,

556
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:55,018
but life is not about
how many blows you take.

557
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,765
It is about how hard you hit back.

558
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,934
You were a kid back then,
right, and I was a cop

559
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:00,852
who still had a lot of fight in him.

560
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:02,194
Things are different now.

561
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,940
How? You just got to stop
beating yourself up.

562
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,942
You got to get back in the fight.

563
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,944
Look, I appreciate you coming
down here to set me straight.

564
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,612
I do. But I'm just not interested

565
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:12,531
in throwing any more punches, Jimmy.

566
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,999
I'm done.

567
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:16,118
What am I supposed to tell Hondo?

568
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,203
Well, you tell Hondo
to worry about himself.

569
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:20,646
And tell him to worry about the team.

570
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,225
No more scratchers.

571
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:42,428
Hey, 15 stores. I'm out of cash.

572
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,563
You got to play till you win, right?

573
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:47,032
Yeah. Or until you go bankrupt.

574
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,739
Come on, come on, come on.

575
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:57,993
Come on. Damn it.

576
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,294
Everything all right?

577
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:02,130
Yeah. Can't get an even pace.

578
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:04,249
Uh, slow on the bottom, fast on the top.

579
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:05,801
And that's a problem why?

580
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:08,253
They don't roll even,
they don't cook even.

581
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:09,903
It's not calculus.

582
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,757
Like you don't take pride
in your work? What do you need?

583
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,343
Arty, is it?

584
00:27:15,345 --> 00:27:16,978
Yep.

585
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,847
We're hoping you've seen
a customer in here

586
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:20,932
who resembles the man in this sketch.

587
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:22,572
No way.

588
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,319
I knew that dude looked shady.

589
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:25,804
Why do you say that?

590
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:28,356
Because no one who eats like
that is in their right mind.

591
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,358
Guy buys, like, the nastiest food we got.

592
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,697
- Almost takes pleasure in it.
- Do you know his name?

593
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:34,696
Nah. Doesn't talk much,
always pays in cash.

594
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:35,914
Why? What'd he do?

595
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:38,432
We're gonna need to see
your security footage.

596
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:42,537
That's him.

597
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,006
His hair was different,
and he had a beard then,

598
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:48,009
but I'd know his eyes anywhere. 100%.

599
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:49,473
Thanks, Miss Sims.

600
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:52,597
Hey, I'll catch up with you
in a minute. Okay.

601
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,301
Our software matched the image
from the security cam

602
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:57,969
to the DMV records

603
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:00,305
of an electrical engineer,
Martin Harwell.

604
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,274
He's been in Portland
for the last two years,

605
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:04,142
but he just moved back
and bought a place in...

606
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:05,497
you guessed it... Agoura Hills.

607
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:07,062
City planner's pulling up
blueprints of the house,

608
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,230
so we know what we're up against.

609
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:09,731
The last time, he had
his place booby-trapped.

610
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:11,066
We should expect more of the same.

611
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:12,784
You guys made fast work
out of finding this guy.

612
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:15,203
You get tired of being shot at,
my unit's always looking.

613
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:16,571
We're more about "go get 'em"
than "whodunit,"

614
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:17,906
so how about we go get him?

615
00:28:17,908 --> 00:28:19,407
I'm rushing the warrant. Won't be long.

616
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:21,209
Long before what?

617
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,161
I'll bring you up to speed.
Luca, go get geared up.

618
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:25,163
Have the rest of the team
meet us on site.

619
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:26,265
You got it, man.

620
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,917
Street.

621
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,970
Hey. Did you find Buck?

622
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,589
Yeah.

623
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:37,893
That money he lost,
he wanted it to be a gift

624
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:39,644
for the kid that he shot.

625
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:42,097
He's trying to make
things right, I guess.

626
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,149
That guilt's gonna eat him up alive.

627
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:47,235
But I think I know something
that could help. It's just...

628
00:28:47,237 --> 00:28:48,436
it's delicate.

629
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:50,522
Is there anything I can do?

630
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:53,174
Yeah. Get Buck in here at
the end of the shift, all right?

631
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,577
- All right. Done.
- Okay.

632
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,045
- No one came forward?
- Nope.

633
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,890
I really thought someone would.

634
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,675
Might have an idea why they didn't.

635
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:30,010
- We pulled a print off the envelope.
- And?

636
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:32,012
We should talk about how to proceed.

637
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:33,338
It could get messy.

638
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:44,892
Hey. What's going on here?

639
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:48,245
We pulled a print off the envelope
containing a threat to Captain Cortez.

640
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:51,866
Your wife's prints were in the system
from volunteer work she did with kids,

641
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:53,734
and she was here at H.Q. yesterday

642
00:29:53,736 --> 00:29:55,035
to drop something off for you.

643
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:56,670
Wait, you're not saying...

644
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:00,554
Oh, Val. Please tell me
you didn't write that letter.

645
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:02,671
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

646
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:04,453
But you weren't going to say anything,

647
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:06,155
and I think it's important that she knows

648
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:08,074
- how the officers really feel.
- And you thought

649
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:10,293
threatening me was the best way
to communicate that?

650
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:11,627
Your proposal makes it easier

651
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:13,713
to prosecute cops for doing their job.

652
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:15,121
You're threatening them.

653
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:17,133
My proposal says cops should be held

654
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:19,585
to the same standard
as the citizens they protect.

655
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:21,381
Which is totally fair.

656
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,339
It's just, it's not what we all felt

657
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:24,390
when we first heard about it.

658
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:26,647
It kind of felt like you were

659
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:29,595
making it harder on cops
instead of criminals.

660
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,241
Anyway,

661
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:35,184
a group of us got together,
and we hit the bar

662
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,459
and got pretty riled up about it.

663
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,817
Riled up enough to vandalize
the captain's vehicle last week?

664
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:41,524
I don't know anything about that.

665
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:44,827
But I was still upset when I got home.

666
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,697
Said a lot of things to Val
that I probably shouldn't have.

667
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:50,449
- All of them true.
- Val. Please.

668
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,752
I was never gonna follow through
on anything in that letter.

669
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:54,537
I was just trying to make a point.

670
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,289
So, Captain,

671
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,924
how do you want to handle this?

672
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:06,599
Watching someone you love head
into danger every single day

673
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,217
must be incredibly difficult.

674
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:10,080
And you think I'm increasing that danger,

675
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:12,054
so I understand why you wrote the letter.

676
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:15,524
But everything I do is meant
to keep our officers safe.

677
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,893
And anonymous threats
are not the way to make me

678
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:20,196
change my mind on how to do that.

679
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,380
I'm not looking to do more damage here.

680
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:26,405
If you promise me
our differences won't be

681
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,931
a problem in the future,
I'm happy to let this go.

682
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:30,455
They won't.

683
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,369
I promise.

684
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,170
Okay, well, I'm glad we made peace here,

685
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:38,372
but this is a criminal offense,
and crimes have consequences.

686
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,507
We can't just pretend
like this didn't happen.

687
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,843
Well, consequences, sure, but
can't we keep it in the family?

688
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:44,678
Well, if we're gonna enforce the law,

689
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,097
we also have to follow it, Sergeant.

690
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:55,438
Sir.

691
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:00,110
Wake up!

692
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:04,481
We're just getting started.

693
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,328
May I help you?

694
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,747
Yeah, I'm with Water and Power.

695
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:21,382
We've, uh, we've had
some outages in your area.

696
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:23,500
My power is fine.

697
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:26,136
Yeah. Just the same, I'd like to walk
your property and inspect the lines.

698
00:32:26,138 --> 00:32:27,917
Should only take a minute.

699
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,774
Uh, I'm sorry. Now's not a good time.
Can you come back tomorrow?

700
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:33,343
Uh, suit yourself, but, uh,
w-we're gonna have to cut power

701
00:32:33,345 --> 00:32:35,276
while we run some tests on the system.

702
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:37,147
Should only take a couple minutes.

703
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:42,436
Fine. But could you make it
quick, please? Thank you.

704
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:44,571
Okay, thank you. And I'm gonna
leave a comment card here

705
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:46,240
by the gate, so you can let my boss know

706
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:48,942
that you're satisfied with my service.

707
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:52,996
We got two minutes to get in before the
power restores and we trigger the alarm.

708
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:56,612
Cut the power in three, two, go.

709
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:01,492
Shall we continue?

710
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:30,924
If this guy sticks to his M.O.,
we got two live hostages inside.

711
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,801
And one of them is running
out of time quick.

712
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,250
Remember, this guy's

713
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:36,815
deep into security tech. He's probably
got some surprises waiting for us.

714
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:38,518
Might have more C4 on him.

715
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,314
If you see something, you alert the team

716
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:42,355
and we pull back.

717
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,118
We're in.

718
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:18,813
Well, I guess he knows we're here.

719
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:20,280
- Any sign of explosives?
- Negative.

720
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:23,700
No, but we got a Burglar Bomb
shooting tear gas from the wall.

721
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:25,485
Luca, pass me the Hooligan.

722
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,241
All right, we got a reinforced door.

723
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:32,992
Preparing an explosive breach right now.

724
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:35,495
Roger. We got a door to work, too,
but I think we can pop it.

725
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,722
Down here! Help!

726
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:53,096
- Left side clear.
- Right side clear.

727
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:54,648
Where is he?

728
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,516
He's-he's behind there.

729
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,159
Tan, stay ready.

730
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:07,327
Loosen them up.

731
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:11,248
I got you. I got you.
You're gonna be okay.

732
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,368
All right, stay calm.

733
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,548
You're good. You're good.

734
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,037
- I got you. I got you.
- Come on. Come on.

735
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,673
Easy. All right.

736
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:25,516
Found the C4.

737
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:26,895
Copy that. Pull back.

738
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:28,642
Victims are secure.
Let's get out of here.

739
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,435
I'm not letting this guy walk again.

740
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:32,519
Luca, I repeat.

741
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:34,130
Pull back! That's an order!

742
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,237
Luca!

743
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:05,585
No!

744
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:08,505
Why'd you do it?!

745
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:10,885
Why?! Why?!

746
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:12,201
Luca.

747
00:37:13,512 --> 00:37:17,180
Luca! Come on, man.

748
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:27,953
Target is secure.

749
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:43,315
Hey. I was just coming to find you.

750
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,317
I zonked out on Wendy's couch
for a while.

751
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:47,319
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

752
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:48,607
Did you get him?

753
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:50,739
We got him, for good this time.

754
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:52,958
- And the guy he took?
- He's safe and sound.

755
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:58,798
Along with another victim that we found

756
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,317
in that sicko's basement.

757
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,514
They're-they're both pretty shook up,
but physically they're gonna be okay.

758
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:05,277
I'd like to meet them.

759
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:06,685
Let them know they're not alone.

760
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,910
Yeah, of course. Come on.

761
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,691
You did good, now.

762
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:15,772
I got Hicks to drop the charge
from criminal threat to harassment.

763
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:17,644
Might hurt your pocketbook,
but no jail time.

764
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:18,895
Thank you, Captain.

765
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,413
I can't tell you what that means to me.

766
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:22,315
As long as you're here, anything
else you'd like to discuss?

767
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,230
- No, ma'am.
- Concerns about the proposal?

768
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:26,820
This whole thing has opened my eyes.

769
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:27,997
A lot.

770
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,166
Thank you, Rocker.

771
00:38:39,842 --> 00:38:41,751
I heard about the letter.

772
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,303
I'm glad it didn't become more serious.

773
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:44,861
Me, too.

774
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:47,807
So, I guess I, uh,
I don't need to stop by.

775
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:51,010
I'll see you tomorrow.

776
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,432
I still need to get you your stuff.

777
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,602
I can meet you somewhere in
between our places tomorrow.

778
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,522
That's fine.

779
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,494
Good night.

780
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:13,199
Ah, there he is. My future Bruin.

781
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:15,752
Ah, UCLA, baby.

782
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,537
You did the damn thing, man.

783
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:19,622
Congrats. I'm so proud of you.

784
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,457
Thanks. I'm pretty excited.

785
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,926
Well, you should be.

786
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,427
- You want a water?
- Yeah.

787
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,545
All right.

788
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,881
So, listen, kid.

789
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:29,642
I had you come down here...

790
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,186
'cause I want to ask you something.

791
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:36,523
It's really important.

792
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:38,391
All right.

793
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:41,227
The officer who shot you, Buck,

794
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:43,696
he was like a mentor to me coming up.

795
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:45,398
Raymont, he was a damn good cop

796
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,951
and he did a lot of great
things for this city.

797
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:50,036
Okay. What's that got to do with me?

798
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,654
He's suffering right now.

799
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,207
He can't seem to let go of his mistake.

800
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:56,910
And I'm supposed to help him out
with that or something?

801
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,964
I was hoping you might
be willing to meet him.

802
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,666
Let him look you in the eye
and tell you he's sorry.

803
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,134
He doesn't need to do that.

804
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,170
I'm moving on. He should do the same.

805
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,222
I wish it was that easy, kid.

806
00:40:09,224 --> 00:40:11,925
I understand that you've done a
whole lot of suffering over this

807
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:14,477
and I'm so proud of you
for how you bounced back.

808
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,482
I wouldn't be asking you to do
this if it wasn't important.

809
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,753
I didn't deserve to get shot.

810
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,466
No, you did not.

811
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:24,655
And I'm not excusing his mistake.

812
00:40:26,054 --> 00:40:28,471
But Buck is a thoughtful man.

813
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,027
It's why this whole thing
is eating him alive.

814
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:35,448
Look, if it makes you too
uncomfortable, I get it. It's cool.

815
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,419
All I got to do is meet him?

816
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:40,870
Just hear him out

817
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,839
and see where it goes from there.

818
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:45,508
Raymont, the greatest thing
that we can do for someone

819
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,710
who wronged us is to forgive them.

820
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:53,099
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

821
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:54,634
I mean, I thought I was, uh,

822
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:56,303
I was ready for this, but I don't know.

823
00:40:56,305 --> 00:40:59,555
Hey, how many times
growing up did you tell me,

824
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,608
"Always face your fears"?

825
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,227
Yeah, I didn't think
you were ever listening.

826
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,655
I was.

827
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,948
Now it's your turn.

828
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,681
Got someone here who wants to meet you.

829
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:16,539
Now, listen to me,
I don't, I don't want to do this

830
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,740
if you pressured him into it.

831
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:18,875
I don't, I don't want... Hondo...

832
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,543
Buck. Buck.

833
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:23,296
He wants it and you need it.

834
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,748
Come on.

835
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:27,967
Okay.

836
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,388
Raymont, come on in.

837
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:33,923
Hey.

838
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,258
I'm Buck Spivey.

839
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,901
Raymont Harris.

840
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,904
Can we, uh, sit down, talk?

841
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:04,663
You sure that kid's ready for this?

842
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,982
He's a tough kid.

843
00:42:08,303 --> 00:42:10,303
And Buck has a way of
putting people at ease

844
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,679
and bringing out the best in them.

845
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:17,100
Yeah. Yeah, I might know
a thing or two about that.

846
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:36,626

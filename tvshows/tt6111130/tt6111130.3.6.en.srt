1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,290
- <i>Previously on SWAT...</i>
- Is Jim Street single?

2
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:12,969
Aren't you worried it could get
a little messy with your dad?

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,165
Maybe if I was 16 and it was
still any of his business.

4
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:16,929
So you want me to find out?

5
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:18,081
Are you still off the dating apps?

6
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:19,845
I'm done with the hustle.

7
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:22,892
I'm just gonna let life
come to me from now on.

8
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,565
Now, imagine these culinary
treats could come to you

9
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:25,851
wherever you are...

10
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:26,939
Like a delivery service.

11
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,419
No, better. Food truck.

12
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:30,552
This could be, like,
a team investment, man.

13
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,858
Do you remember the day
your father left us?

14
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:36,166
And you went running down
the street after him, crying.

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,646
The X-rays we did on your lungs

16
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,082
show an abnormal mass
right here.

17
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:40,649
So lung cancer.

18
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,216
I want to do
a biopsy immediately.

19
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,131
I ain't doing no operation.

20
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:46,065
If you don't want to get
that biopsy, it's your life.

21
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,328
Don't let it be because you
think you deserve this cancer,

22
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:49,484
'cause, Pop, you don't.

23
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,094
I got a daughter
who I miss every day,

24
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:52,332
and she won't even speak to me.

25
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:53,594
I just don't feel like
fighting anymore.

26
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,011
I get Winnie to sit down

27
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,099
with you after 30 years,

28
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,318
then you get that biopsy.

29
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,059
Is that a deal?

30
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,159
Give me all your money!...!

31
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,422
Hondo.

32
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:17,120
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

33
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:19,775
What are you doing in Vegas?
You got a work thing here?

34
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,274
I can't just come visit
my big sister?

35
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,083
Well, sure you can.

36
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,017
You gonna stand there,
or you gonna give me a hug?

37
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,106
- How about we wait till you take a shower?
- How about no?

38
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,784
- No. Come here.
- I'm just... Come on.

39
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,133
Okay.

40
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,569
Okay, that's enough,
that's enough.

41
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,093
Now, girl, you know better.

42
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,399
You can't be out here
jogging in earbuds.

43
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:36,724
Somebody could
come up behind you.

44
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:38,141
What if I was really a mugger?

45
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:40,274
Then I would've
whupped your ass.

46
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:41,840
You mean drown me
in your sweat maybe.

47
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:44,104
It's Vegas. It's the desert.

48
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,628
And this body is not gonna stay
in shape by itself anymore.

49
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,717
Yeah, I see.

50
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,173
Why didn't you let me
know you were coming?

51
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,633
I would've got the
spare room ready.

52
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:54,157
I left you a couple of messages.
You never hit me back.

53
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,638
You know, between my... my
work schedule at the casino

54
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,292
and your saving the world,

55
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,207
I didn't know when we'd
both be awake to talk.

56
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,733
You're not here to
lose money on blackjack

57
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,170
or for brother/sister
hang time, are you?

58
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:09,694
Wish I was.

59
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,957
Look, if this is about Dad,
I don't want to hear it.

60
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,481
Winnie, it is about Dad.

61
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:14,960
No.

62
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,397
He really needs to see you.

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,399
No.

64
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,401
He's about to have
surgery, Winnie.

65
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,054
For what?

66
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,319
Cancer.

67
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,235
Now, they still got to do
a biopsy to see how bad it is,

68
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:29,758
but Pops has cancer.

69
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:33,022
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

70
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:35,155
I am, but...

71
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,374
but he's got another daughter.

72
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,159
With a different mother,

73
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,161
who he poured all his love into.

74
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,033
She can do the hand holding now.

75
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,339
He's got regrets.

76
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,384
Enough regrets
that he doesn't think

77
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,994
he deserves to beat this thing.

78
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,346
Well, maybe he doesn't.

79
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,217
Come on, Winnie,
just hear me out.

80
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,611
Please.

81
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:58,613
Look, the man is stubborn.

82
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,398
We know where
you got it from, at least.

83
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,226
Look, I'm not here
to cause you any grief.

84
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,185
And you ain't got
no obligations.

85
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,186
But he's scared.

86
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,884
He's really scared.

87
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,277
He only agreed to the biopsy

88
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,200
if I was able to bring
the family back together.

89
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:16,108
See, that's not fair, Hondo.

90
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,328
You and I made a pact, remember?

91
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,460
When he abandoned us.

92
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:22,071
Yes, abandoned us

93
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:25,335
and Mom
to start some new family.

94
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,382
You and I swore we were never
gonna talk to him again.

95
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,340
That was a long time ago.
We were kids.

96
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,864
Well, I kept my promise
for 30 years.

97
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:34,649
Why should I break it now?

98
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,216
Because this might be
your only chance

99
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,130
to get all this
off your chest to him.

100
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:42,222
And because I'm not asking you
to forgive him, just see him.

101
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,923
And because I am here
asking you to.

102
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:51,448
I got to go to work tomorrow.

103
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,798
The casino would shut down
if you called in sick

104
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,365
for just a couple of days?

105
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:02,981
Come and get it!

106
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:05,767
Who said there's no such thing
as a free lunch?

107
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,595
Make the most of it.

108
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:10,075
Pretty soon, you're gonna have
to pay full freight for it.

109
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,600
Hey. Where are you two
headed looking so fly?

110
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,645
Protective detail on the
governor. Routine stuff.

111
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,057
She's moderating a
human rights conference.

112
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,258
I actually want to see
a couple of the speakers,

113
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,061
- especially Amina Abadi.
- Hey, we still got...

114
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,043
investment opportunities
in the food truck,

115
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,044
if you're interested.

116
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,263
Yeah? How much?

117
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,352
Five grand a share.
It's a total steal, man.

118
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,092
- Five thousand?
- Yeah.

119
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,853
You could book a surfing
trip to Hawaii for that.

120
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,313
Taste this and you'll be happy...

121
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,836
going camping in your backyard, man.

122
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,447
Yo, I thought we had enough investors.

123
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,013
No offense, Rocker.

124
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:38,060
Yeah, didn't we all
put in together, like, 30 grand?

125
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,342
Yeah, I figure
with five grand more,

126
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,473
we can get those
top-of-the-line broilers

127
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,847
to go with that oven
that Tan kicked in.

128
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,458
Increase our profits
by, like, 15%.

129
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,895
Okay, and did you run this by
everyone who owns a stake?

130
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,331
I thought you trusted me.

131
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,526
Come on, this is
gonna be awesome.

132
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,899
I just bought the vehicle.

133
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,596
A little outfitting,
and we are gonna take

134
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,511
the L.A. food truck scene
by storm, man.

135
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,733
You ever, done an escape room?

136
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:01,605
In real life, sure,
couple times.

137
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,346
Never recreationally.

138
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,750
A new one just
opened up in Venice.

139
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,349
A few friends and I
are going later.

140
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:07,829
Could use an extra player.

141
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,919
And, no SWAT skills
necessary, just your brain.

142
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,964
So we don't
use our brains on SWAT?

143
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,271
No, that's not what I meant.

144
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
You want to come?

145
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,187
Tonight? Yeah.

146
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,362
Yeah. Sure.

147
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,059
- Okay, I'll text you the address.
- Okay.

148
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,322
- See you there.
- Yeah.

149
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,107
What's happening with Molly?

150
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,891
We're meeting up later.

151
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:28,826
- We're gonna do this escape room thing.
- Like a date?

152
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,349
No, no, her friends
are gonna be there.

153
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,090
You sure the boss's daughter
doesn't think it's a date?

154
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,394
You better find
out quick, playa.

155
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,986
All right, we got
to go. Come on.

156
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,207
Those are for potential investors.

157
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,514
Hey, minimum five grand investment, okay?

158
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,342
Gonna see profits in, like, six months.

159
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,323
What, do they think this is
a salvage yard or something?

160
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,131
Hey, that's our baby!

161
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,917
I'm thinking of naming her
Wilhelmena.

162
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,052
Luca, is this the food truck
we invested in?

163
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,141
Look, I said she'd need
a little outfitting,

164
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:00,945
but I got her for a steal
at the police auction.

165
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,319
You paid real money for this?

166
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,973
Why'd the cops impound it?

167
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,409
Let's just say that

168
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,585
they were selling more than
soft serve out of here.

169
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,108
What, selling weed?

170
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,501
Coke?

171
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,068
Meth.

172
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,175
Were they cooking meth in here?

173
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,157
Look, that's all in the past.

174
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,637
All right? A little cleanup,

175
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,769
and Wilhelmena is gonna be
the best thing to happen

176
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,771
to our profit margins, trust me.

177
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,382
No cook here.

178
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,601
No, not right now, but wait
till I get it cleaned up.

179
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:26,211
Hey, where you going, man?

180
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,388
- I thought you were gonna invest.
- Nice try.

181
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,431
Rocker!

182
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,522
All right.

183
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,568
Man, you're missing out.

184
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,528
I'm so honored to be here

185
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,138
to share my story.

186
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,531
A year ago,

187
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:44,186
men came to my home
in the middle of the night

188
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:45,448
and took me away.

189
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,537
I was imprisoned
for five months,

190
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:51,193
with no access
to my family or a lawyer.

191
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:55,676
I was beaten,
flogged, sexually abused,

192
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,808
held in solitary confinement.

193
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,245
- My God!
- What was my crime?

194
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:03,379
Along with five friends,
I had dared to protest

195
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,860
the human rights abuses
in my country,

196
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:08,471
as well as the lack
of equal rights for women.

197
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,777
I've been following her story.

198
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,735
She escaped from prison
by dressing as a guard.

199
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,129
Eventually crossed the border
and applied for asylum.

200
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,478
Brave woman.

201
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:18,350
I'm here today to speak
on behalf of my friends,

202
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,265
who are still in prison
back home,

203
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,486
and to ask you to join me
in calling for their release,

204
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,706
as well as an end to the torture

205
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:28,143
of innocent people
whose only crime

206
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:32,495
is seeking equality,
justice and freedom.

207
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,542
Shukrun.

208
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,414
Keep up the good work!

209
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,851
- That was a great speech.
- Thank you.

210
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:43,613
Still getting used to
speaking in public.

211
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,900
And, honestly, I don't know
what good it will do.

212
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,511
They'll listen. They have to.

213
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,208
I love my country.

214
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,036
The West has the
wrong idea of it.

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,125
Many of the people
are kind and generous.

216
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,605
It's only a small minority

217
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,303
who are closed-minded
and prejudiced.

218
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:01,176
But many of them are in power
and do not listen to women.

219
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:03,744
Route's clear. Let's go.

220
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:04,982
Delighted to be here today,

221
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,269
lending our voice
and our support

222
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,663
to the vital work
of human rights campaigners,

223
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,883
both internationally
and locally, who continue

224
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,406
the fight for equality.

225
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,887
Got movement. Your two.
Black cap.

226
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,063
Looks like he might be armed.

227
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,457
Stay with the governor.
All perimeter units, male, 30s,

228
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,241
wearing a black cap
with a possible weapon.

229
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:26,114
The ideal of a democratic
and free society in which

230
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:29,030
all persons live together
with equal opportunities.

231
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:32,163
For many people
in the world today...

232
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,924
Move on him slowly.
Let's not cause a panic.

233
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,298
But we hope that by continuing...

234
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:37,362
He's reaching for something.

235
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:38,648
Gun!

236
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,345
Governor, come with us!

237
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,391
Move, move!

238
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:44,306
Let's go! Let's go!
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

239
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:46,874
Move, move, move, move!

240
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:50,355
Go, go, go!

241
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:01,758
This way. Follow me.

242
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,639
Principal in the safe room.

243
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:13,988
24-David, what's your status?

244
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,077
We lost him.
Keep the governor in a safe room

245
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,185
until we secure the perimeter.
Additional units are en route.

246
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,428
Roger that.

247
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,433
Go, go, go, go.

248
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,869
Amina!

249
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,436
- You hit?
- Yeah, I got my vest on.

250
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,046
I'm okay.

251
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,271
LAPD!

252
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,624
24-David, two suspects.
Armed and dangerous.

253
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,384
They kidnapped Amina Abadi.
They're headed south

254
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,801
in a black SUV.

255
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,582
Appreciate you, doc.

256
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,236
Dr. Chang, 2298.

257
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,238
Dr. Chang, 2298.

258
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:35,069
Hey, Pop.

259
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,418
Look who's here.

260
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,037
Look at you.

261
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,344
How you doing?

262
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,781
As well as to be expected.
I'm about to be sawed in two.

263
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,653
It's a basic procedure, Pop.

264
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,350
Hondo said it's a biopsy.

265
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:57,265
They're taking
a piece of my lung.

266
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,398
I'm so glad you're here.

267
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,097
Thank you.

268
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,683
We're here to help you
get through this, Pop.

269
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,448
You know,
just thinking about that

270
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,277
you might come here today
got me reminiscing.

271
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,889
Do y'all remember
when I used to take you both out

272
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,412
to dinner every Friday night?

273
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,371
We always used to go
to Pup 'N' Taco.

274
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:17,981
Those green chili burritos.

275
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,220
Yeah, we were never allowed
to get the cherry slush, though.

276
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,005
"Y'all ain't gonna go spilling
in my back seat, you hear me?"

277
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,206
That's 'cause it was good vinyl.

278
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,686
And those were good times.

279
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,601
Good times.

280
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:32,343
Shame you had ruin it by leaving
us to start another family.

281
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,605
Winnie.

282
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,956
No, no, it's all right.

283
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,480
Let her go and say
what she want to say.

284
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,178
That's why you're here,
ain't it?

285
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:43,703
Thinks I'm on my death bed,

286
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,139
so time for last shots.

287
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,184
That's not why she's here, Pop.

288
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,229
Then why, then, son?

289
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,360
Because he made me come.

290
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:52,233
Well, ain't nobody
making you stay.

291
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,756
You did your good deed.

292
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,150
Okay.

293
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,562
- No, no. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.
- Stop, Hondo.

294
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,371
Please. Just, please. Pop,

295
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,735
isn't there something you've
been wanting to say to Winnie?

296
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:09,511
I'm sorry for hurting you
back then like that.

297
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,775
And hurting our mother.

298
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,255
And hurting your mother.

299
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,914
Okay.

300
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,916
You've apologized.

301
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,135
I guess we can get back
to our lives now.

302
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,441
Winnie. Winnie.

303
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,443
What the hell you want from me,
I'm just...

304
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,053
Dad? Pop.

305
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,446
- Pop, Pop.
- Dad, are you okay?

306
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:32,929
- Hey!
- Pop, are you all right? Pop?

307
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,947
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- Well, I was just leaving.

308
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,277
Winnie. Winnie, come on. Winnie.

309
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,497
She's stubborn, just
like your mother!

310
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,546
You okay?

311
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,243
- I'm all right, baby.
- Yeah?

312
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,941
Winnie, where are you going?
Come on, now.

313
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,681
Look, Hondo, I tried.

314
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,032
All right? It's not gonna work.

315
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,555
Now, I love you.

316
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,340
I know this is important to you,

317
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,864
but he threw us away.

318
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,823
And you might have
made peace with that,

319
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,912
but I can't.

320
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,394
Sorry.

321
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,951
Governor's pressing us
hard to find Amina.

322
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,803
FBI's running an investigation.

323
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,283
- They know we'll be working the case, too.
- This is on me.

324
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,218
Your job was to keep the
governor safe, and you did that.

325
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,915
I know, but after everything
she's already been through,

326
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,482
- I let them get her.
- She had her own security detail, Chris.

327
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,855
We got to find her.

328
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,509
Okay, Commander Hicks
is in Chicago

329
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,617
leading a tactics seminar,
so we're on our own on this one.

330
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:37,599
What do we know so far?

331
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,775
Victim is Amina Abadi, age 24.

332
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,081
Been agitating for the release

333
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,484
of her friends
in prison back home.

334
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:45,085
The media have dubbed them
the Freedom Five.

335
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,627
It's got to be her government,
trying to shut her up.

336
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:48,479
I've got access to
the NSA surveillance feed

337
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,501
of their consulate and all
their suspected safe houses.

338
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:53,528
- How'd you get that?
- Well, we all have our sources, don't we?

339
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:54,877
So far, no sign of Amina.

340
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,246
- Are there any other suspects?
- Anyone pissed off...

341
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,489
she's talking about
women's rights.

342
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,554
We don't know who kidnapped her
yet. Until we get more intel,

343
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:01,642
we drill down on
every possibility.

344
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,538
Amina's bodyguard's
been brought in.

345
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,603
Hopefully, he saw something
besides the bullet that hit him.

346
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,909
Amina's aunt and uncle
are also on their way in.

347
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,282
They live in L.A.

348
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:09,520
Thought maybe they have ties
to their community here.

349
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,502
Let's go talk to the bodyguard.

350
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,287
I'm Sergeant Harrelson.

351
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,898
You know Officer Alonso.Yeah.
How you doing?

352
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,596
Well, Kevlar saved me. I only
got the wind knocked out of me.

353
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,902
Have you found Amina?

354
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,078
- Not yet.
- I begged her to go into hiding...

355
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,558
until things cooled down.

356
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,995
She insisted on giving
that speech first.

357
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,823
- She's been receiving threats?
- Dozens.

358
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,520
Phone calls late at night,

359
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:32,915
memes posted online
that are just disgusting.

360
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,501
Some troll said that
if she didn't shut up,

361
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:37,528
she was gonna get her throat
cut, acid thrown on her,

362
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:38,852
that her family would be harmed.

363
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,488
You know who's behind
the threats?

364
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:41,837
All anonymous.

365
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,597
I tried tracing them
but couldn't get anywhere.

366
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,580
We'll need to see those files.Sure.

367
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,538
Do you think it's her government
targeting her?

368
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:48,776
The guys that took her
looked military to me.

369
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,952
I mean, they knew
what they were doing.

370
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,040
And the guns they were using,

371
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,544
LWRC, ultra compact...

372
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:55,566
- Same guns their military use.
- You must have been...

373
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,263
pretty close to be able
to I.D. their weapons.

374
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,811
- Point-blank. Hurt like hell.
- We're gonna need ballistics...

375
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:00,943
to take a look at this.

376
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,511
- Be my guest.
- The aunt and uncle are here.

377
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,040
We warned our niece
that this could happen.

378
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,129
We were afraid for her,
but she would not listen.

379
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:16,306
We know Amina had enemies,
got a lot of threats.

380
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,308
She upset many people.

381
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,962
Including the royal family?

382
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,572
Aren't they at the top
of the list?

383
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,096
Things are changing back home,

384
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,098
but it wasn't fast
enough for Amina.

385
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,100
It is still
a very traditional country,

386
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:29,145
and Amina is not traditional.

387
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,365
She rejected the culture
and the religion.

388
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:34,281
Many people did not
take kindly to her words.

389
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,326
We can use your help
finding her.

390
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,155
- Do you have any connections back home who might...
- Home?

391
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,114
This is home.

392
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,550
We are American citizens.

393
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:45,596
My wife and I have been
living here for 26 years.

394
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,381
We raised our family here.

395
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,731
We have few contact
with the kingdom anymore.

396
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,752
How about connections here
in L.A. within your community?

397
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,908
People talk.

398
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,127
People are afraid.

399
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,346
They don't want trouble. Including you?

400
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,609
Trouble has already
found our family.

401
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,700
The longer Amina's gone...

402
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,006
You know how it works, Chris.

403
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,157
We keep scouring the ground,

404
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,183
we'll eventually find
a footprint.

405
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,031
They discover who was
behind the online threats?

406
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,404
No. But I got something better.

407
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,121
Preliminary ballistics says
that the bullet

408
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,383
that hit the bodyguard's vest
was tampered with.

409
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,712
It barely mushroomed.

410
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,386
They think that half
the grain was emptied

411
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,431
before it was fired,
but they're still running tests.

412
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,172
I knew there was something funky
about the impact on that vest.

413
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,937
That caliber round
shot point-blank

414
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,244
should have cratered it,
but it barely made a scratch.

415
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,159
So the kidnappers were firing
nonlethal rounds?

416
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,398
No, they were lethal. The
bullets fired at the conference

417
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,901
were all normal 6.8s.

418
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,183
Every single one of them
should have been deadly,

419
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,532
but they were all fired
above head height.

420
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,210
They weren't aiming
to kill anyone.

421
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,299
And the one that did hit
was tampered with.

422
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:38,234
And it hit the bodyguard
center mass like he stood still

423
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:41,087
with a bull's-eye on his chest.
They were putting on a show.

424
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,697
So he was in on the kidnapping?

425
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,134
Lynch is looking into him now.

426
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,268
Hey, think I should cancel
on Molly tonight?

427
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,375
What do you mean, your date?

428
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,532
- It's not a date.
- Come on, dude.

429
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,751
This is Dominique Luca
you're talking to here.

430
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,319
You telling me
you're not interested?

431
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:57,842
Give me the real, bro.

432
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:00,671
Look, she's smart,
she's gorgeous,

433
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,151
she's a really great person,

434
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,762
but dating
Commander Hicks' daughter?

435
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:05,981
I've had some pretty big

436
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,306
screwups here,
but that would be...

437
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,984
Look, look, look,
it's not the dating part

438
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,222
you need to worry about,
lover boy.

439
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:11,421
It's the breaking up part.

440
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,032
My cousin Amy dated a cop once.

441
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,424
Right? Regular patrol officer.

442
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,773
When the guy broke her heart,

443
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,341
my dad made sure
that he never made detective.

444
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,865
I'm just saying.

445
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,433
Check out Wilhelmena!

446
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,827
Holy crap.
That's what I call a makeover.

447
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,395
If this doesn't make Xiomara
happy, I don't know what will.

448
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,398
Hey. The cleaners found
this under the front seat.

449
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,616
Also said it took them a
while to get the stains

450
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,619
- out of the countertops.
- What do you mean? Rust stains?

451
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,795
Blood. You know someone
got murdered in there?

452
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,232
- For real?
- What?

453
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,774
Yeah. Same crew cleaned up
the crime scene.

454
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,627
- Someone murder?
- No.

455
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,151
Murder truck?

456
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,369
Look, you'd never know.

457
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,849
I mean, they did a great job

458
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:49,416
cleaning it up. It's spotless.

459
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,157
Madre de Dios. Come on. Xiomara.

460
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,420
- No, no, no, no. Give it a chance.
- New truck.

461
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,422
I sunk almost all our money
into this thing.

462
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,119
New truck or new cook.

463
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,253
Xiomara. Come on.

464
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,040
What do you got?

465
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,278
Bodyguard's name
is Zack Willert.

466
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:07,912
Ex-Army Ranger.

467
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,784
Been working close protection
since 2009

468
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,457
and spent the last decade
protecting this guy,

469
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,440
Christopher Wardlow.

470
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,355
- Should I know him?
- He's a property tycoon.

471
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:17,357
Fingers in a load
of construction downtown.

472
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,161
He's behind that new office
building near Skid Row

473
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,585
that looks like an
arthritic pickle.

474
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,014
- And according to my sources...
- What, the secret ones?

475
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,887
No, the Internet... Wardlow
is a major shareholder

476
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,715
in a luxury hotel project
in Amina's homeland

477
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,499
that's currently stalled.

478
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,042
Wardlow's trying to grease palms
with the royal family

479
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,894
by offering Amina
in the place of cash?

480
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,698
- That'd be pretty evil.
- Yeah, but it could be a way...

481
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,332
to get his hotel project
back on track.

482
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,536
What are we waiting for?
Where's this guy Wardlow live?

483
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,905
The SUV in the drive
matches the one Chris saw

484
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,168
driving away from the scene
of the kidnapping.

485
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:47,778
You are good to enter.

486
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,000
Secure the perimeter.

487
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,436
Watch the cross fire.

488
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,068
Access to the NSA's surveillance
feed on the consulate,

489
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:59,529
- how'd you get that?
- Someone I met while hiking Machu Picchu.

490
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,444
It's amazing who I come
into contact with

491
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,880
when I get out in the world.

492
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,411
Camera.

493
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,605
Okay, drone footage shows
something in the pool.

494
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,433
26-David.

495
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:36,566
Body, male.
Looks to be shot in the back.

496
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,134
- Is it Wardlow?
- No, I think it's a security guard.

497
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,484
- Someone got there before us.
- Watch your backs.

498
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,189
Approaching the one-side
entry point.

499
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,042
I got visual on two more bodies.

500
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,244
Look like more guards.

501
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,507
Street.

502
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,293
Ready for entry.

503
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:08,294
Breach on my mark.

504
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,469
Three, two, one.

505
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,253
Go.

506
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,306
There's a blood trail.

507
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,449
Gun!

508
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:39,281
Bathroom clear!

509
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,631
- All clear!
- 30-David to Command.

510
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,937
Two suspects down.

511
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,634
We found Wardlow.
He's been tortured.

512
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,549
He's not looking good.

513
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:49,160
We took down one suspect.
The rest of the house is clear.

514
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:50,336
30-David, we're Code 4.

515
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,381
Okay to bring paramedics in.

516
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,817
- No I.D.'s.
- Where is she?

517
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,428
- Where's Amina?
- Not here.

518
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:56,840
You took her, though.
It was your men

519
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:57,971
who kidnapped her earlier today.

520
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,736
Wasn't a kidnapping.

521
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,522
It was staged. It was a hoax.

522
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,046
What? Why?

523
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,395
Amina was in danger.

524
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:09,050
We thought a fake
kidnapping would...

525
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,922
throw a spotlight on
her friends in jail.

526
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,490
- So she could get away.
- Amina was in on it?

527
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,318
I came up with the plan.

528
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,493
What exactly was your plan?

529
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,321
Fly her to safety.

530
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,888
Get her into hiding.

531
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,325
I was supposed to meet
her and her boyfriend.

532
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:26,285
- Where?
- Garden Avenue Airfield.

533
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,330
- Like, an hour ago.
- Did you tell the shooters...

534
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,723
where you were gonna meet them?

535
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:35,859
I'm sorry.30-David. All units,

536
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:36,991
armed suspects en route

537
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,122
to Garden Avenue Airfield.

538
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,173
Wardlow should be here by now.

539
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:46,740
Something must have happened.

540
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,311
We need to go.

541
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,922
Five more minutes.

542
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,434
They got a 20-minute head start.

543
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,870
- Almost there.
- Every available unit...

544
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:13,070
in the area's en route
to the airfield, plus a bird.

545
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,744
- We figured out who these guys are yet?
- No.

546
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:17,205
How'd the bad guys know
Wardlow was helping Amina?

547
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,835
I'm guessing they bugged
her phone and her e-mails.

548
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,209
- Whoever these guys are, they're not playing.
- We're here!

549
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:33,177
Unis checked the whole place.

550
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,615
We're too late.

551
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,444
Wardlow's in surgery.

552
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,097
They broke his jaw
pulling teeth.

553
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,553
He managed to give us
some intel, though,

554
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:43,231
before they put him under.

555
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:44,469
It turns out he's business
partners with the father

556
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,016
of one of the Freedom Five.

557
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,496
That's why he's been
helping Amina.

558
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,193
Okay. Well, I pulled
everything I could

559
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,412
on Amina's boyfriend.

560
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,196
Name's Kareem Kashani,

561
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,677
human rights director
at a nonprofit in D.C.

562
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:57,811
They've been dating six months.
He flew into LAX this morning.

563
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:00,248
Is there any reason
to think he'd betray her?

564
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,424
Well, his credit card
statement shows he just spent

565
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,383
four months' salary on
a two-carat diamond ring

566
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,297
from Tiffany's, so
I'm thinking not.

567
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,430
I think he was planning
to escape with her.

568
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,171
Think I got something.

569
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,173
Kareem, or someone
using his credit card,

570
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,523
rented a car close to the
airfield about 20 minutes ago.

571
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,395
Okay, they'll have
a tracker in that car.

572
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,397
Already running a trace on it.

573
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,790
Got a fix.

574
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,097
This is 20-David to all
available units.

575
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,926
Respond to the area of Echo Park
for a kidnapping vehicle.

576
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:33,977
50-David, approaching vehicle,
can't see inside.

577
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,458
Be alert. We don't know
who's in that car.

578
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:44,771
Just Kareem. No one else.

579
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:47,382
Where the hell's Amina?

580
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:54,911
So, that's Amina's boyfriend?

581
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:56,435
Yeah. Heard he's refusing
to speak.

582
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,175
- Why?
- Well, he probably thinks...

583
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,544
he's protecting her
by keeping quiet.

584
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,614
So he rented the car
to create a diversion,

585
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,939
thinking the bad guys
would follow him,

586
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:05,269
allowing Amina the
chance to escape.

587
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:07,160
- That's either really romantic...
- Or really stupid.

588
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:09,317
Someone needs to remind this guy
we're trying to help

589
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,666
keep his girlfriend alive.Yeah.

590
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,799
Now, wait a second.

591
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,322
- I know you admire her.
- Yeah, I've been...

592
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,126
reading about her ever since
she first came to the U.S.

593
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,500
Yeah. Me, too. What?

594
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,328
You got to go
through the news section

595
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,069
to get to the sports section,
right?

596
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,549
I read.

597
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,812
I told her the world
would hear her.

598
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,292
But what if it doesn't?
What if it's all for nothing?

599
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:30,662
She stood up for her friends,
for girls and women everywhere,

600
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:32,688
and this might
cost her everything.

601
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,037
You should talk
to the boyfriend,

602
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,561
tell him what you just told me.

603
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:36,736
If anyone can convince him

604
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,346
that we're on their
side, it's you.

605
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,175
Thanks.

606
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,874
Street.

607
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,528
Just heard from Hicks.

608
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,071
He wants you to do
an inventory of the armory.

609
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:49,096
He called from Chicago

610
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:50,924
to assign me inventory duty?

611
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,621
Yeah. Wants it done by tonight.

612
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,536
Hey, you think Hicks found out

613
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,538
about you and Molly
hitting the town?

614
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,409
I'm telling you,
nothing gets past that man.

615
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,344
He's got me counting bullets.
If that's not a warning,

616
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,587
I'd hate to see what is.

617
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:09,899
I'm Chris.
Can I get you anything?

618
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:15,514
I was there this morning
when Amina gave her speech.

619
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,951
We chatted after.

620
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,605
She's an incredible woman.

621
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:22,346
I guess you don't need
me telling you that.

622
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,957
I know you love her,

623
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,612
and you think you're
protecting her,

624
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:29,440
but she's in very real danger
right now.

625
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,878
You need to tell me
where she is.

626
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:35,621
I promised her I wouldn't
betray her to anyone, ever.

627
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,971
Even one person knowing
is one too many.

628
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,973
It's all it takes
to get her killed.

629
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,603
Wardlow's in the hospital,
you know that?

630
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:42,889
They tortured him

631
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,586
until he gave up your location.

632
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,588
But we left before they arrived.

633
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,851
Amina got away.
I made sure of it.

634
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,508
We had a plan.

635
00:25:55,554 --> 00:26:00,907
I know that Amina escaped
from prison back home.

636
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,997
I know that she's brave.

637
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,714
I know that you want to
believe that she's managing

638
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:07,522
on her own out there,
but I'm telling you,

639
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,934
these people either
already have her,

640
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,656
or they're minutes away from it.

641
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,527
So, if you ever want
to see her again

642
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,530
and give her that engagement
ring that you bought her,

643
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,010
you need to talk to me.

644
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:23,799
The Greyhound station.

645
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:25,496
Downtown.

646
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,237
That's where she's heading.

647
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,587
Thank you.

648
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,241
Chris. It's too late.

649
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:38,118
This video was just released
online and to the news stations.

650
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,990
It is with sincerest regrets
that I make my apology

651
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:44,428
to the American people,
as well as to my own countrymen.

652
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:47,431
The kidnapping this morning
was a hoax.

653
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:50,826
As you can see,
I am safe and well.

654
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,568
I made up false claims
and staged my own kidnapping

655
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,006
in order to make it look
like I was in danger,

656
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,401
that my homeland
was responsible for the crimes,

657
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:03,578
- when in fact, it was myself who was guilty.
- This is coerced.

658
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,625
I have been charged with treason
against my country,

659
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,627
a charge that I accept.

660
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,107
I am now returning home where
I will accept my punishment.

661
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:13,675
Treason?
That's a death sentence.

662
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,641
I have been charged with treason
against my country,

663
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,381
a charge that I accept.

664
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:27,080
I am now returning home where
I will accept my punishment.

665
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,302
No.

666
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:35,610
There's no way she recorded this
of her own free will.

667
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,022
We're trying
to track down nationals

668
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:39,527
from Amina's home country
who are in the L.A. area

669
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,660
and loyal to the government,
but it's a slow process.

670
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,270
What else can we do?

671
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,532
Hold up.

672
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,708
- Those are prayer beads, right?
- Yeah.

673
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,971
The aunt had some identical
to them when she came in.

674
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:51,757
Amina's aunt? She was here?

675
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,062
Yes, and her uncle. Why?

676
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,325
Amina doesn't talk
to her uncle or aunt anymore.

677
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:56,718
They had a falling out.

678
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,459
- About what?
- She thought...

679
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,045
because they lived
in America for so long,

680
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,549
that they would
understand her views

681
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,507
and support her protest
against the government.

682
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:04,683
But they didn't.

683
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,641
They tried to convince her
to return home,

684
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,730
pressured her,
even threatened her.

685
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:09,949
She didn't tell the police?

686
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:11,646
Just me.

687
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,605
What you need to understand
about her culture

688
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:17,434
is that faith and family honor
are everything.

689
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,002
Amina speaking out about the
government and criticizing them

690
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,091
brought her extended family
great shame.

691
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:23,614
- They lost face.
- And the only way...

692
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:26,443
to regain face is by
delivering Amina back home

693
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,141
for the leaders to punish her.

694
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,901
So the men who took Amina
were getting paid by her uncle.

695
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,535
Probably mercenaries.

696
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,755
This isn't connected to
their government at all.

697
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,757
We need to get to her
uncle's house now.

698
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,890
Houses. Her uncle
has homes all over.

699
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,414
Bel Air, Palm Springs, New York.

700
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:41,720
Even a yacht.

701
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,678
The airports have her flagged.

702
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,830
The yacht. That's how they're
planning on getting her out.

703
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,987
You just sail into
international waters.

704
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,647
Just talked to the marina.

705
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:57,755
Amina's uncle's trying
to have his boat refueled.

706
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,433
Chris was right.

707
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:00,671
They're trying
to get her out by sea.

708
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:01,914
Looks like they're on the move.

709
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,437
Hondo, you get all that?

710
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,917
Roger that. We're almost there.

711
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,571
- Can the harbormaster stop the launch?
- Hey, Luca,

712
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,530
ask the harbormaster
if he can slow things down.

713
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:11,793
Tell the unis to stand down
until we get there, too.Yep.

714
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,447
Risk to the public's
way too high.

715
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,338
- These guys are trigger-happy.
- What about the Coast Guard?

716
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,253
They're on alert. Will stop
the boat if it hits open water.

717
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,800
Question is, what do they do

718
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,889
to Amina when they see
they're surrounded?

719
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,674
- Two minutes out!
- Okay.

720
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,285
Stay liquid,

721
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:26,808
and let's bring
Amina back alive.

722
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:36,644
Just need a quick signature.

723
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:42,824
Where you headed?

724
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:45,740
LAPD. Show me your hands.

725
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,176
On your knees.

726
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,091
- Get out of here. Move.
- On your stomach.

727
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,353
Move. Get out of here.

728
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:52,051
Down.

729
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,704
On the ground now. Get down.

730
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:55,010
Don't move.

731
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,753
We'll search the boat for Amina.

732
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,148
Stevens, cover.
Deacon, Chris, you're with me.

733
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:24,953
On your feet.

734
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:26,825
On your feet.

735
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,783
Let me see your hands.

736
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,654
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

737
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:36,312
26-David. Found the aunt.

738
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,010
No sign of Amina.

739
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,106
- LAPD!
- Show me your hands.

740
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,498
Hands behind your back.

741
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,675
Where is she?

742
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,894
- What?
- Where's the girl?

743
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,480
- What girl?
- Don't play dumb. Where is she?

744
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,723
We ain't got time for games.

745
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,725
Tell us where Amina is
right now.

746
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,248
I don't know anything
about a girl.

747
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,859
They pay my wage,
I don't ask questions.

748
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,295
What were your instructions?

749
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:04,688
Head out 12 nautical miles,
drop anchor and wait.

750
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:06,821
They said another boat
was gonna meet up with us.

751
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,344
12 miles, international waters.

752
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,713
They must be taking
Amina by speedboat

753
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:10,956
from another launch point.

754
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,150
Somewhere quieter, more private.

755
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:13,567
It's easier than bringing her

756
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,240
on board a yacht
in the middle of the marina.

757
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,981
There's too many people here,
and she could make a scene.

758
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,765
Is there a private launch
or dock somewhere nearby?

759
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,182
The boatyard next door.

760
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,097
- A few private slips.
- Luca, you get that?

761
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,533
Yeah, looking.

762
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:24,926
Coast Guard had to respond to

763
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,208
a fishing boat taking on water.

764
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:27,581
They can't get there.

765
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,584
We don't get to them now,
we've lost her for good.

766
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,852
Pulling into the boatyard now.

767
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,680
Spotted possible target vehicle.

768
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,469
Keep them back! And you, move!

769
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:48,297
Malik's gonna get
away with Amina!

770
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,779
- Jim, cover!
- Street! Tan!

771
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:58,264
Take it, Chris!
I'm gonna try to flank 'em.

772
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,353
Once I get 'em to return fire,
make your move.

773
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,311
Go get Amina back! Stevens!

774
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,971
Let's do this. Cover.

775
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,368
Move.

776
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,416
It's clear.

777
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:29,425
This guy was hit pretty bad.

778
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:30,992
Couldn't have gone too far.

779
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,995
Rabbit in a trap.

780
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,693
Two ways out of this:
surrender or bleed out!

781
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:38,260
What's it gonna be?

782
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,394
We got our answer.

783
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,396
But we can't let him bleed out.

784
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,311
Go. I told you, move it.

785
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:47,835
Drop your weapon!

786
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:50,098
Move! Move! Move! Drop it!

787
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:52,274
- Stay back! Stay back!
- Drop it!

788
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,233
- Let her go!
- Drop your weapon now!

789
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:55,514
I'll kill her, I swear!
Stay back!

790
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,236
Let her go.

791
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,933
Go, go.

792
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:14,383
Hands! Hands now!

793
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:19,474
Let her go.

794
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,569
- On your stomach.
- It's okay.

795
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,330
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Hands behind your back.

796
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,834
Hey, you okay? It's over.

797
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,967
It's over. Hey.

798
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,969
It's okay.

799
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,449
It's over.

800
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:37,754
30-David.

801
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,800
Need an R/A at dock 27.

802
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,291
Chris, just spoke
to the D.A.'s office.

803
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:53,964
They're weighing up
the charges against Wardlow

804
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:55,531
for the hoax kidnapping,
and they don't think

805
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,339
- he'll do any time.
- And what about Amina?

806
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,080
Are they charging her?

807
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:00,188
Apparently,
there's not enough evidence

808
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:01,754
she was involved
in the planning, so no.

809
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:02,866
And no civilians were hurt.

810
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,322
I think they want
to focus on the win.

811
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:06,087
Amina wanted a spotlight.

812
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,349
She got it.

813
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,068
Her friends have been
released from prison?

814
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,094
- They're free?
- Spotlight got too hot.

815
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,463
The kidnapping got media
outlets around the world

816
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,942
to highlight all the
human rights abuses

817
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:17,316
going on over there.

818
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,467
Government had no
choice but to bow

819
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:19,970
to the international pressure.

820
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,861
And the governor herself
wanted me to pass along

821
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,323
her gratitude,
and so did the FBI.

822
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:25,672
Good work.

823
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:38,163
- Did you hear about your friends?
- Yes.

824
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:39,512
Kareem just told me.

825
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:40,955
I guess you made the world
hear you.

826
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:43,516
Where will you go now?

827
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,952
To D.C. with Kareem.

828
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:46,649
I'm going to keep speaking up.

829
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:48,738
And one day, maybe,

830
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,611
when things change,
I'll return home.

831
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,788
Thank you.

832
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,752
Hey. Thought you
had plans tonight.

833
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,798
Hicks has me counting bullets.

834
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:08,410
- Go on.
- What?

835
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,151
If you get a move on,
you'll still make it.

836
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:13,023
Seriously?
You don't have to do this.

837
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,200
I know. So stop reminding me.

838
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:18,507
Hey. Thank you.

839
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:19,856
I owe you.

840
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,472
Hondo.

841
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,169
Hey.

842
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,040
Hey, this a bad time?
I know you're busy.

843
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:31,607
No, it's all good.
We just got done.

844
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,218
I was just leaving. Come on.

845
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,700
So, where you been?
I tried calling you.

846
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:40,138
Man, I just needed
some air by myself.

847
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,096
I went for a walk around
the old neighborhood.

848
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,838
Well, it's been a minute
since you've been back.Yeah.

849
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,535
Hey, you remember
that old vinyl store

850
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,885
- on the corner of Ashby?
- Yeah.

851
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,974
That music booth saw
a whole lot of action,

852
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,716
and I'm not talking the
listening kind, either.

853
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,936
They turned it into
a hot yoga studio.

854
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:58,132
You know, yoga's bad enough;
now you got to do it in a sauna?

855
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,896
Yeah, the world keeps
changing, Winnie.

856
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,115
That's just a way of saying

857
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,465
that we are getting
older, brother.

858
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,641
So, what's up? You need
a ride to the airport?

859
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,035
You sure? It's not
out of your way?

860
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:10,820
Hospital's on that part of town.

861
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:12,779
Pop's surgery is in an hour.

862
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,522
How could you forgive
him so easy, Hondo?

863
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:18,611
I'm not. You think one little apology

864
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:20,743
makes up for everything
he did to us? I don't.

865
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:22,963
Walking out on us,
starting a whole new family,

866
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,245
not even bothering
with his old one?

867
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,532
I'm not saying it's enough.

868
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,186
I'm saying it's a step.

869
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:32,059
He is so scared
about this surgery.

870
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:34,017
He's even more scared
that we're never gonna

871
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,323
find a way to forgive him.

872
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,760
Well, he's right.

873
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:40,023
I'm not sure I ever will.

874
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,852
This is about me
helping an old man

875
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:45,028
get through a rough time.

876
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:48,641
Just because he stopped
being a father back then,

877
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:51,252
doesn't mean that I got to
stop being a son right now.

878
00:36:56,126 --> 00:37:00,087
All right, I got a little time
before my flight.

879
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,970
That is some miracle
you pulled off, Luca.

880
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,277
Hey, it wasn't me. You can
thank the priest I brought in.

881
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,758
You had an actual priest
do an exorcism on the truck?

882
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:22,109
No, not an exorcism. It
was more like a blessing.

883
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,739
Deac gave me the name
of this guy. I got him

884
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:26,113
to sprinkle some holy water
and say a few prayers,

885
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:27,157
and now Xiomara's happy.

886
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:28,158
How much did that cost?

887
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:29,595
Just a small donation,

888
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:30,944
but whatever it takes, man,

889
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:32,772
I've been dreaming of
this my whole life.

890
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:34,121
You've been dreaming of owning

891
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,949
a Guatemalan food truck
your whole life?

892
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,952
No, dawg, I'm talking
metaphorically, wiseass.

893
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,755
You know, when I was 16,
I worked the counter

894
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,695
at this deli making
subs one summer.

895
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:44,610
My dad started coming
in with his partner.

896
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:46,718
Pretty soon, the whole
department stopped by for lunch.

897
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:49,702
I got a reputation for being
generous with the cold cuts.

898
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,332
Old man that owned the joint
even left me in charge

899
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,966
for a week when he went away.

900
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:56,404
Man, I loved it. It was just,
like, everyone hanging out,

901
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,972
shooting the breeze.
Me serving people.

902
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,627
Now I get to do that
and be SWAT, so...

903
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,977
This is cool, man.

904
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,327
Can I still buy in?

905
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,286
Sorry, bud, you missed the boat.

906
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,417
The shares are all sold?

907
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,941
Yeah, Lynch bought the last one.

908
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,814
- Hey, is that the revuelta with beans and cheese?
- Yeah.

909
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:16,381
What did she put in the sauce?

910
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:17,817
It's a trade secret.

911
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,122
And that's gonna be $4.50.

912
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,820
I thought you said
they were for free.

913
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,125
No, that was earlier.

914
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,407
Okay, we're running a
business, not a charity.

915
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:24,606
Pay up.

916
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,044
Go back there and
pay her. Go on.

917
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,230
- How's he doing?
- Okay.

918
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:42,407
Was talking about
making a run for it

919
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,148
while you were gone,
but I convinced him to stay put.

920
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,933
Best have bought me
something to eat.

921
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,282
The food in here

922
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,110
is godawful.

923
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:52,131
Dad, you know, you can't
eat anything before surgery.

924
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,288
That's another reason
I want out of here.

925
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,943
And when did so many nurses
start being men?

926
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,901
Least they could do for

927
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:01,382
an old dying fool
is give him some eye candy.

928
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:04,907
Some things never change.

929
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:11,784
Thank you for coming back.

930
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:17,311
You know...

931
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,315
I'm a little scared
about all this.

932
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:30,019
We know. That's why we're
all here for you, Pop.

933
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,687
Bye.

934
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,864
Bye. Hey, thanks again, man.

935
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:52,259
The whole point
of an escape room

936
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:54,392
is to figure out the clues,
not pick the lock.

937
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,481
Hey, I got us out
of there, didn't I?

938
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,570
With three seconds
left on the clock.

939
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,094
We would've been
stuck there forever.

940
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:04,619
No food, no water. You know.

941
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:05,838
Things would turn ugly fast.

942
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:07,317
Every man for himself.

943
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,145
Well, someone really
likes to win?

944
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:11,234
Is that not
the point of playing?

945
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:13,628
Question, though...

946
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,804
do you always carry
a lock pick wherever you go?

947
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:18,894
I like to be prepared.

948
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:21,506
Well, this is me.

949
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:24,422
It's a nice place.

950
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:26,336
Yeah, got a roof terrace.

951
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,600
You can see the ocean.

952
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,298
A glimpse at least.

953
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:34,127
You want to come up and see?

954
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,652
I don't know.

955
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:40,089
No, no, no...

956
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,352
it's... hey.
It's not what you think.

957
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:45,617
Molly, I like you.

958
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,270
But?

959
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,709
No buts. I just... I like you.

960
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:52,058
A lot.

961
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,538
Okay, so?

962
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:58,281
In the past I've always...
I've treated things

963
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:01,720
like a hundred-yard dash
as opposed to a marathon.

964
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:05,375
You know? And things
have always...

965
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,203
they've burned out pretty quick.

966
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:11,077
And I guess what I'm
saying kind of badly

967
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,864
is, I'd like to
take our time with this.

968
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,261
How much time?

969
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:32,272
A little longer
than that, maybe.

970
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,625
That wasn't really fair.

971
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:58,864
Good night.

972
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:07,133
Yeah.

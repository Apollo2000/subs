When I went SWAT, he was

are still hiding in the

00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:23,455
Mumford's team set up a perimeter,

55

but they could use extra bodies
to direct the local police.

get over there. Chris and Luca,

Well, he was my commanding officer.

Took a liking to me.

89
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:38,278
He always talked about retiring
and spending as much time

as he could up here.

When was the last time you talked to him?

99
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:53,460
A few years ago. He-he was looking

100
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:56,129
for some intel on some gun
runners that SWAT had busted.

101

You got to love undercover work
to do it as long as he did it.

I'm not sure it's where he
saw his career going,

00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,667
but he was good at it.

104

The Mercs was his last gig.

105
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:05,105
He got charges to stick on
most of their top leaders.

106
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,522
It seems like they never recovered.

Well, they're pretty frisky right now.

setting up for an ambush

163
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:06,529
if they already had him.

164
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:07,663
He's probably out here somewhere.

165
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:08,731
Managed to grab some stuff

166
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:09,899
from the cabin before we got out.

167
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,431
Might come in handy.

168
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:12,869
Flare gun.

169
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,871
Only one left. Last resort.

170
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,697
If Hawkins is hiding from these guys,

171
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,099
there's a good chance that
he's in his hunting blind.

172
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:23,301
We find that, we find him.

173
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,487
And how do we do that?

174
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,508
Trail markers.

175
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,109
Every woodsman knows where to leave 'em

176
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,195
and how to look for 'em.

177
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,356
Oh, so you're a woodsman now?

178
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,514
Spent every summer camping with my dad.

179
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,250
Let's move.

180
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,989
STREET: <i>Did you see
Erika Rogers this morning?</i>

181
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:43,388
Girl was bouncing off the walls.

182
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,568
Night before my graduation
I kept replaying

183
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,603
my rifle qual on week two.

184
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:50,939
Tightened up on everything
after 50 yards.

185
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:52,541
Finished fourth.

186
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,676
Anything was gonna keep me
off the team, it was that.

187
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,444
Ah, that sounds hard, man.

188
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,440
Was top of my class every week,

189
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:00,575
so didn't have anything to worry about.

190
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,482
Yeah. Must've been tough
down in Long Beach

191
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,416
competing with the guys
who didn't make it up here.

192
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:05,940
(DOG BARKING)

193
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,215
Something's got him riled up back there.

194
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,152
Hey. Come here, buddy. Hey, come here.

195
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,987
Is this where you live?

196
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,722
- Huh?
- Is he hurt?

197
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,190
There's blood on his paw.

198
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,659
It's not his.

199
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,337
Street, check this out.

200
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,963
STREET: 26-David to 50-David.

201
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,926
Following a blood trail at our location.

202
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,711
- Hands!
- Let me see the hands!

203
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,819
This is 25-David. We got a dead suspect.

204
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,536
That's the Merc Mumford hit.

205
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,222
They must've hid him after he bled out.

206
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,424
Which means they must've been in a rush.

207
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,370
If I was gonna pick
somewhere nearby to hide...

208
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,930
See that high window by the roof

209
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,083
with the drain pipes leading up to it?

210
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,302
Mumford, they're here.

211
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,407
(WHISPERING): Choppers are gone.

212
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,609
You think they gave up?

213
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,378
- Safe to head out?
- We should wait another hour.

214
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,615
LAPD! LAPD! Let me see your hands!

215
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,118
- Don't move.
- Go hands-on! Go hands on!

216
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,124
What's this?

217
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:36,208
It's a hit list.

218
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,445
Drop it!

219
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,846
HONDO: Drop it now.

220
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,117
You mind telling your buddy
I'm one of the good guys?

221
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,553
Hondo, this is Hawkins.

222
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,055
Deacon, damn. What the
hell are you doing here?

223
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,457
We're looking for you.

224
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,625
We just came from your cabin.

225
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,726
The one with a squad of Merc shooters

226
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,820
camped out front?

227
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,186
They came after you, too?

228
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:05,497
Two of them tried to get the
jump on me about an hour ago.

229
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,933
I managed to sneak around back,
get some cover.

230
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,334
I thought you were one of them,

231
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,603
- on my trail.
- No, they ambushed us.

232
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,005
They ripped your place apart.

233
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,940
That's the least of my worries now.

234
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:20,412
I was gonna wait till dark, make my move,

235
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,080
but now, with you two here,

236
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,060
maybe we can make it
to the Ranger station.

237
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:25,580
There's a radio there.

238
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:28,520
You guys could call your SWAT
pals, have them pick us up.

239
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,249
Why are the Mercs after you?

240
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,282
And why are they starting wars with crews

241
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,583
five times their size?

242
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:34,285
I almost crippled them
a couple years back.

243
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,953
I put their leaders behind bars.

244
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,421
My head's probably a trophy

245
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:38,756
some punk thinks he needs

246
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,266
to rally the troops.

247
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:42,960
The Mercs were always followers, anyway.

248
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,128
(BIRDS FLUTTERING)

249
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,834
Station's this way.

250
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,003
Guns up, boys, they could be anywhere.

251
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,420
CHRIS: You didn't select Erika Rogers?

252
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:10,988
JESSICA: Chris, uh, not now.

253
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,090
That woman crushed the guys
that she was competing with.

254
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,959
She finished first
in the climbing course,

255
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:16,927
she scored one second flat
on the move in her sidearms

256
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:18,362
and Benelli quals.

257
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,463
And she doesn't get a spot

258
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:20,531
because you're all afraid of what?

259
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,833
More qualified women might try out now?

260
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,336
I only see four names.

261
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,138
Picking no one was better
than picking her?

262
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,939
- Officer Alonso, that's...
- Captain.

263
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,641
It's okay.

264
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,544
Not that it's any
of your business, Officer,

265
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,614
but a red flag from Rogers' time
working with the 77th

266
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:37,848
has come to our attention.

267
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,450
We're investigating the matter,

268
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:40,651
and when we're satisfied, we'll pick

269
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,620
a fifth recruit for a team then.

270
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:44,121
Now, you wouldn't want us
to give Ms. Rogers

271
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,723
special treatment either way.

272
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,393
Do you?

273
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,330
Those scores are
for the evaluation team only,

274
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:53,531
Officer Luca.

275
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,499
Not to be shared with anyone else.

276
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:57,201
20 years on the committee.

277
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,670
Not once did I ever have
to remind your father of that.

278
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,540
- I...
- Not another word.

279
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,411
That's not cool.

280
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,251
Don't bother.

281
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:15,886
You can't make a call
anywhere in these hills.

282
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:19,190
No service, no roads, no life.

283
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,425
Don't worry, Ranger station's not far.

284
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,260
So how long you been
out, about six months?

285
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,329
Best decision of my life, man.

286
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:26,764
I should have never let the brass

287
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,432
keep me under as long as they did.

288
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,202
How about you? It's got
to be what, now, 20-David?

289
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,738
Still 30-David, actually.

290
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,382
Hondo's team leader.

291
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,677
Huh.

292
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,546
I think I prefer gang politics
to police politics.

293
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,548
- Less feelings.
- We were hoping that your knowledge

294
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,951
of the Mercs could help us understand

295
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:48,285
what's motivating them.

296
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,854
Motivated by the same thing
they always are.

297
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,288
Control, power.

298
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:52,590
In fact, it doesn't surprise me

299
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,592
that they took a swing at the Jackals.

300
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,542
Wait a minute.

301
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,867
Wait a minute.

302
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:00,865
We never told you

303
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,833
it was the Jackals
the Mercs were targeting.

304
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:09,765
Now!

305
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,991
Cover! Cover!

306
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,276

307
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:17,348
Come on, come on!

308
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,290
We got to go.

312

One of my guys saw your car pull up.

313
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,676
I was hoping it was nothing.

314
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,944
I would've never given the order to fire

315
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:48,646
if I knew it was you, Deac.

316
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,482
I really hate that it went this way.

317
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:54,625
Deacon?

320
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,559
HAWKINS: They went this way.

321
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,309
And one of them is injured.

322
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:08,644
Now, listen, listen,

323
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,946
be careful: these guys
are really, really good.

324

But there's two of them
and there's ten of us.

00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:15,651
Plus, we've got better weapons
and communications.

326
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:18,086
Just don't let them get to civilization.

327
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,990
(GRUNTING)

328
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:23,425
Deac.

329
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,993
Hold up, man.

330
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:26,261
(GRUNTS)

331
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:28,497
All right, that's far enough.

332
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:30,265
I think we've bought a few minutes.

333
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,466
Let me take a look at that wound.

334
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:33,635
(GRUNTS, PANTING)

335
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,268
I counted nine, plus Hawkins.

336
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:36,794
Those HKs were the same as we use.

337
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:38,195
Hawkins got a hookup or something?

338
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,463
He could.

339
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:41,215
He seems to be running the whole crew.

340
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,702
- Oh, man.
- I hit a branch on the way down.

341
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,371
You're gonna have to settle
for conversation as anesthetic.

342
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,240
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

343
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,210
(GROANS)

344
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,147
Hawkins was my commanding
officer for five years.

345
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,317
You know how many beers
I had with the guy?

346
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,585
How could I not suspect...?

347
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,902
Deac, stop it.

348
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:06,824
Whether he lost his way, or
he was always capable of this,

349
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,659
Hawkins decided to switch teams.

350
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:09,994
Yeah, but how did it get to that?

351
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,799
SWAT protocol has Dispatch
check in every two hours.

352
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,500
- That's in ten minutes.
- Right, when they don't hear from us,

353
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:18,257
they're gonna send airships
to our last locations.

354
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,806
- That's another 30.
- We did extractions like this

355
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,047
in Somalia.

356
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,149
We got to make the rescue
as simple as possible.

357
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:24,517
If we can get above that tree line,

358
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:25,852
they'll be able to spot us faster.

359
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,323
- What?
- It's just a long way up that mountain.

360
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,858
And we're outnumbered,
we're out... we're outgunned,

361
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,059
Hawkins knows the terrain.

362
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:35,028
You're injured.

363
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:40,166
I say we make cover, wait
for the airship, use the flare.

364
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,435
(GRUNTING)

365
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:48,441
No. No, those birds need
a flat place to land.

366
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,343
We got no idea how far we are
from that cabin.

367
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,911
Look, I'm good.

368
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:53,179
Okay? I can move.

369
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:54,380
Sorry, Deac,

370
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:55,582
but I'm making the call.

371
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,217
We're headed up.

372
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,418
You understand?

373
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:59,686
Roger that.

374
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,421
All right. Now, that plateau

375
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,456
has got to be 40 minutes away.

376
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:04,591
We're gonna make it in 30.

377
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,293
Let's go.

378
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,495
(GRUNTS)

379
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,632
JESSICA: CHP just spotted

380
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,100
a large group of Jackal bikers

381
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,635
riding into the city.

382
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,136
Did Hondo find anything
from Deacon's contact

383
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,638
about what's causing all of this?

384
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,440
No, I haven't heard
anything back from them,

385
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,108
- but I'll have Dispatch try them again.
- This meth war

386
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,410
is about to become a shooting
gallery in the streets.

387
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:26,412
- What else do we have?
- Mumford's team found all the Mercs

388
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:27,881
from this morning; they're bringing one

389
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,616
back to HQ for questioning now.

390
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,251
I did a little digging into
the other Merc shootings.

391
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,652
The first one, last week,

392
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,387
happened at a bar called The Monkey Man.

393
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,924
There was four Smiling Jackals
killed, two top lieutenants.

394
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,592
Here's the thing, though, The Monkey Man

395
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,227
isn't a public Jackal front.

396
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:43,329
Only Jackals and a
few cops knew about it.

397
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:44,998
JESSICA: But the Mercs knew that.

398
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,499
So they've got an inside source.

399
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,107
Keep digging, and let me know

400
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:49,836
if Hondo or Deacon find anything.

401
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,282
I didn't mean to get you
in the doghouse with Hicks.

402
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,516
I'm really sorry.

403
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:05,151
Look, I shared Erika's results

404
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,953
- with you in confidence.
- I know.

405
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:08,288
- And I shouldn't have...
- My dad was an evaluator,

406
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,523
and his dad, too;
it's part of my legacy here.

407
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:12,292
And you wouldn't let someone who
deserved SWAT get railroaded.

408
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,860
You would look at her files,

409
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,762
make sure that Hicks made the right call.

410
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,297
- Right?
- Of course I would.

411
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:18,798
I'm just asking for the real story.

412
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,166
Seriously?

413
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,534
You already burned me once with Hicks.

414
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,469
I know, and I'm sorry.

415
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:24,537
It won't happen again.

416
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:25,921
I promise.

417
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,720
What do you know?

418
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,315
Two years ago, she failed
to properly restrain a suspect.

419
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,883
That's just sloppy procedure.

420
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,484
He broke free and attacked her partner.

421
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,053
The whole reason
why I got Street to help her

422
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,688
through the academy
is that everything that I heard

423
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:43,523
was that she had what it took to be SWAT.

424
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,991
You're telling me I got fooled by her?

425
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,193
Now, hold up. It never came up before

426
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,162
because her COs never said
anything about it

427
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,607
in our background interviews.

428
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:52,031
Like they didn't want to report it.

429
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,866
Sounds like there's more to the story

430
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,493
than what Hicks knows.

431
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,540
By the way,

432
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,542
don't let Hicks take a shot
at your legacy.

433
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,877
Your dad was on the committee
that picked me.

434
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,013
You're living up to the Luca name.

435
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,083
We're gonna get to the truth.

436
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:16,556
HONDO: Deac, we can't stop

437
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,524
every ten minutes for you
to make sound alarms.

438
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,059
These saplings snap loudly
when they're set off.

439
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:22,428
That buys us ten seconds
that could save our lives.

440
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:26,265
You hear that stream?

441
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,900
We got to bear away from that,

442
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,369
head in that direction.

443
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,071
All right, never travel
by bodies of water.

444
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:34,040
- It's the first place the enemy looks.
- Keep pace,

445
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,742
but stay quiet: heel, toe.

446
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:40,513
You know more than
campfires and marshmallows.

447
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,914
You did a lot more than go camping

448
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,249
with your daddy, didn't you?

449
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,376
Yeah, basic New England woods skills.

450
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,854
(CHUCKLES) Deac, you're from L.A.

451
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:49,622
Yeah, but I spent a lot of summers

452
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:51,757
camping with my dad in Vermont.

453
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,561
(GRUNTING): Oh, come on, come on.

454
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,599
(SIGHS)

455
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,300
Yeah, the truth is, my, uh,

456
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:03,970
my folks had kind of a rocky marriage.

457
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:05,972
We weren't the type
of family to get a divorce,

458
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:10,610
so... his summers camping
with me was kind of a...

459
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,412
Catholic compromise.

460
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,238
I knew why my dad did it, but...

461
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:17,550
I didn't let it get in the way of me

462
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,619
enjoying some time with my old man.

463
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,124
(EXHALES)

464
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,926
A lot of great nights.

465
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,327
Lot of marshmallows.

466
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,296
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

467
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,931
All right, we should keep moving.

468
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,833
All right, Deac,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

469
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,635
(CHUCKLES)

470
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,072
Your shiny white boy sweat makes
you look like a homing beacon.

471
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,473
We should both mask up.

472
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,725
It's another Marine trick. Come on.

473
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,769
You read the incident report?

474
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,414
Then you know it's enough
to keep me off SWAT.

475
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,700
If it really happened.
It's in the report.

476
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:52,819
Leave it alone. If it was your first week

477
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,821
on the street, I could,
but you're seven years in

478
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:56,280
and a training officer.

479
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,991
Just tell me what happened.

480
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:02,695
It's just us right now.

481
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:08,868
There is no "us," Chris.
You're already SWAT.

482
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:11,544
They got no interest in me.
If it wasn't this,

483
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:13,506
they'd just make up something else.

484
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,682
DISPATCHER (OVER RADIO):
20-David, do you copy?

485
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,717
Dispatch requesting check-in.

486
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:32,458
This is 30-David. Got a little
static from the mountains.

487
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:36,028
20-David and I are Code 4.
Sorry for the radio silence.

488
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,731
Couldn't find the target,
still looking for him.

489
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,971
JESSICA: <i>Thanks for letting me know.</i>

490
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:48,341
That was Dispatch. Hondo
and Deacon just checked in.

491
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,510
They haven't been able
to find Deacon's contact,

492
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:51,978
so they have nothing.

493
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,046
The Merc shooter's in Interrogation.

494
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,882
I, uh, looked into Erika's records.

495
00:21:57,885 --> 00:21:59,652
I asked her about the infraction,

496
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,221
but she was acting strange,
like she was hiding something.

497
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:04,056
- It doesn't add up.
- Hicks is looking into it.

498
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,192
Hicks is gonna take
the first version he hears.

499
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,327
I want the truth, even if
it's not good for Erika.

500
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:11,397
Can you get me the contact info

501
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,332
of her old partner?

502
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,067
Please, Captain.

503
00:22:15,663 --> 00:22:18,031
I went about it wrong this morning.

504
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:19,613
Let me do it right.

505
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,242
I'll see what I can do.

506
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,854
Mr. Savoy, you've had a busy morning.

507
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,389
(CHUCKLES)

508
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:40,126
Montrose Mercs for life, sweet thing.

509
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,694
STREET: I don't know why
you're acting so proud.

510
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,930
Half our squad hadn't even heard
of you clowns till this morning.

511
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:46,365
- Yeah, well, you will now, won't you?
- What, after you've

512
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,434
taken out the biggest rival
meth gang in the city?

513
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,708
JESSICA: We found your list.

514
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,772
Top Jackal members, addresses,
hangouts, even street names.

515
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,866
That's hard information to come by.

516
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,576
This wasn't just a "spray and pray"

517
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,977
for a few more corners.

518
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,745
These are targeted assassinations.

519
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,214
More Jackals are already on their way

520
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,548
into town to retaliate.

521
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,751
- We'll be ready for 'em.
- Well, not you.

522
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,198
We're benching you for the big game.

523
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,786
The city wants this handled.

524
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:11,324
So there's a deal to be made.

525
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,826
No one in your situation
gets a chance like this.

526
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,377
Take it.

527
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:20,967
(CHUCKLES) Nah.

528
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,469
Nah, Montrose Mercs for life.

529
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,645
(GRUNTS)

530
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:35,314
Okay. Right there, Deac.

531
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,750
Right there, that break in the trees.

532
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,685
We're gonna have to climb it.

533
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,654
No, we-we don't know how sturdy
any of those boulders are.

534
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,090
One loose rock, we'd be
back down here on our ass

535
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,358
in less than five minutes.

536
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:46,626
Not to mention we'd be broadcasting

537
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,960
exactly where we are to Hawkins.

538
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:49,161
Those choppers are coming.

539
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,430
If we don't get up there soon,
they're gonna pass us by.

540
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:54,200
We get to that extraction point
as fast as possible,

541
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:55,835
that is the mission objective.

542
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,436
It won't be any faster if we
don't make it all the way up.

543
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:58,604
This is not your call.

544
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:00,839
What makes it yours?

545
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,643
Don't make me pull rank here.

546
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:06,312
Rank? This stopped being a SWAT mission

547
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:08,314
about halfway down that
cliff we jumped off of.

548
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:10,383
Right now it's just two guys
trying to stay alive.

549
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,652
It is my responsibility
to get us out of here.

550
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:14,320
Look, I get that you
have Marine training.

551
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:17,023
This is not Somalia.
This is unique terrain.

552
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,691
I spent a lot of time
in woods like these.

553
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:20,126
I know what we need to do,

554
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,461
and I'm not gonna follow
you up into a situation

555
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,829
that's gonna get us both killed.

556
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:25,564
I will not do that to my wife and kids.

557
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,966
Do you really think

558
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,722
I would put us in a dangerous
spot like that?

559
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:30,836
If you take us up there? Yes.

560
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:32,672
Now, you can come with me or not.

561
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:35,408
Deacon. Deac.

562
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,584
(GRUNTING)

563
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,422
Look, if you got some type of problem,

564
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,924
- now is not the time for it.
- That hill was a bad call.

565
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,092
I'm talking about this attitude

566
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:54,760
I've been picking up on since the cabin.

567
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,195
It's no attitude.

568
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,098
Just wish I had more time to get
some stuff that we could use,

569
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:02,501
like a compass or a map maybe.
That fishing line came in handy.

570
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:05,004
We were in a situation
and I had to get us out.

571
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,206
I reacted. That's how I'm trained.

572
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,574
If you're still beating yourself up

573
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,842
about not catching onto Hawkins,

574
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,711
I told you, don't let it get to you.

575
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:13,179
Keep your voice down.

576
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:14,246
(PANTING)

577
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:16,821
I can't get us out of here

578
00:25:16,856 --> 00:25:19,251
if I have to worry about whether or
not my partner still has my six.

579
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,721
You don't have to worry
about getting us out of here.

580
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:23,189
You keep trying to make
calls in a situation

581
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,724
that you don't know
as much about as I do.

582
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,125
It's my job to make the calls.

583
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,793
I understand that's how
you see the job, Hondo.

584
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,297
Deacon, this is my team.

585
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:32,965
How I see it is how it is.

586
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,133
Don't worry.

587
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,801
There's no question
about whose team it is.

588
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,770
Is this about you getting passed over?

589
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,439
That was nine months ago, man.
You're still thinking about it?

590
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:43,242
Of course I still think about it.

591
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:45,978
I thought we buried this,
and I thought you had my back.

592
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,413
I have always had your back.

593
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,449
And I would never put the team in danger.

594
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:52,718
Yeah, every once in a while,
when I'm driving into work,

595
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,153
about to take a left into the garage,

596
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,454
I think about how long it's gonna be

597
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:56,622
before I get a shot at a team.

598
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,707
If I ever get a shot.

599
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,494
All because of some mistake Buck made.

600
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,129
You think I didn't deserve this job?

601
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:04,463
That's not what this is about.

602
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:06,332
Or that you could've done
the job better than me?

603
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:08,634
We'll never know.

604
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,771
But I do know that
I was supposed to be next.

605
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:14,340
And I did nothing to deserve losing that.

606
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,842
Did you ever think about
the position that I was put in?

607
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,844
What'd you want me to do?
Turn the job down?

608
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,015
It was supposed to be my team.

609
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,917
(SAPLING ALERT FIRES)

610
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,620
That's one of the saplings.
50 yards that way.

611
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,428
We can't let him fire a single shot.

- We don't have time to gag 'em.
- Wouldn't do any good anyway.

Rest of the Mercs are on their way.

618

You're good? Let's move, move.

00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:23,226
Where are the airships?
They should be here by now.

622

We've been missing over three hours.

623

Your car.

624
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,168
Your car at the cabin.

625
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:36,034
Hawkins could've given
the all clear to HQ.

626
00:27:36,608 --> 00:27:38,009
He'd know the codes.

627
00:27:38,043 --> 00:27:40,077
It could be nightfall before
SWAT comes looking for us.

628
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,580
We got to figure another way out of here.

629
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:43,848
How?

630
00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:45,883
We're hours deeper into
the woods than we were before.

631
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:47,819
Okay, you know what?
You've said your piece, man.

632
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:49,253
I don't need to hear it again.

633
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,652
You wanted me to be honest.

634
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:54,192
I don't care that you felt
burned when this went down.

635
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:56,027
I care that you're still holding onto it.

636
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:57,405
After all this team's been through,

637
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
you're still hung up on that.

638
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:00,907
Hey, I always put the team first.

639
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:02,142
I have followed you without question.

640
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,644
That is what your job is.

641
00:28:03,678 --> 00:28:05,078
And I could do that and still
feel like I deserved better.

642
00:28:05,113 --> 00:28:06,380
Not if you want this job.

643
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:07,848
The team comes before
everything else, man.

644
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:09,231
Putting yourself in danger

645
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:10,350
doesn't make you a better team leader.

646
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:11,518
You don't always have to be the one

647
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:13,020
climbing on top of a moving truck

648
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:14,888
or-or taking a sniper shot
out of a helicopter.

649
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:16,223
You tell me that you're thinking

650
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,858
of the team in those moments.

651
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:20,060
Is that what you're after? The glory?

652
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:22,062
I want you to admit that
you need to be the hero,

653
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:23,530
carrying all of us on your back.

654
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:25,699
I've been holding things up
on my own my entire life.

655
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,434
What, you think that's a choice?

656
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:29,202
My daddy actually left my mama.

657
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,338
Yeah, when I was 14,

658
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:32,773
and I could've got
caught up in the streets

659
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:34,652
and paid my mama's bills
with dirty money.

660
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,711
Or I could step up and be
the man and take care of her

661
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:40,380
the right way, by myself.

662
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:44,790
I didn't know that about your father.

663
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,167
You never talk about your family.

664
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:53,627
Deac, it wasn't easy for me
coming up through LAPD either.

665
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,262
I had to be better than
they thought I was,

666
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:56,730
just the black dude.

667
00:28:56,764 --> 00:29:00,097
To be as good meant I was only
gonna stay in the same place.

668
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:09,876
Hey, Hondo.

669
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,578
You saved all of our lives

670
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:13,151
more than once.

671
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:17,977
Your approach works.
You make SWAT better.

672
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,620
And I'm proud to serve with you.

673
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:22,356
I'm not bitter.

674
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,827
I just...

675
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:29,042
It kills me that I feel this way at all.

676
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:30,731
(SIGHS)

677
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,671
I don't want to.

678
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:37,629
(GUNSHOT)

679
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:40,841
HAWKINS: I found my boys, Deacon.

680
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,889
You must be close.

681
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:46,846
Why drag this out?

682
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:53,495
What do we do? Those rocks.

683
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,788
Three o'clock, now. Move.

684
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,837
(GUNSHOTS)

685
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:07,834
LEWIS: Uh, hello?

686
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:11,338
Are you Officer Alonso? I was
told I could find you here.

687
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:13,974
I got a call from a Captain Cortez

688
00:30:14,008 --> 00:30:16,977
asking me to come in?
I'm Ryan Lewis, 77th division.

689
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:18,612
- Great to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

690
00:30:18,646 --> 00:30:20,881
Uh, I'm not sure what SWAT
needs my help with, though.

691
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:23,049
I want to talk about Erika Rogers.

692
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:25,786
Specifically about an incident
that happened two years ago.

693
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,523
- Everything's in the report.
- Yeah.

694
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:31,625
I want to know what's not in the report.

695
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:34,227
Look, I can't help you.

696
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:37,798
150. That's how many try out
for SWAT every single year.

697
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:39,566
Half of them don't make their PFQs,

698
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,522
another 40 wash out in a week,

699
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:44,838
and then it starts to gets hard.
And those last 40?

700
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:46,787
They drop out on their own.

701
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:48,875
Erika didn't.

702
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,511
And unless you can tell me
what happened that day,

703
00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:53,747
it'll all be for nothing.

704
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:56,550
Please don't involve
me in this, all right?

705
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:59,052
My wife just had a baby.
I'm on detective track.

706
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:00,420
Have you seen Erika lately?

707
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:03,089
- She's given everything for this.
- Of course I've seen her.

708
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:05,592
I still grab chicken wings
with her once a week.

709
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:08,161
I mean, she's my son's godmother, okay?

710
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:11,731
She made me the man I am today.
I owe my career to her.

711
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,233
It was you.

712
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:17,704
You didn't restrain the suspect.

713
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:20,073
But Erika had to take the hit for you.

714
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:24,277
Look, I was still on my probation period.

715
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,960
All right, it would have
been my third strike.

716
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:28,548
I didn't ask her to do it.

717
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,583
Okay? She just did it.

718
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:32,219
And if she hadn't, I would've washed out.

719
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:34,421
So, every day since, I have tried to be

720
00:31:34,455 --> 00:31:37,257
the cop that she put her
career on the line to save.

721
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:38,692
She needs you now.

722
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:40,026
They're holding that mark against her

723
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:41,127
to keep her out of SWAT.

724
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:42,696
What? No. She-she never said that she...

725
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,297
She doesn't want you to take the hit.

726
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:46,733
That's why she deserves the spot.

727
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,004
She needs somebody watching her back.

728
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:03,049
He's got the mother of all deals
on the table.

729
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:04,384
All he's doing is repeating

730
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:05,418
how loyal he is.

731
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:06,786
TAN: He almost took it before.

732
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:08,952
What's holding him back?

733
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,757
Stay here.

734
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,359
Follow my lead.

735
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:20,901
Your crew attacked The
Monkey Man bar last week.

736
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:23,169
Not many people know
that's a Jackal hangout.

737
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:24,926
(CHUCKLES)

738
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,179
Who are you looking at, Mr. Savoy?

739
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,810
Turn off the cameras

740
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:32,392
and leave us.

741
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:37,484
I don't know why you think
someone inside the police

742
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:38,485
is a Montrose Merc,

743
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,911
but this is SWAT,

744
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:41,655
and everyone here works for me.

745
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:43,423
Nothing you say is gonna be leaked.

746
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:44,524
And the deal I'm offering you

747
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,157
disappears the minute
I walk out that door.

748
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:53,600
(SIGHS)

749
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:54,748
All right.

750
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,037
O-Okay.

751
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:00,807
He used to run with us

752
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:04,110
before a bunch of our bosses got busted.

753
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:05,779
He showed up a couple months later

754
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:07,981
bragging that he used to be a cop,

755
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:09,482
and how easy it was

756
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:11,431
to take us down.

757
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,856
But then he said he knew a way
for us to get it all back.

758
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:18,491
An ex-cop.

759
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:22,696
He had the hookups, like weapons, intel.

760
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,863
Before we knew it.

761
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:25,665
He was telling us all what to do.

762
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,700
I need a name.

763
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,382
Look, you know...

764
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,437
If you want this deal, I need a name.

765
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,792
Now.

766
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:37,689
Hawkins.

767
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:44,017
Dispatch just sent
the recording of the call.

768
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,418
HAWKINS (ON RECORDING): This is 30-David.

769
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:46,886
Got a little static from the mountains.

770
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,421
20-David and I are Code 4.

771
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:50,223
- That's not Deacon.
- Sorry for the radio silence.

772
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:52,425
Last logged location was, um,

773
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,661
Hawkins' cabin in
Angeles National Forest.

774
00:33:54,695 --> 00:33:56,162
Man, they've been gone, like, six hours.

775
00:33:56,197 --> 00:33:57,769
Get the airships ready.

776
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:06,373
There's rock cover
50 yards north of here.

777
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:08,408
Plenty of trees along the way.

778
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:10,443
- Alternate. Don't spare anything.
- All right.

779
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:12,971
(GUNFIRE)

780
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:22,522
DEACON: What happened to you, Hawkins?

781
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:23,757
You used to be a good cop.

782
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,291
HAWKINS: And then I was a retired cop.

783
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:27,394
What's that?

784
00:34:27,428 --> 00:34:29,396
Just an old man in the mountains.

785
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,131
I gave my best years to that badge,

786
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:32,772
and I got nothing in return.

787
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,935
I saw an opportunity for some respect.

788
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,637
Any minute, this sky's gonna
be filled with airships.

789
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:41,875
Where are they, Hondo? No one's coming.

790
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,277
You don't want two bodies
on your jacket, Hawkins.

791
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:45,945
Deacon, move!

792
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:56,089
- Deacon, I'm out.
- Hondo, move!

793
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:03,063
HONDO: Deacon, left side!

794
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:04,130
(GRUNTING)

795
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:05,532
Deacon, go!

796
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:15,508
- I got one of 'em, Deac.
- Me, too.

797
00:35:15,543 --> 00:35:17,677
So that leaves eight.

798
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:19,279
I got, uh, four rounds. I got three.

799
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:20,847
All right, that means
one of is is gonna have

800
00:35:20,881 --> 00:35:22,148
to take out two with one.

801
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:24,230
Now's a good time to be a hero.

802
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:26,399
Don't look at me to do it.

803
00:35:30,524 --> 00:35:32,325
If not now, when?

804
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:41,668
You're passing over the cabin now.

805
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:44,170
I've got these heat signatures
all over the woods.

806
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:45,705
I'm counting 12 people.

807
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,707
Some of them aren't moving.

808
00:35:47,742 --> 00:35:50,256
Can't tell which ones
are Hondo and Deacon.

809
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:52,946
Guys, look. Two o'clock!

810
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,147
Two o'clock!

811
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,688
(GUNFIRE) You ready?

812
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:03,019
Go.

813
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:05,091
(YELLS)

814
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:06,526
(GRUNTS)

815
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:11,231
(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

816
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:13,825
Deac, there's the team.

817
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,174
(GUNFIRE)

818
00:36:35,556 --> 00:36:37,590
Everybody out of here.

819
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,827
Hey!

820
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:42,929
- Hey, here!
- You guys okay?

821
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,330
Hondo's hurt. His right side.

822
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:45,431
Luca, get this jacket off of me.

823
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:47,000
We came as soon as
we learned about Hawkins.

824
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,369
- I hope you brought us some gear.
- You know we did.

825
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:52,005
Chris, give me your radio. Okay...

826
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,506
Captain...

827
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:55,133
Captain, how we looking?

828
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,843
It's good to hear your voice, Hondo.

829
00:36:56,877 --> 00:36:59,045
We're not out
of the woods yet, literally.

830
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,413
And we're not gonna be until
we get every last Merc,

831
00:37:00,447 --> 00:37:01,748
especially Hawkins.

832
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:03,016
The rest of the cavalry's on their way.

833
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,118
Mumford's team will sweep
from the cabin north,

834
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,371
but we can follow the trails

835
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:07,720
picked up from the heat signatures.

836
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:09,022
All right.

837
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:10,290
They're gonna be scattering
in all different directions.

838
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:11,713
Let's go get 'em.

839
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:14,379
You up for this, boss?

840
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:19,143
Hell yeah.

841
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:22,640
Let's move. Let's go!

842
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:29,641
JESSICA (OVER COMM):
Two shooters heading south.

843
00:37:29,676 --> 00:37:30,742
Another couple running east

844
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:31,810
and moving fast.

845
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:33,011
And a pair heading northwest,

846
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:34,527
- back up the mountain.
- All right, Street and Tan,

847
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:36,481
take the crew to the south... go, go.

848
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:37,950
Chris and Luca, go east... move.

849
00:37:39,886 --> 00:37:41,520
That leaves a pair for you and me, Deac.

850
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:42,869
Back to the high ground.

851
00:37:44,724 --> 00:37:45,991
(PANTING)

852
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,426
(GRUNTS)

853
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,027
Give me your hands.

854
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:51,296
Hands! Hands!

855
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,931
Behind your back!

856
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,466
CHRIS: We got one and two.

857
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:00,939
They should be right here.

858
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,407
We're practically standing on top of 'em.

859
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:07,278
TAN: Let me see your hands!

860
00:38:09,386 --> 00:38:10,949
Got three and four.

861
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,651
Just two left, Hondo.

862
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:18,957
Hawkins!

863
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:27,966
I guess this is where
it ends, huh, Deacon?

864
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:29,968
Come on, man.

865
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:32,537
I never come up this far.

866
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:33,739
I never knew this was here.

867
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:34,773
Come on, Sam, get out of there.

868
00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:36,308
What are you doing, man?
Get on the ground.

869
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,577
Hondo, high right!

870
00:38:38,611 --> 00:38:39,578
(GRUNTS)

871
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:41,580
(GUNSHOT)

872
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:14,293
Is he going to be okay?

873
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,783
He just needs some time alone to process.

874
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:19,298
He'll be all right.

875
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:26,425
I guess covering for your partner

876
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:27,993
isn't as bad as letting a perp go.

877
00:39:28,027 --> 00:39:29,428
You didn't just cover.

878
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:30,762
You taught him how to be better.

879
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:31,763
And you took a personal hit

880
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:33,354
for somebody who needed it.

881
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,399
Lewis told me what you did.

882
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,770
Sorry I lashed out.

883
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:40,672
- That's okay.
- (CHUCKLES)

884
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:42,774
Fancy my surprise when I called

885
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,609
Officer Lewis to SWAT headquarters,

886
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:46,812
and he's already in
the building asking for me.

887
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:50,716
I wasn't gonna let
a star recruit like Rogers

888
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,151
wash out without doing
the legwork myself.

889
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,084
Yes, sir.

890
00:39:56,001 --> 00:39:57,402
She's gonna make a great officer.

891
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,057
Yeah.

892
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:01,193
I understand you trust your teammates.

893
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:03,795
But don't forget I'm your teammate, too.

894
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,097
All right?

895
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:09,668
Let's go, you guys.

896
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:11,570
Ah, well-deserved, Erika.

897
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:13,071
- Welcome to SWAT.
- Yeah.

898
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:14,840
Congrats.

899
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:15,874
Congratulations. Thank you, thank you.

00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

901
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,710
ERIKA: Hey, the other recruits
waited to celebrate,

902
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:20,011
- so I'm gonna go join them.
- Have a feeling

903
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:21,012
you're gonna drink them under the table.

904
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:23,181
Yeah. Taught her how to do that, too.

905
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:25,650
(LAUGHTER) See you around.

906
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:27,819
- See you.
- Bye.

907
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:28,820

00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,504
I've never wanted a hot shower

Hey, Deac, uh...

915
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:05,857
Listen, uh, when I took team leader,

916
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:08,693
I tried to treat everybody
the same as before.

917
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:11,244
Just do the job, like a normal promotion.

918
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:13,031
Those first few weeks,

919
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:14,747
I was just playing a role.

920
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:17,235
I think we both were.

921
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:23,575
Deac, I'll never regret taking this job.

922
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,777
There's been a lot of changes
I've been trying to make

923
00:41:25,812 --> 00:41:27,345
ever since I got here.

924
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:30,482
But I could've handled it better.

925
00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:32,951
I could've been more direct with you

926
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:34,553
about how you were feeling

927
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:36,488
and more honest about how I was.

928
00:41:36,522 --> 00:41:38,957
How I am, Deac.

Something like that.

328
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,975
Okay, on the plus side,

329
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,290
Street was a kick-ass
copper down in Long Beach.

330
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:58,781
He has tons of righteous busts.

331
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:00,630
TAN: On the flip side,

332
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:02,471
dude's racked up an inch worth
of disciplinary charges,

333
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,429
and he's been transferred
between units.

334
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:05,936
Doesn't play well with others.

335
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,405
He told me his mom's in prison.

336
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,762
You find out why?

337
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,305
Yeah. She's doing 25 to life

338
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,796
for killing his old man.

339
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,267
I mean, after a dozen

340
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:18,711
domestic abuse calls to 911,
Street's mom popped his dad

341
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,971
twice in the chest with his own gun.

342
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,236
Guess who the arresting officer was.

343
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,828
Buck Spivey.

344
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:26,588
Yeah.

345
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,391
Street was 12 when it went down.

346
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:31,315
After that, he got passed
around the foster care system.

347
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:32,858
Explains a few things.

348
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,750
Yeah. Dealt a tough hand.

349
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,156
But that doesn't mean

350
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:37,599
he gets a free ride with SWAT.

351
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,644
When Buck got fired,

352
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,675
he handpicked Street to take his place.

353
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:45,191
I get we're not feeling
the kid just yet, but...

354
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,088
we all owe Buck.

355
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:50,449
So, before we go pulling
the ripcord on Street,

356
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,009
let's try to make him better.

357
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,809
What, we headed out?

358
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,493
Mr. Master Race thought he'd
rob a check cashing place

359
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:02,782
and throw some shots at us.

360
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,329
He was a little slow.

361
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,290
His aim was worse.

362
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:08,876
Scoop up any of your guys yet, Hondo?

363
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,191
Not yet.

364
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,818
Guess it's one-zero.

365

kill my neighbor...

this is how I found Casper.

376

A message from Cuchillo

377
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,640
not to talk.

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,075
I had to walk past this high roller

every day on the way to school.

He was always messing with me,
wanting me to slang dope.

384

Now, I just wanted to change schools,

385
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,875
but my mother, she was not having it.

386
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:24,005
She stepped right up to
him and got in his face.

387
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,107
Told him to keep away from me and
my friends or she would have

every cop in the 77th

He never bothered me again.

1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:02,422
- Previously on SWAT.
- You have any word on Street?

2
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:04,047
I tried his cell three times,
but he's not picking up.

3
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:06,342
You probably already know, but I lied.

4
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:09,002
<i>You're off SWAT. You report
to patrol duty tomorrow.</i>

5
00:00:09,036 --> 00:00:10,837
<i>We hold each other's lives out there,</i>

6
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:13,039
and I need to see that Street gets that.

7
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:14,793
- Nia Wells.
- Daniel Harrelson.

8
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:16,009
They call me Hondo though.

9
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:18,411
<i>- You're a prosecutor, huh?
- Deputy D.A.</i>

10
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:21,714
- How long you two been married?
<i>- Actually, getting divorced.</i>

11
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,883
It's funny, you know, when
something like this happens,

12
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:25,685
it changes how you look at things.

13
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,457
<i>My son Darryl, he's in trouble,</i>

14
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,255
<i>and I can't get through to the boy.</i>

15
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,844
<i>Darryl's more like you, man.
He's a thinker.</i>

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,026
But he got other options in life.

17
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,766
Your auntie up north,
she'd be willing to let you

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,962
go stay with her for a while.

19
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:38,264
<i>Ela?</i>

20
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,240
Ela?

21
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:41,727
Ela?

22
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:49,040
Ela?

23
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:22,842
- You got plates?
- Got it.

24
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:24,811
Adam 13 to dispatch. Be advised

25
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:26,746
of a late model blue sedan
heading southbound

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,681
from our location on Valencia.

27
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,617
Plates are 3-4-0-

28
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,051
David-Elle-Gray.

29
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:37,395
It's okay.

30
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:46,633
I got a peek inside.
Two guys armed with shotguns.

31
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,034
Adam 13, requesting backup.

32
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:49,769
I have two suspects armed with shotguns.

33
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:51,304
We got to go in.

34
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:52,672
No. More officers are on the way.

35
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:53,773
This girl needs our help.

36
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:55,008
Right now.

37
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,345
We can breach from the one side,

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,847
make a limited penetration entry,

39
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,549
- get her out of there.
- Limited penetra...

40
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,984
- I don't speak SWAT, man.
- Fine. Just follow me.

41
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,419
Standard procedure.

42
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,530
Hey. Come here.

43
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,999
Come here. Come here, honey. Come on.

44
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:21,834
Come with me. Come with me. It's okay.

45
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:23,169
That's it.

46
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:24,237
Come on.

47
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,347
<i>The call came</i> from Adam 13.

48
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,014
That's Street and his partner.

49
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,421
All right, we're almost there.

50
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,556
All right, you know your assignments.

51
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:57,703
Luca, Tan, two side.
Beni, Chris, four side.

52
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:05,578
Metro SWAT!

53
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:12,652
- You good?
- We're good. We're good.

54
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:22,795
Gun! Gun! Gun!

55
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,697
Suspects heavily armed!

56
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,191
- Let me help. Let me help.
- No.

57
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,168
- Stay with the girl.
- They got us pinned!

58
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:35,657
They also got us on the two side.

59
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,078
Go, go, go, go.

60
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,287
Cover! Cover!

61
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:57,096
Hey, stay down.

62
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:59,306
You okay?

63
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,503
Move! Move!

64
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,204
Go, go, go, go!

65
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,550
Get to the alley!

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,361
They called in their own backup,

67
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:30,296
moved in formation,
and tactical shooting.

68
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,532
And they got a bulletproof SUV.

69
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,034
Who the hell are these guys?

70
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:43,071
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

71
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,265
The bulletproof SVU was found
abandones two miles from here.

72
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:14,018
I got unis searching every inch

73
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,401
of Pico-Union for these guys.

74
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:18,177
D.A. thinks they know
who they are. Agent Floyd?

75
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,903
We found heroin and guns
inside the house.

76
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,171
It's a stash spot.

77
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:24,058
The duffel bag they retrieved
probably contained drug proceeds.

78
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:25,742
From everything you described,

79
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,010
this crew has to be the Omegas.

80
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,412
The rumor is the Omegas were
trained by the DEA

81
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:32,382
to hunt drug cartels in Turkey
before becoming one themselves.

82
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,383
Unfortunately, the rumors are true.

83
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,884
The Omegas' military discipline

84
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,986
makes them well-organized and dangerous.

85
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,155
Yeah, we just got a taste of that, but
I'm looking forward to round two.

86
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,000
They're led by Cano Ozdemir,

87
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:44,260
who goes by his call sign, Omega One.

88
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,995
He normally operates out of Turkey.

89
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,997
If his crew's here in L.A.
looking to stay under the radar,

90
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:49,933
then he's definitely up to something.

91
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:52,202
Witnesses saw a woman and young
boy flee before we arrived.

92
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:53,670
Patrol's still looking
for the car they were in,

93
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:55,238
but here's a photo of them.

94
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,272
Probably the mother
and the brother

95
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,740
of the little girl Street found.

96
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,709
Unfortunately, she's not
saying much. Too terrified.

97
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:01,945
That mother was forced
to leave her daughter behind,

98
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,012
so if she's still out there with her son,

99
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,266
then they're both targets right now.

100
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,916
Maybe we should start
with the enemy of our enemy.

101
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,308
The Omegas' main heroin rival
is the Baja Diablo Cartel.

102
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:10,683
We could talk to them, find out

103
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,021
if this mother and son
are connected to them.

104
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:13,623
The Baja Diablos aren't
gonna talk to the police,

105
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:14,924
even if it's about the Omegas,

106
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,259
unless we've got some type of leverage.

107
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,360
Let's get a search warrant.

108
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:18,628
Find some dope at one of their places.

109
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:20,063
See if we can loosen
their tongues that way.

110
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:21,931
I'll go to court, find a friendly judge.

111
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,700
Tan, you roll with Beni.

112
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:26,035
All right, no way the Omegas
shipped a bulletproof

113
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,471
monster like that across
the Atlantic through customs.

114
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:31,107
But I know a local guy does
high-end work like this on trucks.

115
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,642
That sounds like a solid lead.

116
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:34,577
Chris and I will go with you.

117
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,547
What do you want to do about the girl?

118
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:38,948
I've already called Social Services,

119
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,650
but they're shorthanded at the moment.

120
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,778
I got an idea.

121
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:47,757
Street.

122
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,229
Heard the Omegas might be behind this.

123
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:54,831
They might be going after
that girl's family.

124
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,982
She seems to have a connection with you.

125
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:58,134
You want me to talk to her?

126
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,169
See if she can give us anything?

127
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,506
Sure. I'll let you know.

128
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,448
You see that car at one o'clock?

129
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:14,183
Driver's been watching us the whole time.

130
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:17,453
- Omega lookout?
- I wouldn't put it past 'em.

131
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:20,123
I'm contact, you're cover.

132
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,493
Excuse me.

133
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,795
Commander Bob Hicks, LAPD.

134
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:27,847
Could I see some I.D., please?

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,422
Gun! Let me see hands.

136
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,804
Let me see hands!

137
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,506
With your right hand, unlock the door

138
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,674
and exit the vehicle.

139
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,348
Hands on top of the car.

140
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,321
Jessica Cortez.

141
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:52,555
Kamile Erkan.

142
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,677
Please tell these people who I am.

143
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,626
Kamile is an Interpol
officer from Turkey.

144
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,462
Consulted on a few cases
I worked in Hollenbeck.

145
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,564
Interpol doesn't have
jurisdiction in the States.

146
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,300
They also can't carry
service weapons here.

147
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,401
So we'll hang onto this for now.

148
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:06,781
What are you doing in L.A.?

149
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:09,681
Same thing as you. Hunting Omegas.

150
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,575
The mother on the run,
her name is Jubilee.

151
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:14,722
Her son is Rudi.

152
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,680
If you want to find them
before the Omegas do,

153
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,233
you should listen to what I have to say.

154
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,827
You want to tell us your name?

155
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,196
I'll be back.

156
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,368
How's it going with the girl?

157
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:41,104
Well, she's not showing
any signs of physical abuse,

158
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:42,505
but she's still not saying anything.

159
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,341
Have you tried speaking
to her in Turkish?

160
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:47,173
- I will.
- Mm-hmm.

161
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:48,678
As soon as I learn Turkish.

162
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:51,414
Well, you should get creative
and use your dictionary

163
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,242
or your translator on your phone.

164
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:55,030
You're good with kids.

165
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,200
There's a real-life translator
showing up any minute.

166
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,982
She obviously sees
something in you she trusts.

167
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,538
You got to speak her language.

168
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:05,695
- Maybe literally.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,043
Oh, one more thing. I, um...

170
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:09,077
I talked to Hondo.

171
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,812
Why?

172
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,080
Because you won't do it yourself,

173
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,216
and I know you want to be back on SWAT.

174
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,418
If I'm wrong, then tell me.

175
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,056
The door's still open for now.

176
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,338
But you got to show him
how far you've come.

177
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,528
Thanks.

178
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,435
Try something.

179
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:41,176
Jim Street.

180
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,620
She won't tell us what she knows

181
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,161
until she gets a guarantee
from the D.A.'s office

182
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,762
she won't be facing gun charges.

183
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,264
I made some calls to Interpol,

184
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:03,865
and according to Kamile's superiors,

185
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,777
she's been M.I.A.
for the past seven weeks.

186
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,702
When I worked with Kamile in Hollenbeck,

187
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,671
she was dedicated to her job.

188
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,940
- Sometimes too much so.
- Well, apparently,

189
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:13,275
they had to get her counseling.

190
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,610
She was on the verge of washing out.

191
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:18,680
She could be an asset,
but can we trust her?

192
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:19,981
You know her.

193
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:21,116
I'm not sure we can trust her,

194
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,784
but I've seen Kamile work.

195
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:25,120
And if she's got information
that can help us,

196
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:26,822
maybe we can save Jubilee and her son.

197
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,758
It's your call, Cortez.

198
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:41,303
Every second I'm here,
the Omegas get closer

199
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:43,338
to finding Jubilee
and her son before you do.

200
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:44,478
You're free to go.

201
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,141
The D.A. won't charge you for the gun.

202
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:48,503
- Tell us where to find him.
- Let me speak with Ela first.

203
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:50,846
I can't do that. Ela's in our custody.

204
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,247
We are all police here.

205
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,548
Are we?

206
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,183
You're M.I.A. from Interpol.

207
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:56,685
Feels like you're doing this on your own.

208
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,053
In Turkey,

209
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:00,055
some police still belong
to the drug crews.

210
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,323
I have to make moves.

211
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:02,557
And when you're a woman,

212
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:04,559
they call you crazy for that.

213
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,614
I'm sure you understand.

214
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,698
You don't trust me.

215
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:12,100
But why should I trust you?

216
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,670
It was U.S. law enforcement
that created the Omegas.

217
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,785
If we can't fight them together...

218
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,497
then I will just keep doing it on my own.

219
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,714
How's your life?

220
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,883
You still close with your sister?

221
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,320
No.

222
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:36,791
I had a relationship
that was very special to me.

223
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,026
Didn't last.

224
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,418
I've also been meaning to spend
more time with my niece.

225
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,732
We used to talk about this.

226
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,467
To do this job well,

227
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,802
you must put everything into it.

228
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,070
But to put everything into it,

229
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:50,639
how much of yourself do you lose?

230
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:55,117
My sister, Oba, said
I was too obsessed with work.

231
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:56,992
She was right.

232
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,227
That's how I lost her.

233
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,953
The sacrifices we make,

234
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,817
let's make them count.

235
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:08,836
I followed the Omegas from Istanbul.

236
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,091
<i>Most of the time, they're efficient,</i>

237
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:14,392
<i>business-minded.</i>

238
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:16,094
But that changed recently.

239
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,897
<i>Their failure and exposure
at the stash spot shows that.</i>

240
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:23,902
<i>It's also the reason their
boss, Omega One, himself,</i>

241
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:25,603
<i>has come to Los Angeles.</i>

242
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,075
<i>For Omega One to come here</i>

243
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:32,177
<i>and risk a fight with the LAPD means</i>

244
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,578
the situation is personal for him.

245
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:34,846
<i>He is not leaving</i>

246
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,915
until he finds Jubilee and his children.

247
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,049
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

248
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:41,019
<i>Rudi and Ela are his kids?</i>

249
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,654
This is a custody battle.

250
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,691
Hey, Luca, you said
your apartment was red-tagged

251
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,193
from the earthquake damage, right?

252
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,028
Yeah, got a lot of broken gas pipes,

253
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,363
cracks in my walls.

254
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,731
Just when I found a place I like,

255
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,359
poor Duke and I got to move.

256
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:55,867
Well, Annie and I
were looking at this place,

257
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,936
but it might be better suited
for you. It's a dollar house.

258
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,537
A dollar house in L.A.?

259
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,439
It doesn't actually cost
a dollar, but it's

260
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:03,575
available for about a quarter
of what it's really worth.

261
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,910
This that thing where, uh, Housing and
Urban Development offer homes

262
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,774
in at-risk neighborhoods
to police officers on the cheap?

263
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,573
Oh, yeah, it's supposed to build bonds

264
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,083
between the cops and
the neighborhoods, right?

265
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:14,486
Right, yeah. Didn't exactly
catch on in my dad's day.

266
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,055
Yeah, but Captain Cortez's
proposals have brought it back.

267
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,457
Always thought I'd wait till
I got married to buy a home.

268
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:22,660
But... moving from
apartment to apartment...

269
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,596
might be time to get my own place.

270
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,165
All right, just send me the listing.
I'll take a look later.

271
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,833
Place is right here.

272
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:31,669
This guy will modify anything
you want in bulletproof glass.

273
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,405
His name is Casino Gangster.

274
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:36,040
Hey, don't look at me like that.

275
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:37,967
It's the actual name
on his birth certificate.

276
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,616
That's a Desert Eagle.

277
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,251
It doesn't even penetrate
the first layer.

278
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,253
My bulletproof glass
is guaranteed for two years

279
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,455
or one shooting... whichever comes first.

280
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,490
Any of this legal, Mr. Gangster?

281
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:54,759
The business is fully licensed.

282
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,795
Yeah, some of your clients, not so much.

283
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,575
All right, Chastity,

284
00:13:58,609 --> 00:13:59,864
- you're up.
- Hey, hey.

285
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:02,100
Seriously? You test bulletproof glass

286
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,835
by shooting at women in bikinis?

287
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:06,271
Well, they're perfectly safe.
That's the point.

288
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,528
- And they get paid per round.
- Well, maybe

289
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:10,708
you should sit your butt
behind that glass in a Speedo.

290
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:11,943
If the price is right, sweetheart.

291
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,711
Excuse me?

292
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:14,979
All right, everyone out!

293
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,781
Let's go, you guys.

294
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:18,450
Take a hike.

295
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:19,809
Thank you.

296
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:25,223
Bulletproof SUVs driven
by Omegas. What do you know

297
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:26,558
- about 'em?
- Not a damn thing.

298
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:27,659
Look, you want us

299
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:29,060
to shut you down,
look into your customers,

300
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,895
see what kind of dirt
you do business with?

301
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,263
There's a woman named Jubilee
and her son Rudi.

302
00:14:32,298 --> 00:14:33,531
What do you know about them?

303
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:36,134
I don't know anything
about a lady and her kid.

304
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,970
Omegas... are great for business though.

305
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,339
Orders skyrocketed, 'cause every dealer

306
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:43,575
from Pico-Union to K-Town
is scared of whatever

307
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,009
they're planning in L.A.

308
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:47,884
A few weeks ago,

309
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:51,416
they ordered two cars customized
but only large-sized SUVs.

310
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,519
Omegas... never make
transactions in person.

311
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,087
They wouldn't even allow me to be present

312
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:57,755
when they picked up the finished trucks.

313
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,193
Give us the specs
you used on those trucks.

314
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:05,763
I want to know what kind of gun
defeats your glass.

315
00:15:05,798 --> 00:15:08,099
Yo, Tan, Judge Kumi's
fast-tracking our search warrant.

316
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:10,268
Narcotics I.D.'d
a Baja Diablo drug house,

317
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:11,903
and they got a few buys over there.

318
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:13,404
Once the warrant's ready,
I'm gonna send it to you

319
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,739
and I'll meet you there.

320
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:16,007
Yeah, good.

321
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,909
That's all we could ask for.

322
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:19,627
- See you in five.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,680
Nia.

324
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,150
Hondo.

325
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:25,517
- Hey.
- Pickin' up a warrant?

326
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,852
- Yeah.
- Thanks again for your texts.

327
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,621
I appreciate you checking up on me.

328
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:30,889
I see not even an earthquake
or a concussion

329
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:32,445
can stop you from doing your thing, huh?

330
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,725
Fully recovered.

331
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,461
They put me in that new hotel
up on Olympic.

332
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:38,696
Now it's back to business
on my bribery case.

333
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,598
Just taking a five while
the court reporter stretches

334
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:45,270
her fingers after my key witness
just testified for two hours.

335
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:46,538
Brave lady.

336
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,606
She killed it up on that stand.

337
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:50,375
Defendant is so screwed.

338
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,551
You know, it's amazing...
nothing makes a D.A. happier

339
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,451
than sending people to jail.

340
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,748
People who deserve it? Hell yeah.

341
00:15:56,782 --> 00:16:01,319
Don't tell me it's
not an aphrodisiac sometimes.

342
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:03,755
Listen, you
should stop by court sometime,

343
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,657
check out the trial
when you get a chance.

344
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:06,758
Look, uh,

345
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,493
I never said anything before.

346
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:10,828
But I came to the
hospital to check on you

347
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,163
when you were still unconscious.

348
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:14,132
Your husband was there.

349
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,967
Ah, did you see
his girlfriend there, too?

350
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,995
Blonde Amy?

351
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,838
Eric likes to act protective.

352
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:22,473
He's sentimental that way.

353
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:24,920
Divorce papers get signed this month.

354
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:26,611
All right,
let's move it. This way.

355
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,804
Somebody you put away?

356
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,979
No, no.

357
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,191
Somebody I tried to keep out.

358
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,832
What up, Darryl?

359
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,300
The sheriff told me

360
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:50,935
you just got charged with armed robbery.

361
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:53,371
That you and two of your boys jacked

362
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:56,374
a convenience store at gunpoint
and I told them, "Nah, nah.

363
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:58,876
There has to be some type of mistake."

364
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,713
Boy, you better look at me.

365
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:10,822
New tat, new scars.

366
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,791
When'd you get back into town?

367
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:14,826
Six months ago.

368
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,900
I thought we had a deal.

369
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,336
Darryl, you were gonna live right

370
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,572
if I sent you up north
to live with your Aunt Tanya.

371
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:29,007
Aunt Tanya got sick.

372
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,409
So I came to visit
my girl Heema for a week.

373
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,678
But then she got pregnant,
so I had to come back full-time

374
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:35,480
to take care of the baby and her.

375
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,547
And what type of job you got that's gonna

376
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:37,873
take care of all of that, Darryl?

377
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:40,852
Why didn't you just ask me for help?!

378
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:43,054
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

379
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,213
I do.

380
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,383
But it ain't your place
to take care of me.

381
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,695
Got to be my own man now.

382
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,163
Darryl, you are 15.

383
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,532
Same age my pops was
when he first went away.

384
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,804
Does your pops even know about this?

385
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,414
I'm gonna keep checking in on you.

386
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,550
But this ain't got to be your life.

387
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:18,483
Don't it?

388
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:51,360
What up, Leroy?

389
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,696
- How you feel, homie?
- I'm good.

390
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,911
Thanks for meeting me.

391
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:56,992
I figured you might be able
to give me some intel

392
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:59,326
on the Omegas, help me out with my case.

393
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,962
I got no connection
to the Omegas and no skin

394
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:05,399
in the heroin game,
but I stay up on things.

395
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,967
What do you want to know?

396
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:08,602
We both know what happens
out there gets watched

397
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:10,604
by people in here.
So I just wanted to see

398
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,006
if your eyes and ears
picked up on anything

399
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,173
that can help us.

400
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,808
Food chain remains the same.

401
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,211
Another day, same old beefs.

402
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:25,786
But, uh, that ain't the only
reason you came here, is it?

403
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,357
I know Darryl got himself arrested.

404
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,208
- Don't make me a proud father.
- You talk to him yet?

405
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:36,764
Boy thinks he can
handle things on his own.

406
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,532
Sounds like I used to sound.

407
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,801
But I plan on talking to him soon.

408
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:44,638
Leroy, he's still got a chance
to avoid doing serious time.

409
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:46,340
If he plays it right.

410
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:48,008
He can still turn his life around.

411
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:49,239
You think there's hope for him?

412
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,211
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

413
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:53,547
But only if he's got hope for himself.

414
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,716
And you know you're the only one
who can reach him.

415
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,384
I hear that.

416
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,153
I haven't been around
most of Darryl's life.

417
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:00,487
I hate everything about that.

418
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,644
I always hoped there'd be a day when

419
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,813
my influence held sway.

420
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,200
Like a real father.

421
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:11,398
That boy needs you now more than ever.

422
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:21,709
Jubilee and her children
were not kidnapped.

423
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:25,179
They were running from her
estranged husband, Omega One.

424
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:27,815
This guy forced her to marry him
after burning her village

425
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,579
down to the ground. Then came
two kids, Rudi and Ela.

426
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:31,752
Social Services was

427
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:34,421
on their way here to get Ela.
I sent them back.

428
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,256
We're gonna keep her in the
building under our protection.

429
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,893
That's a good idea, although
Omega One cares primarily

430
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:41,314
- about getting his son back.
- Yeah, the male heir

431
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,163
to his drug business.
The wife and daughter

432
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:44,665
obviously don't matter as much.

433
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:46,688
I'm loving this sexist ass more and more.

434
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:49,203
Jubilee's desperate. Her plan
must have been to come to L.A.,

435
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:51,238
hit up an Omega stash spot
and then use the cash

436
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,588
to disappear with the kids.

437
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:54,360
Except the Omegas found her,
nearly killed her,

438
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:55,876
and then forced her to leave without Ela.

439
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,911
Our search warrant paid off.
We leveraged the Baja Diablos

440
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,947
into pointing us to
an industrial warehouse

441
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:01,515
the Omegas were operating out of.

442
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:03,791
Unis found two gasoline drums,
no witnesses.

443
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,285
I know what that is.

444
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,222
Each has a body inside so badly
burnt they're unrecognizable.

445
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:10,424
Yeah, except for the
shirts found with them.

446
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,259
Those are the shooters
from the stash spot.

447
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,757
Omega One's cleaning up loose ends.

448
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:17,064
You've seen this before.

449
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:19,066
The Omegas torture people,

450
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,568
then dispose of their bodies
in gas drums.

451
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:22,803
It's what Omega One will do

452
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,705
to Jubilee for trying to take his son.

453
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:25,939
All right, well, Jubilee didn't

454
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,374
get any cash from the stash spot,

455
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:29,409
so she's got to be looking
to get money in other places.

456
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:31,945
These are suspected stash spots

457
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,580
where Omega One might keep his money.

458
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,812
Too many to send unis to each one.

459
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,551
So let's narrow down the
choices... I mean, just like

460
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:39,453
the DEA keeps tabs on the Omegas,

461
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,332
the Omegas know
exactly how the DEA moves.

462
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,056
So we need to think like Jubilee.

463
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,392
If I'm traveling with my young
son, I want to avoid places

464
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:46,755
where I can easily be trapped.

465
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,230
Look for larger venues where she
can use a crowd to blend into.

466
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,266
A few high-traffic casinos, hotels.

467
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,967
A horse track, a downtown bank.

468
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:55,188
All right, we're getting closer,

469
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:56,703
but we're not there yet.

470
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:59,239
Say, Hondo.

471
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,607
Yo, what's up, Deac?

472
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:02,342
You remember that friend
that you mentioned

473
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:04,645
that was looking to hire someone
to do security some nights?

474
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,181
Yeah, my boy Dee Fletch,
owns an R&B joint in Inglewood.

475
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,449
- Why, you know someone?
- Yeah, me.

476
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:12,186
I'm looking to moonlight
for some extra cash.

477
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,520
Doesn't pay much.

478
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:15,526
Ah, it's better than nothing, right?

479
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:17,991
Everything good with you?

480
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:20,427
Yeah. It's just, Matthew's doing karate

481
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,996
and-and Lila wants
to start this dance thing

482
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:24,498
which costs way more than I expected.

483
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:26,266
And that's before we
get to the little one

484
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,668
and the new baby room.

485
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:29,536
Being a good Catholic
sounds expensive, man.

486
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:32,306
- Tell me about it.
- But, yeah, yeah.

487
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,708
I'll call him, check,
see if he's still got a spot.

488
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:37,311
- Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

489
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:39,680
Hey, we still on for family
dinner this week? Annie's hoping

490
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:41,782
to meet at least some of your
family one of these days.

491
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:43,617
I don't know if you guys are
really ready for all that, man.

492
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:44,952
Trust me.

493
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,854
But, uh, you tell Annie I'll be there.

494
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:48,455
All right. Thanks again.

495
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:49,656
Uh-huh.

496
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:55,996
Excuse me, sir. Hey, you got a second?

497
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,171
Yeah, what do you need?

498
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,004
Well, you know I'm looking
for a new place to live.

499
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,034
Isn't this a monthly thing with you?

500
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:03,036
But I'm thinking
about planting roots

501
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,872
and I might put in a bid for a
place that Deacon recommended.

502
00:23:05,872 --> 00:23:07,272
The HUD advisory board is looking

503
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:09,742
for the best officer
candidate to move in.

504
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,944
I'm a single guy with a good rep

505
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:13,679
who might start a family
some day, you know,

506
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:16,148
engage in the neighborhood,
figure I got a shot.

507
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:19,351
But, if you could put
in a good word for me,

508
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:21,086
that would go a long way.

509
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:22,821
- You see the neighborhood this is in?
- Yeah, no, I know.

510
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:24,657
Normally, I'm really
picky about where I live,

511
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:26,525
but they say it's got a lot of character.

512
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,093
Well, that's one word for it.

513
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:29,795
What do you mean?

514
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:31,597
When you grew up with your father,
were you in the city limits?

515
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:33,298
No. Always in Simi Valley.

516
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,000
You know the reason for that.

517
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:36,935
Right. The last thing you want
is for people you police

518
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,937
to know where you live 'cause as a cop,

519
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:40,706
- that can make you a target.
- Exactly.

520
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,141
I mean, do you want to be driving home,

521
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:43,776
looking over both shoulders every night?

522
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,945
No, I get it, but there's got to
be a way to change that, right?

523
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,716
Hey, look, I don't
want to be a hard-ass.

524
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,720
I'll endorse this if you want,
but give it some thought.

525
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:57,156
You know, there's a, there's a saying

526
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,691
that your grandfather taught me

527
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:01,160
and you'd be wise to remember it.

528
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:03,162
"Just because you work at the dump,

529
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:05,097
it doesn't mean you have to live there."

530
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:11,537
Ela.

531
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:23,315
...Peppermint Crunch
and Banana Surprise and Peachy.

532
00:24:25,452 --> 00:24:27,186
I suck at this.

533
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,189
I think she's saying
that her mom is gonna

534
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:31,356
take her to see food.

535
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:33,192
Peppermint Crunch and Banana Surprise.

536
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,326
Wait a second.

537
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,314
Ask her about, um,

538
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,086
Swirly Whirly and Cherries Jubilee.

539
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,527
Ela...

540
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:49,508
See, your language skills are fine.

541
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,243
You just have to learn how
to speak seven-year-old girl.

542
00:24:51,277 --> 00:24:53,178
Those are <i>My Little Pony characters.</i>

543
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:54,513
Well, she said that her mom was gonna

544
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:56,448
take her and her brother to see them.

545
00:24:56,483 --> 00:24:59,384
Jubilee's going to a stash
spot at some toy store?

546
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:01,553
Or she's going to a place
where there are horses,

547
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:04,156
like a racetrack.

548
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:45,964
Hello, Jubilee.

549
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,379
We got to clear this location.

550
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:05,805
We got to find Jubilee and her son.

551
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,584
Move, move!

552
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,434
Put your weapons down!

553
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:27,303
They have another one of those monsters!

554
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:29,505
We've got to stop them
before they get Jubilee inside.

555
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,632
I got this.

556
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,411
Concentrate 20 rounds in the same spot.

557
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:36,512
Light 'em up!

558
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,921
Forward! Move forward!

559
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:47,991
Hands on the ground or you're dead!

560
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,159
Get on the ground!

561
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,128
- Deacon! Deacon!
- I'm with you!

562
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:53,718
- Stay down! Stay down! Don't move!
- Don't move!

563
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:55,973
- Do not move! Stay down!
- Nobody move!

564
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,648
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

565
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:02,896
We can't let him get away, Deac.

566
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:04,857
Can't shoot him here, either;
watch the background.

567
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,494
That all of them?

568
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:08,669
Yeah.

569
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:10,123
No sign of Omega One.

570
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:12,866
But we got Jubilee and Rudi back alive.

571
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:21,075
Yo, Hondo, you mind if I pick your brain?

572
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:22,886
Anything you need, man, what's up?

573
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:25,393
Thinking about doing that
good neighbor house program.

574
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:27,366
- Ha. Congrats, man.
- Thanks, man.

575
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,778
Which neighborhood?

576
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:31,752
- East Hollywood.
- Okay. That's cool.

577
00:28:31,786 --> 00:28:33,354
Only I'm not so sure about it.

578
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:36,056
I mean, you've lived in the city
your whole life. Right?

579
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,992
Most cops don't do that. So, why do you?

580
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:42,429
Well, it's a little different for
me, man. That's where I'm from.

581
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:44,652
I mean, if I was moving to a
new area for the first time,

582
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:46,900
maybe that might make it different.

583
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,460
But would you still do it?

584
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,905
Look, I get there's risk involved.

585
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,707
I mean, if I had a wife
and a family, I mean,

586
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:56,176
that might change my thinking.

587
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:57,638
But you want to make a difference

588
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,888
- in people's lives, right?
- Mm-hmm.

589
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,721
And sometimes you get to wondering

590
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,551
if good intentions are enough.

591
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:08,889
But, that being said, I
believe in good intentions

592
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,565
and that's why I do this.

593
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:14,986
And a lot of the time, I
can't do that with a gun.

594
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,768
We have Ela safe.
We're taking you to her now.

595
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,002
I went back for her.

596
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,804
By the time I went back,
she was already with you.

597
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:27,173
I would never leave my baby all alone.

598
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:28,428
I would never, ever do that.

599
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:29,976
We know. A-And she's okay.

600
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,444
Do you think she will forgive me?

601
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,046
I think she'll be happy
to see that you're alive.

602
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,281
I'm so sorry this happened.

603
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,216
Hey! And I'm sorry for this, too.

604
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:39,686
- Kamile, stop!
- No! No!

605
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,287
What are you doing? I'm taking the boy.

606
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,488
What? No, please, please!

607
00:29:42,523 --> 00:29:44,457
Not another word

608
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,658
or I will shoot him.

609
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:47,827
Jessica, your car keys.

610
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:51,331
Don't do this.

611
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:52,665
You're working for him now?

612
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,335
No. That's the last thing I'd do.

613
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:58,304
I've been trying to find
Omega One for a year and a half.

614
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,706
Nobody can get to him.

615
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,675
With his son, now I can.

616
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,976
Rudi! No!

617
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,913
- Why?
- My sister. Oba.

618
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,083
When I got too close to the Omegas,

619
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:12,151
they put her in a gasoline drum.

620
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:15,321
And I'm sorry. But don't ruin
your life by doing this.

621
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:18,024
The sacrifices we make, right?

622
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:22,543
At least I can stop a monster
before he hurts anyone else.

623
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:25,031
- Rudi, no! No, Rudi, no!
- Kamile!

624
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:26,999
Rudi!

625
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,779
Rudi!

626
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:29,869
Rudi, no!

627
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:31,537
- Kamile!
- Rudi!

628
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:34,307
Rudi!

629
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,973
Should be able to track
the GPS in your car.

630
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,141
Kamile won't get far.

631
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,709
She's not trying to get away.

632
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:46,812
It's a suicide mission to kill Omega One.

633
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,480
She's planning this as she goes,

634
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,682
probably using an Omega
burner phone to contact him.

635
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,884
Take Jubilee back to HQ.

636
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,686
GPS from your car shows
it's a few miles away.

637
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,888
- Where?
- Industrial area.

638
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,524
Any refineries nearby? Or truck stops?

639
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,759
You're thinking someplace
with a gasoline drum.

640
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:02,260
Yeah.

641
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:17,943
Where's Omega One?

642
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,078
- Where's the boy?
- We agreed on the phone.

643
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:22,881
I want $5 million
in exchange for his son.

644
00:31:23,406 --> 00:31:25,050
$5 million inside.

645
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,551
I told you.

646
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:30,021
Omega One hands the money
to me, personally.

647
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,057
Not happening. Where is the boy?

648
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:35,427
Rudi is inside this gasoline drum.

649
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:38,763
Don't shoot. He's still alive.

650
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:42,567
Omega One tortures people
before putting them in drums.

651
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,569
I didn't do that,

652
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:47,556
but if he doesn't come now...

653
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:52,177
he'll see what I'm willing to do
to his flesh and blood.

654
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,780
Okay.

655
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:00,085
Please. Don't hurt my boy.

656
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,753
This is what you do to everyone else.

657
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,196
Let him go.

658
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,825
You shoot me, they shoot you dead.

659
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,561
I'm okay with that.

660
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:14,087
Let me see your hands!

661
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:15,800
We have guns on you right now! Hands!

00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,698
So what now?

679
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,399
Hondo spoke with the DEA.

680
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,401
They're working on relocating
Jubilee and her family.

681
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,638
Give them new identities,
new place to live.

682
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,554
- New start.
- Right.

683
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,509
- Nice job.
- Not really.

684
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:34,212
You guys brought in
the bad guys. What did I do?

685
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:35,814
You really don't see it?

686
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,849
Treat people like family.

687
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,217
What you did with Ela
was just as important

688
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:40,418
as what we did out there.

689
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,153
You did what you were asked to do.

690
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,035
People notice that.

691
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:51,696
I'm gonna take off.

692
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:59,710
Sir, I wanted you to know
I'm sorry about Kamile.

693
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,840
I should've done better.

694
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,509
We wouldn't have found the mom
and the kid without her help.

695
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,379
It was a tough call, plus,
you knew how to bring her in,

696
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,906
and that's what matters.
You did your job.

697
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:12,751
Hey.

698
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:16,121
It's not easy finding the
balance between life and work.

699
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,124
Kamile obviously struggled with that.

700
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,892
The sacrifices we make.

701
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,396
I raised a family
while doing this job.

702
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,765
I don't think I ever really
figured it out.

703
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,366
Might be different for a man.

704
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,469
Well, probably is,

705
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:33,638
but the sacrifices are there
no matter what.

706
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:36,331
- Hmm.
- You know,

707
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,909
the past few years without Barb,

708
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:40,638
I've had to do things on my own.

709
00:34:40,673 --> 00:34:44,115
A lot of stress, a lot of mistakes,

710
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,067
a lot of compromises.

711
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:50,822
But trying to find that balance,
that's what keeps me sane.

712
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:54,045
You good?

713
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:56,328
I'm good.

714
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,787
All right.

715
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,674
- You talk to Darryl?
- Yeah.

716
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:12,277
Good. All right, look,
I've been doing some research.

717
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:13,878
I got a friend who's a D.A.

718
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:15,180
- Hondo.
- No, listen, listen.

719
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,782
State props give discretion
to courts as to whether or not

720
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:18,983
to charge a juvenile as an adult.

721
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,352
Hondo.

722
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:23,455
I talked to my son.

723
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,357
He's no Einstein.
He ain't going to college.

724
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:26,925
Hell, he ain't gonna finish high school.

725
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:30,528
Okay, but as long as he can
avoid doing a serious stint,

726
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:31,963
I might still have a chance

727
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,079
to get him into the Marines when he's 18.

728
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:37,702
Maybe this is his best path.

729
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:39,704
What path?

730
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:41,139
Look, I thought about it.

731
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,310
I thought about when you, me,
and big Darryl used to hang.

732
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,312
Now, you realize, of the three of us,

733
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,215
one is dead, one is in prison,
and the other is you.

734
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:52,617
I think about that all the time.

735
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,286
Odds ain't never been great, dawg.

736
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,988
Not everybody can be Hondo.

737
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,723
Look,

738
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:02,327
I tried to keep my son out of the life,

739
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,996
but he just keeps looking for it.

740
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,398
Maybe it's for a reason.

741
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:08,299
It's not, Leroy.

742
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,735
He got a baby on the way now.
He got bills.

743
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,303
Okay, what does that mean?

744
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,572
So what, you're just, you're
gonna give up on your son?

745
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,008
Don't ever say that.

746
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,211
If this is the life he's gonna choose,

747
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:22,247
I should prepare him,

748
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,848
hook him up with the right people,

749
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:26,718
help him survive it, thrive in it.

750
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,354
How do you measure success in this life?

751
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,523
Stay alive?

752
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,525
Earn respect? Come on, man.

753
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,760
Watch your tone.

754
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:39,831
This is the same ghetto rap

755
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,232
you've been spitting since day one.

756
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:45,437
I've known you my entire life, Leroy.

757
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,773
Your granddaddy did time.

758
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,526
Your pops did time.

759
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,879
Darryl's supposed to be the one
to break that cycle.

760
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:59,784
Yeah, but it's my cycle
because he's my son, not yours.

761
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,964
Leroy.

762
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,472
Darryl might be guilty,

763
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:24,075
but there are still
plea deals to be made, man.

764
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:27,378
Ways of making sure that his
future isn't completely ruined.

765
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:30,273
I ain't giving up.

766
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:34,085
I'm never gonna quit on him.

767
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:38,195
I know.

768
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:44,155
But nobody's asking for
your help here anymore.

769
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:51,736
Sometimes things don't work out.

770
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:55,006
Sometimes it just be that way.

771
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,679
Appreciate you checking in, though, dawg.

772
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,790
Ah, here we go.

773
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:14,792
Come on.

774
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,497
Whoa.

775
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:21,533
This redefines "do it yourself."

776
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:24,661
- Hmm.
- I tried to warn you, Luca.

777
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:35,513
Hey. This neighborhood
got a graffiti problem?

778
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:37,727
- It does.
- Well, what's the point of doing that?

779
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:40,118
Well, every day, there's graffiti.

780
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:44,022
Every night, I'm here to paint it over.

781
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,123
Hmm.

782
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,125
You're a cop, right? How'd you know?

783
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,793
Look like one.

784
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:50,595
Are you moving here?

785
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:53,498
Uh... I'm thinking on it.

786
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,316
All right, thanks.

787
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:58,970
- You ever own a house?
- First one.

788
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,939
- You got a mortgage guy?
- Nah.

789
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:02,640
I'm just gonna pay cash.

790
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:04,500
I mean, it's a good price, right?

791
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:07,345
Plus, I've been
saving money up for years.

792
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,480
Used to call it "screw you
money" that I could live on

793
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:11,249
if anyone ever tried
to get me to do something

794
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:12,350
I didn't believe in.

795
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,252
Money to quit your job?

796
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:15,753
Maybe you shouldn't tell me that.

797
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:20,158
Now, I'm thinking, I'm thinking
I could fix this place up.

798
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,595
I could put a pool table
in the living room,

799
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:25,864
big screen for the PlayStation.

800
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:27,465
Oh, yeah.

801
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,300
Hell yeah.

802
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:31,202
I got a feeling we're gonna be responding

803
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:33,705
to a lot of noise complaints here.

804
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,507
Duke! Look what we got.

805
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:44,590
Hey.

806
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,216
Hey.

807
00:39:46,477 --> 00:39:48,145
Everything okay?

808
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:50,830
Honestly, no.

809
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,827
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

810
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,346
You know, Nia,

811
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:11,462
when I was training
to be a cop...

812
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,644
my goal...

813
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,849
was to help people,

814
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:19,717
like my friend's son Darryl.

815
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:20,985
From what I know about you,

816
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,687
I'm sure you did help him.

817
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:27,125
Did I really? I mean, really?

818
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:30,661
I mean, you're a D.A.

819
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:33,623
You know the way it goes.

820
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:38,809
No matter the intentions we may have,

821
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:41,639
even when we put ourselves out there...

822
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:45,718
...it doesn't matter.

823
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,348
Just more holes in the dam to plug.

824
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:53,318
So? Then we just keep
plugging them, right?

825
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,422
I hear what you're saying.

826
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:01,259
You want to be the change.

827
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,128
But, ultimately,

828
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:06,898
you don't know if you'll ever
really be able to.

829
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:16,274
There's a quote my father used to say:

830
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,627
"I can't be a pessimist
because I'm alive.

831
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,882
"I'm forced to believe
that we can survive

832
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,285
whatever we must survive."

833
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,266
James Baldwin.

834
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,688
My mother used to read
the same thing to me.

835
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,467
We don't have a choice

836
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,318
but to be optimists.

837
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,605
But being an optimist is a burden.

838
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:49,974
It means

839
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,492
a lot of disappointment,

840
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:54,245
and sometimes,

841
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:57,415
a little anger.

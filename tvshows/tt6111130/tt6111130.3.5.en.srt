1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,792
Previously on SWAT...David.

2
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:15,972
Lieutenant Detective
Piper Lynch.

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,452
You worked with her
in Hollywood.

4
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,932
How much political
juice does she have?

5
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:22,674
The mayor's placing me here
as a consultant outside
the chain of command,

6
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,981
to reorient your thinking
about what SWAT can do.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,722
Be safe.

8
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,115
Interesting lady.

9
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:30,595
Imagine these culinary treats
could come to you.

10
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:31,944
Like a delivery service?Better.

11
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,990
Food truck.
This could be a team investment.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,079
I can't invest in the food truck
right now.

13
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,820
I can't swing it either, Luca.

14
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,561
I know Tan and Street
are in the same boat.

15
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,606
You can put me down for $5K.

16
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,915
Pop, you are sick. I know I'm sick!

17
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,264
I don't deserve your help.

18
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:48,918
You know what?
Maybe you don't.

19
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,833
But you damn sure
gonna get it.

20
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,095
So that's what's up?

21
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,923
That's what's up.

22
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,968
Okay, then.

23
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,418
You see them?

24
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,377
Can't see anything yet.

25
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,640
But we know that truck's coming.

26
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,537
I'm taking fire!

27
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,104
Breaking off!

28
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,022
L.A. police convoy.
We're taking shots.

29
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,197
Send all available units.

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,200
LAPD!

31
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:39,202
Official convoy!
Drop the weapon!

32
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,516
No, Don Dada.

33
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:00,136
Come on, Pop.

34
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,833
Let's get the damn thing
over with.

35
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,879
It could be good news.

36
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,533
I want to thank you
for coming in.

37
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,796
I know it wasn't easy.

38
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,624
Yeah, well, my boy
wouldn't let it go.

39
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,278
Even more stubborn
than his mama.

40
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,629
So, Doc, what's the word?

41
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,544
Uh, the word
is not good.

42
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,937
The X-rays we did
on your lungs

43
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:21,549
show an abnormal mass
right here.

44
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,856
And we took a look at the sputum
that you've been coughing up.

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,771
Found cancer cells.

46
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,428
So, lung cancer.

47
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:32,821
Listen, the
cancer can take

48
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,823
different forms, some more
dangerous than others.

49
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,304
There are things
we can do to fight it,

50
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,741
but I want to do a
biopsy immediately

51
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:41,699
so we can learn more
about what we're facing.

52
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
Thanks, Doc.
I'll think about it.

53
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,314
Okay.

54
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:48,576
Why don't I leave you
to discuss.

55
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,235
Hey, hey.
Hold up. Hold up.

56
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,323
What do you mean
you got to think about it?

57
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,846
What the hell is there
to think about?

58
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,282
You forced me
to get an X-ray,

59
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:00,588
so I got the X-ray.

60
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,372
We already knew
something was wrong.

61
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,200
I ain't doing no operation.

62
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,593
Look at that.

63
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,290
You got no choice.All I got to do

64
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,639
is stay black and die.

65
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:10,206
Young buck,
go around there

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,425
and get my car
and bring it around front.

67
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,339
No.

68
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,166
Pop, I thought
we agreed

69
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,298
we're gonna fight
this together.

70
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,866
Everybody says you got to fight.

71
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,302
That's a bunch of bull.

72
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,957
A lot of strong people
fight and they die.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,438
Survival is about luck.

74
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,310
And mine
ain't been the greatest.

75
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:30,966
Didn't smoke one day in my life,
and I got lung cancer.

76
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,664
Well, if you ain't
gonna get my car,

77
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,405
I'll get it my damn self.

78
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,367
I got his keys.

79
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,194
He's not going anywhere.

80
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,719
Get my pops home.
I got to go.

81
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,547
A police officer's been shot.

82
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,244
Check it.

83
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,376
Artist friend of mine
offered to design

84
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,986
the logo for
my food truck.

85
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,161
Nice. These
images are fresh.

86
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,163
Right? That's badass
right there.

87
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,208
Hey, uh, Luca.Yo.

88
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,732
I heard Hondo
kicked in $5,000

89
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:58,950
to buy a share
of your food truck.

90
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:00,387
Yeah, he's the first backer
on record.

91
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,302
Yeah. I-I know
I said I was out, but I checked

92
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,347
with some friends,
and Guatemalan cuisine
is getting hot.

93
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,522
They think I should be
all over it.

94
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,176
They even gave me
suggestions of locations

95
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,351
that could bring in
a lot of business.

96
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,570
So I started thinking.

97
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,615
I want in, too.

98
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,834
You sure?I just had

99
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:14,226
to check the prospects.
Wanted to make sure.

100
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,967
Okay. But, um,

101
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,926
there's some guys from 50-Squad
that I promised I'd hold spots.

102
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,842
So, before I accept, let me
just, uh, check some things.

103
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,060
I'll get back to you, okay?

104
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,106
Sure. No problem.

105
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,021
Okay.
What's up, man?

106
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,239
How are Annie and the kids
doing, Deac?

107
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,458
Good, I think.

108
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,112
They took a quick trip
down to San Diego

109
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,243
with my sister-in-law.

110
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,158
The, uh, kids still insist

111
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,943
on sleeping in the same room
as Annie.

112
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:37,075
Can't be easy, with your house
getting shot up, man.

113
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:41,036
No, but, uh, you know,
we're-we're managing.

114
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,038
Thanks for getting me out of
the house for a couple hours.

115
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,474
Are you kidding me, man?
Thanks for coming.

116
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,346
Food is ridiculous,
as always.Right?

117
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,260
I heard Hondo bought
into the food truck.

118
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:49,958
Yeah.

119
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,177
Listen, Annie and
I were talking.

120
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:54,179
And, uh...

121
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:57,182
you were there for us in a
major way when we needed money.

122
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,184
And we'd like to
return the favor.

123
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,882
Nah, Deac, I'm not looking
for any favors.

124
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,753
I was just offering you
a business opportunity.

125
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,755
Yeah, no, I know. I talked
to a financial advisor.

126
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,322
He's got a client who
invested in a food truck,

127
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,193
and it's doing really well.

128
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:11,458
And, I mean, if run properly
and hitting the right spots,

129
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,459
it could really work.

130
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:13,764
And-and like you said,

131
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,418
this food is
gonna sell itself.Yeah.

132
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,420
I'm still a little tight,

133
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,291
paying you back
the money I owe you.

134
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:22,033
But I was wondering
if you'd be willing

135
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,514
to take $2,500 of what
I'm to pay you back

136
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,037
against a share.

137
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,562
I can get someone from 50-Squad
to put up another 25

138
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:31,434
and then split that share.

139
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:33,218
Nice, Deac.

140
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,437
I'll consider it.

141
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,438
Hey.

142
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:36,874
Cop's been shot.

143
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:42,576
What's the word?Hicks is in court today,
so I'm running point.

144
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,404
Officer Ed Hawks.

145
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,449
He's in critical condition
at a hospital in Long Beach.

146
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,972
There's a chance
he won't make it.

147
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,192
So he was shot during
an armed robbery?

148
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,672
What's the stolen cargo? An 18-wheeler

149
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,890
full of long gun
assault rifles.

150
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,283
Every year, when LAPD

151
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,111
property rooms get full of guns
from closed cases,

152
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,460
they ship 'em out
to be melted

153
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,027
and destroyed.The Big Burn

154
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,594
tends to be
need-to-know only.Yeah, most people don't know

155
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,857
any details about it
what time the convoy rolls out,

156
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,032
what route it takes.

157
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,512
But this crew knew
enough to pull off

158
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,644
a well-coordinated
assault.The Jeeps they drove in

159
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,298
match the description
of vehicles stolen

160
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,387
from a dealership in
Mission Viejo a week ago.

161
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,476
They fired shots
to deter the LAPD airship.

162
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,305
Drove into controlled
airspace, evaded pursuit.

163
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,654
Careful planning.

164
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,091
There's got to be a leak
somewhere.In the LAPD?

165
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:21,876
Leading to a cop maybe dying?
There better not be.

166
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,921
We have to consider
all possibilities.

167
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:26,358
You know, a lot of these guns
were used in cases SWAT closed.

168
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:29,884
.50-cals, HK416s,
M14s, AUG A2s...

169
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,494
Capable of firing .223 rounds

170
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:32,756
through SWAT body armor,

171
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,541
over a thousand rounds
per minute.

172
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,020
And now they're in the hands
of a crew

173
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,500
who's willing
to shoot the police.

174
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:22,719
Since our truck
was found abandoned

175
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,199
in Long Beach,
I've cozied up

176
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,549
with Long Beach PD
to help track down this crew.

177
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,769
This is
Detective Herb Gordon, LBPD.

178
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,335
Detective.
Sergeant Kay.

179
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:32,512
Jim Street.

180
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,035
I heard you left Long Beach
and made Metro SWAT.

181
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,037
I just didn't believe
it until now.

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,256
We're a long way
from being boots, huh?

183
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,389
Rocking polyester
in the LBC.

184
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,130
How is Long Beach?Well, you are missed.

185
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:44,175
Our, uh, sympathies
are with your officer

186
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,307
and his family.

187
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,091
We know he was injured
in Long Beach,

188
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,658
so we're here to help.Well, it's our guns

189
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,225
that could be unleashed
in your streets,

190
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,053
so both departments
are highly motivated.

191
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,358
Our mayor's
chatted with yours.

192
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,317
Resources are at each
other's disposal.

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,102
And that includes using our
Southeast Division as a hub.

194
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,670
Now, we're not as, um,
high-tech as you guys,

195
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,977
but we're, uh, we're in
the middle of this search.

196
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,979
We'll work with the ATF,
checking local gun shows

197
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:07,198
and dealers for any signs
of those stolen weapons.

198
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,678
Technically, I'm
here as a consultant,

199
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,767
outside the chain of command,
but may I also suggest

200
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:13,248
checking with undercover
gang and narco officers.

201
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,684
You think these weapons
could be sold to the hood

202
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,381
or south of the border
to the cartels?

203
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:17,513
Absolutely.

204
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,907
You know, uh,
I grew up in Long Beach.

205
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,386
If these guys are
dealing guns there,

206
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,215
I may know a source that
could help us track 'em down.

207
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,042
All right, great.

208
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,478
I'll go with you.
Okay.

209
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,655
Hey, Deac. Deac. I got
an idea of who our leak is.

210
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,439
Police convoys
are partly arranged

211
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,919
by property officers, right?

212
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:34,225
They keep track of, uh,
booked evidence, including guns.

213
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:36,401
And they're civilians. They're
not sworn officers of the law.Right.

214
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,403
So I looked up property
officers. I found this guy.

215
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,057
Dennis Upton.

216
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,319
He was scheduled
to work today.

217
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,494
Called in sick
at the last second.

218
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:43,800
Well, isn't that convenient?Yeah.

219
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:44,845
All right, tell you what.

220
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,324
You take Tan and Chris.

221
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:49,153
Go see how sick
this guy really is.

222
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,068
I just got a call
from the hospital.

223
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,722
Officer Hawks
is between surgeries.

224
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:55,290
He's conscious now.

225
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,249
How well do you know him?

226
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,948
Keen observer,
aren't you, Sergeant?

227
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,950
Hawks was my partner

228
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,300
when we were detectives
in Hollywood Division.

229
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,345
Well, I was thinking
we should go talk to him,

230
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:09,347
see what he knows that might
help us identify these guys.

231
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,568
Uh, may not be the best
time for us to chat.

232
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,831
He stepped down from
detective last year.

233
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,659
I helped him get the
convoy assignment.

234
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,140
I told him it'd
be an easy gig.

235
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,968
Guess I was wrong.

236
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,367
Luca, you're the ranking
P-three-plus-one.

237
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,239
How do you want
to play this?

238
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:33,284
Well, as my dad used to say,

239
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,331
always start
by knocking on the door.

240
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:39,682
Sound like they're coming
from the backyard.

241
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,118
Chris, Tan, two side.
I got the four.

242
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:55,002
LAPD! Put your
weapon down!

243
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,874
I said put your gun down!Okay, okay.

244
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,484
Dennis Upton? Thought you
were under the weather.

245
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,704
We were gonna bring soup, but it
doesn't look like you need it.

246
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,706
Is that a tommy gun?

247
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,407
LAPD convoy got
ripped off this morning.

248
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:12,106
You got over a thousand assault
rifles in your storage shed.

249
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,498
It's not a good look.

250
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,065
You think
I ripped off the police?

251
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,763
Come on, I'm not that crazy.

252
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,286
You're also not that sick.

253
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:21,463
Yeah, I stayed home to do
target practice for my podcast.

254
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,247
It's called Two Tickets to the Gun Show.

255
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,988
That's original.

256
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,599
Firing assault weapons
in California is illegal.

257
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,905
I'm just a collector.

258
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,038
I mean, that tommy gun
belonged to Mickey Cohen.

259
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,214

This piece right here,

260
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,389
Pablo Escobar.

261
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:35,825
And that,
that was used

262
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,609
in the North Hollywood
shoot-out.

263
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,046
Oh, so you buy guns
from real-life crimes?

264
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,744
Yes, but not
today's real-life crime.

265
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:42,789
You sure about that?

266
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,268
This is a special edition Uzi

267
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,096
with Gilly Gembetta's name
engraved on it.

268
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,446
I know, because I booked it
into evidence last year.

269
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,796
It has 11 bodies on it.

270
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,101
The serial number's
been filed off,

271
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,799
but it was definitely inside
that hijacked truck.

272
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:55,192
Did you hear a cop got shot
during that hijacking?

273
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,152
Okay.

274
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,850
Okay, okay, all right,
I'm in real trouble.

275
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,286
I get it.
Yeah, yeah, you are.

276
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,159
I didn't want anybody getting
shot, especially a cop.

277
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,944
It's just I bought guns
from these guys before.

278
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,338
They gave me a great deal.
If I gave them intel

279
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,556
on the convoy,
they'd let me pick

280
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,036
any piece I wanted
from the truck.

281
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,430
I mean, do you know
what the LAPD was gonna do

282
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:17,301
with this work of art?
Melt it.

283
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,739
Who'd you deal with?I don't know her name.

284
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,566
Some lady with an accent.

285
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,439
Sounds Jamaican.Jamaicans
with big guns?

286
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,093
Could be the Chaos Posse.

287
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,485
Jamaican gunrunners?They got no problem

288
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,096
targeting cops work
mainly on the East Coast,

289
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,532
but this definitely
fits their M.O.

290
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,187
Okay, everything that you
got on these Jamaicans.

291
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,711
I mean everything,
no more games.

292
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,017
Okay.

293
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,888
Thanks, Luca.

294
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,195
Chaos Posse operates
in Miami and New York.

295
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,371
What are they
doing in L.A.?
Expansion?

296
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,895
Basic corporate economics
you're either getting bigger

297
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,724
or you're getting smaller.Well, finding out who
they're selling to

298
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,335
won't be easy Chaos Posse
doesn't leave loose ends.

299
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,345
Hey, Ed.

300
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,173
It's me.

301
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:05,219
Look, you know I
can't stay long.

302
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,742
The people who did this,

303
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,744
anything you remember
about them?

304
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,795

Don Dada.

305
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,319
No, no. Piper Lynch,

306
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,190
if you don't get out
of this room...

307
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,713
I'm sorry. I'm done.
I'm-I'm leaving.

308
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,193
Miss, miss, miss, miss.

309
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,369
I'm Sergeant Harrelson,
LAPD SWAT.

310
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,632
Pamela Hawks.
Ed's wife.

311
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,417
You're a piece of
work coming here.

312
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,333
I'm just trying to help find
who did this to him.

313
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:33,595
Well, help somewhere else.

314
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,992
Mrs. Hawks, it's been
an emotional day.

315
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:41,429
We just needed to ask
a few questions of your husband.

316
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,779
I'm sure he's happy
to see you.

317
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,438

Hi.

318
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,659
Thanks, Asafa. You, too.

319
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:57,184
You want to tell me
what that was?

320
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:59,839
Not especially. Hawks
gave me something, though.

321
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,406
The guy who shot him
was called Don Dada.

322
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,800
It's a term of respect,
probably a street moniker.

323
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,890
Maybe it'll get
us a real I.D.

324
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:14,244
So this source that we're
looking for is an arms dealer?

325
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,246
Mm, he grew up in a
family of gunrunners.

326
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,726
He's not a criminal.

327
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,902
You think that dressing
in civvies is...

328
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:21,948
gonna help us
with this informant?

329
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,037
He's not exactly
an informant.

330
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,342
He's a...

331
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,171
...my brother.

332
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,216
Streeter.

333
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,695
Nate.

334
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,654
It's good to see you.
Back in the LBC.

335
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:34,351
Yeah, man.You're Street's brother?

336
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,310
Foster brother.
Nate Warren.

337
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:39,182
David Kay. After everything
went down with my parents,

338
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:41,881
I moved to a group home
I used to get my ass beat

339
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,360
on the regular
till Nate taught me

340
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:46,450
how to fight.You had a decent
knuckle game to start.

341
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:48,278
It's been a minute.I know.

342
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,367
Lot of memories.

343
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,326
Yeah.

344
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,591
Listen, uh, the reason I'm here
is I need your help.

345
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,420
So you're here to ask a favor?

346
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,248
Seriously?

347
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:09,691
Nate and I used to be
really close.

348
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,172
He's older, so he left
the group home first.

349
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:13,695
But he was always
checking on me.

350
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:16,393
When I got old enough,
I left, too, but I kind of

351
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:17,829
never looked back.So you ghosted him.

352
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,483
Not exactly, but...

353
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,268
I needed a clean slate.

354
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:22,878
I don't think
he sees it that way.

355
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
Yeah.

356
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:27,274
You never visited.I checked in a few times,

357
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:28,362
to see where we stood.

358
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:31,321
But you didn't care to find out.

359
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:35,673
Street. Hondo got a hit
on our shooter.

360
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,286
ATF database identified
Don Dada as Isaac Irie.

361
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:41,418
Now, he was charged in Queens
for shooting an ATF officer,

362
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,420
but everyone set to testify
against him disappeared

363
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,118
before the trial
even started.

364
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,208
This guy ties up loose ends
and he's dangerous.

365
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,210
You getting anywhere
with your brother?

366
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,473
Don't worry. This is
just how we say hello

367
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,301
in the LBC.

368
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,433
You remember when we
took that blood oath?

369
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,044
You really pulling
that card, bruh?

370
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,654
We were stupid teenagers.

371
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,873
You told me if I
ever needed anything,

372
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,224
I could ask three favors,
and no matter what,

373
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,921
you would have my back.

374
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,011
The first favor was
when you borrowed my chopper

375
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,926
to impress Meg Ullman, right?

376
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,536
You crashed it on the PCH.

377
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,148
And the second favor was
for you to forgive me.

378
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,412
But I never cashed in
the third one, not until now.

379
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,501
The Chaos Posse is
in Long Beach.

380
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,024
They shot a cop.

381
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:24,374
And now they got
a truckload of guns.

382
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,465
When the Chaos Posse
gets cornered,

383
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,033
they'd rather be buried
by six than judged by 12.

384
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,035
People are
scared of them.

385
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,038
But this bar's like a big TV
set with huge antennas, man.

386
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,388
Lot of roughnecks
roll through here.

387
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,000
Things get said,

388
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,003
and I hear a lot
of those things.

389
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,830
But I'll get into it.

390
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,354

Thank you.

391
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,051
Let me know.

392
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,054
Thank you.

393
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,100
You know, Lynch,
in my experience,

394
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,754
when a cop's wife is pissed off
at a former female partner,

395
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,147
it tends to be
for one reason.

396
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,367
I thought you were SWAT,
not a detective.

397
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,369
You came in looking
at all our files.

398
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:06,242
You hit me up about my one SWAT
reprimand from a decade ago.

399
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,029
You seem to know
a lot about us,

400
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,422
but you don't want us to know
anything about you.

401
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,337
You and Hawks?

402
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,340
First rule you learn
as a lady cop

403
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:19,342
Don't get involved
with other cops.

404
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,648
And yet?

405
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,128
And yet.

406
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,395
Yeah, go ahead, Street.

407
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,484
Roger that.
Street's source came through.

408
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:33,226
We got an address
on the Chaos Posse's hideout.

409
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,452
Nate says the woman
who owns the strip club

410
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,715
is Isaac Irie's
West Coast sidepiece.

411
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:49,111
All right, listen up.
We got eyes on the location.

412
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,200
Visual on the one and two sides.

413
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,680
All's quiet
on the Western Front.

414
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:55,291
Right now,
we're watching air move.

415
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,032
22-David in position.
I have a visual

416
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,426
on the four side;
Long Beach patrol
has the three side.

417
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,210
This is Detective Gordon.
I authored a search warrant.

418
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:02,603
Got it signed.
Ready to roll.

419
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,300
Deac, I'm still
five minutes out.

420
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:05,606
Don't wait on me.Roger that.

421
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:06,955
Chris, initiate.

422
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,568
LAPD! Search warrant!

423
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,179
Get down!

424
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,397
Down, down, down, down!

425
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,399
Down.

426
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,274
Take cover!

427
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,406
Shots fired! Shots fired!

428
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,803
24-David has eyes on shooter!

429
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,021
In pursuit!

430
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,240
Hands!

431
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:33,329
Switching to beanbag.

432
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,427
We've got movement
on the two side

433
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,299
black Jeep matching description
from the hijacking.

434
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,171
Don't move! Hands!Out of the car!

435
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,433
Get out of the car!Hands, now!

436
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:51,652
Hands!

437
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,884
Street! Luca!
You hold down the fort!

438
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,625
Let's see if we can get
a better shot!Roger that.

439
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,674
Hey! Time to go!

440
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,400
Searched the Chaos Posse's
hideout, top to bottom.

441
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:47,142
Found fake passports,
but no sign of long guns.

442
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,492
Recovered two AUG A2s
off the dead posse members.But the majority

443
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,843
of the stolen guns are still
in the wind with Isaac.

444
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,673
Welcome to Long Beach
Southeast Division.

445
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:58,022
Short on manpower today,

446
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,808
due to training exercises
in Carlsbad.

447
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,333
Travis.
Yeah.

448
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:07,380
As I said, it's a little
different flavor here.

449
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,776
Thanks.

450
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,909
Hey. You guys LAPD?

451
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,389
Has my bail
been paid yet?

452
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,391
Can you tell me why
I'm still here?

453
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,393
Is this how it is in the LBC?

454
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,437
Now you're getting it.

455
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,571
Ah. Sorry, sir.
Not in our purview.

456
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,747
That's two of our bad boys
and one bad girl accounted for,

457
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,923
leaving five at large,
including Isaac Irie.

458
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,230
The ATF has wires up
on usual suspects.

459
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,232
There was chatter
about potential gun sales

460
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,538
earlier in the day,
but it stopped in the last hour.

461
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,061
Our gunrunner stopped
trying to sell guns?

462
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,499
The Chaos Posse changed
their plan. Why?

463
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,805
We may be
disrupting business.

464
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,808
We may be short on manpower,
but we have every available unit

465
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,854
in the field, searching.Splendid.

466
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,596
In the meantime, I'd love to
have a chat with our bad girl.Sounds good.

467
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,640
Brie,

468
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,033
did you get my message?

469
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:54,253
I got it, Hondo.
Just processing.

470
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,776
Dad actually having cancer...

471
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,256
Every time I think
I'm making progress,

472
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,606
he starts talking crazy
about not getting that biopsy.

473
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,086
Have you forgotten
who your father is?Oh, here we go.

474
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,392
Every time he's a pain
in the ass, he's my father.

475
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,567
Come on, Brie. I need your help.

476
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:05,742
What do you expect me to do?

477
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,091
Maybe we gang up on him.

478
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,528
Already tried talking
to my mother and Winnie,

479
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:09,920
but I haven't heard back
from Winnie.

480
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,182
What else is new?

481
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,836
Don't do that.
You know it's complicated.

482
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,534
The charming dad
that you grew up with

483
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:17,493
is the same guy who abandoned us
for another woman in Oakland.

484
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,321
Look, he's scared. I get it.

485
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,149
He seems to be okay
with dying, Brie.

486
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,411
I just don't understand
where that's coming from.

487
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,891
He's probably
never gonna tell you.

488
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,936
Once he's made up his mind,
he can't be pushed.

489
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,330
Look, in a few days,
he'll change his mind,

490
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,679
decide to have the surgery.

491
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,420
And what if he doesn't?

492
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,384
Yo, Luca. I heard, uh,
Hondo, Deacon and Chris

493
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,559
went in on the food
truck? Is that true?

494
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,169
Yeah. They asked
to buy shares,

495
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:42,779
but I'm still evaluating
the offers.

496
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,868
Uh, well, look,
I can't offer any money.

497
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,479
I'm saving for an
engagement ring.

498
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:48,524
With Bonnie? Dude!Yeah.

499
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:49,438
Congrats.Yeah, thanks, man.

500
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,918
Awesome, man.Um...

501
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:53,486
But, hey, what I can offer
is, uh, cooking equipment.

502
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:54,922
A poker buddy of mine

503
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,750
manages this restaurant
supply warehouse downtown,

504
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,578
and he owes me,
so I can probably

505
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,493
cash in chips for
a Viking oven.

506
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:01,537
Nice, bro. Those are, like,

507
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,365
what, seven grand a pop?Uh-huh.

508
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,412
All right, I'll let you know if
I decide to take you up on it.

509
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:08,022
Oh. All right.

510
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,985
Mrs. Hawks.

511
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,987
How's your husband?

512
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,555
Doctors took him in for what
they say is his final surgery.

513
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,514
Ed suggested
I get out of the hospital,

514
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:22,906
get some fresh air.

515
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,648
But the only place I could
think of coming was here.

516
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:29,304
Seeing you all at work
helps me know that Ed

517
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,653
is going to be okay.Hmm.

518
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:31,959
Hey, Tan.

519
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,003
Let's go talk...

520
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,137
Sergeant Harrelson,

521
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,965
I also came here to apologize

522
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:39,532
for the way I behaved
at the hospital.

523
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,360
No, there's no
need for that.

524
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,536
I'm just sorry that you have
to go through any of this.

525
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,147
You seem like a decent man.

526
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,932
I assume
you're also a good cop.

527
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,065
Because of that,
I thought you might want to know

528
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,720
what type of person you're
working with in Piper Lynch.

529
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,377
We searched your hideout

530
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,074
and found a passport
that said your name is Tamika.

531
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,336
I don't know if that's real,

532
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,642
but we're gonna
call you that anyway.

533
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,339
Where's Isaac?
He planning to sell those guns

534
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,688
or use them for something else?

535
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,038
Officer Tan and I have
worked together a long time.

536
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:10,171
He's pushier than me.

537
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,303
When I started as a detective,

538
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:14,958
my partner and I
worked murder books together.

539
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:17,439
Me no understand.
Speak plain truth.

540
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,745
Oh, I'm getting to it.

541
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:20,399
My partner and I dealt
with a lot of hard cases,

542
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,444
so we became
hard cases ourselves.

543
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,185
Didn't matter
if a person was a sinner

544
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:25,447
or a saint;
we worked every case

545
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:27,449
like it was the most important
case we ever had.

546
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:28,711
Except I don't
feel that way

547
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:31,410
about this one.
This one actually is personal.

548
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:35,283
You and your friends
shot my former partner,

549
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,676
and you left him to die.

550
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,765
And right before
we walked in here,

551
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:41,898
Officer Ed Hawks passed away
in his hospital bed,

552
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:45,467
which means that you are guilty
of murdering a police officer.

553
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,382
The district attorney
is on her way down here

554
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,819
to formally charge you.
She'll be here in ten minutes.

555
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:53,127
Look, I didn't pull
the gully trigger.

556
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,869
Doesn't matter. You still
get sentenced like you did.

557
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:00,134
Unless you decide to talk.

558
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:02,136
Piper was my husband's
partner for seven years.

559
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,704
It wasn't just that she
had an affair with him.

560
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:07,750
After he tried to end it,
she wouldn't let it go.

561
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:11,101
Do you know how devastating
a broken family can be?

562
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,452
I have an idea.

563
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,324
She actively tried to
break up my marriage.

564
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,414
I don't tell you
this to gossip.

565
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,156
I tell you because it says
a lot about her ethics,

566
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,201
for whatever that's worth.

567
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,511
Them questions you asking

568
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:32,166
is not really questions
you want an answer to.

569
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,517
It's not what you think it is.

570
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,258
What do you mean by that?Doesn't matter.

571
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:38,781
I don't want to hear any more
unless you're gonna

572
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,479
tell us where those guns are.

573
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,437
Right now!

574
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,181
Okay.

575
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:50,184
I'll tell you what
you want to hear.

576
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,752
Tamika gave us Isaac's
plan. The chatter

577
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,580
about gun sales stopped
because the Chaos Posse

578
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:55,929
decided who to sell to.

579
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,408
They're unloading
guns to the Vandals,

580
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,846
Forty-Twos and Baja Diablos.

581
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:02,544
Three of the most dangerous
crews in Long Beach,

582
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:03,632
and they all
hate each other.

583
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:04,894
With guns like that,

584
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,374
they'll start shooting
anything that moves.

585
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,506
And civilians caught
in the middle.

586
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,377
The buys go down within the hour

587
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,857
in three separate locations.
Those locations

588
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,206
are spread across Long Beach.

589
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,729
The only way we're gonna make it
is if we split up.

590
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,775
I'll hop on the horn,
help mobilize the few units

591
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:16,906
we have available.
Lynch and I

592
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,386
will coordinate with you.Got it. Hey!

593
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:19,909
We're gonna need most
of you for this op.Hey, Tan.

594
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,911
How'd you get Tamika to talk?You mean, how did Lynch

595
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:24,305
get her to talk? You may
want to ask me that later.

596
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,793
30-David

597
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,795
to Command. We've got eyes
on location number one.

598
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,579
Visual on three tweakers.

599
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,799
From the looks of it, probably
members of the Vandals gang,

600
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:41,235
looking to make a buy
from the Chaos Posse.

601
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:42,584
Roger that, 30-David.

602
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,281
Watch your six.
From what Tamika said,

603
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,935
these gun buys are going down
in the next five minutes.

604
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,502
Luca, what's your 20?

605
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,113
22-David in position
at location number two.

606
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,375
Chris and Tan?

607
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,421
24-David has reached
location three.

608
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,297
All right.

609
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:01,472
We got visual on a van.

610
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,957
All right, looks like

611
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,437
we got something. Let's move.

612
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,181
On the ground!

613
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:15,704
Let me see the hands!
Hands, now!On your knees!

614
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:16,836
Show me your hands!On the ground now!

615
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,968
On your knees now! LAPD!Hands!

616
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:24,974
Hey, we found guns,

617
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,323
but not any
from the hijacked truck.

618
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,282
Luca, what do you see
at location number two?

619
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,980
Same thing.
We found guns, but small-time.

620
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,939
No sign of Jamaicans.Same thing

621
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,375
at location three, boss.

622
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:35,637
This isn't the Chaos Posse.

623
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,248
Tamika lied.

624
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,555
She told me
what I wanted to hear.I don't think

625
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,774
it's that simple.They tried

626
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,863
to use us to eliminate
their competition.

627
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,386
It still doesn't explain
what the Chaos Posse

628
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:46,996
plans on doing
with those guns.

629
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:52,654
Two visits in one day?

630
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,656
Nate, you already
did me a solid,

631
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,050
and I appreciate that,
and I thank you.Do you know

632
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:58,442
what the people in
here would do to me

633
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:01,097
if they knew I did
favors for a cop, man?

634
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,969
Already bad enough, you coming
in here dressed like one.

635
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,275
We are still having no luck

636
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,582
tracking down these guns.Why is that my business?

637
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,279
Because this bar
is a way station

638
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,585
for everything going on
in Long Beach.

639
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,543
If there is anything

640
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:13,893
that you know that I'm missing,

641
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,459
I could just really use it
right now.

642
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:16,983
Thought I already
fulfilled our blood oath.

643
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:17,984
You did.

644
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,203
But I know
that you're a good dude,

645
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:21,596
so just be a good citizen.

646
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,773
Look, man.

647
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,557
You can't just turn
your back on family

648
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,081
and keep asking for stuff.

649
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,736
When you came in here earlier,
I thought for one second

650
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,173
that maybe you were here just
to say "what's up" to me.

651
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:34,783
Ask me how I'm doing.

652
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,567
How are you doing, Nate?How's it look?

653
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:38,091
I'm working in a
bar I don't own,

654
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:40,093
hanging with the
same low-rent crowd

655
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:42,530
I've always known.I can help
get you out of here.

656
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:44,140
That offer always stands, man.

657
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:47,361
Nah. I'm good.

658
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:56,631
There is one key on that ring
that I can't use for anything,

659
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,809
but I carry it with me
because it belongs to the bike

660
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,811
that I wrecked
that you let me borrow.

661
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:06,336
I carry it to remind myself
that you had my back.

662
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,425
You know my dad
was a drinker.

663
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,600
Gave me

664
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:11,080
my first shot when I was eight.

665
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,212
And I was lucky.

666
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:13,996
I threw it up. I hated it.

667
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,129
My mom was even worse.

668
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:18,914
And out of a dozen
foster homes, you are

669
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,830
the only friend
that I have ever had.

670
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:24,093
But when Buck gave me
a second chance,

671
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:27,444
he made me promise
not to have any connection

672
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,490
to any temptations
from my past life.

673
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:32,014
I didn't just ghost you, man.
I ghosted everything.

674
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:34,234
I was just trying to survive

675
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,540
by moving on, and I am sorry.

676
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:39,108
I'm really sorry.

677
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,112
Okay, Streeter.

678
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,422
Look, I told you
everything I knew before.

679
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:50,511
But after you left,
there was this Jamaican

680
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:52,252
who came in here
and ordered a beer.

681
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:55,690
I'm not sure if he was
Chaos Posse or not,

682
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,388
but he wasn't
talking guns, man.

683
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,609
He was talking about
some dude named Cyfort.

684
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,698
Does the name Chris Cyfort
sound familiar?

685
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,308
Yeah.Why?

686
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,615
Chaos Posse wants him dead.

687
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,791
This guy's name is Chris Cyfort.

688
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:13,273
He was brought in on a DUI
just a few hours ago.

689
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,278
And that's around the same time

690
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:19,540
the Chaos Posse
stopped shopping guns.

691
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,020
Cyfort has priors

692
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:23,022
for making fake passports.

693
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,588
He's also been suspected

694
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,199
of being a bookkeeper
for criminal enterprises,

695
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,201
though it's never
been confirmed.

696
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:29,550
He must work

697
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:30,812
for the Chaos Posse.

698
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,379
If he's got knowledge of how

699
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:34,860
they travel and do business,
he's a walking RICO case.

700
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,426
And a potential informant.

701
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,254
And they don't leave loose ends.

702
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,998
Cyfort's why they
changed their plans.

703
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,521
The Chaos Posse stopped
trying to sell guns

704
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,480
to use them to come and kill
Cyfort and anyone else here.

705
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:48,656
Get your cops back now.

706
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,667
We're heading
straight over there.

707
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,060
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Hey!Watch that, boy.

708
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:02,452
Rest easy. Grab up
their gun now.

709
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,585
Hold on.

710
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,198
This is 20-David.
I need everyone

711
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,809
back at Southeast
Division immediately.

712
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,549
The Chaos Posse's
on their way here.

713
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,203
Hondo, I'm checking the armory.

714
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,814
I put out a call
to every patrol unit.

715
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,728
Should only be minutes
before they're here.

716
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,121
Yeah, well, old SWAT saying
when seconds count,

717
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:20,340
backup's only minutes away.

718
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,776
Roger that.

719
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,604
Did you reach the armory?

720
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:26,825
Yes.

721
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:30,741
Unfortunately, most
of our assault weapons

722
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:32,134
are out in the field

723
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:34,354
with officers trying
to hunt these guys down.

724
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:45,278
Let's go.

725
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,204
Where the hell's Cyfort?Hmm?

726
00:30:58,247 --> 00:30:59,422
Where is he?!

727
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:02,164
Isaac!Hey, hey, hey.
Get her in there.

728
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:40,115
Show your face,
or me murder a cop for fun!

729
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:53,868

Deac, you there?

730
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,304
We're three minutes out.

731
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:57,176
No, man, that's too much time;
they got hostages.

732
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,526
What do you need, boss?
Call the maintenance division.

733
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,571
General services.
On my cue, you cut the lights.

734
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:02,398
Roger that.

735
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:14,628
Deac, now.

736
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,962
Get him out of here.
Go. Get him out of here.

737
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,271
Move!

738
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,558
Hands!

739
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:00,951
Let me see your hands.

740
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:33,593
I admired
your work today.

741
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,160
Thanks.

742
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:38,859
Ed's surgeries went well.
He's gonna make it just fine.

743
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:41,688
I, uh, saw you talking
to his wife.

744
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:44,647
Yeah. She, uh...

745
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,301
she's got a strong opinion
about you.

746
00:34:46,345 --> 00:34:47,650
She tell you about me and Ed?

747
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,304
It's not my business.
No.

748
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:51,567
But since you know,

749
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:53,526
you might as well know
the whole truth.

750
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:56,529
I'm not superstitious,

751
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,661
but I find myself
double tapping on surfaces

752
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:01,099
anytime I want
the best for people.

753
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:04,885
It means "be safe."

754
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:06,756
When Ed and I were partners,

755
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,758
we would wish each other well
before every shift.

756
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:10,499
Of course,
the one time I forgot,

757
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:13,633
we almost got killed,
so now I don't forget.

758
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,594
As much as I loved Ed,

759
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:21,554
I knew the best thing for him
was to be with his wife.

760
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:23,904
So I ended it,
and I told him

761
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:26,036
to tell her
that he broke up with me.

762
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,126
He was choosing her.

763
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,779
You protected him.

764
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:32,130
I have no problem
playing the bad guy.

765
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,175
Even my own mother says
I have a rhino hide

766
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,611
and a concrete soul.

767
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,833
Sometimes you need it.

768
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:53,368
Long Beach PD's doing
an itemized check,

769
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,327
but it looks like every
assault weapon's accounted for.

770
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,545
And on the way
to the Big Burn?

771
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:57,633
Yep.

772
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:59,069
Nice.

773
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:03,596
Hey, uh, Luca.
We got to talk, man.

774
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,641
I feel like I'm the only one

775
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,252
who's not investing
in your food truck now.

776
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,210
Uh, because you are.

777
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,647
And if I'm being honest,
I still think it's a crazy idea.

778
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,041
But, man, there's no way
I'm gonna be left

779
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,043
holding the short straw,
watching you guys jet off

780
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:19,307
to Acapulco when this thing
hits big, so count me in.

781
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,874
So you're gonna buy
a share?

782
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,267
Yeah, what do you say, Luca?

783
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,488
I've been thinking.

784
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,448
I didn't know how to
say this to any of you,

785
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:32,668
but my food truck idea's
getting serious buzz.

786
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:33,930
I don't even have a truck
yet, and I already got

787
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,367
three events lined
up for next month.

788
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,978
So here's the thing. Since
the business is looking

789
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:40,328
to make revenue,
share prices have gone up.

790
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:43,201
It's no longer $5,000
to get in anymore.

791
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,332
It's $7,500.

792
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:45,768
Now, Hondo, he
bought in early,

793
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:48,249
and Tan might be good with
that Viking oven thing,

794
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,946
but the rest of you,

795
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,906
you all had your chances
to get in early.

796
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,864
You just blew me off, so...

797
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,823
Wait, Luca,
are you serious?

798
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,439
No. I'm not serious.

799
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,702
I just wanted you to get a
taste of what it feels like

800
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:08,356
to be left hanging in the air.

801
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,966
Thank you, everybody.
As far as I'm concerned,

802
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,533
food truck belongs
to all of us!

803
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:12,969
Yes.
Yes.

804
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,057
That was good, man.

805
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,582
This is a family thing, man.

806
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,061
Well played.

807
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,759
Yo, Hondo.
What's up?

808
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:22,283
You know, as I try to make
this new business work,

809
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,589
I've been reading
about leadership.

810
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:25,460
One of the things
they talk about

811
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,767
is setting
a good example.

812
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,377
I know what you did.

813
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:31,031
I don't know what
you're talking about.

814
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,251
You knew if you
invested in the food truck,

815
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,384
everyone else would get
competitive and dive in.

816
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:38,560
You set a good example
and everybody followed it.

817
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,780
I just think that's a credit
to our team, don't you?

818
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:42,303
Yeah. No doubt.

819
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:44,653
But I just want you to know
I appreciate it, man.

820
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,051
Almost done with
your shift, or what?

821
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:55,142
Almost. Why?

822
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,100
Well, there's that bike rental
place down by the harbor.

823
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:59,625
I thought we could take out
some Ducatis. Let them eat.

824
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:02,454
Not a bad idea.

825
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:05,283
But, as usual, Streeter,
I have a better one.

826
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,285
You see that girl?

827
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,330
That's Chastity. She's been
coming in here for weeks.

828
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,332
She likes your boy.

829
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,508
And today, she's in here
with a friend.

830
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:14,901
You check her
arrest record?

831
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,511
I'm kind of serious.

832
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,687
We both know your type.
What was the name

833
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,907
of that girl, um, who stole
your eight ball jacket?

834
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,562
Yeah. Kiana Simmons.
This ain't the same, brother.

835
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,390
So, what, y-you want me
to be your wingman?

836
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:28,262
I'm not sure that's my speed.Why? You got a girlfriend?

837
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,829
No, I'm just... I'm
trying a new approach.

838
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,352
You owe me one.

839
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:32,962
Or three.

840
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:34,355
Come on.

841
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,183
So which routine
you want to try?

842
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:37,793
Rude guy, shy guy?

843
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:39,360
Lando and Han Solo?

844
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:40,535
How about no pickup lines?

845
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,928
Just straight up
conversation?

846
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:44,713
That's crazy,
but might be genius.

847
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,367
What's up, ladies?

848
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:47,542
My name is Nate.

849
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,501
And this is my brother Jim.

850
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,546
Your brother?

851
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:07,432
Hey, Pop.

852
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,824
Son, what a day.

853
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,522
I've been putting
some elbow grease in,

854
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:12,872
trying to get these
chrome door handles polished.

855
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:14,569
Toughest fight
you ever want to see.

856
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,397
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

857
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:19,444
Listen, Darryl fixed dinner.
Some vegan food.

858
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:21,184
Sounds real,
smells good.

859
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:23,491
Some in the oven if you want it.
How was your day today?

860
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:25,754
Better, now that
I'm here with you.

861
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:27,887
Hey, Pop, listen.

862
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,715
I had some time to think.

863
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:33,588
I don't cotton to, uh,

864
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,503
talking about cancer
on an empty stomach, son.

865
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,596
Look, I know you got
a lot of pride

866
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,859
and you passed that down to me.

867
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:45,992
If you don't want
to get that biopsy,

868
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,516
it's your life,
so be it.

869
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,606
But I am asking you
for one thing

870
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,000
if you don't do it,
don't let it be because

871
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:56,394
you think you deserve this
cancer, 'cause, Pop, you don't.

872
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,744
See, that's where you're wrong.

873
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:03,531
I know you think
you made mistakes,

874
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,185
and hell yeah, you did.

875
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,969
You made a whole bunch
of them with me,

876
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:08,623
but here we are.

877
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,104
Bridges can be rebuilt.

878
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:14,281
It's been 30 years, son.

879
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:16,979
I got a ex-wife
who barely tolerates me.

880
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:19,242
She can't even stand to be
in the same room with me.

881
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:21,331
I got a daughter
who I miss every day,

882
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,333
and she won't even speak to me.

883
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:26,249
And I don't blame her.

884
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:29,252
I just don't feel
like fighting anymore.

885
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,866
I got in a fight
today at work.

886
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,694
And I ain't gonna lie,

887
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:38,044
I was afraid for my life.

888
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,699
But I fought my way back
here tonight. You know why?

889
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:43,397
Because that's what my father
taught me a man does.

890
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,102
Maybe I can help make
things better for you.

891
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:55,844
I can reach out to Winnie and
help you reconnect with her.

892
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:57,280
See, there you go,

893
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:59,065
trying to fix things
that can't be fixed.

894
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:00,806
It ain't never
gonna happen, son.

895
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:04,070
I get Winnie to sit down
with you after 30 years,

896
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:06,812
then you get that biopsy.
Is that a deal?

897
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,901
How are you gonna
make that happen?You don't worry about it.

898
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:11,251
It's my problem.
Is it a deal?

899
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:14,384
Pop.

900
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:18,258
We ain't ready
to say goodbye to you yet.

901
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:31,576
Okay.

902
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:37,059

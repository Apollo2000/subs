1
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,706
Yeah! This is our prison now!
We're in charge!

2
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,308
<i>All right, finally getting</i>

3
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:26,610
some details on the riot.

4
00:00:26,644 --> 00:00:28,111
Three different gangs have taken over

5
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:29,546
three different sections of the prison.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,348
- They gain entry to the control room?
- Yep.

7
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:33,316
That means they have keys to
nearly every cell in the place.

8
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,785
- That can't be good.
- That include the armory?

9
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:36,153
Yes, it does.

10
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,021
Any firepower the guards have,
now they have.

11
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:39,927
- What gangs we looking at, boss?
- One-Niners?

12
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:41,792
Give that man a prize.

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,566
<i>Shot caller's Katrell Porter.</i>

14
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,535
<i>O.G. doing hard time.</i>

15
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:49,105
<i>The one thing he is not is felony stupid.</i>

16
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:50,428
In Cellblock B, it looks like

17
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,552
the Baja Diablo cartel's in charge now.

18
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,744
<i>Lot of muscle. Bunch of</i> veteranos

19
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:56,579
<i>running around who like to kill people.</i>

20
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:58,548
<i>Their leader's name is "Moco" Hernandez.</i>

21
00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:00,566
Hold up. They call this guy Moco?

22
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,385
<i>That's probably why he's so angry.</i>

23
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:03,586
Well, the third gang's the worst.

24
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,321
- What, Nazi Eagles?
- Yep, one and the same.

25
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,323
They're currently in possession
of Cellblock C.

26
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:09,392
<i>Now, we all know their work:</i>

27
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:12,295
<i>running crystal meth out
of Fontana, led by Gunnar Cade.</i>

28
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:13,398
I heard stories about him.

29
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,151
It's one thing to be smart
and another to be vicious,

30
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:16,566
<i>and this guy's both.</i>

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Don't do this.

32
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,369
No one here wants to hurt you.

33
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,674
This is a sanctuary.

34
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,576
Sister Carmelita.

35
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,947
Every week, you come here,
trying to redeem people.

36
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,915
Eternal hope.

37
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,551
Makes me wonder how I
can get a piece of that.

38
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:46,662
J.R., tell your therapist
I would never violate her.

39
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,307
Thing is, you're not my type, Carmelita.

40
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:00,776
And before you call me racist,

41
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,346
understand it's not just that.

42
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:05,982
I also hate Catholics.

43
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,619
Let them go. Please.

44
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:11,387
Are you begging me?

45
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,115
If it helps them, yes.

46
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:17,193
No! Gunnar!

47
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:20,363
Please. Don't!

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Let... the civilians go.

49
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:27,422
You don't want to put yourself
in any more hot water.

50
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:30,640
Warden, I'm serving three life sentences.

51
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,573
Water can't get any hotter.

52
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,153
All right, we all stay sharp.

53
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,419
The bad guys are gonna have

54
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:36,646
serious home court advantage.

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,381
There's gonna be danger
around every corner.

56
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:39,715
All right, we're here. Let's go!

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,684
<i>Watch each other's backs.</i>

58
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,062
Thank God you're here.

59
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:54,363
Hondo, this is Ashe Jones.

60
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:55,898
He's the owner of this prison.

61
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:57,233
Didn't know somebody could own a prison.

62
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,268
I'm private sector. I have
a contract with the state.

63
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,404
They pay my company to run this facility.

64
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,846
What can you tell us
about what happened here?

65
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:03,944
Details are thin.

66
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,908
Seems to have started with
the white pride prisoners.

67
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:07,777
When the warden shifted resources

68
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,058
to try to deal with them,

69
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:10,880
the Baja Diablos and
One-Niners took advantage

70
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:11,914
and were able to overrun us.

71
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:13,249
From what I hear,

72
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:14,917
it was just too much for our CERT Teams.

73
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,085
Are negotiators talking to the gangs?

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,054
To the Baja Diablos
and the One-Niners, yes.

75
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,355
They make any demands yet?

76
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,057
Better food, more yard
time, conjugal visits.

77
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,525
That's pretty standard stuff.

78
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,093
No word yet from the Nazi Eagles
and Gunnar Cade?

79
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:25,495
They haven't answered our calls.

80
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,263
How many hostages inside?

81
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,633
18. Prison warden, six guards,

82
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,833
eight construction workers,

83
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:33,503
two chaplains and a nun.

84
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:36,443
Wait a minute. Sister Carmelita's inside?

85
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:37,940
- You know her?
- Yes.

86
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:39,175
She goes from prison to prison

87
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,943
trying to rehabilitate these guys.

88
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,211
She asks me to speak to them sometimes.

89
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:43,779
She does good work, hard work.

90
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,348
Negotiators say she may be injured.

91
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:47,621
- How bad?
- We're trying to find out.

92
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,665
I need your breach plan
in case talks fail.

93
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,522
Talking to these animals is useless.

94
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,090
Well, I'd like to know what
Gunner Cade and his boys

95
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:55,506
are up to before we go charging in there.

96
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:56,553
What's that?

97
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,532
Somebody turned on
a security camera in C Block.

98
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,144
That's Gunnar Cade.

99
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,971
That's our warden, Phil Harvey.

100
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:17,529

103
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:04,708
What's the ETA on Mumford's team?

104
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:06,343
They're stuck finishing
an operation in Century City.

105
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:07,645
They'll be here as soon as they can.

106
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,013
Gunnar Cade's up to something.

107
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,548
Whatever it is, makes it more dangerous.

108
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,882
He wouldn't kill the warden
just for kicks.

109
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,296
He's always got an agenda.

110
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,541
Strap up.

111
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:18,022
- My team's going in.
- Wait. Just you?

112
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,422
What about all these other officers here?

113
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:20,769
They're not trained for this.

114
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:22,529
If we take them in there without
knowing the lay of the land,

115
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:23,901
some of them could get grabbed.

116
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:26,226
Which means more hostages, not less.

117
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:28,832
They cut the camera
feeds, so we can't see 'em.

118
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,568
- Also means they can't see us.
- All right.

119
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:31,969
We make a stealth entry.

120
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:33,671
That gives us the element of surprise.

121
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:35,072
We see what the traps are,

122
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,074
then we use these officers
here as backup.

123
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,076
Now, if any one of us
sees Sister Carmelita,

124
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,316
- we do whatever it takes to get her out.
- Okay.

125
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,580
Three different cellblocks,
three different gangs.

126
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:46,050
- We go three teams of two.
- Street, Tan, you track down

127
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,085
the Baja Diablos and
construction workers.

128
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,849
Never thought I'd be
breaking into a prison.

129
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:50,833
Deacon and Chris,

130
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,479
you got the One-Niners
and the captured prison guards.

131
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:53,465
You got it.

132
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,960
Luca, you're with me. Gunnar Cade's mine.

133
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,505
- You good?
- Yup.

134
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,108
- All right, let's do this.
- Go.

135
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,895
You two, guard the door.

136
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:37,301
24-David to Command.

137
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,737
We have breached entry from below.

138
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:47,711
20-David to Command.

139
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:49,113
We're on the roof of Cellblock C.

140
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,247
Roger that, 20-David.

141
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,484
Three, two, one.

142
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,922
No one exits without you
confirming their identity first.

143
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,802
All right, Command. On my cue.

144
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:47,471
You fools step up, get beat down.

145
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:49,373
Let's go.

146
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:50,870
Now.

147
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:55,813
What the hell?

148
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:02,019
Give me your other hand!

149
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,954
Luca, you good?

150
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:05,135
Good!

151
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:11,474
20-David to Command. We're in.

152
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:18,355
All three teams are inside.

153
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,037
Any ETA on Mumford's team?

154
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:21,538
We could use extra bodies.

155
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:23,340
They're still on the situation
in Century City.

156
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,843
I'll get them to you
as soon as they come available.

157
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:27,738
Keep me updated.

158
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,640
- Yes, sir.
- Annie.

159
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,208
Bob.

160
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,244
What brings you by?

161
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,311
Special occasion.

162
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,212
You know, I tell Deacon every day

163
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,047
he's damn lucky you
decided to marry down.

164
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,016
Well, don't you let him forget it.

165
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:40,902
You look busy.

166
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,187
Never too busy for family.
You've been doing some baking.

167
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,389
Special occasion, you said?

168
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:46,890
I don't know if anyone here remembers,

169
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,525
but today's the ten-year anniversary

170
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,006
of David becoming SWAT boot.

171
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,029
- Today's Deacon's ten-year mark in SWAT?
- Yeah.

172
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,031
Ah. He never mentioned it.

173
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:55,699
Of course he wouldn't.

174
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,308
Oh, so it's up to his
wife to embarrass him.

175
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,450
No, it's up to me to make
sure he gets acknowledged.

176
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:01,608
Yeah.

177
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,274
Everything hasn't gone his way this year.

178
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:05,594
I know.

179
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,077
I just want him to have
a little spotlight,

180
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:08,512
even if it's just for a day.

181
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:09,713
Admirable proposition.

182
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,415
Unfortunately, you just missed him.

183
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:12,911
I was afraid of that.

184
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:16,053
Prison riot or high-rise barricade?

185
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,956
You know how this goes, Annie.

186
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,293
I do.

187
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,192
You know, it was Barbara who taught me

188
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,418
how to be a cop's wife.

189
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:24,795
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,565
Oh. Well...

191
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,302
Barb was good at that...
and just about everything else,

192
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,553
but... I wish I let her know that more

193
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:36,423
- while she was still alive, but...
- Bob, I'm sorry.

194
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:38,809
No, no, no, no, no, it's-it's all right.

195
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,845
You know, it's been, it's been
three years since we lost Barb.

196
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,948
I'm glad to be reminded of her.

197
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:50,053
Look, if you leave this
cake in that kitchen,

198
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:52,256
those ogres are gonna devour it
before Deacon ever sees it.

199
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,758
Come on, we're gonna
keep it in my office.

200
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,271
Where they at, where they at?

201
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,460
No! No-no, please.

202
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,063
Oh, God.

203
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:34,832
Hands!

204
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,133
Show us your hands!

205
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,535
Put that knife down! Show us your hands!

206
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,670
Don't move! I'm unarmed! I'm unarmed!

207
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:40,838
- Don't move!
- I'm unarmed!

208
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:42,172
- Show us your hands!
- I'm unarmed!

209
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,508
- I'm unarmed!
- Go down!

210
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:50,247
Face down! Down!

211
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:52,701
He's dead.

212
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,685
It-It's not what it looks like.
I-I'm a guard.

213
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,886
He stole my uniform.

214
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,955
- What's your name?
- Telly Appleton.

215
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,225
Chris.

216
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:10,439
He's listed in the prison
database as a guard.

217
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,903
I-I couldn't let him take
my uniform without a fight.

218
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,054
Do you have keys for every
room in this cellblock?

219
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,156
Uh, only some of them.

220
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,157
We need to know exactly where
the other prison guards

221
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,425
are being held hostage.

222
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,761
Okay, I, uh, I-I know where to find them,

223
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,763
but Katrell and these One-Niners,

224
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,265
they're tough, they're smart.

225
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,900
Then we'll have to play it smart, too.

226
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:46,436
Find an indirect way in.
Any idea how to do that?

227
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,277
I can access the service
corridors with my keys.

228
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:50,316
Well, you can tell us if you want.

229
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,042
Look, you go back that way five minutes,

230
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:54,011
and there's officers watching the exit.

231
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,545
Five minutes?

232
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,484
I-I think I'd feel safer
staying with you.

233
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:03,946
Lead the way, then.

234
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,089
Hey, I'm-I'm, I'm not

235
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:07,457
a violent person, you know.

236
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,109
I-I don't do things like that.

237
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,360
How long have you been working here?

238
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:11,428
Six months.

239
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,798
What'd you do before this?

240
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,243
Sacking groceries.

241
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,302
No, there's training
required for a gig like this.

242
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:20,704
Well, maybe in other prisons,
but not this one.

243
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:23,601
I just saw a job opening and took it.

244
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,188
Now, I'm thinking maybe $11
an hour wasn't worth it.

245
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:30,066
I mean, I-I just killed a guy.

246
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,917
Piece of advice.

247
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,819
When I first got this job,

248
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,587
somebody told me that I'm
gonna see some rough things

249
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,890
and I'm gonna have to
do some rough things.

250
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,059
But every cop needs a chair.

251
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:45,290
A... a chair? What-what does that mean?

252
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,232
It's whatever you use to decompress.

253
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,568
For some people, it's a chair
and a glass of Scotch.

254
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:54,549
For others it's a favorite
meal, a certain book.

255
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,702
Anything. The sooner we do this,

256
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,877
the sooner we get you back to your chair.

257
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,317
Okay. Yeah.

258
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,122
26-David to Command.
We're deep into Cellblock B.

259
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:13,857
No sign of any hostages yet.

260
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,459
Roger that, 26-David.

261
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,694
I have the negotiation team
stalling for us.

262
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,364
That'll only last so long before these
gangs realize we're in here.

263
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:21,698
Still got a few areas to clear, Street.

264
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,266
Let's keep moving.

265
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,135
Been wanting to see you
die for a long time!

266
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,805
- Stop here.
- Today's your day, you son of a bitch!

267
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:31,408
That doesn't sound friendly.

268
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,013
Inside, inside, go, go, go, go, go, go.

269
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:37,447
Move. In here, come on, come on.

270
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,761
- Room clear.
- Over here.

271
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,656
Hurry it up.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,003
Let me see hands! Let me see hands! Now!

273
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,669
...proprietary information.

274
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,071
'Cause you kept coming
at us, Jack, with...

275
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,739
What the hell is this?

276
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:04,374
It was you, stepping on dialogue.

277
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,410
I wasn't going to
roll over and let you steal...

278
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:08,178
<i>Young and the Restless.</i>

279
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,679
We earned every single sale
that we got, Jack...

280
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,681
Except for the ones you bought, right?

281
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:13,483
Jack hates his bastard brother

282
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:14,776
for sleeping with his wife.

283
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,127
Bad blood from way back.

284
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:17,616
You know there's a riot going on?

285
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,357
What I know is most days
they restrict TV time.

286
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:23,493
Today, we got our ice cream
from the commissary...

287
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:24,761
watching our stories.

288
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:25,996
We're looking for construction workers

289
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,767
taken as hostages.

290
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,933
Looks like you're using
some of their equipment.

291
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:32,069
Don't know nothing
about no missing workers.

292
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:34,248
Can tell you who's double-timing
who in Genoa City, though.

293
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:35,803
All right, viewing party's over.

294
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:38,035
Man, come on, chief, we're not
even hurting nobody.

295
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:40,410
Why don't y'all just leave us
in here and close the door?

296
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:47,451
You mean you're not
tossing us in there with them?

297
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,119
Cells are built for two.

298
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,499
Yeah, you definitely new here.

299
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:57,394
This place, everybody shares a
cell with at least four people.

300
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,329
Why you think there's a riot?

301
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:16,046
Cut the power, play games on the phone.

302
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,483
Cops being cops. We stay on mission.

303
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,618
Hey. Hey there.

304
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:24,452
Don't worry. It's all gonna work out.

305
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:27,212
Hey. Did I tell you to talk, Sister?

306
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:30,627
If I want you to open your
mouth, I will force it open.

307
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:33,130
You think... you think that scares me?

308
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:38,468
Everything you say, I've heard way worse.

309
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:52,682
You've heard worse? Well, hear this.

310
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,795
It'll all be over soon for you.

311
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:10,433
I'm gonna send you back
to that brown Jesus of yours.

312
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,314
What are you thinking?

313
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,716
First place inmates hit up when
everything starts popping off.

314
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,752
- Prison pharmacy.
- To get their fix.

315
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,464
Eagle tats.

316
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:36,993
That's gotta be Gunnar Cade's guy.

317
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,495
Hostages won't be far behind.

318
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:39,732
Let's move.

319
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:01,518
Keep going.

320
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:19,814
Okay.

321
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:40,190
Okay, hostages on the far side
of the room at two o'clock,

322
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:43,170
including Sister Carmelita.

323
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:45,629
Gunnar Cade's in there, too.

324
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:47,675
These guys are armed to the teeth.

325
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,733
We gotta soften 'em up.

326
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,345
On my cue.

327
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:06,683
Go, go, go!

328
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:16,092
Hondo!

329
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:21,631
On stomachs! Hands down! Let me see them!

330
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,667
Ooh, yum.

331
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,303
Um, y-you know what, on second thought,

332
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,438
that cake may not be safe
with me after all.

333
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,908
Oh. Annie, excuse me a sec.

334
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,009
Mm, yeah.

335
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,858
Yeah, talk to me.

336
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,013
The good news,

337
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,781
we've recovered two hostages...
the chaplains.

338
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:40,417
The bad news, Gunnar Cade's still loose.

339
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,785
He has Sister Carmelita,

340
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,486
and now he knows we're inside the prison.

341
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,188
- We could use Mumford's team.
- They're en route.

342
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:46,790
They should be at your
location about ten minutes.

343
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:48,024
Thanks. I'll prep 'em.

344
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:50,193
Annie, I'm sorry, I have to go.

345
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:52,662
Oh, busy day. Everything okay?

346
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,664
Oh, we're doing the best we can.

347
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,299
Good enough for me.

348
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,634
And I completely understudy.

349
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:59,302
- Um...
- I'm sorry, what?

350
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:02,806
I just... uh, it was sound advice...

351
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,307
Yeah?

352
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:07,277
Sounds... g-great...

353
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:13,483
Are you... a-are you all right?

354
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:16,953
- I'm f... feel my...
- Annie, are you okay?

355
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:20,390
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
- Bob...

356
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:21,991
Whoa, Annie, come on, come on,
come on, we're gonna lie you down.

357
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,493
We're gonna lie down, honey.

358
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:26,963
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

359
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:28,709
All right, now don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

360
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,902
I'm gonna get some help.
I'm gonna get some help.

361
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,283
Somebody get me a medic right now!

362
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:44,814
Mumford's team is heading your way.

363
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,912
In the meantime, stay alive.

364
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:47,966
Roger that.

365
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,179
Listen, I'm not with Gunnar's crew, man.

366
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:51,913
No, what are you, an upstanding
citizen wrongly convicted?

367
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:54,158
I was just trying to save
Sister Carmelita.

368
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,950
If you guys don't find her soon,
Gunnar's gonna kill her,

369
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:58,086
- if she doesn't bleed out first.
- Bleed out?

370
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,914
- How bad's she hurt?
- Gunnar stabbed her.

371
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,989
Said something about using her

372
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:02,724
as a shield long enough
to get the job done.

373
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,059
I'm listening. What job?

374
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:05,727
- I don't know.
- Yeah, but you know enough

375
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,896
to get us to help you,
not enough to help us?

376
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,764
You guys followed me from
the pharmacy, right?

377
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,167
I was grabbing medical supplies
for Sister Carmelita.

378
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:14,402
She's the only one in this place
who ever helped me.

379
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:17,272
You know, every convict's got a story...
why should we believe yours?

380
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:20,354
What's your name?

381
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:22,276
J.R. Coltrane.

382
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,914
J.R. Coltrane.

383
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,582
Charged with armed robbery four times.

384
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:30,318
That's before we get into
the white pride bullcrap.

385
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:33,788
I'm not like that.
At-at least not anymore.

386
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,458
Lift up my shirt, you'll see.

387
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,740
- Snitch!
- You ain't nothing!

388
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:40,922
Tweaker!

389
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,330
You're burning off your old tats.

390
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:45,514
I got a past, but I'm
trying to escape it.

391
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,513
Prove it.

392
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:47,836
You say Gunnar Cade's planning something,

393
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,304
and he's using Sister
Carmelita as a human shield

394
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,240
to buy time. What's he up to?

395
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,640
I want to help you. I do.

396
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,375
But-but he doesn't tell me anything.

397
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,212
He only communicates with the
big shots, usually with kites.

398
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:58,780
Prison letters, okay.

399
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:00,949
He exchanges them with his lieutenants.

400
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,903
- Other gang leaders.
- All right, Luca,

401
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:05,164
let's toss Gunnar Cade's
cell, see what we find.

402
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:16,064
LAPD! Stop!

403
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,133
Clear.

404
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,068
LAPD SWAT!

405
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:22,537
- Hands! Show me your hands!
- Put 'em up!

406
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:24,205
Drop 'em! Drop your weapons.

407
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,340
Show us your hands!

408
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,212
- Drop your weapons!
- Down!

409
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,244
- Get on your knees.
- Down!

410
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:37,154
I think you're the ones
who need to give yourselves up.

411
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:41,856
Put your guns down.

412
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:43,658
Y'all ain't even got the numbers.

413
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:45,996
And that's a dead end you're stuck in.

414
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:48,122
Ain't no getting past us.

415
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,267
I don't have anything new to report.

416
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:53,501
You have a way to get through to Deacon?

417
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,203
Are you able to call him?

418
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:56,437
I have a cell block up,
and he's still inside.

419
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,539
Is there a problem?

420
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:59,440
It's Annie. I'm at the hospital with her.

421
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:01,469
It's serious.
She's had a stroke or something.

422
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:02,610
What happened?

423
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:03,912
Doctors ran an MRI,

424
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:05,680
and the stroke was caused
by bleeding in her brain.

425
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:06,848
Oh, no.

426
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:08,249
Look, they may need
to rush her into surgery,

427
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:10,306
and they're not sure
if she's gonna make it.

428
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,120
Now, I'm not saying she won't,

429
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:13,888
but is there any way
to pull Deacon out of there?

430
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:14,923
I'll find out.

431
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:17,959
I said drop your guns!

432
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:19,794
We ain't got nothing to lose, homies.

433
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:21,699
You can't say the same.

434
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:24,232
You Katrell?

435
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,868
That's right, redbone.
You know the name, don't you?

436
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:28,743
I heard you're a smart guy
who likes to lay traps.

437
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:31,239
So you should recognize
when you're being set up in one.

438
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,474
You're not the only crew bringing backup.

439
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:34,742
- Put the guns down!
- Down!

440
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:36,377
Put the guns down! Put 'em down!
Drop 'em! Drop 'em!

441
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:37,712
Put 'em down!

442
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:39,115
- Drop 'em!
- Get down on the ground.

443
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,234
Down.

444
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:42,094
Drop 'em!

445
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,139
Slide 'em towards me.

446
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,959
How far are the other guards from here?

447
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:52,227
Uh... a few hallways down.

448
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:54,929
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

449
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,464
Move.

450
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,290
Luca.

451
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,393
What do you see?

452
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:30,934
It's one of Gunnar Cade's prison letters.

453
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:36,106
"The hills of Valhalla are
Thor's lightning paradise."

454
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:37,939
Sounds like a bunch of nonsense.

455
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:39,374
No, this is code.

456
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:40,708
What, you really think
this has something to do

457
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:41,809
with this big plan of his?

458
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:43,344
If we decode it, we find out.

459
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:45,046
Well, don't look at me. I'm a
shooter, not Sherlock Holmes.

460
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,114
Well, neither am I.

461
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:47,715
But I think we got somebody
who can help us.

462
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,205
What, J.R.? I don't know, Hondo.

463
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,374
If anybody can break
that code, it's probably him.

464
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:56,357
You're really gonna make me be the dude

465
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:57,659
defending a white supremist right now?

466
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:01,396
You ever really think
you can trust a guy like that?

467
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:05,199
Sister Carmelita must've believed in him

468
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,668
to counsel him every week.

469
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,070
Maybe she needs us to trust him, too.

470
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,852
Okay.

471
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:28,489
Jess? I thought there was
a cell block on the prison?

472
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:30,513
I had it lifted just for this call.

473
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:31,738
What's wrong?

474
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:33,956
Annie.

475
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:35,563
Hicks took her to the hospital.

476
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,584
It's serious.

477
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:39,701
Does Deacon know?

478
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:41,069
Not yet.

479
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:43,705
Is the situation there under
control? Can I pull him out?

480
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:45,673
I can't say that just yet.

481
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,241
Gunnar Cade's making some kind of play,

482
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:48,876
and we don't even know what.

483
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:50,678
He's still got Sister Carmelita.

484
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:52,547
We're a long way from calling this a day.

485
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:53,581
Understood.

486
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:55,602
What do you want me to do about Deacon?

487
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,590
I'm not gonna compromise him
or the team while you're inside.

488
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:04,027
We keep this between us.

489
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:07,261
Roger that.

490
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:14,955
Right side clear.

491
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,083
Left side clear.

492
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:22,052
- What is this place?
- Not sure, Rocker.

493
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,978
Guess it used to be the prison infirmary.

494
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:26,258
Looks more like an old factory now.

495
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:31,452
Now I understand how someone
makes money running a prison.

496
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:33,921
Cheap labor to make bulletproof vests.

497
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:35,223
Gun!

498
00:25:41,363 --> 00:25:43,500
Move, move, move!

499
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,945
Two, two, two.

500
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:49,907
Two, two, two.

501
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:27,208
I see you guys are itching for a fight.

502
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,677
And if you think
you have nothing to lose,

503
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:31,740
by all means, have at it.

504
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:33,982
That said,

505
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:36,851
the prison armory didn't have
enough guns for everybody.

506
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:38,786
So at most,

507
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,788
two of you are armed.

508
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:43,736
The rest of you are holding
homemade shanks,

509
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:47,256
assuming a bulletproof vest
will save your life.

510
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:51,799
Thing about those vests,

511
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:54,569
well, our 5.56 rounds

512
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:56,974
go through 'em
like a knife through butter.

513
00:26:57,435 --> 00:27:00,141
Oh, yeah, the other
thing about those vests.

514
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,577
They don't make 'em for your head.

515
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:04,745
And we practice our shooting

516
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,317
all day, every day.

517
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:10,318
So, you tell me.

518
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,573
How's this gonna go?

519
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,592
Easy, easy, easy.

520
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,877
Go.

521
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:29,103
Tan, door.

522
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:30,691
In the cooler, right now!

523
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,173
- Go, let's go! Let's go!
- In the cooler! Move, move!

524
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:33,207
Move, move, move!
In the cooler, let's go.

525
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:34,208
Move, move!

526
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:35,243
Come on, move it!

527
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:36,544
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

528
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:45,586
Moco Hernandez. On the ground, big fella.

529
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:49,693
Last warning. On the ground now!

530
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,972
Got your back if you want to handle this.

531
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,656
Thanks, Rocker.

532
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:56,764
Can't we just shoot him?

533
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,999
Fine. Okay. We do this together.

534
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:32,300
Get down, Moco.

535
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:37,071
God, he's strong.

536
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:39,640
I got him. Oh, God.

537
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:43,538
Stay down, buddy.

538
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:49,014
Excuse me. You're here for Annie Kay?

539
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:50,883
Yes. I'm-I'm not family.

540
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:53,018
Uh, her husband works for me. He's a cop.

541
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:54,920
I'm trying real hard
to get him down here.

542
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:56,349
Yes, well, we don't have much time.

543
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:57,675
We did more tests.

544
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,168
The symptoms you noticed and
the bleeding in Annie's brain

545
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:02,037
are the result of a meningioma.

546
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,505
That's a non-cancerous tumor.

547
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,839
And how dangerous is that?

548
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:06,908
There's swelling in her brain
and it's getting worse,

549
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:08,479
so we have to drill a hole into her skull

550
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,693
and drain excess fluid.

551
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,150
Good Lord.

552
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:15,617
Just tell me the truth, Doc.
Is Barb gonna be okay?

553
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:16,779
Excuse me, who's Barb?

554
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:20,622
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Um, uh, Barb was my wife.

555
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:22,057
I meant to say Annie.

556
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:23,925
Any time we have to go into the brain,

557
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,960
there's a chance there
could be serious damage.

558
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:28,596
Now, we can hold off on surgery
for just a little while longer,

559
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:30,762
but her husband needs to get here soon.

560
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:33,588
Yeah, well, I'm-I'm, I'm working on that.

561
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:39,941
26-David to Command.

562
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:42,110
We have the construction workers
with us and Big Moco

563
00:29:42,144 --> 00:29:43,211
is back in custody.

564
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:44,379
Roger that.

565
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:46,448
That's 80% of the rioters
back in their cells.

566
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:48,116
Ten hostages rescued.

567
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,584
Seven to go.

568
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:51,152
Captain, there's something else.

569
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:52,554
What?

570
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:55,990
Well, I heard Deacon mention
inexperienced prison guards.

571
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:57,926
I've seen overcrowded cells,

572
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,161
and I'm pretty sure
I'm standing inside a sweatshop.

573
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,797
Just saying, maybe there's more
to this prison than we know.

574
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:16,444
Hey, Telly.

575
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,509
Oh, nice work.

576
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:23,551
It's great to see you, Tell.

577
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:26,554
Thanks, Telly.

578
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:31,234
Hold up. Not you.

579
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:32,480
Hey, yo, Katrell.

580
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:34,596
You said you was gonna
get me out of here.

581
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,764
No chance.

582
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:39,234
But you know what,
I'll do you one better.

583
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,439
Hondo.

584
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:46,141
We got all the One-Niners in their cells.

585
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:47,375
All right. Good work, Deac.

586
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:49,611
Hostages are all accounted for, too.

587
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:50,779
Had a little inside help.

588
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:52,708
All right, that just leaves
Sister Carmelita.

589
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:55,378
And Gunnar Cade
and his crew. We're on our way.

590
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:58,419
Roger that.

591
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,526
So it turns out, maybe these geniuses

592
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,295
aren't stupid after all.
Tell him what you translated.

593
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:08,863
Gunnar likes World War II stuff,

594
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:10,565
so he uses old codes in his letters.

595
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,133
Norse references stand in
for the alphabet.

596
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:13,334
Sentences are actually words.

597
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:15,637
This message was received
from another gang member

598
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:17,305
before the riot started.

599
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:20,308
What does it say?

600
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:21,976
It's a single name. Dale DeGroat.

601
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:23,912
I looked it up
in prison database, got nothing.

602
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,776
Well, then something's missing.

603
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,483
Dale DeGroat. Let me ask.

604
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,819
Mr. Jones, I need a word.

605
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:32,608
- Of course. What is it?
- My team came across

606
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:33,988
a name that's not in your database.

607
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:35,190
Dale DeGroat?

608
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:36,691
Any idea who that is?

609
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:39,475
We keep a few inmates
in a separate cellblock:

610
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:41,034
protective custody.

611
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:43,565
They have to have
their own security protocol,

612
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,066
which locks them in their
cells during a riot.

613
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,168
Cost me a fortune.

614
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:50,271
The name you're looking for,

615
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:53,061
you'll find it in this file.

616
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:55,343
Why didn't you show us this before?

617
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:57,474
I didn't think the riot
could reach that section.

618
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:59,347
My people are finding things
inside this prison

619
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:00,748
they didn't expect to find.

620
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:02,350
When this is over,

621
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:04,114
we're gonna come back to that.

622
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:08,189
All right, listen up, people.

623
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:10,124
We got an I.D. on Dale DeGroat.

624
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,759
He's an inmate in protective custody.

625
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,581
- Means he's probably an informant.
- Yeah.

626
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:15,630
DeGroat was transferred here
a week ago after making a deal

627
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:18,633
with the D.A.'s office.
If he testifies, it could put

628
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,069
about a dozen of Gunnar Cade's
meth business buddies in jail.

629
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:22,842
So that's what Gunnar Cade was up to.

630
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:24,035
He told the other gangs that he was gonna

631
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,740
start a riot, distract us long enough

632
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:27,942
for him to find Dale DeGroat.
And if anything went wrong,

633
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:29,978
he still had Sister Carmelita
as collateral.

634
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:31,946
- He's not dumb.
- No, he's not.

635
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:33,948
We think Gunnar Cade is
going after Dale DeGroat

636
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:36,317
in Cellblock D. Let's roll.

637
00:32:41,257 --> 00:32:43,925
I'm your angel of death, Dale.

638
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,094
I want you to know
what I'm gonna do with you

639
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:47,795
once I burn through this door.

640
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:58,406
Carmelita, do you believe in redemption?

641
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:01,776
I believe in second chances.

642
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:05,633
Even for you.

643
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,347
It's never too late to
accept God in your life.

644
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,350
Change your ways.

645
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,959
Don't do this.

646
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,369
I'm gonna burn this rat alive.

647
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:30,475
Then...

648
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,140
I'll worry about redemption.

649
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:38,112
Should be about five of them
left, including Gunnar Cade.

650
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:39,814
Protective custody is
that way. Where's Hondo?

651
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:41,015
He's coming.

652
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,484
I'm here. Mask up.

653
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:07,590
Give me a two! Two!

654
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:09,577
Down! Down!

655
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:11,346
Give me your hands!

656
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:13,826
Hands behind your back!

657
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:16,484
Think I care if I get caught?

658
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:17,518
No.

659
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,433
Gun!

660
00:34:26,253 --> 00:34:27,654
Sister Carmelita.

661
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:28,855
- You all right?
- Yeah.

662
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,956
Luca!

663
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,224
Yeah!

664
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:32,692
We got you, okay? We got you.

665
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,194
I got her, got her, got her.

666
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:35,228
You okay?

667
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:37,664
Hondo, I got your six.

668
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:26,726
That's not Gunnar. Rocker, take him.

669
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:27,779
Got him.

670
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:31,451
Stay down!

671
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,832
Mr. Jones, how many guards
did you say you have?

672
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,567
- Six.
- Not seven?

673
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:01,736
No. Why?

674
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,404
Stay back.

675
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:14,876
Gunnar Cade! Get on the ground.

676
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,241
Right now.

677
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,834
On the ground. Now!

678
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,185
Gunnar Cade's been neutralized.

679
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:41,391
Situation is under control.

680
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:44,058
- Thank you.
- Sister.

681
00:36:44,092 --> 00:36:45,693
Hondo.

682
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,495
Why am I not surprised to see you here?

683
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,395
I'm sorry I caused you all this trouble.

684
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:53,233
Oh, stop it. You're never any trouble.
How is she, Luca?

685
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:55,202
- She's gonna be fine.
- Well, better be.

686
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:56,939
I got a new group of inmates at Lompoc

687
00:36:56,974 --> 00:36:58,241
I'm supposed to start with next week.

688
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:02,009
Is that all of them?

689
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,410
All prisoners accounted for.

690
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:08,248
Deacon. I got to talk to you.

691
00:37:08,283 --> 00:37:09,679
All right, let me just
bandage her up first.

692
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:12,252
No, no. Let Luca do it.
I need you right now.

693
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:13,487
Okay.

694
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:17,458
Yeah, what is it?

695
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,930
It's Annie.

696
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:24,331
What about her?

697
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:14,966
- I'm looking for an Annie...
- Deacon!

698
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,417
Yeah. Where is she?

699
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:17,851
I tried, I really, I really tried, man,

700
00:38:17,886 --> 00:38:19,753
they just couldn't wait any longer.

701
00:38:19,788 --> 00:38:21,066
She's been in surgery
the last 20 minutes.

702
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,124
What? What happened?

703
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:24,255
- What... did something cause this?
- Well, we're finding out as we go,

704
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,993
and as soon as they know
anything, they're gonna tell us.

705
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:27,294
All right? It's gonna be okay, brother.

706
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,096
We're gonna get through this.

707
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:31,688
Thank you.

708
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:33,267
- Thank you for being here.
- Of course, man.

709
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:34,835
I don't know what I would've
done if she was alone for this.

710
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:36,503
- Oh, what, are you kidding me?
- I can't believe that

711
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:38,439
- I-I wasn't here for her. I...
- Oh... hey, hey, hey, hey.

712
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:40,174
Listen to me. Don't do that.

713
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,310
Don't do that.

714
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:44,945
You're gonna drive yourself crazy.

715
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:46,814
All right, believe me.

716
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:49,087
I know, all right?

717
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,230
Bottom line is, you're here now.

718
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:56,690
All right? All right?

719
00:38:58,132 --> 00:38:59,092
And you have people here

720
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:00,060
who need you.

721
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:01,295
- Daddy. Daddy.
- Oh, hey.

722
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:03,330
- Oh.
- You're here.

723
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:08,287
Where is he?

724
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,225
Tremendous job, Officer.

725
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,243
Actually, it's Sergeant.

726
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:18,414
Uh, well, my apologies, Sergeant,

727
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:20,147
uh, but <i>this</i>

728
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:21,982
is how justice should be served.

729
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:23,884
- Thank you.
- What are you thanking me for?

730
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:25,085
Saving your sweatshop?

731
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,553
Getting your prisoners back under control

732
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:28,088
so you can shove them four in a cell?

733
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:29,857
I don't know what you're referring to.

734
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,425
My ass you don't.

735
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:32,826
Now, I don't know how dirty this goes,

736
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,495
but I know you're neck-deep.

737
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:36,063
I know the warden's dead
and a nun got stabbed

738
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:38,165
because of the conditions
you created in here.

739
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:40,167
Be careful, Sergeant.

740
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:42,769
There's still libel laws in this country.

741
00:39:42,804 --> 00:39:44,404
You should be careful
what you accuse me of,

742
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,340
unless you want to mix
it up with my lawyer.

743
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:48,036
Please. Please.

744
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,910
You tell me when and where,
and I will be there.

745
00:39:49,944 --> 00:39:51,445
Because I'm going
to the Bureau of Prisons,

746
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,013
I'm gonna go to the city council.

747
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:54,848
I will bang my drum
to anyone who will listen

748
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:57,217
because I will see
that you pay for all of it.

749
00:39:57,252 --> 00:40:00,854
I treated them like
they deserved to be treated.

750
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,357
This is a prison, not a country club.

751
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:06,326
I'll remind you of that
when I toss your ass in one.

752
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,201
He always angry like that?

753
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:16,403
Only when he sees someone
who deserves to be behind bars.

754
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,238
In my experience,

755
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:20,276
he always puts them there.

756
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:41,795
Who's that? What's up, buddy?

757
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:43,830
- Hey, little man.
- Hey.

758
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:48,835
Hey.

759
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:53,740
Hey, Deac.

760
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:55,475
Yeah.

761
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,677
You take her.

762
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:57,778
Here you go.

763
00:40:57,812 --> 00:40:58,612
Come here, little one.

764
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:00,080
Oh, go see Uncle Luca.

765
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,082
Go sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

766
00:41:02,116 --> 00:41:03,611
There you go.

767
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,025
Did you get here in time to see her?

768
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,127
No.

769
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:17,097
But you did the right thing,
though, you and Cortez.

770
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,566
Not telling me.

771
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:22,867
Would have, uh, would've
compromised my judgment

772
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:24,162
and would've hurt the team.

773
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,341
I'd have done the same thing.

774
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,675
That's why you're the best.

775
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,278
And Annie's the best, too, Deac.

776
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:33,914
She's gonna fight her
ass off, you know that.

777
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:38,312
You know, uh...

778
00:41:39,153 --> 00:41:40,621
today is my...

779
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,359
today is my tenth anniversary with SWAT.

780
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,359
I didn't know that.

781
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:46,487
Yeah.

782
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,491
When I started, Annie and I,
we made a will.

783
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,577
We planned for one thing:

784
00:41:54,954 --> 00:41:57,404
what they would do
if something happened to me.

785
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:03,877
Never planned on anything
happening to her.

786
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:12,019
I did figure out one thing, though.

787
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:13,720
What's that?

788
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:16,934
I know what my chair is.

789
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:20,855
It's Annie.

790
00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:34,646

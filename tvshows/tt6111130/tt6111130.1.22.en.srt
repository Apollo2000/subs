1
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:05,126
All right, boys,

2
00:00:05,127 --> 00:00:06,260
ring the doorbell and ditch

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,359
before somebody answers.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,192
Me and Leroy got those two houses.

5
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:10,352
Darryl, you take that one.

6
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:12,352
Come on.

7
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:27,943
Hey.

8
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:31,246
Aw, shoot. The cops.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,315
No, they ain't here for us.

10
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:35,250
Okay, let me see hands.

11
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,418
Hands.

12
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,086
What are you running from?

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,322
Officer, we were just playing
a stupid game.

14
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:41,723
Up against the car.

15
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:45,739
Now.

16
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,346
A burglary was reported in the area.

17
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:52,801
We're looking for suspects.

18
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,137
Why are you talking to us?
We didn't steal nothin'.

19
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,371
Because you fit the description,

20
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:57,806
smart-ass.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,442
Yeah, right... young,
black and breathing.

22
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:01,543
Darryl, shut up.

23
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:02,878
- Man, forget this.
- Both of you shut up.

24
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,346
And I said don't move!

25
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,380
You didn't say that. You said to...

26
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,891
I said don't move!

27
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:07,983
You understand English?

28
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:09,017
Why you bum-rush <i>me?</i>

29
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,018
I ain't do nothin'!

30
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,153
This ain't right!

31
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:13,622
This is how cops get shot.

32
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,856
I told you

33
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,159
keep your hands where I could see them.

34
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:18,360
You understand?

35
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:20,796
Hey, stop resisting! Do you want

36
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,631
- to get shot?!
- No!

37
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,499
He doesn't want to get shot.

38
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,536
None of us do. Please.

39
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:30,339
Padulla.

40
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,174
They got nothing on 'em.

41
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,575
I think they get the point.

42
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,318
Have a nice evening.

43
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,253
You see those robbery suspects...

44
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:48,090
you call us. Okay?

45
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,226
Let's go.

46
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,679
Come on, Darryl.

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,120
- Stupid cops.
- Boy, what'd I tell you

48
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:03,271
about slamming my door?

49
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:04,940
Darryl started talking,
this cop grabbed him...

50
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:06,842
it looked like he was gonna shoot him.

51
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,577
Is everybody okay?

52
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,746
I used all the rules you taught me.

53
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,414
I did everything they asked.

54
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:15,017
Kept my hands in view,
kept my voice calm.

55
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,785
You tried not to give them
a reason to fear you?

56
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,220
Yeah.

57
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:21,790
Son, I'm-a tell you something.

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,400
Some people fear you

59
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,060
without even knowing you.

60
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,729
It's black versus blue.

61
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,598
But it don't got to be that way.

62
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,733
Maybe.

63
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:34,636
But what do you think
you can do about it, Hondo?

64
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,573
All right, we got a hostage situation.

65
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,575
Suspect's name is Christian Baty.

66
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,811
Someone called 911,
saying he's threatened to shoot

67
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,347
his two kids, his girlfriend
and himself with an AK-12.

68
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,448
These guys always want

69
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:48,283
to kill themselves last...
they should try

70
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:49,985
going first.

71
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,254
- We got any word on Street?
- He knows he's on standby.

72
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,489
I tried his cell a few times,
but he's not picking up.

73
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:56,124
But I'm gonna keep on trying.

74
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:07,169
911 caller says
Baty has hostages in danger.

75
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:08,904
- You need to go in now.
- All right,

76
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,405
we're a man down, but
we're ready to go in.

77
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,441
Heat sensors can't identify which room

78
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:13,809
Baty or the hostages are in.

79
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,944
The front door is reinforced.

80
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,245
All right, well, we brought
our own reinforcements.

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,713
Okay, we got the Rook, let's do this.

82
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,684
Please stand back.

83
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:31,927
Nice of you to join us, Street.

84
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,662
I'm sorry, I didn't get
the message right away.

85
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,363
I know we don't do excuses, but my mom,

86
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:37,099
she got this job in Lincoln Heights,

87
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,300
and she was supposed to take the train,

88
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:39,434
and then she started getting all these

89
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,769
anxieties, and she asked me to take her.

90
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,870
It's not gonna happen again.

91
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:43,505
You get familiar with the layout,

92
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,673
get squared away.

93
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:45,941
Yeah. Thanks. I'll be ready.

94
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,210
Boss?

95
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:51,346
This job, it's a good thing for her.

96
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,647
Get ready to roll, Street.

97
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:54,216
All right.

98
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,356
Chris, Street, go.

99
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,725
All set. Three, two, one.

100
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,578
LAPD! On the ground!

101
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:58,680
Christian Baty, get down on the ground!

102
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:00,182
All the way! Give me a two!

103
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,950
- Left side clear.
- Right side's clear.

104
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:03,185
All right, he's unarmed.

105
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,786
- We got Christian Baty.
- Roger that.

106
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,688
- No hostages, our end.
- House is clear.

107
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:07,923
No girlfriend, no kids.

108
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:09,835
Something's off.

109
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,460
You want to tell us
what the hell is going on?

110
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:14,429
You're the ones busted
in here, you tell me.

111
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,298
Why'd somebody call 911,
say you were about to kill

112
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:17,599
your girlfriend and kids?

113
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,467
I don't have a girlfriend, or kids!

114
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:22,537
Damn, sounds like we
just got swatted, boss.

115
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,707
Hondo, we may have something.

116
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:27,542
Blast plates,

117
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,411
caps, copper fuses.

118
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,244
Somebody's been messing
with explosives here.

119
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,447
Making something pretty big.

120
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:33,782
It's a list of cities. Crenshaw,

121
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,617
Baldwin Hills, Ladera Heights, Inglewood.

122
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,485
Possible targets?

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,322
Those are all black neighborhoods.

124
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,559
Hey. Who are you?

125
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,994
What the hell do you have planned?

126
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:55,527
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

127
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,731
Hondo, this is Agent Elliott Gines,

128
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:26,390
- point for the FBI.
- SWAT's here to help,

129
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:28,058
but I'd be lying
if I didn't say this guy's list

130
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:29,493
of possible targets feels personal.

131
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,061
Completely understand, Sergeant.

132
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:32,596
Now, I've interviewed
Christian Baty twice

133
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,131
in the last six months.

134
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,966
He made the FBI's watch
list for researching

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,940
improvised explosive devices,
along with this.

136
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:42,185
Baty just happens to be
a member of a white pride

137
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,967
chat group called the
"Ultimate Patriots."

138
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:45,181
These guys espouse violence

139
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,663
based on the fear

140
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,263
of the "surging minority threat."

141
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,764
Yeah, they sound awesome.

142
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:50,998
Yeah, the kind of awesome
that hides behind pseudonyms

143
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,600
- and avatars.
- Most of the time,

144
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,902
this kind of chat group
is all talk, no bite.

145
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:57,238
But a few days ago, this one went silent.

146
00:06:57,272 --> 00:07:00,141
Not before hinting at something
big happening today, though.

147
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,776
We found TATP residue in his house.

148
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,508
Evidence that Baty's making explosives,

149
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:04,829
but where are they now?

150
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,781
I got unis running
extra patrols from Crenshaw

151
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:09,684
to Ladera Heights. If they see
anything, we're mobilizing.

152
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:11,285
Sir, South L.A. is full of soft targets.

153
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,321
We need to find out exactly
what Baty's got planned.

154
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,422
And who else he might be working with.

155
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:15,523
We can search for the real names

156
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:16,691
of the people in this chat group.

157
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:17,959
"WhitePridePiper,"

158
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:19,126
"AlbinoAlbert"

159
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,261
and "ChicksDigAryans."

160
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:22,096
Yeah, count me in.

161
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,699
I'll set you up with FBI servers
and our best computer guy.

162
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,769
We I.D. these guys, and with
your local knowledge, we can

163
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:27,841
scoop these guys up faster.

164
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:28,803
- Okay.
- Whoever was behind

165
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:30,825
that swatting call
knew Baty was dangerous.

166
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,506
A friend or neighbor who
wanted to tip us off without

167
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,559
opening themselves up to
retaliation by Baty?

168
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:36,711
FBI's dealt with swatting calls before.

169
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:37,945
They're difficult to trace.

170
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,481
Let me know if you need our resources.

171
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:42,283
Gines.

172
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,352
I want to be in that room
when you question Baty.

173
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,074
Be my guest.

174
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:50,458
Deac, Luca,

175
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,560
- I need a favor.
- Sure, Hondo, what's up?

176
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:53,728
You guys still play ball
with that watch commander

177
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:54,829
out of the Southwest Division?

178
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:55,963
Lieutenant Bernard. Yeah.

179
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:57,231
Big mouth, no jump shot.

180
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,166
- Yeah, my dad was his training officer.
- I need you

181
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:00,701
to give him a call,
and get a uni to locate

182
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:02,203
someone in South L.A. for me.

183
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:04,005
- Sure, who?
- My father.

184
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,473
I talked to him this morning, he
said he was headed to Crenshaw

185
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:08,242
to hang out with some of his
friends. I tried his cell.

186
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:09,543
- He's not picking up.
- All right, we're on it.

187
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:11,579
No problem.

188
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,552
Christian Baty.

189
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:20,655
Hey.

190
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,857
Why is it always
boring-looking guys like you

191
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:25,326
who turn out to be the most dangerous?

192
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,395
Are we really gonna do this again, Agent?

193
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:28,763
"Special Agent," and yeah, yeah, we are.

194
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:29,864
Except this time,

195
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:31,273
I have bomb residue

196
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,933
and materials as evidence.

197
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,202
Tell us what the target is
and who you're working with,

198
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:38,001
maybe you won't go to prison
for the rest of your life.

199
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,130
Do you play football?

200
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:45,212
I used to.

201
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:46,623
What position?

202
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:47,830
- Linebacker?
- Halfback.

203
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:49,050
But not quarterback, though.

204
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:50,184
See, I...

205
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:52,386
I care more about facts than feelings.

206
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:54,522
And here's a fact.

207
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:56,123
Blacks can't play quarterback.

208
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:57,525
Not with the best of them, anyway.

209
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,427
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

210
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,861
'Cause I've been there and done that.

211
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:02,563
Eh, just my way of connecting.

212
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:03,931
You know, I grew up in South L.A.,

213
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,266
one of the neighborhoods on your list,

214
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,934
and there's a lot
of good people who live there.

215
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,114
Really?

216
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:11,305
Do you you have any idea
what's going on in your hood?

217
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,108
There are black armies on street corners

218
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,444
chanting to put "wings on white pigs."

219
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:18,412
You're saying someone's looking
to kill cops there?

220
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,548
I pay attention to what's going on.

221
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:22,550
There are hate groups
plotting the assassination

222
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:24,285
of white police officers.

223
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,320
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Exactly.

224
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:28,656
How is it that I know
more about what's going on

225
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,224
in this city than you do?

226
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:31,892
In your own communities?

227
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,128
Why do you leave it up to
me to protect other cops?

228
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:35,730
Let's sit you down

229
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:37,352
and see what you got to say.

230
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:43,471
Did you hear any chatter

231
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:45,339
on the streets about
someone going after cops?

232
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,151
No. Nothing I've heard.

233
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,964
He's probably just wasting our time.

234
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,444
I don't know.

235
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,813
He seemed like he was feeling it.

236
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:54,915
Let's give a heads-up to
Southwest and 77th Divisions.

237
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,618
We dig deeper, we'll find out his target.

238
00:09:57,652 --> 00:10:00,054
All right. I'm on it.

239
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,688
Our swatting call was made using
a deaf teletype relay service.

240
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:08,161
The hard of hearing use them.

241
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,297
To turn typed messages
into voice messages.

242
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:12,830
Prevents us from I.D.'ing
the caller's voice.

243
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:15,824
But these services aren't as
anonymous as you might think.

244
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,714
We traced the call through dispatch.

245
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:20,048
Our swatter tried to mask
his location by connecting

246
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:22,883
to a non-emergency line
before transferring to 911,

247
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:24,618
but I focused on the signal,

248
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:27,221
found the physical address:
an apartment in Echo Park.

249
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:29,256
I want unis there now.

250
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:37,064
Did you know Commissioner
Plank was stepping down

251
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,199
to run for governor?

252
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,775
No.

253
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,635
Hey, Annie, what are you doing here?

254
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,237
I was just on my way home
from a doctor's visit,

255
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:46,073
and guess who just got
a totally clean bill of health.

256
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:47,308
Are you serious?

257
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,243
Brain scan, blood test, all checked out.

258
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,278
No more worries about tumors.

259
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:53,747
I guess you're stuck with me
a little while longer.

260
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,816
Oh, my goodness.

261
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,651
All your hard work, all the rehab.

262
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,154
Well, I could not have done it
without you.

263
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,637
Hey, I know you're busy.

264
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,057
I just wanted to tell you in person.

265
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,258
And kiss you.

266
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,827
- And tell you I love you.
- Love you, too.

267
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:08,495
Annie!

268
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,064
Hey, Luca.

269
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:11,799
- Bye, Luca.
- What's up?

270
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,801
Hey, how's the rehab going?

271
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:15,469
She's got a clean bill of health.

272
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,438
Deac! That's awesome, man.

273
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:19,073
Yeah, it's a blessing.

274
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:20,608
We got to celebrate.

275
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:22,009
Sure thing, man. What
did you have in mind?

276
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:23,217
Well, I'm thinking I got to come up

277
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,749
with a really big surprise for Annie.

278
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,014
Dude, Annie always sniffs
out your surprises.

279
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,254
Not this time.

280
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,785
Sorry. It's my mom's first day at work,

281
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,487
and she's kind of freaking out.

282
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,322
At least she knows how
to use her phone now.

283
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:37,157
What's her job?

284
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,926
I found this opening at this deli.

285
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,461
They hire parolees.

286
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:43,163
Bunch of hard ex-cons
and my mom selling sandwiches.

287
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,531
I can't imagine

288
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,834
it's easy starting a new
life with a past like hers.

289
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:48,869
It's just a little different
than I expected.

290
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:50,971
You know, I got to...
I got to grocery shop

291
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,973
so we can fix breakfast
together, and then I...

292
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,208
I got to try and get home
in time to set the dinner table.

293
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,711
It's like she's still on
this prison schedule, you know?

294
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:59,013
Our little boy's growing up.

295
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,315
Let's not get carried away.

296
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,183
Ran your parameters through our database.

297
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:05,779
Came up with fellow chat room
buddies of your suspect.

298
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:06,979
Connor Glenski.

299
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,113
Used to affiliate

300
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:09,715
with local white pride groups in Fontana.

301
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:11,750
I got two more. Jacob
Sullivan from Wyoming

302
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:13,952
and Garrett Logan from Virginia.

303
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:16,059
- How'd you find them so fast?
- We're the FBI.

304
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:18,924
We've got equipment and
algorithms locals can't touch.

305
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,559
Don't got one of those, though.

306
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:22,761
Sweet jacket. Got any for sale?

307
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:25,297
After you finish with this, I'll
see if I can scrounge one up.

308
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:26,832
I'm gonna get these names

309
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,300
to Agent Gines. Excuse me.

310
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,738
Mom?

311
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,673
Jimmy, I need you here right now.

312
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:37,142
What's wrong? Your Uncle Ralph is here.

313
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,811
Mom, Uncle Ralph lives in Phoenix.

314
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,079
I mean, we haven't seen him since...

315
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:42,247
I know, si-since after the funeral.

316
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:44,349
But he's here. Now.

317
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,951
I think he wants to hurt me.

318
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,519
Are you sure it's him?

319
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:49,655
I mean, it's been 20 years
since you've seen him.

320
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:52,691
It's him. You remember how angry he was

321
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,259
after your father died?

322
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,462
And-and how he talked
about getting back at me

323
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:57,830
if he ever had the chance?

324
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,198
Ma, hey. Just take a breath.

325
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:00,666
Okay? Take a breath.

326
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,301
I don't know what he wants to do to me.

327
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,769
Just come down here, please.

328
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,137
We're in the middle of a case.

329
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:06,939
Okay-okay.

330
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,140
I understand.

331
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,175
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just scared.

332
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,711
Mom. Mom?

333
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,115
I've updated Gines. Let's go.

334
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:17,995
Actually, Chris...

335
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,044
take the Charger,

336
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:20,385
- head back to HQ without me.
- All right, funny guy.

337
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,987
- Come on.
- I know it sounds crazy,

338
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:24,022
but I got an emergency. I got...
I'll meet up with you later.

339
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:25,205
- What?
- I can't argue right now.

340
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,191
I just got to go.

341
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,160
Hell you do. What am I
supposed to tell Hondo?

342
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:30,696
I covered for you going AWOL
before, and I got burned.

343
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,331
I know, I... You don't have to say a word

344
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,732
- to Hondo, okay? I'm gonna talk to him.
- Okay.

345
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,300
How do you know
she's not playing you again?

346
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:36,446
Who?

347
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,170
Come on, don't put me in this position.

348
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:40,038
Look, I said I was gonna talk
to Hondo, okay?

349
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:42,207
It's not on you.
I'm gonna take care of it.

350
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,066
Street.

351
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,352
Hondo, we got the names

352
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:49,438
of Baty's accomplices.

353
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,602
Yeah, I just talked to Gines.

354
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:51,884
- We're looking into it.
- Great.

355
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,448
Chris is on her way back
to HQ now with the intel.

356
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,544
Listen, I got to make
a quick detour, though.

357
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,891
You remember the arrest I made
on that gunrunner in Palmdale?

358
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,592
Yeah. Yeah, what's going on?

359
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,867
Well, uh, I got
an on-call subpoena for it.

360
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,232
And, uh, D.A. needs me to appear in court

361
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,433
in, like, 30 minutes.

362
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:10,035
Listen, uh,
I'm gonna split off to respond,

363
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:11,670
but I should be back in time to, uh...

364
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:13,372
I should be back in time
to move on these guys.

365
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:15,908
- All right. Roger that.
- Thanks.

366
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:23,925
I got him from here.

367
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,052
Thanks.

368
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:26,051
Wow.

369
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,553
I live my whole life right.

370
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,688
I ain't been in a police station
over 45 years,

371
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,518
and it takes my son to have me arrested?

372
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:33,292
Okay, look here, ain't
nobody arresting you, Pop.

373
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:34,726
I thought we agreed

374
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,695
that you would keep us updated
on where you would be.

375
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:37,930
- What, like I'm 12 years old?
- No.

376
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:38,964
Like you have a medical condition

377
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:40,065
that can be a problem

378
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:41,533
if you don't stay on top of it.

379
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,101
That was the point of moving you to L.A.,

380
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:45,103
so me and Brie could be here for you.

381
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:47,272
Look, I was down on Crenshaw
looking after Ms. Reginald.

382
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:48,540
See, there's this guy that keeps coming

383
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,475
around her neighborhood, and, well,

384
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,958
she just wants somebody
to look out for her, that's all.

385
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,580
Oh, right. You is that someone,
huh? Come on, man.

386
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,748
This ain't got nothing to do
with her being single, huh?

387
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,250
I've been gone for 30 years.

388
00:14:58,284 --> 00:15:00,385
I'm just reconnecting
with my community, that's all.

389
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,987
Okay, well, you can reconnect
with your community

390
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:03,388
by letting people like Ms. Reginald know

391
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,556
she can call the cops

392
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:05,624
if she got a problem.

393
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:06,792
It ain't that simple for some people.

394
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:09,061
Oh, here we go. Black versus blue, right?

395
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,762
I've been telling you since I was a kid

396
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,064
it ain't got to be like that.

397
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:13,632
You're the one who told
me that if I wanted

398
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,434
to do something about the
police, I should join them.

399
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:18,737
Yeah, but I was just
making a point about futility.

400
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,906
Ain't nobody with any sense expected you

401
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,941
to actually start wearing a badge.

402
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,309
All right, I ain't gonna
do this right now, Pop.

403
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:25,477
We can talk about it later.

404
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:26,812
All right, come on.

405
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,914
Look, our counselor has a couch and a TV.

406
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:30,282
You can post up there for now.

407
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:33,413
Hondo, I know you.

408
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:35,454
And I know when something's wrong.
What's really going on?

409
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,024
All right, real talk?

410
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:40,792
There's a bomb threat in South L.A.

411
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:42,628
We're trying to locate
it and shut it down.

412
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,463
- And you want me out of harm's way?
- That's right.

413
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:45,864
What about the other people, son?

414
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,099
That just don't seem fair.

415
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,267
We got cops all over the neighborhood

416
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:49,883
trying to find these suspects.

417
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,970
Listen, I was born and raised
there, and so were you.

418
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:55,207
I can't just sit here on my ass
if it's in danger.

419
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:57,042
Pop, will you let me do my job?

420
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:59,144
I can't do that if I'm worried about you.

421
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,913
It is my turn to take
care of this community.

422
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:06,485
Officer. Get him set up

423
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,520
- in the counselor's office, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:15,327
We checked our swatter's apartment

425
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,162
in Echo Park. No one lives there.

426
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:19,164
I was afraid of that. It's a dead end.

427
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,199
Not quite. We looked into

428
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:22,567
the apartment's lease history.

429
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,303
Last one was a long-term agreement,

430
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:26,238
but no one remembers
what the tenant looked like.

431
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:27,406
Well, he must have kept a low profile.

432
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,874
Made us look closer.

433
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:31,510
Boring location, lots of exits,
and a bathroom

434
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,378
perfect to use as a darkroom.

435
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,313
Sounds like a safe house.

436
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:35,387
I made some calls.

437
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:38,250
It <i>was</i> a safe house. For the FBI.

438
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,153
I also looked into you.

439
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:42,688
Your daughter has a friend who's deaf

440
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:45,624
and uses the same relay service
our swatter used.

441
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,093
You made that 911 call.

442
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:53,565
What else are you hiding?

443
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,526
The more I dug into Baty, the more I knew

444
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,953
how dangerous he was.
Now, I went to my superiors.

445
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,698
I even went to the higher-ups
in the Justice Department.

446
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,300
No one thought
we had enough for a warrant.

447
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:08,777
No one took it seriously.

448
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,060
So you used SWAT
to get inside Baty's house

449
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:12,400
to uncover his plan?

450
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,319
That stunt could have led
to my guys killing people

451
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:15,726
under false pretenses.

452
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,391
And you know what I'm talking about.

453
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:20,395
How many people are gonna die

454
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:21,563
if Baty isn't stopped?

455
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:23,064
Now, we all know

456
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:25,867
his accomplice is gonna do
something today, right?

457
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:30,138
So who are we going after here?

458
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:32,807
Now, you could spend your time
digging into me,

459
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:34,637
trying to prove I made that call.

460
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,545
Or you could focus on stopping
this attack.

461
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,485
Agent Gines.

462
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:42,487
Could you excuse us, please?

463
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:46,390
Stay in the building.

464
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,865
Anything we found in Baty's house

465
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,340
can't be used in court.

466
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,168
Well, it leaves us two choices.

467
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,303
Maintain plausible deniability,
keep it under wraps

468
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:02,240
for a few hours, which makes us complicit

469
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:04,136
in a cover-up with the FBI.

470
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,877
Or release Baty back on the street.

471
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,812
Hold up, hold up. Release Baty?

472
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,814
We know he's been making explosives.

473
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:12,150
He's got accomplices out
there ready to use them.

474
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:14,719
And it was an illegal search.

475
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:18,556
Hmm.

476
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:26,731
Are we just gonna

477
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,733
- let this clown walk?
- Yeah, what's the word, Hondo?

478
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,935
We're letting him walk,
we're not letting him go.

479
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:32,069
We're gonna roll with Baty,

480
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:33,437
and we're gonna watch his every move.

481
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:34,438
I called in a few favors

482
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:36,007
with some outsiders who're gonna help us

483
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,508
- keep an eye on him.
- You think Baty's gonna lead us

484
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:38,576
to his accomplices?

485
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,610
Heard you're a man down,

486
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,279
so Rocker and I agreed to chip in.

487
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:43,548
- We're upgrades, honestly.
- Appreciate that.

488
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:44,815
All right, load up.

489
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,816
Let's get ready to move out.

490
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:47,451
- Let's go.
- Chris, hold on a second.

491
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,517
You and I got to talk about Street.

492
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:52,523
I called the D.A.
He never got subpoenaed.

493
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:54,926
- Subpoenaed?
- Where the hell is he, Chris?

494
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,127
What did he tell you?

495
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,595
That he needed to appear in court.

496
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,097
Only his case was never
on the books for today.

497
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,134
I'm sorry, boss. I assumed
you knew what was going on. I...

498
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:04,936
He swore to me
he was gonna call you right away

499
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,070
and tell you the truth.

500
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,738
What is the truth, Chris?

501
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,207
He didn't say exactly yet.

502
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,942
Just think there's some kind of drama

503
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:12,109
going on with his mom.

504
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:18,382
Ma.

505
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,785
- Hey.
- Oh, Jimmy. Oh!

506
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:22,153
Hey, it's okay.

507
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:24,388
It's all right. I'm here.

508
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:25,823
I didn't mean to ruin your day at work.

509
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:27,992
I know how important work is for you.

510
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:30,661
Ma, take breaths, okay?
Take deep breaths.

511
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,763
Okay.

512
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,834
Drea's gonna let you sit
for a couple minutes.

513
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,836
Everything's cool, okay?

514
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,304
- Okay.
- All right, just relax.

515
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,190
- Okay. Okay.
- Relax.

516
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:44,075
Where is he?

517
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:45,403
Who?

518
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,845
The guy my mom thinks is my Uncle Ralph.

519
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:04,495
Jimmy.

520
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:08,099
You grew up big.

521
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,795
<i>I got Baty</i> in a Code 37 plate number.

522
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,672
John, Adam, Nine, Edward, Three, David,

523
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:16,007
headed south on Crenshaw.

524
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,142
Deacon, Luca,
keep a perimeter to the north.

525
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,644
We're in position, Hondo.

526
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:20,745
Chris, keep a perimeter to the south.

527
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,480
- Mumford and Rocker to the west.
- On it.

528
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,382
Looks like Baty's heading into South L.A.

529
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,950
This guy gets released,
and the first place he heads for

530
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:27,151
is the neighborhood he's targeting?

531
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,819
I had him and his car searched at HQ.

532
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,054
No guns or explosives.

533
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:32,323
But he could be meeting
with the people who have them.

534
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,258
Eyes peeled, people.

535
00:20:44,903 --> 00:20:46,904
Think we just got made.

536
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:49,073
Good. I want Baty

537
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,141
to think he's smarter than us.

538
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,009
That's why I called in favors.

539
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,482
All right, Little Red.

540
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:00,251
- You sure you're up for this?
- Depends, Hondo.

541
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,987
You gonna talk to that D.A.
about my possession charge?

542
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:05,356
And don't pull one of them
cop tricks like last time.

543
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,158
Look, man, a deal's a deal,
assuming you and your boys

544
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:08,259
don't lose this guy.

545
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,562
Look, you see anything,

546
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,831
you text us, and we'll handle
it from there, you understand?

547
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:14,865
Mm-hmm.

548
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:19,003
Guy is definitely not from around here.

549
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:20,504
More like the North Pole.

550
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:22,606
How dangerous is he?

551
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,076
Too dangerous to talk about, Red.

552
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,244
Wait, you serious?

553
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,846
Welcome to my world.

554
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,614
How's it feel to be working
with the good guys?

555
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:32,283
Jury's still out on that.

556
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,854
Hey.

557
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,390
How'd you find Mom?

558
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,059
When lowlife murderers
are released from prison,

559
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:45,062
the parole board notifies the
families of their victims.

560
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,964
It wasn't hard to track her down.

561
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:49,567
- Why are you here?
- To collect family property.

562
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,303
Your mom has a necklace
that belonged to my mother.

563
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:53,571
Antique gold.

564
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,805
Ma, go back inside.

565
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,074
This necklace is not yours. Shh.

566
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:00,244
You kept it as some kind of sick
trophy after killing my brother!

567
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,545
No, I earned this necklace

568
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,280
after all the beatings I took from him!

569
00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:04,782
- Is that right?
- Hey. Hey! Hey.

570
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:06,884
You're not stepping to my mom,
Ralph. Not happening.

571
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,619
All right, all right,
I-I don't want trouble.

572
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:10,554
I just want what's right.

573
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,890
That necklace belongs to her.
Her mother gave it to her.

574
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:15,126
Take a look at the engraving on the back.

575
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:24,835
So he's telling the truth?

576
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,071
Your Grandma Jeanie gave it to <i>me,</i> Jimmy.

577
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:29,473
Before you killed her son in cold blood.

578
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:31,809
Your brother was a violent son of a bitch

579
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:33,978
who would've killed me and Jimmy both

580
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:36,313
- if I hadn't shot him!
- Shh! Enough, enough.

581
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:37,748
Both of you, stop it.

582
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,517
Give it to me.

583
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,420
Give it to me.

584
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:53,097
Take it.

585
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:56,100
I told myself I was coming here for this.

586
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:58,302
But if I'm being honest,

587
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,038
I wanted to look you in
the face and say you're

588
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:03,474
an evil bitch who's
going to hell one day.

589
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:04,901
Hey.

590
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,480
My father, he was the worst
thing that ever happened to me.

591
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,216
So you take your necklace,
and go back to Arizona,

592
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,318
and you do not come near my mother again.

593
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,554
Or what? You gonna shoot me?

594
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,522
I thought that was her job.

595
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:20,357
Go. Now.

596
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:24,195
You only remember things the way
she wants you to remember them.

597
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:26,297
But her and your daddy,

598
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,399
they went after each other. I saw it.

599
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:29,667
I saw it.

600
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,169
Leave. Leave.

601
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,872
Good luck to you, Jimmy.

602
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,015
- Hey, man.
- You alone?

603
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,017
Yeah. Just drove past.

604
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,253
Yeah, I think I'm good, too.

605
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,524
Hondo, check this out.

606
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:54,692
Listen up,

607
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:55,893
Baty's with Connor Glenski,

608
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:57,328
one of his known associates.

609
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:58,996
Glenski's got a backpack
and may be armed.

610
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,498
- Roll with caution.
- Roger that.

611
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,233
- On our way.
- On my way.

612
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:09,073
Some guy is taking pictures of us.

613
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:10,241
- Over to the right?
- Yeah.

614
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,442
- All right, let's get going.
- Yeah.

615
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:12,877
Let's go. Go, go, go, go.

616
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:20,251
LAPD! Get off the bike!

617
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:21,752
Stop! LAPD!

618
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,121
Stop!

619
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,459
Glenski's on a black bike, headed west.

620
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,867
Off the bike, on the ground!

621
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:38,469
Off the bike now!

622
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:40,170
Watch the crossfire!

623
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,107
Get off the bike!

624
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,716
Little Red and his boys lost eyes on Baty

625
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:04,941
during the explosion. There's
not much left of Glenski.

626
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:06,442
I talked to the Bomb Squad,

627
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:09,250
and the explosives in
his backpack are made of TATP.

628
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,159
Matches the residue from Baty's house.

629
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,261
That combo's easy to make
if you know what you're doing.

630
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:15,096
And it's known for accidental detonation.

631
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,265
That's just one device. If
Baty and his friends have more,

632
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,267
- we got a serious problem.
- Speaking of Baty's friends,

633
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:21,102
credit card receipts
for Sullivan and Logan show

634
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:23,671
they bought plane tickets to
LAX yesterday. They're in town.

635
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:25,340
No hits on the BOLO search yet.

636
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,108
Deac and I are still
looking into Baty's claims

637
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:29,277
about cops being targets.
So far, nothing.

638
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,012
Got to find these guys, quick.

639
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:33,781
Keep grinding. We're running out of time.

640
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,450
Say, Hondo,

641
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,784
I thought you should know, I saw your dad

642
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,286
- leaving HQ a few minutes ago.
- What?

643
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,822
I told him to stay in Wendy's
office until the end of the day.

644
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:42,657
I tried to stop him, but I guess
he doesn't like being told.

645
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:44,993
'Cause he said something
about not wanting to be

646
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:46,761
on the sidelines while people need help.

647
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,330
- Thanks, Luca.
- Mm-hmm.

648
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:50,932
<i>Hey, Deac.</i>

649
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,334
What's this I hear about a
surprise celebration for Annie?

650
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:55,003
Putting something together, yeah.

651
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:57,005
Well, you know, since Nikki
and I eloped to Vegas,

652
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,607
I got these vendors
locked in we didn't use.

653
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,676
Maybe you want to
split the cost, you know?

654
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,612
Save some cash if you need
a flower guy or a cake.

655
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,814
Yeah. I mean, I'm putting it
together on the fly, so...

656
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:09,217
Great. So you got anybody to officiate?

657
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:12,487
'Cause you know who's
licensed in California...

658
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:22,397
I came to apologize.

659
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:25,033
I didn't mean for you to find out about
my campaign through a press conference.

660
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,035
I put myself on the line
with those proposals

661
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:29,303
because you said you would protect me.

662
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,406
Now there's gonna be a target on my back.

663
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,408
Listen, I'm a long shot
to win the governor's seat.

664
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,909
But if I do, there'll be
incredible opportunities

665
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:37,204
for you to expand your work.

666
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,547
I'm sorry about this.

667
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,883
Things moved faster than I anticipated.

668
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:44,318
Really? I looked up your website.

669
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,656
MichaelPlankForGovernor.com
was reserved five months ago,

670
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,893
before we even went public
with the police reforms.

671
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,194
You were using

672
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,729
my work to set you up for this.

673
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:55,997
Listen, that's politics.

674
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,865
Of course there was a benefit for me.

675
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,367
But the reforms are off to a great start,

676
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:00,935
and you're here to make sure
they stay on track.

677
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:02,203
I have an opportunity now

678
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,439
to implement them all across the state.

679
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:07,275
If I succeed, you'll have
a powerful ally.

680
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,078
And if you don't, people
are gonna come after my job.

681
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,282
I'm gonna tell you a secret, Jessica.

682
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:18,953
You never needed me to protect
you or to do any of this.

683
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:20,588
You got this.

684
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,098
<i>Just got back.</i>

685
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:31,532
What's going on? Where do you need me?

686
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,035
How'd your testimony go?
You gonna put the guy away?

687
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,771
False alarm. Turns out I wasn't needed.

688
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:39,540
Hey, boss. A, uh, motel manager
in Inglewood recognized

689
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,209
Jacob Sullivan and Garrett Logan.

690
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,111
Said they rented out rooms. Unis went in,

691
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,046
but all they found were
research books on Crenshaw

692
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,881
- and Micheaux Park.
- That narrows down the target area.

693
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,117
Hey, you got to see this. Come here.

694
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:52,420
This might make Baty's words
make more sense.

695
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:56,257
So, it's a video of a community
group, the Young Slausons,

696
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,760
in South L.A. They're chanting
to kill white cops

697
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:00,328
and put "wings on pigs."

698
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:01,996
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

699
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,711
So Baty was right?

700
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:05,933
Yes and no. No, it's totally fake.

701
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:07,769
It's a bunch of clips edited together,

702
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:09,637
taken out of context.
The website for this video

703
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,405
didn't check out.

704
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,941
- There are fake articles, misspellings.
- The video was posted

705
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,010
- out of Crimea. It's a troll farm.
- Yeah, it's people

706
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,678
looking to take advantage of fear,

707
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:19,514
start violence in U.S. cities.

708
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:22,150
Problem is, an online conspiracy
theorist on YouTube picked it up

709
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,585
last month, then bots on
Twitter started pushing it.

710
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,820
- Like gas on the fire.
- See, Baty and his friends

711
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:27,655
think that they're
actually protecting cops

712
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:28,990
by trying to kill Young Slausons,

713
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:30,324
but it's all based on a hoax.

714
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,592
Micheaux Park.

715
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,994
There's a celebration today,

716
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:34,428
and all the Young Slausons
are gonna be there,

717
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,830
along with hundreds of people.

718
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:37,165
Probably my pops, too.

719
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,099
What?

720
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,326
Let's move.

721
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:01,556
- Hondo.
- Pop,

722
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,990
are you in Micheaux Park?

723
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:04,284
- You know it.
- Okay, listen to me.

724
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,560
That attack I was talking about

725
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:06,894
is going down there soon.

726
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:07,962
Look, son, now,

727
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,831
- if you're asking me to leave...
- I'm not,

728
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:12,166
Pop, I'm not. I need you
to help evacuate people

729
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:14,001
before we get there,
quietly, without panic.

730
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:15,703
- Can you do that?
- Son,

731
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:17,155
I got this.

732
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:19,707
V.O.C.!

733
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,876
We got us a situation to handle.

734
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,487
All right, let's get these
people cleared out of here.

735
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,655
My team's gonna take the north end.

736
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,157
Mumford, Rocker, you go south.

737
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,159
- Let's go, everyone!
- People,

738
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,061
we need you to get out of this park!

739
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,330
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Let's go!

740
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,265
We need you to move to the front now.

741
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,499
People, you got to move!

742
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,834
You need to move out of the park!

743
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,236
- Move to the front!
- Exit that way.

744
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,872
- Everybody, move out of the park!
- Keep moving! Everybody move!

745
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:54,375
Out of the park, to the front! Pop.

746
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:02,383
We got eyes on that?!

747
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:03,618
Neither bomb was set off

748
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:05,219
in a heavily populated area.

749
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:06,454
There are no casualties.

750
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:12,560
Move!

751
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,044
Get out of here, Pop.

752
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:17,131
- Move. Get out of here.
- All right.

753
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,935
Go!

754
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:22,236
Please, come on, move out.

755
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:28,943
These bombs weren't meant to kill.

756
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:31,379
These are smaller ones herding
people to the bigger bomb

757
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,381
inside that truck! Get patrol

758
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,417
and make a wall! Keep people
away from that truck!

759
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:37,985
- Move!
- This way!

760
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,220
Away from the truck!

761
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,289
- Let's go!
- Come on!

762
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,758
Get away from the truck!

763
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:45,993
Get away from that truck.

764
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:47,628
Go!

765
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:53,134
- Keep moving.
- Go! Move, move, move! Move!

766
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:54,580
Everybody move out the front!

767
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:55,937
Do not go near that truck!

768
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,338
- Move, move! Exit!
- This way!

769
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:01,776
Hey, girls. Come here, come here.

770
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,010
I'm gonna take you to Mom, okay?

771
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,247
Here we go, here we go.

772
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,149
Move, move!

773
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:10,384
Come on, let's go! Move, move!

774
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,791
Over there! Those are Baty's guys.

775
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,326
Hey! Keep your hands up!

776
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,097
Hands behind your back!

777
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:21,429
Now! Now!

778
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,964
Got it!

779
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:31,839
Hondo!

780
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:37,144
Baty's got the truck. Get me
the MRAP. Street, let's go.

781
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,513
- Get out of the way! Out of the way!
- Move, move, move!

782
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:54,364
That truck's a sensitive bomb.

783
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:57,501
Could detonate at any second
and take out half a block.

784
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:01,806
Hondo, you have to steer it

785
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,164
away from civilians right now.

786
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,608
We're parallel with him now.

787
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:10,342
I want barricades set up on Main
moving north.

788
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:40,744
He's heading west through a parking lot

789
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:43,447
- straight for civilians.
- Hondo, he's headed for a busy

790
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:44,749
farmer's market on the
other side of that lot.

791
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:45,783
Yeah, I got him.

792
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,852
- Street, are we clear?
- Right side clear!

793
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:56,193
Hondo, Hondo, we're not gonna
be able to cut him off!

794
00:32:56,228 --> 00:32:58,062
That's not the plan, Street.

795
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:06,136
Brace yourself!

796
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:26,657
Command to 20-David. Are you there?

797
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,965
This is 20-David to Command.

798
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:48,946
We're good.

799
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:06,163
I came as soon as I heard.

800
00:34:06,197 --> 00:34:07,607
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm okay.

801
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:09,233
Dad and you could have been hurt.

802
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,748
I'm okay.

803
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:12,245
- You sure?
- Yeah.

804
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,493
Okay.

805
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:16,667
Hondo, thank you.

806
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:18,909
You're always welcome.

807
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:24,081
Same Ms. Reginald who wouldn't
call the cops, huh?

808
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,383
Yeah.

809
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:29,386
- Thanks for your help today, Pop.
- Oh.

810
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:32,091
Guess you might have to rethink
this black versus blue thing.

811
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,097
It is what it is, son.

812
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:37,962
But I saw what you did today.

813
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:41,165
As for me, I'm...

814
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,024
I was just being my son's father.

815
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:50,148
Let's go, Bri.

816
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:54,912
This is my daughter, Brianna...

817
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,039
Hey.

818
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:03,941
I, uh...

819
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:05,634
heard about Plank.

820
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:07,846
- Oh.
- So what's your next move?

821
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:10,339
Things could get rocky. I hear
the new commission president

822
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:12,265
isn't a fan of me or my ideas.

823
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,857
Well, you're not alone, Jess.

824
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,805
Me and my team got your back.

825
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,431
- I appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

826
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,884
I got your message about Street.

827
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,177
Yeah. And?

828
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:24,689
You're team leader. It's up to you.

829
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:26,924
And I support whatever that is.

830
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,685
Hondo?

831
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,687
You know David Arias?

832
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:39,156
Works for the city trade commission.

833
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,389
No.

834
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:44,150
We both do charity work for
the Boys & Girls Club of L.A.

835
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,443
I've seen him at a couple
recent functions, and, um...

836
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:50,267
he asked me out on a date.

837
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,871
Well, he sounds like a smart guy.

838
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:59,272
You and I are not leaving SWAT
anytime soon.

839
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:01,841
I'm still your boss, there's still rules.

840
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:07,113
And I thought it was time
for me... us, uh...

841
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:09,315
I don't know why I feel like
I have to tell you this.

842
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,719
Okay, Jess, Jess, we both know
why you're telling me this.

843
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,287
You deserve

844
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,823
any happiness that comes your way.

845
00:36:16,857 --> 00:36:18,159
You, too.

846
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,027
Thanks.

847
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:23,863
Mm-hmm. Hope he's ready.

848
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:43,187
You wanted to see me?

849
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,720
All right.

850
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:52,191
I figure you probably already know,

851
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:53,903
but I lied.

852
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:56,562
I lied about being needed in court,

853
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:58,030
'cause I didn't know what else

854
00:36:58,065 --> 00:36:59,499
to do, Hondo.

855
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,934
My mom was in danger. For real, man.

856
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,770
That's what you should
have told me, Street.

857
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,205
But I know how you feel about her.

858
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,274
She okay?

859
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:09,675
Yeah, she is now.

860
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,944
Good. I mean that.

861
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,079
Thanks.

862
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:15,114
But you're off SWAT.

863
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,449
What?

864
00:37:16,885 --> 00:37:18,084
Okay.

865
00:37:18,118 --> 00:37:20,186
Hondo, listen,
please don't do this, okay?

866
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,755
You're not leaving me
any choice here, Street.

867
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,124
- You report to patrol duty tomorrow.
- Okay.

868
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,560
Listen, I'm sorry, all right?

869
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:30,696
I screwed up. I-I know that, and
I take full responsibility...

870
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:32,899
You violated the trust of your teammates,

871
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,301
- your commanding officer and this city.
- Is that really

872
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:36,789
what this is about, or
is it about my mom?

873
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,906
Don't do that. Don't even go there.
I'm leaving you in Metro.

874
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,541
Any other team leader would
ship your ass off

875
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:42,909
to some corner of the city.

876
00:37:42,943 --> 00:37:45,016
You want to take full responsibility?

877
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,646
Then you get ready
for your next assignment.

878
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,948
Hondo, this is not how this ends!

879
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:52,552
Hey, don't turn your back on me,
man. I'm still talking to you!

880
00:37:53,214 --> 00:37:55,121
Right now you're off SWAT.

881
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,123
You want to stop being a cop,
you keep pushing it!

882
00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:58,124
Hondo, maybe he was just trying...

883
00:37:58,158 --> 00:37:59,492
Okay, you better be careful.

884
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:01,357
You were with him
both times he pulled this stunt.

885
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:03,077
You know, when I first joined this team,

886
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:04,864
you told me that it was a family.

887
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,467
You don't kick people out of a family!

888
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:12,004
I made a promise to Buck
to show you the right way.

889
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,307
It was my responsibility to do that,

890
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:15,775
and obviously, I failed it,

891
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,176
and you.

892
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,224
Now, I'm not giving up on you, Street.

893
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,057
But I wouldn't be doing you or this team

894
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,316
any favors if I kept letting you slide.

895
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,095
So maybe working uniform,

896
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:27,487
you can learn things
I couldn't teach you.

897
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,155
All right.

898
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,892
I don't need this.

899
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:37,342
I don't need you or anybody else.

900
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:47,373
Way to back me up with Hondo.

901
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:49,451
You mean lie to him? No, I didn't.

902
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:50,535
You didn't have to lie!

903
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,944
You said you were gonna
tell him the truth!

904
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,347
All this time acting
like you're my friend.

905
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:56,048
- I am your friend.
- Yeah.

906
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,650
And you still have a choice.
I know Hondo.

907
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,120
I know that he wants there to be
a way for you back to SWAT.

908
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:03,055
But you can't be burning that bridge.

909
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,791
It isn't me burning bridges, Chris.

910
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:08,027
It's on you and Hondo.

911
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,539
Hey, man.

912
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,723
Maybe he'll still show, Chris.

913
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:29,268
Come on. You did the right thing, boss.

914
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:31,027
I mean, SWAT has to stand for something.

915
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:32,770
Maybe he needs this.

916
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,021
Maybe he does.

917
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:38,424
Oh. Okay, everybody.

918
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:39,926
Uh, Cortez just texted,

919
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,863
and she and Annie
are outside, so, uh, places.

920
00:39:47,587 --> 00:39:49,154
Hey, Deac?

921
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:00,279
Hey, Mom.

922
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:06,779
Surprise!

923
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,189
Oh. Wow.

924
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:13,392
- What's going on?
- You're kidding. How did you know?

925
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:14,806
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

926
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,929
I had no idea

927
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:18,813
you wanted to celebrate our wedding vows.

928
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,301
Tried to warn you, Deac. There's
no pulling one over on Annie.

929
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,936
- Uh-huh.
- All right. Fair enough.

930
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:25,531
But I got her this time.

931
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:28,284
This isn't actually my surprise.

932
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:33,915
Come on.

933
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:44,223
Um, Annie... I love you.

934
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:47,994
And I know how hard you
rehabbed to get better, so,

935
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,476
I spoke to Cortez and to Hicks.

936
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:54,834
And since I've saved up 200 sick days,

937
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:58,437
I've decided to use them to
stay home, look after the kids.

938
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:03,009
You have two semesters
left of law school,

939
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,011
and it's the perfect time to finish.

940
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:25,631
Just wait a minute.

941
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:31,337
I truly appreciate this,
and everything you do, David,

942
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:34,106
but I can't go back to law school, babe.

943
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:38,444
And I want you to know
that me quitting was my choice.

944
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:42,048
And the other reason, actually...

945
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:46,452
Not everything came up normal
in my checkup.

946
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:56,062
You're pregnant?

947
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,663
She's pregnant!

948
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,899
- What?
- Again.

949
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:05,071
Damn, Deac! What kind of rehab
y'all been doing?!

950
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,373
That's how you drop a surprise!

951
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:08,808
Well, I guess I got nothing to say.

952
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:10,209
He's already kissing the damn bride.

953
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:42,620

<i>Previously on </i>S.W.A.T...

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,210
All right, want you
to fill the gaps, stay liquid.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,330
You with us, Hondo?

5
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,330
Fill the gaps, stay
liquid. You say it

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,670
so damn much, Buck, I finally
got it tattooed on my ass.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,710
All right, here we go!

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,620
<i>17-year-old young man, Raymont
Harris, was accidentally shot</i>

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,710
<i>and seriously injured
by team leader Buck Spivey.</i>

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,420
<i>This morning,</i>

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,830
I terminated Sergeant Spivey.
Today, I am assigning

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,710
command of this unit
to Sergeant Harrelson.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,540
I asked Hicks to put Street

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,540
<i>on the team in my place. </i>

15
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,540
Jim... Street.

16
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,750
This is wrong.

17
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,750
It's your job now.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,000
You have plans
tomorrow night?

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,250
You know, actually, um,

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,880
I was thinking about
asking this woman

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,670
that I work with
out to dinner.

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,620
I'm just not sure
what she might say.

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,330
Maybe she's not
into it.

24
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,620
Please.

25
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,290
Oh, she's into it.

26
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,290
Oh.

27
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,080
Trust me, she's into it.

28
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,040
It's just, um,
she's my boss.

29
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,710
Ah.

30
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,710
I know.

31
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,710
Sounds inappropriate.

32
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,710
No, it is.

33
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,960
We have to keep
the whole thing a secret,

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,500
we can't be seen together.

35
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,790
You know,
all that stupid stuff.

36
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,830
Might be tricky.

37
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,830
Mm.

38
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,670
Or it might be
kind of exciting.

39
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,710
Where you going?

40
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,330
Hey.

41
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,210
What, are we playing
hide-and-seek?

42
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,000
Happy anniversary.

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,540
Anniversary?

44
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,580
Our 13-week anniversary.

45
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,790
What?

46
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,710
Okay. 13 weeks?

47
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,120
It's no big deal.
I just... I just saw it,

48
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,290
wanted to get it
for you, so I did.

49
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,710
Baby, it is a damn nice shirt.

50
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,710
I know.

51
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,710
Yeah, of course you do.

52
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,670
There. You look
very handsome.

53
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,120
Hmm.

54
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Give me a decent head
start to Deacon's, okay?

55
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,290
So it doesn't look like
we're arriving together.

56
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,960
All right. Spot you
what, five minutes?

57
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,580
Make it ten.

Matthew's tooth is hanging
by a thread.

62
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,500
Already?

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,080
Been looking all over
for you, Annie.

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,790
Congratulations
to you both.

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,790
Oh.

66
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,080
Oh, hey,
thank you.

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,620
Where's the baby?

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,620
Oh, Grandma's
putting him down.

69
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,670
Baptism was
a bit much.

70
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,290
Although he did a lot better
than our last two.

71
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,290
Yeah.

72
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,710
Kid's tough. He's definitely
SWAT material.

73
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,500
Oh, hey, over my dead body.

74
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,040
Hey, you seen Hondo here yet?

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,120
No. I'm sure
he's on his way, though. Why?

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
You'll see. Oh,
speak of the devil.

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,880
Hey, Annie.

78
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,540
Hi.

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,540
How are you?

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,540
Okay, everyone, gather up.

81
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,830
Gather up. This way.

82
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,830
Hey, everyone,
come around.

83
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,250
Good luck.

84
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,250
Huh?

85
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,500
Come up front.

86
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,500
Gather 'round, everyone.

87
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,750
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

88
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,120
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, wow.

89
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,120
Yup.

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,460
Wow. Okay.

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,460
All right.

92
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,960
Yeah.

93
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,960
Oh!

94
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,960
Yeah. See?

95
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,670
Okay, the bad news is

96
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,750
there is no Jackass of the
Month to hand out today.

97
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,750
But the good news is
there's a Jackass of the Year!

98
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,170
This month's infraction
was a doozy, because one

99
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,080
of our own was pictured
very prominently

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,290
in the Sunday papers.

101
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,500
On the front page,

102
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,750
above the fold!

103
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,120
Ladies and gents,

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,830
it is my distinct
displeasure

105
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,250
to present Jackass
of the Year to, uh,

106
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,710
shameless media darling
Daniel "Hondo" Harrelson.

107
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,830
Come forward
to receive your punishment.

108
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,960
This way.

109
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,920
Anything you'd
like to say?

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,710
Yeah, I got something to say.
Y'all are fired.

111
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,710
I would <i>not
</i>like to thank

112
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,620
the photographer
who took this picture.

113
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,710
And to the newspaper
that published it, I curse you.

114
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,330
And certainly no thanks to Annie

115
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,120
and Deacon,
our ungracious hosts.

116
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,580
Hey, but
seriously, um...

117
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,120
I never asked for this job,
you know?

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,920
But...

119
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,540
I couldn't be prouder
of this team.

120
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,170
♪ Hold on, I'm comin'... ♪

121
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,620
Punishment!

122
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,120
Punishment! Punishment!

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,830
Okay, we need a picture
for the wall of shame.

124
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,420
I think Hondo's
got a new girl.

125
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,460
Why is that?

126
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,790
Well, don't tell me he bought
that shirt for himself.

127
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,040
I mean, that's
a woman's touch.

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,620
I haven't heard
about anyone new.

129
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,620
Hey, um, I know
Deacon felt passed over

130
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,250
when he wasn't made
team leader.

131
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,120
How's he holding up?

132
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,670
You don't have to worry about
my husband causing a problem.

133
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,670
How are you doing?

134
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,790
Look, I know it's tough,
being a cop, but...

135
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,540
sometimes I think
it's tougher loving one.

136
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,420
I thought Buck
was coming today.

137
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,500
Yeah, so did I.

138
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,500
Hmm.

139
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,040
Have you talked
to him lately?

140
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,040
No.

141
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,420
Not in a while.

142
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,420
Hmm.

143
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,620
Sorry.

144
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,620
Yeah.

145
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,210
Everyone,
you're all about to get it.

146
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,670
Come here. You
know the drill.

147
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,790
I got to go. You
take care of Mom.

148
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,290
Okay.

149
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,290
Okay, come here.

150
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,120
What about you?

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,250
You gonna take care?

152
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,210
Piece of cake.

153
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,080
Okay, you
be good.

154
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,500
Ooh.

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
I'm sorry to leave
you with the mess.

156
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,750
Ah. What I get for planning
a party when the team's on call.

157
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,830
How about we go check out
that tooth, huh, Mister?

158
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,420
Okay.

159
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,790
Deacon, Chris,

160
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,380
get these
people back.

161
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,380
Roger.

162
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,670
I need two uniforms
right here.

163
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,380
Guessing

164
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,000
this wasn't a gas leak.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,960
The gas lines are intact.

166
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,790
This one's
for the bomb boys.

167
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,750
Hey, what are we looking at,
Reggie?

168
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,210
Detect any explosive materials?

169
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,830
Yes, sir.

170
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,290
From what we're finding,

171
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,380
this place is practically
a bomb-making factory.

172
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,750
So there might
be more of these

173
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,210
already out there?

174
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,080
Street, techs haven't
cleared that yet.

175
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,540
Yeah, I hear something.
Is somebody in there?

176
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,500
Hey, hey, over here, over here.

177
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,790
I need help over here.
We got a survivor.

178
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,830
Bring me that gurney.

179
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,460
Luca, we got to
get this thing up.

180
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,000
All right, careful.

181
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,000
On three.
One, two... three!

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,670
We're right here. Hey.

183
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,210
Hey, I'm Hondo.
What's your name?

184
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,330
Maya.

185
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,300
I was vacuuming
inside my apartment.

186
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,510
I'm having people over tonight.

187
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,920
Why am I outside?

188
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,760
Okay, no, no, no.
Look at me.

189
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,090
Look at me. I need your eyes.
Keep your eyes on me.

190
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,010
I can't feel anything.

191
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,300
Is that weird?

192
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,090
No, no, no,
that's not weird. That's...

193
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,380
That's normal, Maya.

194
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,970
My whole building is gone?

195
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,760
Are the guys
next door okay?

196
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,130
What happened?

197
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,380
We're gonna find out.

198
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,380
These people are gonna
take care of you, okay?

199
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,010
Pretty big explosion.

200
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,220
Yeah. And this might
just be the beginning.

201
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,800
That's a lot
of lead-acid batteries.

202
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,220
How big an arsenal
did this guy have?

203
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,760
Go introduce
yourself to Reggie.

204
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,470
See what else
he's finding.

205
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,470
Reggie?

206
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,720
He's the lead bomb squad
operator, the big guy.

207
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,260
Go ahead. Everybody
loves Reggie.

208
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,550
Hondo, this is Agent Conley,
point for the FBI.

209
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,050
Eileen, Hondo.

210
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,970
He's our newest
SWAT team leader.

211
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,050
One fatality? That's confirmed?

212
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,050
Just the bomb builder himself.

213
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,720
Adam Jarrett, 24.

214
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,720
Still don't know

215
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,680
if he made any others
before this one, though.

216
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,760
Or what he was planning
on doing with them.

217
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,090
Well, we have our suspicions.

218
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,630
Adam made our watch list
last month,

219
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,630
surfing pro-jihad Web sites.

220
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,760
We found this in
the wreckage, too.

221
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,720
Published in Yemen.

222
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,470
Any extremist connections
to anyone here in L.A.?

223
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,510
Unknown. Could be a lone wolf.

224
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,590
Either way,
there are a few doors

225
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,470
in the Muslim community
we've been wanting to knock on.

226
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,880
This gives us
our opportunity to do so.

227
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,630
SWAT's here
to assist.

228
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,300
Well, the survivor
from 2A, Maya--

229
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,380
she asked about
"the guys next door."

230
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,680
This Adam kid might not have
been working by himself.

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
Well, he was
the only one on the lease.

232
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,300
We'll check out
our watch list most likelys

233
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,920
if you can look
into Adam's local contacts.

234
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,300
Let's keep talking.
We're here to help.

235
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,300
Okay, great.

236
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,970
Hey, listen up. These
high-end batteries--

237
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,680
no more than a dozen
stores in L.A. sell 'em.

238
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,510
Let's find a record
of that purchase.

239
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,880
We're on it.

240
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,880
Street,
you're with me.

241
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,550
We're gonna continue
your education today.

242
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,880
Hey, Maya.

243
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,760
Do you remember us?

244
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Doctors said I
would've suffocated

245
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
if you hadn't found
me when you did.

246
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,720
Are you cops?

247
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,880
Metro SWAT.

248
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,550
I talked
to your doctor.

249
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,090
She's optimistic that
you're gonna be fine.

250
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,630
I've never had surgery before.

251
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,630
Don't sweat it.
Surgeons at this place--

252
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,380
they can do anything.

253
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,380
It's time.

254
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,680
Okay, Maya,
I just have one question.

255
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,970
At the explosion, you asked
about the guys next door.

256
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,760
Was there someone else
living with Adam?

257
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,300
I don't know if
he lived there,

258
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,550
but he was always around.

259
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,630
Kyle or-or Kevin. Maybe Kenny?

260
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,680
I was worried that
maybe he was hurt, too.

261
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,340
I just don't get it.

262
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,380
Adam seemed like a normal guy.

263
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,760
Why would he do something
like this?

264
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,590
I don't know.

265
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,590
Maya, you're gonna be good.

266
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,970
Okay?

267
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,180
Hey, Street.

268
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,630
I need you find
a ride back to HQ.

269
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,130
What happened
to continuing my education?

270
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,630
This is someone I got
to talk to, alone.

271
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,130
Hey, Hondo.
Haven't seen you

272
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,220
since the
fantasy draft.

273
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,800
What place you in?

274
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,800
I think you know
the answer, Tarek.

275
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,720
Second to last?

276
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,720
Dead last.

277
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,220
Just wanted to hear you say it.

278
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,050
See you, ladies.

279
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,050
I got your text.

280
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,680
Saw the bombing on the
news-- wanted to help.

281
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,260
This guy's a
homegrown terrorist?

282
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,970
Possible. Too early to tell.

283
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,840
Hmm. People say it's,
uh, faith versus faith.

284
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,420
But that's a lie.

285
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,630
It's decent people
versus barbarians.

286
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,550
Show me who your
suspect is--

287
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,800
I'll ask around the mosques,
see if he's been around,

288
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,720
if anyone knows him.

289
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,720
I was hoping
you might say that.

290
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,420
His name is Adam Jarrett.

291
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,420
White kid?

292
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,880
I know. Now, he
may have been working

293
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,720
with a friend--
if this is true,

294
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,470
we're very interested
in finding out who he is
and what his connection

295
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,840
to your community might be.

296
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,840
I learn anything, I'll
let you know immediately.

297
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,800
You always do.

298
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,720
Thanks, Tarek.

299
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,630
I've been busy
in your absence.

300
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,880
Found the store that sold
our bombers high-end batteries.

301
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Farm & Garden
in Shadow Hills.

302
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,880
We need to get
that to the FBI.

303
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Already did.

304
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,760
Did you have the store
run his name through

305
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,220
credit card purchase logs?

306
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,220
Did that, too--
Chris pulled

307
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,090
the last three weeks
of checkout line surveillance.

308
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,800
Any sign of Adam?

309
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,800
That's Adam buying
eight chrome batteries

310
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,510
and a hell of a lot
more ammonium

311
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,880
than was in that apartment.

312
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,800
That would have taken
out the entire block.

313
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,340
So there are more bombs
still out there.

314
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,010
Yeah, but the good news is,
we got some pictures

315
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,590
of the accomplice--
haven't ID'd him yet,

316
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,840
but whoever he is...

317
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,300
Just became our
top priority.

318
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,090
All right, Street, whatever
they were planning,

319
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,720
Adam going boom is gonna make
his buddies speed things up.

320
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,470
We need a name.

321
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,470
Working it.

322
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,180
There he is.

323
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,810
Thanks for
swinging by, Buck.

324
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,810
Mm-hmm.

325
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,220
Missed you earlier at Deac's.

326
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,220
I didn't want to
make it awkward.

327
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,520
Nobody wants to talk
about me getting the heave-ho.

328
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,930
Don't worry about it.

329
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,430
You're my guest.

330
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,270
Hey, listen, I've been,
uh, meaning to ask.

331
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,220
That kid I shot--
Raymont--

332
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,270
you ever... you ever
hear how he's doing?

333
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,600
Yeah.

334
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,180
I've been looking
in on him.

335
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,810
He's back on his feet, Buck,
way ahead of schedule.

336
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,180
That's great. That's great.

337
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,180
Mm-hmm.

338
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,310
You know, I've been wanting
to reach out to him,

339
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,060
but the department's
lawyers said until
a settlement's negotiated...

340
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,640
Listen, do you think

341
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,180
he would ever let me
tell him how sorry I am?

342
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,810
I'll ask Raymont and
his mom when the time is
right-- I'd be happy to.

343
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,810
Hey, Buck.

344
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,810
Great. Thanks.

345
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,100
Hey.

346
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,100
What are you doing here, man?

347
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm not, uh,
I'm not really sure.

348
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I was hoping you could take
a look at something for me.

349
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,310
Come on.

350
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,310
Come here.

351
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,520
It was no half-assed
pressure cooker, was it?

352
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,980
This kid knew
what he was doing.

353
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,140
We think he may have
finished a few these

354
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,390
before he blew himself up.

355
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,770
Street's trying to ID
his buddy right now.

356
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,770
All right, I'm on it.

357
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,560
Later, Buck. Don't be
a stranger, okay?

358
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,890
See you, brother.

359
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,890
So listen.

360
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,310
Once we get a name
on the second guy,

361
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,770
I could use your expertise--
what do you say?

362
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,140
What do I say to what?

363
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,600
Help me out?

364
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,720
Just for the day,
off the record.

365
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,270
Come on, you and I
both know I'm poison

366
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,480
in this building
since the shooting.

367
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,890
You're probably gonna
get a reprimand

368
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,930
just for walking
me through here.

369
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,930
Hicks won't care

370
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,560
as long as he gets
the credit, and you
know that. Come on, Buck.

371
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,980
You've secured
more explosives

372
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,060
than most people
in this room have ever seen.

373
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,720
It's never about
the bombs, right?

374
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,310
It's always about the
guys who make them,

375
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,350
and they're all the same.

376
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,930
How's that?

377
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,600
Nobody's pushes a button
until they stop feeling human.

378
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,850
And I just kept 'em human.

379
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,770
I see what
you're trying to do here.

380
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,390
You're trying to... trying
to make me feel useful.

381
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,980
Buck...

382
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,980
Yeah?

383
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,930
...you got screwed, man.

384
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,220
No hearing, no review.
Come on.

385
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,060
That's 100% Hicks trying
to cover his own ass.

386
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,020
I could still use you here.

387
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,350
I'm not gonna be responsible
for you getting fired, too.

388
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,020
Now, you got this.

389
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,430
I'm gonna beat it
before, you know,

390
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,270
people start thinking
this is a thing.

391
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,560
Listen, I, uh...

392
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,890
I never rooted for
days like this,

393
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,060
but, you know, chasing them down
before they did any more harm,

394
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,020
they were always my favorite.

395
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,850
Thanks. Good luck.

396
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,140
Hey, time stamp
on the photo matched

397
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,810
a debit card swipe--
we got a name.

398
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,850
Cross-referenced
his image with the DMV.

399
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,140
Second guy in the photo
with our bomber,

400
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,480
his name is
Kevin Lynch.

401
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,980
If he spent lots of time
in that apartment,

402
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,140
he's a real threat.

403
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,140
He might be the ringleader.

404
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,480
And he has his own place.
We're headed there now.

405
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,020
What else do we know about him?

406
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,020
Attended

407
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Cameron College with Adam.
Dropped out a month ago.

408
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,020
Listen up. Good chance he's

409
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,060
sitting on more bombs.

410
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,060
What's up, Hondo?

411
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,640
Watch every step.

412
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,930
Hondo.

413
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,850
Take this guy down,
but be careful, okay?

414
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,350
Piece of cake.

415
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,720
Hey.
Buck was here?

416
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,980
Yeah.

417
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,980
I didn't get
to see him.

418
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,480
Is he coming back later?

419
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,640
I don't think so, Street.

420
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,350
Eyes ahead on
the cross-traffic.

421
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,060
Clear!

422
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Whoa!

423
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,200
Reggie says
it's ammonium nitrate

424
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,660
packed in there with C-4,
same as earlier.

425
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,080
Also says he can't
believe no one died.

426
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,870
If Kevin's waging jihad, he's
not doing a very good job.

427
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,240
You got something?

428
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,080
The building security cameras.

429
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,740
Kevin called in a bomb threat
just a few minutes

430
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,870
<i>after he dropped the backpack
in the second floor lobby.</i>

431
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,080
Who are the other tenants
in the building?

432
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,870
Investment firms,
med firms...

433
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,620
Metzler Financial,
Sherman & Ross.

434
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,490
Why bomb this place?

435
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,660
Agent. The kid
called in a bomb scare

436
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,490
to clear the lobby.

437
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,490
I'm aware.

438
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,820
But wouldn't a
terrorist be going

439
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,080
for the highest
body count?

440
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,280
Not all terrorists think alike.

441
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,120
All those doors
you've been knocking down

442
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,910
in the Muslim community--
you get anything?

443
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,700
Related to this? No.

444
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,120
All due respect, Agent,
I've been going

445
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,160
down that road with you,
but look around.

446
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,620
This place was not a target
of opportunity for Kevin.

447
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,700
This was Kevin executing
his plan-- a plan that's

448
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,160
not exactly screaming
jihad to me.

449
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,160
Okay, you might be right,

450
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,490
but my bosses want me to keep
going through our watch list.

451
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,370
So where are you guys
on tracking Kevin Lynch?

452
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,910
We were on our way to his home
when this happened.

453
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,030
I doubt he'd be stupid enough
to go back there,

454
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,950
but we still need to see
what we can find.

455
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,820
Okay. Just keep me apprised.

456
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,160
Hey, Hondo.

457
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,160
Yeah, what'd Reggie say?

458
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,780
He got anyone free to
sweep Kevin's place?

459
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,780
No, he needs

460
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,370
his technicians for
another couple of hours

461
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,620
to sift through the rubble.

462
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,120
Yo, Reggie!

463
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,530
I need you to open up
your toy box for me.

464
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,120
Better not break it.

465
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,950
Let's go.

466
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,910
Kevin may have left
this place rigged,

467
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,160
so keep your eyes peeled.
Fan out around the perimeter

468
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,320
in case this place goes up.

469
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,950
Got the tree side!

470
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,320
Who's getting eyes
on that garage?

471
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
How about the new guy?

472
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,580
Fine with me.

473
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,990
Go.

474
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,160
No one's home.

475
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,870
All clear.

476
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,870
Fall back.

477
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,660
Andros is going in.

478
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,990
Where'd you learn
to operate these?

479
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,870
Celtics-Lakers.
2008 Finals.

480
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,160
My unit had to sweep
the Staples Center

481
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,660
for explosives, so...
I got certified.

482
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,200
You guys got a visual?

483
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,200
Roger that.

484
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,450
There's something
planted in here.

485
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,240
It's booby-trapped.
The place is gonna go up.

486
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,870
Along with
any evidence.

487
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,870
Stand by. Hold on.

488
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,870
<i>Might be able
to put the fire out.</i>

489
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,780
Andros must have tripped
this fail-safe.

490
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,870
It's crude,
but it's impressive.

491
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,990
The kid didn't want us
to find anything in here.

492
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,870
Boss?

493
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,120
Found a term paper cowritten
by our first bomber, Adam,

494
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,990
along with Kevin--
do you think this
is something?

495
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,620
Paper for what?

496
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,620
Camden College,
Poli-Sci 433.

497
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,200
It could be, but
I still think

498
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,700
we're missing something.
Keep looking.

499
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,200
Luca. Could we try it
my way now?

500
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,660
All right, that
works, too.

501
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,990
Guys, listen to this.

502
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,490
"When institutions favor
the haves over the have-nots,

503
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,200
"violence may not just be
an expected outcome,

504
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,580
but a certain one."

505
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,370
Chris, Street,

506
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,660
get down
to Camden College

507
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,080
and see what you can
find. Be quick. Go.

508
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,530
You guys keep digging.

509
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,530
Neither of these young men
was an academic standout.

510
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,450
Although they both got As
in that class you mentioned,

511
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,120
Poli-Sci 433.

512
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,870
I read their paper
on the way over-- intense stuff.

513
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,080
I'm familiar
with the anger in that class.

514
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,280
Students in there made the last
year of my life a nightmare.

515
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,160
They organized a protest
against the renaming

516
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,120
of our business
school.

517
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,120
What was their beef?

518
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,990
Didn't like that a
$50 million donation

519
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,120
was going to create
"more capitalist pigs."

520
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,160
Those protests got
ugly, violent.

521
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,030
Any punishments?

522
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,030
Some suspensions.

523
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,160
Adam and Kevin
got reprimands
on their records.

524
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,870
Of course, the
actual ringleader

525
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,320
suffered no
consequences at all.

526
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,320
Who was the ringleader?

527
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,120
Their professor, Marc Lasky.

528
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,030
Whipped them all up.

529
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,780
What, he didn't get fired?

530
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,780
Our donor's been
all over us

531
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,160
to find a way
to get rid of him,

532
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,530
Lasky's got tenure.

533
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,120
He'd have to
murder someone

534
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,780
for us to
fire him.

535
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,320
Do you know where
we can find Lasky?

536
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,200
He holds office hours
for another 20 minutes.

537
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,950
I can show you where.

538
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,620
After the news broke
about the second bomber,

539
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,820
didn't take an hour for a
brick to get tossed through.

540
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,450
I'm sorry, Tarek.

541
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,820
We're exhausting every angle
we can to find him.

542
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
Nobody's seen either
of your guys around the mosques.

543
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,530
The FBI's kicking
people's doors in.

544
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,950
I know they've got a job to do,
but do you really think

545
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,370
these white American boys
are Muslim extremists?

546
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,240
I don't.

547
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Yeah, well,

548
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,660
it'd be nice
to see that on the news, too.

549
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,780
Yeah.

550
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,820
I'm really sorry
about your window.

551
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,120
Thanks.

552
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Yeah, Chris, go.
What'd you find?

553
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,240
That class was a staging ground
for some violent protests,

554
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,450
and the professor that taught it

555
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,870
was right in the middle
of it all.

556
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,240
Lasky's supposed to be
at his office

557
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,080
right now,
but it's all locked up.

558
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm listening.

559
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,240
The donor who funded
the college's business school

560
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,080
is one of
the board members here,

561
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,280
and apparently he's been
trying hard to get Lasky fired.

562
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,410
Name's, uh, Fred Dwyer.

563
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,410
As in Dwyer Capital?

564
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,450
Looks like it. Why?

565
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,870
The building that got bombed--

566
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,120
Dwyer Capital
rents half the offices

567
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,410
on the second floor.

568
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,660
That business school's
the next target.

569
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,410
Chris, get down there
and start evacuating.

570
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,490
That's Hondo. We have to
get everyone out. Come on.

571
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,240
Get out of the building.
Get out of the building.

572
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,950
Everybody out!

573
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,950
LAPD SWAT, out!

574
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,610
Get in, drop it,

575
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,780
and get out.

576
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,020
I know, Professor. You told me.

577
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,690
Twice, actually.

578
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,820
But that didn't stop you
from phoning in a bomb threat.

579
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,110
Blowing out windows
won't get people to wake up.

580
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,360
I said I'm sorry.

581
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,730
Don't be sorry.

582
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,610
Be strong.

583
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,070
LAPD SWAT, everyone out!
Everyone out! Out! Out!

584
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,070
Move, move, move, move!

585
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,690
Move! Come on, let's go!

586
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,980
Come on, move, move, move.

587
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,980
Second floor covered?

588
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,360
Every room. Rest of the team
should be here any minute.

589
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,940
LAPD SWAT, everyone out!

590
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,610
Everyone out! Out!

591
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,860
LAPD SWAT, move, move!
Everybody out.

592
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,860
Out, out, out!

593
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,610
Come on, everybody out.

594
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,610
Hey!

595
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,650
You need to evacuate. Hey!

596
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,860
Hey! Do you hear me?

597
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,220
Kevin!

598
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,760
Eyes on the suspect.

599
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,590
Eyes on Kevin Lynch
in the Dwyer building.

600
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,180
Possible bomb in his backpack.

601
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,220
Kevin!

602
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,260
Get out of the room.
Get out of the building!

603
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,760
Kevin, stop!

604
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,760
All right, nobody move.

605
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,760
LAPD SWAT.

606
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,260
Get down. Everybody out.

607
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,380
Hey, get back.

608
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,380
Kevin, drop the backpack, buddy.

609
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,340
I need to see
that backpack, okay?

610
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
He's got a bomb!

611
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,420
Move out. Everybody out,

612
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,720
everybody out.

613
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,180
Out!

614
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,180
Get out of here

615
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,970
right now!

616
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,970
Put your backpack down.

617
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,920
Let's just keep it calm, okay?

618
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,920
Calm?

619
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,220
As soon as I let go
and these two sides connect,

620
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,680
this entire building

621
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,180
and everybody in it
goes down with me.

622
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,470
You're not gonna do that,
though, are you?

623
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,920
Everyone paying attention,
class? Hey, you! You!

624
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,090
Kevin, you're not
gonna do that.

625
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,800
Sit down!

626
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,800
Down, down.

627
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,090
Anyone else leaves,
everyone dies.

628
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,300
Just keep it calm, okay, buddy?

629
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,840
It's all right.

630
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,840
Kevin...

631
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,800
put the backpack down.

632
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,800
Get out of here.

633
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,180
You want to speed
this process up, hero?

634
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,800
Get out of here.

635
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,920
Okay, we're going.

636
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
We're going, okay?
It's all good.

637
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,090
Just keep them apart, okay?

638
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,340
Don't do anything stupid.

639
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
Just keep them apart.
We're going.

640
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340
Take it easy, Kevin.

641
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,470
Kevin, don't do anything stupid.

642
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,680
Hang tight.

643
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,380
Stay with me, Kevin.

644
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,380
Don't look at me.

645
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,800
Get down. Get your face

646
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,300
to the ground right now.

647
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,050
We've evacuated everyone
not in the classroom.

648
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,180
Street, did you check
those bathrooms?

649
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,180
Twice. All clear.

650
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
Evacuate yourselves
as soon as possible.

651
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,800
You hear me, Chris?

652
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,800
Copy.

653
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,920
Files on all 12 students

654
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,830
trapped in that room.

655
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,710
How far away

656
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,080
is the FBI negotiator?

657
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,460
Agent Conley said
15 minutes out, maybe 20.

658
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,580
Well, looks like we got
a new negotiator, then.

659
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,500
Classroom has an
auditorium-style layout.

660
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,210
It's 15 rows, three sections,
each 20 seats across.

661
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,380
Windows out?

662
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,380
Nope.

663
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,500
Internal windows?

664
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,500
They're on the door,

665
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,170
but it's the size of a
cereal box. Anything?

666
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,000
We need to deactivate
Professor Lasky's badge as...

667
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,290
No. Leave it.

668
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,880
Have them call you
if it pings anywhere on campus.

669
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,620
He says he won't

670
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,790
wear the bomb suit.

671
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,830
You can't go in
without the suit.

672
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,080
There's 12 kids in there

673
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,710
who don't have that option.

674
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,460
I'm gonna do better
talking with him man-to-man,

675
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,250
not looking
like the Pillsbury Doughboy.

676
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,250
Let's wait for
the FBI guy.

677
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm certified in negotiations.
You know that.

678
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,710
I've watched Buck talk guys away
from their explosives plenty.

679
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,790
You don't have to
do this, you know.

680
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,000
The only thing I know

681
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,880
is the perfect guy to disarm
this kid is sitting on his ass

682
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,460
in Northridge
because you fired him

683
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,540
without giving him a chance
to defend himself.

684
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,580
What has Buck
got to do with this?

685
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,580
He's who we need here today,

686
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,710
but we don't have him
because of you.

687
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,000
You could've just suspended him,
but no, you fired him

688
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,330
because you wanted to do
what's good for you,

689
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,880
not what's good for the city.

690
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,880
No, hold on.

691
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Otherwise, we wouldn't be
in this position right now.

692
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,920
You done?

693
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,290
You think I enjoyed

694
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,710
watching his career end
like that?

695
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,580
I begged him to fight it.

696
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,040
Buck insisted that I fire him.

697
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,880
He had shot an
unarmed black kid

698
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,580
who looked like he
was about to die.

699
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,500
Buck knew the city
was about to explode.

700
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,880
He didn't want to make it harder
on the rest of us.

701
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
It was Buck's call.

702
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,080
Not mine.

703
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,460
I know you don't respect me.

704
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,710
I never said that.

705
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,580
Never had to.

706
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,500
But if you ever say

707
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,330
that I don't care
about this city

708
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,330
or the officers who
work for me again,

709
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,880
you and I are gonna mix it up.

710
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,670
Lasky's access badge just pinged

711
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,960
at the faculty
parking structure.

712
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,170
You and Luca. Go.

713
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,380
Hondo, you be careful.

714
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,920
You might just get that
promotion after all, Deacon.

715
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,790
Yeah. Hope not.

716
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,380
Come on, let's go, let's go.

717
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,750
Move, move, move. Move,
move, move, move, move, move.

718
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,330
These are the
last of the kids.

719
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,330
Hostages' positions?

720
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,790
Behind their seats in
the first three rows.

721
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,790
And where's Kevin?

722
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,790
11 o'clock
when you first

723
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,620
enter the room. But he's pacing
around, muttering.

724
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Something's really off
with him, Hondo.

725
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Yeah, no kidding.

726
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,460
All right, both of you, get the
hell away from this building.

727
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,380
All right.

728
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,000
LAPD SWAT. Get out
of the building. Go.

729
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,880
Hey.

730
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,250
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Get out of here!

731
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,880
I-I will. I will. Once I know

732
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,040
everyone in here is safe.

733
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,830
I'm Hondo.

734
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,250
Cool to call you Kevin?

735
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,460
Yeah, that-that's
what everyone calls me.

736
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,620
What the hell do you want?

737
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,290
I want to know what you want.

738
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,880
Kevin, I need you
to listen to me.

739
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,670
You have a student in here.

740
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,420
Her name is Maria Quinn.
She's a diabetic.

741
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,880
She really needs to get
to her medicine, Kevin.

742
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,920
Jesus.

743
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,620
Okay, hey. Hey, how about this?

744
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,880
You let Maria go,

745
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,750
and I'll take her place,
and you and me, we can talk.

746
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,750
Oh, yeah.

747
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,040
Yeah,
that's what you want to do.

748
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,710
You ju...
y-you just want to talk.

749
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,250
Yeah, well,
I don't feel like listening.

750
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,080
I just want to make sure
we all stay safe, Kevin.

751
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,710
Oh, "we"?

752
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,710
That's right.

753
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,670
Look around.

754
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,710
We're all in this together.

755
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,290
Which one of you is Maria?

756
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,330
Me.

757
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,710
I-I'm Maria.

758
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,710
Kevin.

759
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,830
Look at her.

760
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,830
She's sick.

761
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,880
She needs her medicine.

762
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,920
Just let her go.

763
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,920
Oh, God.

764
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,290
Okay? Just her.

765
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,460
Okay.

766
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,880
Come on, Maria.
Come on.

767
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,250
Get outside. Go.

768
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,290
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

769
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,960
Where...
What the hell are you doing?

770
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm keeping my promise.

771
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
I said her for me.

772
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,370
As soon as I drop this thing,
we're all dead.

773
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,250
So go ahead and shoot me
if you want.

774
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,000
No.

775
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,420
No, I'm not gonna do that.

776
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,420
I'm not gonna shoot you, Kevin.

777
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,380
I'll put it away.

778
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,420
I want to help you
end this peacefully.

779
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Yeah, well, this doesn't

780
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,540
end peacefully, okay?

781
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,540
Why not?

782
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,580
I mean,
it has to be really important

783
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,210
that you're willing
to hurt all these people.

784
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,120
Kevin, these
are just kids.

785
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,790
You don't even know them.

786
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,170
Yeah, well,
would I rather take down

787
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,380
a room full of billionaires?
Sure.

788
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,540
But trust fund babies studying

789
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,210
to become those billionaires?

790
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,670
Well, that's
the next best thing.

791
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,290
These kids?
They're your problem?

792
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,880
They're not my problem.

793
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,920
Monopolized wealth
is my problem.

794
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,750
The one percent

795
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,420
is my problem.

796
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,540
Greed is my problem!

797
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,580
I mean, look at this.

798
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,330
I mean, just step outside.

799
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,120
The world is burning down

800
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,540
and nobody cares!

801
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,170
Oh, and these criminals
at the top, they think

802
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,380
they're gonna get away with it.

803
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,080
Why? Because they always
get away with it. Right?

804
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,380
Well, not this time.

805
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,380
'Cause we're gonna
wake people up.

806
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,710
We're gonna show them

807
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,960
that the whole system is rigged.

808
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,460
Okay, I get your goals. I do.

809
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,500
But violence
is the solution?

810
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,170
Explain that to me.

811
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,420
Uh, it commands
people's attention

812
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,000
when nothing else works.

813
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I mean, come on.

814
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,540
You're a cop.

815
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,380
Man, you must see injustice
every day.

816
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,960
The powerful
abusing the weak.

817
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,500
The rich riding the backs
of the poor.

818
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,210
Man, there's people born on
the wrong side of the tracks

819
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,580
and then they're blamed
for living there?!

820
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,670
You don't have to tell me
about being born

821
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,000
on the wrong side of the tracks,
Kevin,

822
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,380
because I still live there.

823
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,750
But most people
work hard

824
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,460
and they do
their best

825
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,960
to climb a notch, just so,
one day, God willing,

826
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,420
they can sit on a porch
somewhere and just enjoy it.

827
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,580
That's all these kids want.

828
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,750
And I got to believe
that's all you want.

829
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,250
Isn't it?

830
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,540
Yeah, Professor, man,
uh, where the hell are you,

831
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,920
you know? You-you
kind of left me here all alone.

832
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,250
Kevin,

833
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,500
we're in this together.

834
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,460
We're almost there.

835
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,290
Our negotiator's outside.

836
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,290
Too late.

837
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,540
Now, listen to me. Listen.

838
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,250
I am so, so proud
of what you're about to do.

839
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,750
No, don't listen to him, Kevin.

840
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,250
He's the one who's pissed
off at this college.

841
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,500
Ask him why he isn't standing
here instead of you.

842
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,810
Who is that?

843
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,760
He doesn't know you.

844
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,420
He doesn't know
what it's like to sacrifice

845
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,590
for something greater
than himself.

846
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,840
The price that we've paid.

847
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,470
Come on, Kevin,
he's playing you.

848
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,260
You're the one
who's paying that price.

849
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,380
Don't listen to him.

850
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,550
You can't trust him

851
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,840
the way you can trust me.

852
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,760
Kevin, look at these kids.

853
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,760
Where's Lauren?

854
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,340
Lauren Moss, where are you?

855
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm-I'm Lauren.

856
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,800
Lauren, you're not some
trust fund kid, are you?

857
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,470
Tell Kevin
why you enrolled here.

858
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,470
My mom's restaurant, it
gives her all the bad shifts.

859
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,680
And so I thought maybe I could
help her buy the place one day.

860
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,090
Kevin, we agreed.

861
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,840
We agreed to change the world
together.

862
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,090
Remember, Kevin?

863
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,090
Hey, Paul. Paul. Where's Paul?

864
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,090
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Could you just, please...

865
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,050
Okay.

866
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,840
Just-just back up, okay?

867
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,130
Kevin, I want you
to listen to Paul.

868
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,840
Your parents pay for college?

869
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,550
No, they, uh...
they didn't go to college.

870
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,840
They wanted

871
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,800
to help, but they can't.

872
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,880
Kevin, finish what we started.

873
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,680
Get people to rise up.

874
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,840
You can change the world.

875
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,470
Yeah, man, but, uh,

876
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,300
you know, there-there's
a bunch of students

877
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,680
in here.

878
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,680
Yes.

879
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,550
Studying to control the rest
of us with their money!

880
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,130
Now,

881
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,680
let go of the clamp, Kevin.

882
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,880
Be a hero.

883
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,260
Professor! I'm
gonna need you to put

884
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,090
that phone down.

885
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,090
Don't do it, Kevin. Don't...

886
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,510
Hey, shut up!

887
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,180
You shut up and back up!

888
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,760
Right now! All right?!

889
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,800
I am trying to think!
Can you let me think?

890
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,510
Do it. Do it

891
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,220
for a better world.

892
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,220
Come on down.

893
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,630
Come on down. You'll be brought
in nice and peacefully.

894
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,720
Your word means nothing to me.

895
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,510
I'm all talked out.

896
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,800
No, you don't get
the easy way out.

897
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,420
Hondo,

898
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,510
the threat's been neutralized.

899
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,880
Professor.

900
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,680
Professor?

901
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,760
He was never there, Kevin.

902
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,010
Not really.

903
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,420
I know
that's hard for you to hear.

904
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,220
No.

905
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,590
No, you don't know me at all,
man.

906
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,800
What are you doing?

907
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,880
I know no one in
that office building died today.

908
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,380
Because you called in
a bomb threat.

909
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,880
Kevin, you saved lives--
you didn't take 'em.

910
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,630
Yeah, 'cause,
you know, I just...

911
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,010
You know, I just...
I just want to matter.

912
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,510
I just want things
to get better.

913
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,880
I mean, that-that's why
we built this thing.

914
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,800
Adam, he found
the instructions online,

915
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,090
and I helped him because
I wanted to make things better.

916
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,840
I-Isn't it better

917
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,590
to die for something
than to ignore reality?

918
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,880
No. No, Kevin.

919
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,010
It's better
to live for something.

920
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,010
You got humanity in you.
I can see it.

921
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,220
And I know you see the humanity
in these kids.

922
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,510
Look at 'em.

923
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,760
Look at 'em.

924
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,260
Nobody has to die today.

925
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,380
That's not
who you are.

926
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,180
That's not who you are, Kevin.

927
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,130
Come on, now.

928
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,340
Just hand that
over to me.

929
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,680
Move that clamp over to me
nice and slow.

930
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,880
Okay?

931
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,090
Slow.

932
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm-I'm so sorry.

933
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,260
I'm-I'm sorry.

934
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,470
I'm so sorry. I'm...

935
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,470
Everybody out!

936
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,880
Get out. Move.
Go outside!

937
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,590
Let's go! Outside!

938
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,380
Send in the bomb techs.

939
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,760
Send 'em in!

940
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,760
All right!

941
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,760
Go! Go!

942
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,420
Good. Double punch left.

943
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,550
Good.

944
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,260
Yo, Hondo.
Want to get in

945
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,800
on a workout?

946
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,050
Nah, rain check, Luca.

947
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,050
Aw, come on.

948
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,630
Adrenaline's pumping!

949
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,630
Nah, nah, nah.
I'm beat.

950
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,630
Go easy on him, Chris.

951
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,050
No chance.

952
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,260
Let's go!

953
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,550
Double.

954
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,800
Hey, Street.

955
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,800
Hi, boss.

956
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
Actually, come here
for a second.

957
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,180
I want to talk to you.

958
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,180
What's up?

959
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,840
I been thinking a lot
about Buck,

960
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,550
what happened to him.

961
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,260
Yeah, you think we should take
him for a beer or something?

962
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,340
I can call him.

963
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,340
No. No, no, no.
I think it's better for us

964
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,630
and better for him if we just
give him some space for a while.

965
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,590
Okay.

966
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,220
Your call.

967
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,340
Street, uh...

968
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,050
don't you ever forget who
your locker once belonged to,

969
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,760
the reason
that you are SWAT

970
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,550
and whose legacy you carry.

971
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,380
I promise.

972
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,760
Night, boss.

973
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,010
Good night.

974
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,010
Night, guys.

975
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,130
Everything okay?

976
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,050
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

977
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,300
I was just coming by to check on
next week's schedule, but, um...

978
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,880
unless you got something
on your mind...

979
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,010
No. Just, um...

980
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,680

982
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,090
But sometimes it's tougher to...

983
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,880

985
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,340
Have a good night.

986
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,130
You, too.

987
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,640

1
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,220
Where are those breakfast bars?

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,170
Uh, the kind with sugar,
or the kind without sugar?

3
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,750
I thought neither
of them had sugar.

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,290
One kind has sugar, but it's
organic pure cane sugar, so...

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,460
Is that even better for you?

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,019
So... where are they?
Uh, which kind?

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,970
S.W.A.T.! S.W.A.T.! Get on the ground now!

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,600
Move! LAPD!

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640
- LAPD! Get down!
- This is a mistake! Promise.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,140
You have the wrong house!
On the ground!

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,810
This is a mistake!

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,810
Put your hands together.
Get down!

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,390
Get over here. On the ground.

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,980
Get down and shut up!

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,560
Go upstairs and get the stuff.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,890
Go!

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,060
Why-why are the police
stealing from us?

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,560
Because they're not the police.

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,140
You-- what's your name?

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,930
What's your name?!
Desiree. Desiree.

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,180
Desiree, give me the alarm code,

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,720
or we kill your dad.
It-it's six,

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,680
seven, one, eight.
Desiree, is that
the right code?

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,520
Yes. Is that the right code?!

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,430
Do I need to kill your dad
to show you I'm serious?
No, please.

26
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,402
Please, please don't.
It's the right code! It's the right code!

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,630
Thanks, Desiree.

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,260
You did the right thing.

29
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,090
You know what? You seem
like an interesting girl.

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,880
Let's you and I...
No. No.
No, no, no.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,260
...go have a talk, huh?
No, no, no, no, no, no!

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,010
Get off! No! Just
tell us what you want!

33
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,300
No! Don't take her!
Don't take her!
Please!

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,720
Just tell us what you want!

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,800
Help me! Help me!

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,340
Please!

37
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,340
Hey, it's probably
just another false alarm.

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,420
Uh, sorry to bother you.

39
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,260
We got a noise complaint about...

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,680
House belongs to Donovan
and Trisha Watson.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,310
One child-- 17-year-old girl.

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,100
Looks like a home invasion.

43
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,810
Unis got the house surrounded.
The bad guys might

44
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,310
still be inside, or they might
have taken off on foot

45
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,720
after shooting
the security guard.

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,850
Either way, we have to assume

47
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,930
they're all still inside.

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,180
Be ready for anything.

49
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,680
You awake, Street?

50
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,060
Shoot anything that moves.
Got it.

51
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,390
Be ready for anything.

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,430
Metro S.W.A.T.!

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,220
LAPD!

54
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,520
Metro S.W.A.T.!

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,020
Kitchen clear.

56
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,600
Go.

57
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,180
Dining room clear.

58
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,180
Luca clear. Chris out.

59
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,980
Tan out.

60
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,600
No!

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,810
Leave my family alone!

62
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,350
Street?

63
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,480
I got him.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,100
Police! Put down the weapon!

65
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,770
Put down the weapon now.
How do I know

66
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,720
- you're really the police?!
- Ma'am, we are the police.

67
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,350
We're Metro S.W.A.T..

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,350
Just put down the knife
and step away from the girl.

69
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,310
Mom, it's okay. It's not them.

70
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,240
Resync by 阮清才@VOZ48

71
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,520
They kept yelling
"police" and "S.W.A.T.."

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,100
Why wouldn't we believe them?

73
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,120
We're working with robbery-
homicide to track 'em down.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,290
Now, any details, no matter how
small, can help us find them.

75
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,540
Well, I don't know what to tell
you, except that they were...

76
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,920
They were dressed like you guys,
except their faces were covered.

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,330
Well, what about race?

78
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,170
Or height or accents?

79
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,330
Um, you know,
it was all a blur, really.

80
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,920
Maybe your daughter
got a better look?

81
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,960
No, she saw even less
than we did.

82
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,210
You said you were zip-tied?

83
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,540
Yes. You saw them.
They were right over there.

84
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,080
But then they cut you free?
Um...

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,170
Desiree set us free.

86
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,830
So they cut her loose?

87
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,460
She slipped out of them.
She's small.

88
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,000
She slipped out of them?
But they were cut.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,580
Then she must have cut them.

90
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,500
And why were her zip ties
in another room?

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,210
Okay, this was all
very terrifying.

92
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,830
How much longer
will the officers be here?

93
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
A few hours, ma'am.

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,580
Wait.

95
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,000
You're staying, right?

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,460
Uh...

97
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,420
Emts are getting packed
up if any of you want

98
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,880
to change your mind
about getting checked out.

99
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,420
No. We're fine.

100
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:52,520
Something happened in there.
They don't want us to know about it.

101
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,120
You thinking sexual assault?

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
I really hope not.
Sure feels that way.

103
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,380
In which case she needs

104
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,880
to be convinced to get
medical attention.

105
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,500
Get a counselor up here?

106
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,540
When that girl saw Chris,
she knew we were the good guys.

107
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,710
Hey, there's already
a connection there.

108
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,500
I'll talk to her.

109
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,540
High-end jewelry like that's
gonna be tough to unload.

110
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,580
You sound like you have an idea.

111
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,540
I got some buddies who buy
this kind of merchandise.

112
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,170
You're buddies
with jewelry fencers?

113
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,790
Not exactly fencers.

114
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,580
Let's just say they
work in the gray area.

115
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,830
All right, the less I know,
the better. Go.

116
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,380
Don't make me regret it.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,460
What if he had come at us with
a gun instead of a golf club?

118
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,000
I was thinking the same thing.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,170
The last thing we need is
citizens taking shots at us

120
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,670
because they think
we're the bad guys.

121
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,250
- Somebody's gonna get killed.
- We should check with

122
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,170
the S.W.A.T. uniform vendors.
There's only a couple in L.A.

123
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,710
How are the victims?

124
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,250
It's hard to say.
They're lying to us.

125
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,120
Like they don't want us
to catch whoever did this.

126
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,210
- Insurance scam?
- Donovan and Trisha Watson.

127
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,710
They both have
their own businesses.

128
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,080
Maybe one of them got caught up
with the wrong kind of people.

129
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,540
We'll look into their
financial situation.
Chief wants to be updated

130
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,580
on this one, so when you know
something, let me know

131
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,380
so I can tell him. I'll check

132
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,920
with robbery-homicide. They inside?
Mm-hmm.

133
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,710
Big boss getting
his hands dirty?

134
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,920
Look around, Deac.
It's Brentwood.

135
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,170
You two have that
protection detail today.

136
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,460
Yeah, I was hoping
we could, uh, stay on this.

137
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,580
You know,
maybe one of mumford's guys

138
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,580
could take it.
Yeah, I second that.

139
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
They've got
homeland security drills

140
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,750
through the end of the week.

141
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,710
I'm sorry, guys.
This comes from the top.

142
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,620
We'll make do.

143
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,620
Hey, Hondo.

144
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,830
Lady here runs
a private security firm

145
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,620
that patrols the neighborhood.

146
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,750
They notice anything
out of the ordinary recently?

147
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,620
Nothing big,
but she said there's a couple

148
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,250
in the neighborhood--
Jake and Tiffany kemp--

149
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,420
Asked her just last week
if she offers a premium service.

150
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,830
24/7 security
against home invasions.

151
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,830
You get the kemps' address?

152
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,830
I read an article.

153
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,750
Said these kinds
of things were on the rise,

154
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,460
so I looked into upgrading
our security. That's all.

155
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,920
Oh, just in time, huh?

156
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,670
They said they don't offer

157
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,420
the services I asked for,
but I found someone who did.

158
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,290
We noticed. Two armed men
outside of your house 24/7.

159
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,170
It's a little overkill,
don't you think?

160
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,500
Apparently not, given what you
say happened down the street.

161
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,290
You hire protection
for home invasions, and then,

162
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,210
a week later, you have a home
invasion in your neighborhood.

163
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,580
Something must have spooked you.

164
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,620
Suspicious people driving by,
a threat of some kind?

165
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,380
Like I said, I read an article.

166
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,920
An article.

167
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,080
Right, yeah.
I wish I could help,
but I'm late for work.

168
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,420
Did something happen
to your door back there?

169
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
We're doing some remodeling.
These people seem
to have a thing

170
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,960
for high-end jewelry.
Would you happen

171
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,540
to have something like
that in your home?

172
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,290
Nothing worth taking.
Hey, look, I-I...

173
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,750
I know you guys are just
doing your job,

174
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,250
and I don't want this
to come off as rude,

175
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,460
but all I did
was read an article and hire

176
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,330
security to help my family.
That's not a crime.

177
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,670
The same thing happened
here as at the other house.

178
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,250
Doesn't make sense.

179
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,670
Somebody kicks in the door
and ties up my family,

180
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,540
I'm begging the police
to look into it.

181
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,380
The kemps' daughter looked about
the same age as Desiree Watson.

182
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,790
They might know each other,
even if the parents don't.

183
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,380
Chris, I got something for you.

184
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,330
Okay. Yeah.

185
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,380
Got it.

186
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,790
They find them? Not yet.

187
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,290
Do you know the kemps?

188
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,880
They live a few streets over
on langham.

189
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,250
No.

190
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,540
They get robbed, too?

191
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,170
We're not sure yet.

192
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,580
They have a daughter.

193
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,290
Laura, your age.

194
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,420
Do you know her?

195
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
No.

196
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,880
What?

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,960
It's... nothing. It's just...

198
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,170
Um... this kind of thing
shouldn't happen to anyone.

199
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,210
No. It shouldn't.

200
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,670
Whoa! Way to go, way to go!

201
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,120
So, which one's our guy?

202
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
You don't know
who Bobby strock is?

203
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,580
You don't follow hockey?

204
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,250
No, I never got into it.
"Never got into it"?

205
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,210
How have we never had
this conversation?

206
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,460
Look, I know it's your thing,
but I don't want people

207
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,080
trying to force me to like
stuff I'm not interested in.

208
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,120
But you get why people
want to kill this guy, right?

209
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,420
Yeah, he injured one of
our players last month.

210
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,620
You might have mentioned it
once or twice.
Yeah.

211
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,210
Justin Montgomery.
Justin Montgomery--

212
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,080
He knocked him out for
the season, on a dirty hit.

213
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,580
It could cost us the playoffs.

214
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,920
Officers Kay and Luca?

215
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,790
Yes. Hey. Brian Mobley.

216
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,330
Bobby's agent. Good to meet you.

217
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,830
Thank you so much
for helping us out.

218
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,420
Well, v.I.P. Protection's

219
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,080
one of our main
responsibilities.
We saw

220
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,540
the letters he's receiving,
I mean, memes online

221
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,790
burning him in effigy.
Imagine that.

222
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,580
Oh, let me guess--
hometown fan?
No,

223
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,830
I'm just a fan of clean hockey.

224
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,710
Hey, maybe it was an accident.

225
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,170
Full-speed, blindside elbow
to the head? You watch it

226
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,420
in slow motion
and tell me that's an accident.

227
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,250
Well, it's a rough game--

228
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,250
Injuries happen sometimes.
Hey, Bobby.

229
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,500
LAPD S.W.A.T.-- awesome!

230
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,830
Luca.

231
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,330
Hey, guys. Deacon.

232
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,460
Sergeant.
What are you, 20-David?

233
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,380
Uh, 30-David, actually.

234
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,460
Dude, it's an honor.

235
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
You must have
some massive stories.

236
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,330
You seem to know
a thing or two about S.W.A.T..

237
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,540
Oh, yeah. If I'd
have known I'd get

238
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,420
to hang out with you
guys, I would've tried

239
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,710
making enemies a long time ago.

240
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,250
These are
serious threats, Bobby.

241
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,250
From a bunch of serious losers.

242
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,290
Can't wait to hear
some badass takedown stories.

243
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,330
My cell's on here.

244
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,420
Call me if you need me.

245
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,880
Off the record...

246
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,750
He's a little off.

247
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,330
Even for a hockey player.

248
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,670
I promise you, Ms. Webb,

249
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,880
we are leaving no
stone unturned.

250
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,290
That's why
I brought you here, Lacy.

251
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,250
S.W.A.T. is LAPD's
best and brightest,

252
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,380
and they're all over this.

253
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,670
And we always welcome a visit

254
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,330
from a member
of the city council.

255
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,460
Then, S.W.A.T. should be the ones
protecting the neighborhood.

256
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,380
LAPD already has Metro
crime suppression platoons

257
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,000
assigned to your area.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,250
If S.W.A.T. is the best,
I want S.W.A.T. officers

259
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,960
doing the patrols,

260
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,170
every day until we
find these people.

261
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,420
LAPD's already using

262
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
more resources
on today's home invasion

263
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,620
than on a double murder

264
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,210
last night in south L.A.

265
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,170
Having money doesn't
buy you special treatment

266
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,000
from the police--
Not from S.W.A.T..

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,170
Well, I'm sure that's
not what Lacy...
I'm not looking

268
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,460
for special treatment,
captain Cortez.

269
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,380
I'm looking
for the exact treatment

270
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,420
that you should be
providing everywhere.

271
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,080
It's not my fault if you're
providing substandard treatment

272
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,000
to south L.A.

273
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,620
But that doesn't mean we have to
accept it in our neighborhood.

274
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,380
Treat everybody better.

275
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,330
Well, we've made our request.

276
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,250
Now let's let Jessica
get back to work,

277
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,040
and I'll follow up later.

278
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,380
Thank you.

279
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,290
You sold the guy

280
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,920
four of these S.W.A.T. outfits?

281
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,790
Guy bought four complete sets--
Boots, helmets,

282
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,670
uh, the whole kit and caboodle.

283
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,670
Look a lot like
the real thing.
We pride ourselves

284
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,880
on the authenticity of our
police and military uniforms.

285
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,420
And of course,
you check customer I.D.S,

286
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,920
keep all the necessary records.

287
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,380
Well, I mean, things move fast.
If someone wants

288
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,040
to buy a police uniform,
they'd have

289
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,380
to show you a letter from
the department saying it's okay.

290
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,330
If they have a department
insignia on the uniforms, yeah,

291
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,790
but these don't say "LAPD,"
they just say "police."

292
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,960
Well, congratulations
on following

293
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,380
the absolute minimum
letter of the law, Felix.

294
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,460
We make every effort to ensure
our customers need the uniforms

295
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,000
for legitimate purposes.

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,420
The guy you sold these to

297
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,580
used them to terrorize
people in their homes.

298
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,380
I don't want to hear about
your "every effort."

299
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,040
Right now I want
to hear every detail

300
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,710
you remember about the
guy who bought 'em.

301
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,920
He said he was making
a web series.

302
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,960
I-it's L.A.
everyone's doing that.

303
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,330
Can you at least describe him?

304
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,420
Uh, he looked, uh...

305
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,380
Like the type of guy
who makes a web series.

306
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,830
One of my fences has some guys
in his store right now

307
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,460
trying to get
some high-end stuff appraised.

308
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,540
On the West Side? Mm-hmm.

309
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,040
Let's go.

310
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,120
Said he's gonna stall 'em.

311
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
How? Didn't say.

312
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,830
G-good luck.

313
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,880
You guys can't leave!

314
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,960
That's my guy,
the one with the shotgun.

315
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,540
Street, take care of your boy!

316
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,500
Will, will, will!

317
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,670
Put the gun down!

318
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,790
♪ ♪

319
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,750
Tan!

320
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,250
This is 20-David
in pursuit of suspect.

321
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,620
Westbound in east/west alley

322
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,580
off Santa Monica and kelton.

323
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,330
Three other suspects headed
east and north through same.

324
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,000
We need an airship.

325
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,040
Hey!

326
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,120
Gun!

327
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,620
Come on!

328
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,050
Go. Hands on.

329
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,670
Go. Go.

330
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,380
Looks like the stuff stolen
from the watsons this morning.

331
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,830
Airship's late responding.

332
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,250
Nobody's got eyes
on the other suspects.

333
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,830
Well, at least
we got one of them.

334
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,050
You gave it a good shot, though!

335
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,010
You're lucky it was them
that got you instead of me!

336
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,470
Guys think 'cause
I don't wear a suit that

337
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,340
I'm some kind of fence--
I'm just new kind of legit.

338
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,470
Hey, chill out. Bring it down.

339
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,380
This new kind of legit

340
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,010
involve functioning
security cameras?
Yeah, sure,

341
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,470
but I outsource, you know, so
the footage goes on the cloud.

342
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,420
I mean, I could get it
in an hour, probably.

343
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,010
You said these four
have been here before?
Last week.

344
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,260
I bought some nice pieces
off them, real nice.

345
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,970
Nothing on any theft reports--
I checked.

346
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,260
Because you're not a fence.
Exactly.

347
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,840
They said they'd be back
with more, too.

348
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,090
When?
Just before I pulled out the shot...

349
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,800
No, no, when did they say
they'd have more jewelry?

350
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,720
Tomorrow. They said they'd be
back tomorrow with more rocks.

351
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,380
Sounds like they have
another home invasion planned.

352
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,550
Think they'd be dumb enough
to do it again so soon?
They might be

353
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,720
desperate enough-- we just
scooped up their profits
from this morning.

354
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
That jewelry you bought off them
last week, I'm gonna need that.

355
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,510
All of it?

356
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,550
Can I get a receipt?

357
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,380
You know, um...

358
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,880
I've been doing this a while.

359
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,470
The cop thing.

360
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,970
And you start getting
pretty good at figuring out

361
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,550
when someone's not
telling you the whole story.

362
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,550
I'm not lying to you, I promise.

363
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,800
When I was 15...

364
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,010
...some guys grabbed me
while I was going

365
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,680
to the gas station
to get cheese puffs.

366
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,760
And I love cheese puffs.

367
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,590
They, uh...

368
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,050
They were the east valley pasas,

369
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,050
and they thought
I was this other girl

370
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,420
who was dating the head
of the sirois street mafia.

371
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,680
They had me tied up for hours...

372
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,840
...before they figured out
I wasn't her.

373
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,680
Hours...

374
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,130
Under their control.

375
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,840
And, uh...

376
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,010
I was... really scared
for a long time after that.

377
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,510
Scared to go to the store.

378
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,220
Scared about everything.

379
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,840
And I was really mad at myself
for not getting over it.

380
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,630
I just kept saying it.

381
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,880
I just kept saying it
in my head,

382
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,510
"just-just-just get
over it," and I...

383
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,420
How did you?

384
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,010
I didn't.

385
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,090
But that's when I figured out
I didn't have to get over it

386
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,420
if I could just look it in the
face and-and then control it,

387
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,470
instead of letting it
control me.

388

Desiree...

390
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,130
...did they hurt you?

391
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,970
Did they touch you?

392
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,720
Rape me?

393
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,380
No.

394
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,720
They didn't.

395
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,550

is that we're taking
you back to the hotel.

Plans change.
It's not like I'm a prisoner.

back, I'm safe anywhere, right?

Come on, guys. Grab one beer.

438
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,630
I know a kick-ass bar near here.
Call.

439
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,680
All right.

440
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,180
Be right back.

441
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,470
You heard him.
He wants a lawyer.

442
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,680
We know if he had any connection

443
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,880
to the victims?

444
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,260
Watson family's never heard
of any T.C. Fleming.

445
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,090
Leads on the three friends?

446
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,880
T.C.'s been busted
a couple times for possession.

447
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
No known associates.

448
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,760
We got security footage

449
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,970
on the other guys
coming any minute.

450
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,010
We're gonna run that
by the families.

451
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,840
"Families"? Plural?

452
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,920
Yeah. Didn't the kemps

453
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,300
ask you to leave 'em alone?

454
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,010
These punks are doing crimes
dressed as S.W.A.T..

455
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,970
Every second they're out there
is another second

456
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,630
the public second-guesses this uniform.

457
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,050
We go where the case takes us.
Well, of course.

458
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,050
I mean,
we want these guys found.

459
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,340
But, you know,
just handle with care.

460
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,720
Just like it says on the label.

461
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,050
I heard you pulled a copy

462
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,760
of the department's budget
earlier today.

463
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,920
Is that because of that woman
that councilwoman baliss

464
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
brought in?
I thought she
was gonna push

465
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,970
for special favors,
but she surprised me.

466
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,050
Yeah. Actually made me think.

467
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,050
Regarding what? Whether I'm part

468
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,090
of the problem or the solution.

469
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,090
We've gotten so used to the way
things are that we forget to ask

470
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,920
if they have to be that way.

471
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,220
She's right.

472
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,470
We should do better.
By everyone.

473
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,840
Well, everyone I see here
is busting their butts.

474
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,550
We've got a team in brentwood
and two officers protecting

475
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,550
a hockey player
while two murders

476
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,550
in south L.A. are
still unsolved.

477
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,970
You know, when I first started,

478
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,340
I was gonna change
the world, too, Jessica,

479
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,130
but these situations,

480
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,300
they're like political
hot potatoes.

481
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Just throw this woman a bone,

482
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,130
get this councilwoman
off our backs.

483
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,130
We caught one of them,

484
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,800
which means we're closing in.

485
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,090
We're gonna catch
the other three.

486
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,090
What then?

487
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,090
Then it's over.

488
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,970
You're still scared.

489
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,510
Why?

490
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,920
The guy you caught,

491
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,720
if he had anything on him
when you arrested him,

492
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,510
what happens to it?

493
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,050
You mean the jewelry?

494
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,340
No, I-i mean, like...

495
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,180
Like his phone.

496
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,970
What happens
to that kind of stuff?

497
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,550
Oh, anything that he had on him
at the time of his arrest

498
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,550
is in police custody now.
So, you don't give it

499
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,050
to anyone? Not
his lawyer? No one?

500
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,800
Desiree, what...
What's in his phone?

501
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,010
Whatever it is,

502
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,680
you're strong enough to face it.

503
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,680
After they tied up my parents,

504
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,420
two of them took me upstairs...

505
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,840
...and they started videoing me
on their phones.

506
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,300
They made me take off
my clothes.

507
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,630
And...

508
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,630
They told me
that they would kill my parents

509
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,300
if...

510
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,720
If I didn't talk on camera
about...

511
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,260
The dirtiest thing
I'd ever done.

512
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,090
Or the dirtiest thing
I'd ever thought about doing.

513
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,300
So I did.

514
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,010
And then they said that...

515
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,590
...if we did anything
to help the police,

516
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,510
that they would put it online,

517
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,050
so if anyone...

518
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,050
Googled my name,

519
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,760
like colleges or employers...

520
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,340
...it'll follow me forever.

521
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,260
Hey.

522
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,220
The "Jake and Tiffany
tenth anniversary" inscription

523
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,920
makes me think
this all might be yours.

524
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,300
You want to get real with me?

525
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,260
The other family that
got robbed, the robbers made

526
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,550
a video of their daughter.

527
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,800
I just want to protect my girl.

528
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,510
The best way for you to do that
is help us catch these guys

529
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,180
so they don't do anything
with that video.

530
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,130
Or do what they did to
your daughter to somebody else.

531
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,680
I'll help you.

532
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,590
I won't let it happen
to anyone else.

533
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,420
I didn't know his name,
but I've seen him at Hardline.

534
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Hardline? It's this little club

535
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,590
near UCLA.

536
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,840
They don't look very hard at your I.D.

537
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,970
Do you recognize
any of these guys?

538
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,380
Um...

539
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,380
Wait, that's...

540
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,470
Cash.

541
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,680
Cash is his name?

542
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,880
He deals Molly at Hardline.

543
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,050
Cash is bad news.

544
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,340
I try to stay away from him.

545
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,920
Sounds like Cash
and T.C. Were scoping out

546
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,630
rich girls at this club.

547
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,840
Which means the next target
could be somebody

548
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,550
that you partied with
at Hardline.

549
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,380
Is there anybody Cash and T.C.
Paid special attention to?

550
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,050
The only girl I know who's there
every weekend is April Bagley.

551
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,470
Is she a friend of yours?

552
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,550
We go to school together.

553
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,510
Cash definitely has
a thing for her.
April Bagley.

554
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,340
Does she live around here?
I think so.

555
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,220
I-I met her at a party.
I've never been to her house.
It's okay.

556
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,260
We'll find it. Before Cash does.

557
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,260
Thank you.

558
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,300
I know you've
been through a lot.

559
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,300
Whoa.

560
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,800
Is that Bobby Strock?

561
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,020
Seriously?

562
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,150
What is this, man?

563
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,570
Skate-around was tough today.

564
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,070
Made me thirsty.

565
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,320
This really isn't getting me
into hockey.

566
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,020
- You suck, Bobby!
- Get out of here!

567
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,190
Get out of here, Bobby!

568
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Whatever beer you have on tap,
barkeep.

569
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,980
Get lost!
We don't want you here!

570
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,070
Call yourself a player? You look
like a damn giraffe on skates.

571
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,020
And a couple ginger beers
for my friends.

572
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,900
Get out of here...

573
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,730
- You suck!
- Suck it, buddy!

574
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,280
Weak-sauce fans
for a weak-sauce team.

575
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,020
You got our city
on your uniform,

576
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,520
you're protecting this
jackass?! Pick a side!

577
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,230
Yeah, pick a side.

578
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,900
I might kill him myself.

579
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,110
Look, I know Cash and T.C.

580
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,480
Okay, they wouldn't hurt me.

581
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
They hurt your
friends pretty bad.

582
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,570
Yeah, but if they wanted
to Rob from me,

583
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,940
they could have at any time.

584
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,900
Wait, they've been
to your house before?

585
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,070
A few of my parties, yeah.

586
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,570
Where are your parents?

587
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,280
Oh, my mom, uh, is

588
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,690
in Ibiza this month
with her boyfriend.

589
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,690
And my dad lives in New York
with his boyfriend.

590
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,480
So you're here alone?

591
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,360
Yeah, but, listen, okay,

592
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,150
Cash isn't gonna come after me,

593
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,730
uh, and I'm hanging
with some girls tonight.

594
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,440
So maybe you guys want to stay
and watch the place

595
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
and I can go stay at a friend's?

596
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
You're gonna have to cancel
your plans, April.

597
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,901
Dirty! Dirty!

598
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,780
Time to go.

599
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,530
Come on.

600
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,620
I didn't even get
any S.W.A.T. stories yet.

601
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,280
It's not really a conducive, uh,
environment for storytelling.

602
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,780
Ha. Hey, these fans
could use a good story

603
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,780
after my team breaks
their hearts tomorrow night.

604
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,910
In your dreams!

605
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,280
Bunch of donkey

606
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
fair-weather fans.

607
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,990
Say that again, scumbag!

608
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,410
That's far enough.

609
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,780
I said stay back.

610
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Get off of him!

611
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,200
Patrick, you okay?!

612
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,410
Down, down. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

613
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,990
Got no right!

614
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,200
Get your hands off him!

615
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,950
Get off of him!

616
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,950
You guys ever been to Rhyner's
on sunset?

617
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,990
It has this salad with,
like, pears in it. So epic.

618
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,820
Not much of a foodie, I guess.

619
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
Mm. You're like Virgil,
my mom's last boyfriend.

620
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
He was from Texas. All he ate

621
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,990
was, like, steak.

622
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,410
Probably on his third
heart attack by now.

623
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,660
Back of the house

624
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,240
is locked down. Once
the other units get here,

625
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,910
we'll have eyes on
the whole perimeter.

626
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,320
Okay. Well, all this food talk
has me starving.

627
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
So do you guys

628
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
want anything from the kitchen?

629
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,410
Think we're good.

630
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
Don't need your purse to
get food out of the kitchen.

631
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Where you going?

632
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,910
Oh, I...

633
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,080
I thought
I left my phone charger in here.

634
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,820
I guess... I guess not.

635
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,200
85%. You want to
try another lie?

636
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,320
If I check this phone,

637
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,950
am I gonna find the videos
Cash made of Desiree and Laura?

638
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,530
What the hell did you do, April?

639
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,820
So, Cash sent me some videos.

640
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,910
I mean, it doesn't mean
that I knew about any of this

641
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,410
- Ahead of time.
- "Some videos"?

642
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,120
April, these were movies of
your friends being humiliated,

643
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,370
naked, at gunpoint.

644
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,700
If you weren't a part of it,
why didn't you call the police

645
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,200
when you saw them?
I thought it was

646
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,620
maybe a prank.

647
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,620
Laura's such an attention whore.
I didn't know.

648
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,490
You don't get
how these girls suffered?

649
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,120
How they suffered?

650
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,240
I mean, I don't remember
anybody crying for me

651
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
when a picture that my
best friend Desiree took

652
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,990
showed up on the slut board
in the guys' locker room.

653
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,080
Then she tries to tell me
it wasn't her fault.

654
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,280
Bitch, please.

655
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,320
And if Laura doesn't know
what she did...

656
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,120
Then she deserves everything

657
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
that Cash made her do
in that video, and more.

658
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,450
You planned these
home invasions, had Cash

659
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,160
make those videos,
over a grudge?

660
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,990
I didn't plan anything.
We're pretty sure
another one

661
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,740
is about to go down.
Now, if you tell us where,

662
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,450
maybe we can get you a deal.

663
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,780
Deal for what?

664
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,280
I didn't do anything.

665
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
Did you get ahold of my mom yet?

666
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,240
She's gonna take care of all this.

667
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,820
I had no clue she was
still mad about that.

668
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,490
It wasn't my fault--
Lots of kids had that picture.

669
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,530
None of this
is your fault, Desiree.

670
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,910
This girl is a total psycho.

671
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,870
It's like she's not
living on the same planet

672
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,450
as the rest of us.
Same planet,
different tax bracket.

673
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,490
Probably never had to deal with
the consequences of her actions.

674
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,870
All right, girls,
you heard April.

675
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,870
I'm gonna need your help again.

676
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,990
Who else might
be on her hit list?

677
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,910
Laura, what about that thing

678
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,910
she just said about you-- that
you'd know what you did wrong?

679
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,780
I don't know. I seriously
thought we were cool.

680
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,450
Are you the same Laura
that corby was flirting with?

681
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,780
That was months ago.
It seems like April has

682
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,370
a long memory.
Who's corby?
Corby Davidson,

683
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,120
April's ex.

684
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,780
He hit on me at a party once
when they were still dating.

685
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,950
Nothing happened, though.
But he broke up with her

686
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,780
the next day.
She still bitches about it.

687
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,700
Sounds like corby could be next.
And April saved him for last.

688
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,530
Who knows what she's got
planned for him. Do you have

689
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,660
corby's number? Yeah.

690
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,740
All right, Chris,
you take home, I got cell.

691
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,990
It's going
straight to voice mail.

692
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,780
Busy signal at the house.
Phone's off the hook.

693
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,900
I can't find it. You what?

694
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,980
I looked right where you said.

695
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,900
I'll do it. You watch 'em.

696
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,820
Oh, no.

697
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:41,830
What do we do?

698
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,120
You guys are gonna teach me
those takedown moves, right?

699
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,380
I could use those on the ice.
You do know that there's
nothing funny about this,

700
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,710
right?
they got what was
coming to them.

701
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,790
Yeah, unlike you.

702
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,080
Oh, come on.

703
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,750
You know, if I had your talent,

704
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,880
and got to do what you did
for a living,

705
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,250
I'd have a little bit more
respect for the game.

706
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,920
Instead of acting like a jerk.

707
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,460
What position you play? What?

708
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,500
You're a player, aren't you?

709
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,960
Yeah, I played defenseman.

710
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,120
Where'd you play?

711
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,620
In college.

712
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,670
You get drafted?

713
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,250
Nope. Wasn't good enough.

714
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,620
Bet you still skate, though.

715
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,750
Yeah, I can hold my own.

716
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,960
So you get it, then, right?

717
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,670
It's about the action, the juice.

718
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,500
You probably wish you were
on the ice with me.

719
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,830
Sometimes I wish
I was with you guys,

720
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,920
out on the street, kicking ass.

721
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,960
What you guys do isn't a game.

722
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
I knew you could take
anybody in this place.

723
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,500
I just wanted to see it.

724
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,670
Hey, guys from the home invasion
crew barricaded

725
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,250
in another house.
All hands on deck. Let's go.
Oh, I got shotgun!

726
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,580
No, no. No, you're not coming with us.
Oh, okay,

727
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,000
fine. I'll just wait here

728
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,210
and talk to my new friends.

729
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,710
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, hurry up.

730
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,380
You guys have an extra vest
or am I good without one?

731
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,040
You joking right now?

732
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,380
All right, you know what,
Luca, I think there's one

733
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,500
in the back, there.

734
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,000
Dude, come on!
Hey, two minutes in the box.

735
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,670
For what?
For being a pain in my ass all day.

736
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,540
I can watch the back door or something.
Like you said, Bobby,

737
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,710
this isn't a game.

738
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,640
Please let us go. If...

739
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,100
If you, if you let us go...
Shut up!

740
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,220
What do we do, surrender?
You want to go to jail?

741
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,100
Huh? I'm not going to jail.

742
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,560
We-we kill the dad
to show the cops we're serious.

743
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,480
Have them get us a car
so we get out of here.

744
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,890
- Please, no, no!
- I said

745
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,220
shut up!

746
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,770
What is that?

747
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,640
What is that?

748
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,430
Metro S.W.A.T.!

749
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Deacon, right side.

750
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,350
Right side clear.

751
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,640
Left side clear.

752
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Upstairs.

753
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,640
Deacon out!

754
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,720
Luca out!

755
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,350
Give me a two!

756
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,640
Get down! Get down, down, down! Down!
Down, down! Down!

757
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,270
Please, please.

758
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,980
We got one!

759
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,890
Yeah.

760
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,640
Yeah, that's right!
Your ass is going down.

761
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,390
S.W.A.T., fool!

762
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,680
Is that Bobby strock?

763
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,600
Yeah.

764
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,640
I hate that guy.

765
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,020
Survivor's gonna give up April.

766
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,060
Says she and Cash met at a club.

767
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,640
They started hooking up,
he wanted money.

768
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,480
She wanted revenge
against the girls

769
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,720
and her ex. So she told him

770
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,270
where the parents kept the jewelry,

771
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,070
and all she wanted was them on film.

772
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,980
Who turns teenage grudges
into home invasions

773
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,180
and humiliation videos?
Well, I can remember

774
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,060
more than one teenage grudge in
my hood that led to a drive-by.

775
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,140
Same mentality,

776
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,560
just... different weapon.

777
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,140
We found the videos, by the way.

778
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,930
They won't get out.

779
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,640
Good work.

780
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,430
Your mouth is saying
"good work," but...

781
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,770
Your eyes are saying
something else.

782
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,220
Want to talk about it?

783
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,220
We caught these guys
in less than a day,

784
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,180
but that double murder in
south L.A. is still unsolved.

785
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,310
And nobody there
has called to complain.

786
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,680
City councilperson
isn't barking down your door

787
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,430
demanding answers, huh?

788
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,640
So you're wondering how
do we improve a community

789
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,140
so used to being overlooked

790
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,220
that they don't get
outraged by it anymore.

791
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,810
Something like that.
And you're telling me

792
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,390
you haven't solved that yet?

793
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,310
I mean, come on,
you've had, what,

794
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,140
a whole eight hours? Seven hours

795
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,560
and 42 minutes.
You got a councilwoman

796
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,980
on your ass and I got suburban
dads coming after me

797
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,020
with a golf club.
That's one hell of a day.

798
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,270
But it's over.

799
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,020
The only S.W.A.T. out there is real S.W.A.T..

800
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,020
At least take a minute
to enjoy that victory.

801
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,350
We're gonna change things
for the better, Jessica.

802
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,350
Together.

803
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,310
And we're just getting started.

804
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,180
Just once around the block.

805
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,480
You can't drive the truck, man.

806
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,520
Do I have you guys
tomorrow, too?

807
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,100
One more day.

808
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,600
Yeah, well, tomorrow,

809
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,680
I think maybe I can
make it up to you.

810
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,180
It's not about the self-
defense aspect for me.

811
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,180
It's more like therapy, I guess.

812
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,180
I just get lost in it, and
I leave my pain in the bag.

813
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,480
All right, remember
what I told you--

814
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,600
Just feet solid on the ground.

815
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,980
Punch, don't push.

816
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,270
Okay, now picture those guys
and really hit it hard.

817
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,930
Come on. Jab...

818
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,560
The right. There you go.

819
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,060
It's fun. Harder.

820
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,520
Yes.

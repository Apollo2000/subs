Jules!

12
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:10,650
Jules!

13
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,919
Rick! Help!

14
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:14,487
Rick!

15
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:18,758
Rick!

16
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,793
Rick!

17
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:22,662
Rick!

18
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:24,998
Rick! Rick.

19
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:26,332
No, no.

20
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:29,302
No! Rick!

21
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:30,937
- No!
- Careful with her.

22
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,905
No, no, no!

23
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:39,846
Not the plan!

24
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:54,427
How is he the one and only witness?

25
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,829
Probably 'cause all anybody saw
was the ass of the person

26
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:58,598
in front of them when they
were running out the door.

27
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:00,099
My team cleared the scene.

28
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,258
Robbery-Homicide wants our help
until these shooters get got.

29
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,952
We put an APB out
on the plate he gave us,

30
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:05,426
in case he turns out to be reliable.

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,006
Okay, what do you know
about this guy so far?

32
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,374
Private bodyguard.

33
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,843
Says the rich chick
he's babysitting got snatched.

34
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,613
Rick Owens, 25. No outstandings.

35
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,281
Valid permit to conceal and carry.

36
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:16,883
Works for Granger Protection.

37
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,117
That's expensive muscle.

38
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:21,120
Well, you don't always get
what you pay for.

39
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,892
Her name's Juliette
Carlton, with a "C," 22.

40
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:28,027
Address: 115 DeMille Drive, Los Feliz.

41
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,962
I already gave all this
information to the sergeant,

42
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:33,566
sir, but he sees me more as
a, uh, suspect than a witness.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,355
Semper fi.

44
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,536
All the way.

45
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,204
- Who were you with?
- 1/1.

46
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:39,953
1st Battalion, 1st Marines.
When'd you get out?

47
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,874
- 2014.
- Iraq.

48
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,142
Oorah.

49
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:44,710
- You?
- 1/9.

50
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:46,450
'94 to '98. Somalia.

51
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:48,815
Camp Pendleton was home base
for both of us.

52
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,349
I still got friends down there.

53
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,820
Why does Juliette need a Marine?

54
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:56,189
Well, she's smart in every way
except street smart.

55
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:58,296
She got herself mixed up with
a bunch of lowlifes who thought

56
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:00,359
she was a walking, talking ATM.

57
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:02,003
Her parents hired us to back 'em off.

58
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:03,200
Okay, who's Steven Earl Webb?

59
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:04,479
Top of my list for this.

60
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,899
Open complaint from the girl,
two gun violations,

61
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,935
a pending case with intent to sell.

62
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,413
How's this clown even on the street?

63
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,159
Moves enough drugs
to pay the right lawyers.

64
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:13,739
- Boyfriend?
- She thought so.

65
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,341
It was all about the money for him.

66
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,579
Wasn't happy
when we shut off the cash flow.

67
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,245
On parole. Address of record is...

68
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,836
2017 Wilcox.

69
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:22,337
I make it a point to know
where to find him.

70
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:24,172
Okay, that's nearby. They
couldn't have moved her too far,

71
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:25,334
with the APB and all the blue

72
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:26,448
- on the streets.
- That's right.

73
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:27,823
I can give you positive I.D. on Webb.

74
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:28,948
- Let me come with.
- No.

75
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:30,645
- Please. I'm the one who lost her.
- Rick, you know

76
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,814
I can't do that.
Go get your arm patched up.

77
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,451
He's good to go.

78
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,421
Seems like we might need to make
a parole compliance search.

79
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,189
Quicker than a warrant, for sure.

80
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:43,158
Video cam at the back door
is just for show.

81
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:44,449
It's a swipe-only business, no cash.

82
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:46,261
These dudes weren't virgins.
They knew how.

83
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:47,929
All right, look, if we don't
find this girl based on the tip,

84
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:49,197
which could be bogus, we need to get

85
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,632
with the family in case a call comes in.

86
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,033
- I'll take the parents.
- Sending you the coordinates.

87
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:53,201
Maybe they know something useful.

88
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,470
You just want to keep
your kids safe, and you can't.

89
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:57,038
Not every second.

90
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:59,014
That's the dirty secret of parenthood.

91
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,584
This stuff really winds him up.

92
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,741
I hate that dog.

93
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,743
We could shoot it.

94
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:36,478
What's the matter with you?

95
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:51,660
Metro SWAT! Get down!

96
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:53,762
Hands behind your back!

97
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:56,698
Get down! Give me your hands!

98
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,700
Hands, now! Hands behind your back!

99
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,435
Okay, okay, okay! Hey!

100
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:01,993
Suspect running side three!

101
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:11,379
Get up.

102
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:14,916
How far did you really think
you were gonna get?

103
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:18,420
All clear. Girl's not here.
No sign that she ever was.

104
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:20,262
Tan, get him out of here.

105
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:24,926
Get up. Get up.

106
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,453
- Where's Juliette?
- She's why you broke down my doors?

107
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:29,064
Where you been the last
couple hours, Steven?

108
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:32,567
Right here. I ordered pizza.
You can track it.

109
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:33,860
My neighbor saw me.

110
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:35,704
H-He was outside with that dog
you're hearing.

111
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,038
He'll tell you I've been here all night.

112
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,607
Working hard on
a pharmaceutical empire? Huh?

113
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,710
So you're gonna violate me
because of her?

114
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:43,244
Whatever trouble Juliette's in,
she probably

115
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,480
went looking for it;
got nothing to do with me.

116
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,716
She was kidnapped from a club tonight.

117
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,818
Just a few blocks from you.

118
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:51,319
Well, I haven't seen her in a month.

119
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:55,390
Oh. Sounds like your ride's here.

120
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:56,825
- Get up. Get up!
- Get up.

121
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:01,296
All right, let's go.

122
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,300
Do you have kids, Sergeant?

123
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,835
I have three, all under six.

124
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:07,836
- Any girls?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,945
My middle one. She's five.

126
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,440
- Enjoy her while she'll let you.
- Juliette's our only child.

127
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:16,111
She likes to say that how
she grew up isn't who she is.

128
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,912
She's trying to make her own way.

129
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:19,481
In all the wrong ways.

130
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:20,949
- Have you had threats?
- No.

131
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,117
Any business enemies?

132
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:25,687
- We make a doll.
- You know Jammin' Julie?

133
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:27,322
Juliette's the real-life inspiration.

134
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:28,656
His kids are too young, Gina.

135
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:31,760
It's a very popular doll line
for preteen girls.

136
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:33,290
Bought us this house.

137
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:34,696
Money can create enemies.

138
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,764
Is there anybody like that in your life?

139
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,465
I don't know anyone who hates us.

140
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,268
That's all we've been talking
about since the police called.

141
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,719
Why us? Why her?

142
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:47,709
Hello?

143
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:49,044
- Mommy?
- I'm here.

144
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,663
We're both right here, baby.

145
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:53,615
I'm supposed to say they want
$5 million in 24 hours.

146
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,568
- Who?
- Who?

147
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,285
I don't know.
They're gonna make me call back

148
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,789
to tell you how to pay it.
I'm supposed to say "no police."

149
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:03,525
Daddy, I...

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

151
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,493
Thank you for your time.

152
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,915
Any chance it's a hoax?

153
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,917
The girl sounded legit
scared on the phone.

154
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,685
Could still be somebody in her life.

155
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,320
She seems to be a terrible
judge of character.

156
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:55,423
How reliable is the bodyguard?
Could he be in on this?

157
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:57,792
He sent you to the wrong place,
bought a little time.

158
00:07:57,826 --> 00:07:59,994
- He caught a bullet for her.
- Plans go wrong.

159
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,430
Mistakes happen. Or maybe they decided

160
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,032
to split the ransom four ways
rather than five.

161
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,035
No, this kid seems like
he has real feelings for her.

162
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,436
Robbery-Homicide is here.

163
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,025
Phil Granger, Granger Protection.

164
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:12,627
I provide security for the family.

165
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:13,895
Captain Cortez.

166
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:15,463
Sergeant Kay. Sergeant.

167
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:16,917
- Sergeant Harrelson.
- Hi, Sergeant.

168
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,885
Having protection usually
keeps you from needing it.

169
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,553
- She wasn't a soft target.
- There's a lot of rich kids

170
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,055
in I.A. without security to go after.

171
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,556
Richer kids, famous kids.

172
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,391
You know Juliette and her family.

173
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:26,580
What's your working theory?

174
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:29,162
No clue, or I would've used
strict protocol.

175
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:32,065
Look, the family is ready
and able to pay the ransom.

176
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,000
It doesn't guarantee her safe return.

177
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,468
I agree with you, Sergeant. I-I told them

178
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:37,236
Juliette's best chance
is if you find her first.

179
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:39,138
Have you had any problems
with your guy before?

180
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,307
Oh, zero. No-no, I hire
vets like Rick because

181
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:43,698
they already own the skills and
discipline for the work, so...

182
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:45,565
He's taking it personally.

183
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,100
Every one of my guys takes
the job personally.

184
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,435
Look, I'm gonna do my own investigation

185
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:49,569
into how this happened, all right?

186
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:51,822
So anything you need,
please, just let me know.

187
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:52,975
Will you excuse me? HONDO: Yeah.

188
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,608
Thank you.

189
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,351
<i>Her parents want her to stay in the box.</i>

190
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,293
You know? Play tennis at the club,

191
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:00,907
volunteer for charity,
marry some rich dude

192
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,408
who knows all the rules.

193
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:04,093
Juliette's not like that.

194
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,294
It sounds like you're buddies.

195
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,363
No, no. I know the job.

196
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:09,065
Hands off.

197
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,566
Rick, is there any chance
that Juliette was involved?

198
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,901
Some gripe with her parents?

199
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,536
Some trust fund money that
she was tired of waiting on?

200
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,137
You think she helped fake
her own kidnapping?

201
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,472
She wouldn't be the first.

202
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:17,940
No, I was there. I saw what happened,

203
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,575
how scared she was,
and I couldn't protect her.

204
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,377
- You did the maximum.
- I have been teaching her

205
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:23,212
what to do if something
like this ever happened.

206
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:25,580
Tradecraft, you know,
to try to stay alive.

207
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:27,750
I talked to one of my buddies
at Pendleton about you.

208
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,218
Sergeant Anders.

209
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,887
I thought you'd call.

210
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:32,588
He said you were the best Marine
in his unit.

211
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,590
That's really nice to hear. That's
not all he said, though, is it?

212
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,791
He mentioned there'd been an incident

213
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,826
that got you in trouble.

214
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,094
But he vouched for your loyalty

215
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,896
and your courage 100%.

216
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,398
Rick, you couldn't have
stopped this once it got going.

217
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,434
You're gonna find her, right?

218
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,169
Sergeant Luca's gonna stay
with you until we do.

219
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:49,322
Yeah, 'cause you got to keep eyes on me.

220
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,974
- That's procedure.
- How about protection?

221
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,576
You're the only witness we got right now,

222
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,177
and these guys were willing
to throw bullets at you.

223
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,666
Don't worry. I'm good company.

224
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,827
Here's what you're doing
Saturday, four weeks from now.

225
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,629
Do I have to train for it?

226
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,168
- Only if you can't dance.
- Save the date.

227
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:18,701
- I'm getting married.
- Again?

228
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:20,036
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,038
Rocker already gave me
the "three strikes" joke.

230
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,773
But practice makes perfect, right?

231
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:25,708
I-I didn't even know that
you were dating someone new.

232
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:27,810
What do you think,
I keep these arms home alone?

233
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,590
- We met a month ago.
- Where?

234
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:33,349
No, she's not an exotic dancer, okay?

235
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,051
I'm done with those.

236
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:37,453
Nikki's a physical therapist.

237
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,956
- Like a masseuse?
- She does massage,

238
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,859
but it's at a nice spa,
a medical spa, Beverly Hills.

239
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,394
Is that where you met her?

240
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:48,164
I-I thought this was the
grub room, not interrogation.

241
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:51,367
I'm sorry. Hey, congratulations.

242
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,069
I'm happy for you.

243
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:55,171
She was in front of me
at the dry cleaners.

244
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,840
You know, I saw her uniforms,
she saw mine.

245
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,809
We started talking.

246
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,911
Went for coffee,
which turned into happy hour,

247
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:03,579
which turned into dinner,

248
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:06,048
and I'm still at her place.
Isn't that wild?

249
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,351
- You moved in with her?
- Hey.

250
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:09,585
When it's right, it's right.

251
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,153
You know, a happy marriage starts

252
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:12,855
the first day you meet,
just like you and Annie.

253
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,224
Well, we did not rush into things.

254
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,361
Yeah, but you could have. Same results.

255
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,085
See, I really want this to work.

256
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,953
I'm even eating vegan for her.

257
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:26,524
So, any advice from the happy home front?

258
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:28,759
Yeah. Take your time.

259
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:31,362
Take your time before
jumping into anything.

260
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:34,793
Four weeks seems like...
plenty of time already.

261
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,967
I guess I'm just an incredible romantic.

262
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:38,702
But maybe that's bragging.

263
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:42,406
Rest of your team's invitations
are in their locker.

264
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:48,312
You want information,
you don't even offer

265
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:50,281
a sandwich or a latte?

266
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,715
That's just rude.

267
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,317
What would you like, Hopkins?

268
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:54,818
A week in Hawaii. Maybe two.

269
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:56,153
How is it you and I

270
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:57,588
came through the same station,

271
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:59,156
now you're SWAT, and I'm still sitting

272
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,591
in puddles of beer in Hollywood?

273
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,840
Least, I hope it's beer.

274
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,827
Stop complaining.
You were always hounding

275
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,429
Sergeant Yates for more undercover work.

276
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,298
Got your wish.

277
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:08,566
You were staked out here
when the club got shot up?

278
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,441
Trying to grab
a crew of car thieves, yeah.

279
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:11,729
Set out a honey trap,

280
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,237
unlocked, key in the ignition.

281
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,739
Waited and waited.

282
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:17,945
I know you miss our
stakeout nights together, Tan.

283
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,217
- No, I do not.
- Now I'm hurt.

284
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:23,514
- No action on your vehicle?
- Sometimes crooks get smart.

285
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:29,853
He's got something.

286
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:31,322
Hopkins spotted a car cruising around

287
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:33,857
last night before the shoot-out.
Matches the description.

288
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:35,876
Saw it parked at the 170 Motel
around the corner.

289
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:36,996
He figured tourists.

290
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:38,596
Out-of-towners can't tell the difference

291
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,030
between Hollywood-the-hood
and Hollywood-the-biz.

292
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:41,699
- Is it still there?
- One way to find out.

293
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,454
Let's go.

294
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,373
24-David. Show us Code 6,

295
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:51,609
1700 block Harvard Boulevard, Hollywood.

296
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:52,977
It's not the plate we want.

297
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,278
Doesn't match the car
in the database, either.

298
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:56,280
Front desk will have a copy of the I.D.

299
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:57,648
from check-in. We can run the name.

300
00:12:57,682 --> 00:12:58,983
Even if it's fake, the clerk will know

301
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:00,217
which room goes with that car.

302
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:03,426
All right.

303
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,028
I'll do a casual walk-by.

304
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:49,433
26-David to Command.

305
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:50,534
Shots fired.

306
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,536
Four suspects with the hostage.

307
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,441
24-David. We have four suspects
driving northbound

308
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:33,077
on Harvard Boulevard
in a silver Chrysler 300.

309
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:45,589
24-David. We've lost visual.

310
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,124
We need backup and an airship.

311
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,927
Command to 24-David.
Airships are not close enough.

312
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:52,129
I have units rolling Code 3
to your location.

313
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:54,331
Roger that.

314
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:01,698
Oh, my...

315
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:02,733
Come on, move, move!

316
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:03,834
Move, come through!

317
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:13,577
Oh, my parents are gonna kill me.

318
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:16,013
- I might save them the trouble.
- Yeah, don't do that.

319
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,648
<i>24-David to Command,</i>

320
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:19,016
<i>show us in a traffic collision.</i>

321
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,714
We're involved. Suspects gone.

322
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:25,736
You're sure Juliette wasn't hurt?

323
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,738
Look, these guys need to keep her alive.

324
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:29,106
All right? They want the money.

325
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,340
Well, she's only 22.

326
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,575
Shouldn't be her last birthday.

327
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:34,144
No, it shouldn't.

328
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,031
This is Rick.

329
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,499
Rick, it's me.

330
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:40,867
I got hold of a phone like you taught me.

331
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:42,135
I'm locked in the trunk.

332
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,470
Different car. They changed cars.

333
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,905
Keep her on the line. Come on, man.

334
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,373
All right, stay on the phone,
deep breaths, keep quiet.

335
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:47,808
We can use this to track the signal.

336
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,176
What kind of car are you
in and what color?

337
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,744
I-I don't know, I couldn't see.

338
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,014
All right, come on, now. I know it's
not a smartphone, but I need better

339
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:55,182
than five square miles, people.

340
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,583
Okay, shh-shh.

341
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,084
Don't let 'em hear you.

342
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,153
You see the glow-in-the-dark cable?

343
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,189
That's the emergency release...
you remember?

344
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:03,756
They cut the cables.

345
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,059
Do you recognize any of 'em?

346
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,494
No, no, they never
let me see their faces.

347
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:08,995
Okay, that's a good sign.

348
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,764
That means they're thinking
of your future.

349
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,566
Now feel around for anything
you can use as a weapon.

350
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,733
Okay? Try to pull up the carpet.

351
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:14,901
There should be a tool kit.

352
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,603
I can't find it.

353
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:17,838
Okay, that's all right, that's all right.

354
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,773
Keep trying.

355
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,708
I want you back with me.

356
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:24,110
I-I hear a helicopter.

357
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:26,146
One of yours?

358
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:30,517
This is 20-David to Air 17,
what's your location?

359
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,185
Air 17 to 20-David,

360
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,387
we are inbound to the pad
above beautiful Hollywood.

361
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:35,956
Air 17, hold your location.

362
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,390
Roger that.

363
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:38,592
We can use flyover noise.

364
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:39,960
To shrink the search zone.

365
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:41,361
The louder it gets, the closer she is.

366
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,596
She can help us right now.

367
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,764
This is 20-David to Air 17.

368
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,032
We have a kidnapping in progress,

369
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,034
unknown vehicle, hostage on board. Over.

370
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:49,903
Copy. Hold your altitude.

371
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:51,571
Orbit right, maintain that pattern.

372
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:52,873
Roger.

373
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,641
Jules, you still hear the helicopter?

374
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:55,909
Yes, yes.

375
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:58,111
Is it moving closer or farther away?

376
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,603
Farther.

377
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,049
20-David to Air 17,
I need you to come around.

378
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:04,951
Roger. Air 17 coming around.

379
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:06,653
Closer or farther now?

380
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:07,988
It's closer but not close.

381
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,657
Air 17, tighten your perimeter.

382
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:11,892
Copy.

383
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,261
That's closer.

384
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:15,428
- Luca.
- Right here, boss.

385
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:17,105
- We need proximity.
- Yeah.

386
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,498
Load the rest of the team.

387
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,267
I'll send GPS coordinates to the truck.

388
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:21,334
You got it, boss.

389
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,836
Hello?

390
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,071
20-David to Air 17,
I need you to sweep the area.

391
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:26,339
Copy.

392
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:28,275
Do you see anything
down on those streets?

393
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:29,743
Traffic. Nothing special.

394
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:30,944
Rick, can you hear me?

395
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:32,012
- Rick? Rick...
- Hey... h-hello?

396
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,748
Jules-Jules. Jules!

397
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:35,849
What just happened?

398
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:36,983
It could've lost juice.

399
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,418
Or hit a dead zone.

400
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,653
Maybe dish interference.

401
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,087
There's a lot of studios in the area.

402
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:42,689
Yeah, or we spooked them
with the helicopter.

403
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,024
Hey, hey, hey.

404
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:45,692
You taught her how to stay alive.

405
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,360
So far, it's working.

406
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:50,630
This is 20-David to Air 17,
we've lost contact.

407
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:51,831
Do you see any activity?

408
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,366
Negative.

409
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:55,702
We need to break off, we're low on fuel.

410
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:56,937
Roger that. Thank you.

411
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,472
Air 17 out.

412
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,841
Man, I never should have
let her go to that club.

413
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,843
But all she ever hears is "no."

414
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,645
She loves to dance.

415
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,880
Does she know how you feel about her?

416
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,485
Come on, man, it's pretty damn obvious.

417
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,155
Maybe to you. Not to her.

418
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,157
She's a client, there's boundaries.

419
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,992
And I know you've been
doing everything you can

420
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:20,727
- not to make any mistakes.
- Any <i>more</i> mistakes.

421
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,163
I already screwed up,
I let her get grabbed.

422
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,398
Now I'm sidelined with this thing?

423
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:27,033
Granger's not running a charity.

424
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:28,468
He knows we're grateful for the job,

425
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,903
but you either work or you're out.

426
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:32,872
The prints lifted from the motel room...

427
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:34,908
we got a hit on a set from an open case.

428
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,243
The defendant used to work
for Granger Protection.

429
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:38,912
Do you know Tom Russell?

430
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:41,181
Not personally, but I
sure know who he is.

431
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:42,382
Everybody at the company
knows about Russell.

432
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,984
Army vet.

433
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:46,186
He got fired after he tore
his ACL on the clock.

434
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,154
That was enough to make him famous?

435
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:51,758
No, he sued Granger for wrongful
termination, then lost.

436
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,551
I heard he started drinking heavy.

437
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,637
Wait, that's who grabbed Juliette?

438
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,639
Why?

439
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,766
Five million bucks and a chance
to humiliate his ex-boss.

440
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,854
Can the parents even pay the money?

441
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,706
They have insurance.

442
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:07,774
Kidnap insurance?

443
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,243
K&R, kidnap and ransom.

444
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,013
It's part of Granger's package
for his premium clients.

445
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,081
So, then, who pays the ransom?

446
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,183
It's self-funded, the company does.

447
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,419
That means Granger does.

448
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,955
What if this wasn't about Juliette?

449
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,957
What if Granger was the actual target?

450
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,292
Could put him right out of business.

451
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:27,761
Look, Tom was a good man.

452
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:28,962
He's been through hell.

453
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,697
I-I was very sorry he got hurt.

454
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,532
But it wasn't my fault.

455
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,867
You know, he-he had no case against me.

456
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,435
He lost every motion every time

457
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,103
because he was an independent contractor.

458
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:38,772
Like all my guys. Like Rick.

459
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:40,573
No unemployment benefits,
no workman's comp.

460
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:42,042
And no taxes withheld.

461
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:43,977
I-It's a good business model
for both sides.

462
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,478
- Unknown.
- Huh?

463
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:46,780
This is Rick.

464
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:47,947
It's her.

465
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,503
Mark! Gina!

466
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:50,984
Your parents are coming.
Are you all right?

467
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,733
Anybody hurt you?

468
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:53,867
Put her on speaker, Rick.

469
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:54,954
They found the other phone on me.

470
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:56,423
They know I was talking to you.

471
00:20:56,457 --> 00:20:58,391
Okay, okay, your parents are here.

472
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,593
I'm supposed to say you're all
responsible for what happens

473
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:02,429
- to me next.
- Okay, okay.

474
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:04,097
We're gonna do whatever they tell us.

475
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,299
- Mommy?
- I love you, baby. I love you so much.

476
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,069
Let's just figure out
how to get you back.

477
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,629
I'm supposed to say you disobeyed orders.

478
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:11,938
You called the police.

479
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:13,343
No, no, no, no.

480
00:21:13,377 --> 00:21:15,442
They shot up a nightclub.

481
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:17,310
Everybody called the police.

482
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,150
I'm supposed to say you now only have

483
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:25,919
four hours to...

484
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,687
buy my life.

485
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:30,523
Okay. Okay. Where?

486
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,092
I'm supposed to say I'll call
you back for the transfer,

487
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:33,960
but first you need
to get rid of all the police.

488
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:36,429
I'm supposed to say that's
nonnegotiable, so please,

489
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:39,933
please just listen to them.

490
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,835
Just do what they s...

491
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,170
Is there any reason she kept
repeating "I'm supposed to say"?

492
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:45,338
It's code I taught her.

493
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,040
It means they're listening
to both sides of the call,

494
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,322
so don't try to give her
private instructions.

495
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:51,010
Y-You heard what she said. You're fired.

496
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,612
Phil, make them leave.

497
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,180
No, no, Gina, you can't fire
SWAT. You don't want to.

498
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,882
They have technical
resources I don't have.

499
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,218
So far all you've done is put
our girl at more risk.

500
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:00,453
You're not required
to cooperate, Mrs. Carlton,

501
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,322
but we are your best way
of getting her back safe.

502
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,690
Unless you're wrong.

503
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,326
This is private property.

504
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,582
I want them out of the house.

505
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,764
We're leaving.

506
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,509
They're betting with lousy cards.

507
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:18,910
They have the right.

508
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,981
Hey.

509
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,584
You're not actually quitting, are you?

510
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,019
No.

511
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:29,554
Just gonna leave the premises.

512
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:32,257
Hey, uh, you're either with
them or you're with us,

513
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,059
but, uh, make your choice, huh, Rick?

514
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:35,462
Yes, sir.

515
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,625
Rick, he's not your only choice.

516
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,817
That's a longer discussion.

517
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,035
Which we should have when this is over.

518
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:49,274
It's Hondo.

519
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:51,443
The Army vet who sued Granger,
Tom Russell,

520
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,044
well, our friend in GND just came through

521
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,479
with his last known address in Echo Park,

522
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:56,081
not far from Juliette's last location

523
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:57,382
when the phone failed.

524
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,622
All right, she could be there.

525
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:00,618
We don't need a warrant.
There's immediate danger.

526
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,787
I'm sending coordinates
and aerial photos now.

527
00:23:02,822 --> 00:23:05,557
- First good news of the day.
- You know it.

528
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:08,226
Deacon, we got a hit on Russell.

529
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,228
Get with the team, get 'em up to speed

530
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:11,496
while I get eyes on his place.

531
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,931
Meet me there.

532
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:22,186
Rocker says the guy
is still paying alimony

533
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:24,412
to all three of his ex-wives.
How does that even happen?

534
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,438
I don't understand why Mumford
always needs to get married.

535
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:27,830
I mean, he should just live with them.

536
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:29,689
Things work until they don't.

537
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,882
That's my mantra. Travel light, Luca?

538
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,341
Hey, keeps it from getting messy.

539
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:34,533
You're still sleeping on my couch

540
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:35,891
five months after your last girlfriend

541
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,783
kicked you out. Trust me, it's messy.

542
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:39,942
You know, Mumford's a junkie for women.

543
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:41,493
Deac, you remember his ex?

544
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:42,927
Yeah, number three and number two.

545
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:45,130
- Guy's got a type.
- I can imagine.

546
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:46,931
Yeah, my gramps went
to his first wedding.

547
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:48,756
My dad went to his second and third.

548
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,579
I guess I'll have to keep
up the family tradition

549
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:52,027
and dance at his fourth.

550
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,333
Yeah, well, who says
this is where it ends?

551
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,273
Elizabeth Taylor got married eight times.

552
00:23:55,307 --> 00:23:57,008
We should do a background
check on this one.

553
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,128
Make sure he's not getting played again.

554
00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:00,712
- That's cold, Chris.
- Not a bad idea, though.

555
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:32,777
Position Two set.

556
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:38,082
Position One set.

557
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:39,417
On three.

558
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:41,619
One, two, three.

559
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:45,390
LAPD, SWAT! Hands behind your back!

560
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:46,758
Give me a two, give me a two!

561
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,679
Give me a two, give me a two.

562
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:52,230
My baby is in there. He's alone in there.

563
00:24:52,264 --> 00:24:54,432
Luca, go.

564
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:55,533
Left side clear!

565
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:57,235
Right side clear!

566
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:59,904
- Luca.
- Two, two!

567
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:01,539
- Two!
- It's clear.

568
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:02,674
Deacon out.

569
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:03,708
Straight out.

570
00:25:03,742 --> 00:25:05,743
- It's all clear.
- Luca out.

571
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,325
I got this.

572
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:13,551
Where's Tom?

573
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:15,019
He doesn't live here anymore.

574
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:16,020
There you go. Shh.

575
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:17,255
Shh, shh, shh.

576
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:19,224
Kids love me.

577
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,234
- Let her go, Chris.
- You okay?

578
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,563
What did Tom do now?

579
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:27,298
When was the last time you saw him?

580
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,900
In the delivery room.

581
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,902
He was more lit than I was,
and I'd had an epidural.

582
00:25:30,936 --> 00:25:33,438
I wasn't going to bring
the baby home to that.

583
00:25:33,472 --> 00:25:35,974
He started drinking again
after he got hurt.

584
00:25:36,008 --> 00:25:37,782
- Did he have a problem before?
- The Army got him sober.

585
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:39,741
Kept him sober.

586
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:42,080
All it took was one drink
to undo all his hard work.

587
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:43,465
He never went back on a program?

588
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,417
Sure. The VA, AA, church.

589
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:49,593
Nothing stuck, except
for his party buddies.

590
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:52,080
You're not gonna tell me
why you broke into my house?

591
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:53,849
We'll send a crew to fix the damage.

592
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:54,983
Tom's a suspect in a shooting

593
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,151
that occurred last night in Hollywood.

594
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:57,919
- The thing at the nightclub?
- That's right.

595
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:00,088
Any help you can give us?

596
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,425
Uh, I heard he's back
at the Sober Sanctuary.

597
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,160
Part of his probation.

598
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:06,561
What a joke.

599
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:09,343
Best place to find trouble
is at a halfway house.

600
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:19,241
Guess the halfway house

601
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,343
is all the way out of business.

602
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:23,578
We need to catch a break.

603
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:25,013
This would be a great place to hide

604
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,549
with a secure perimeter already in place.

605
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,656
What? Right there.

606
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,053
That little bit of light
on the edge of the window

607
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,256
on the second floor just came on.

608
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:36,998
Bootleg wiring?

609
00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:41,229
Someone's here who shouldn't be.

610
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:42,542
Gear up.

611
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:10,719
Goggles.

612
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,842
Lights.

613
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:18,159
- We good?
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:28,290
Come on.

615
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:29,704
Just have some more.

616
00:29:02,772 --> 00:29:04,105
Metro SWAT!

617
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,106
Turn around! Face down!

618
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,908
Turn around! Get on the ground!

619
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:08,877
- Go, go, go! Move, move, move!
- Give me a two, give me a two!

620
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:11,212
- Down on the ground! Runner!
- I'm Code 4, Chris!

621
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,648
Metro SWAT!

622
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,155
Chris, go right. I got left.

623
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,792
Clear!

624
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:26,824
Hey. Just stay down.

625
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:27,962
I got you.

626
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:31,299
- Where's Rick?
- He's good.

627
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,744
This is 20-David to Air 17.

628
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:45,680
Suspect heading up to the roof,
Side Three.

629
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,173
20-David to Air 17,
what do you see down here?

630
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:10,143
Air 17 to 20-David,
suspect is behind a roof vent

631
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:12,011
street side of your position,
near the parapet.

632
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:14,013
Be advised, suspect is armed.

633
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:16,249
You're right on him.

634
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:18,151
20-David to 24-David,

635
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,352
Chris, cover me by the door.

636
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:20,920
Do not come out.

637
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,223
24-David, holding in place.

638
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,827
20-David to Air 17,

639
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:30,263
give me some altitude.

640
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:31,698
Air 17, roger that.

641
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:40,640
Tom!

642
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,508
We can play hide-and-seek
up here for a while,

643
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:45,211
or we can save some time
and call it a night.

644
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:47,252
You're thinking if you can just get over

645
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:49,478
to that other stairwell hatch
you got a chance, but you don't.

646
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:51,213
Play it through, man.

647
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:53,499
SWAT's got every exit covered

648
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,417
and the block is locked down.

649
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:57,753
Your crew ain't coming for you, man.

650
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,689
I know your knee's got to be hurting,

651
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:01,890
keeping it bent like that.

652
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,526
It doesn't matter anymore.

653
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:06,829
30-David to 20-David,

654
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:09,164
three suspects secured, hostage is safe.

655
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,866
We're on our way up
the back stairs to meet you.

656
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,334
This is 20-David to 30-David.

657
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:13,936
I am trying to negotiate.

658
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,538
Stand down by the stairwell.
Wait for my signal.

659
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:19,074
30-David, roger that.

660
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:27,282
Tom, you didn't make it
out of Afghanistan

661
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,284
just to die on a roof in Hollywood.

662
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:36,043
I used to come up here a lot
when the place was still open.

663
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:38,360
Nobody around to bother me.

664
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:39,895
I wasn't gonna hurt the girl.

665
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:42,030
I'm not the one that shot the bodyguard.

666
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:44,533
There wasn't supposed to be
any collateral damage.

667
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:45,634
I believe you.

668
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:47,202
No, you don't.

669
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:48,437
Or the body count would've been higher.

670
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,138
I believe you, man.

671
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:53,308
You only wanted to hurt
Phil Granger, am I right?

672
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,613
All you see is the big smile
with the fake teeth,

673
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,414
as fake as the rest of him.

674
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,983
He is a slick salesman,
I'll give you that.

675
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:02,784
He tells you what he's gonna do for you,

676
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:06,722
why you should be thankful,
how he only hires vets,

677
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:08,257
no questions asked.

678
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,826
Like that makes him the hero, right?

679
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,928
Because companies don't want
to give a second chance

680
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:15,030
to somebody who actually needs it.

681
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:19,045
So now you're cheap.

682
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:22,343
And you're disposable.

683
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:24,840
You can't even complain

684
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:27,676
when he screws you over
'cause you signed a contract.

685
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:29,931
It's just business.

686
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,915
How many times have
I heard him say that in court?

687
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:34,983
And you just wanted to put him
out of business. I get it.

688
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:36,948
- He owed me.
- Okay.

689
00:32:36,982 --> 00:32:40,758
He owed you, Loulou, and Tommy Jr.

690
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,857
That's right.

691
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:45,363
I got Army buddies off the grid
in Costa Rica waiting for us.

692
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:49,598
There's a hotel by the beach
we were gonna buy, all cash.

693
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:51,083
And Loulou was down with that, huh?

694
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:54,536
Nah, man. She didn't know
anything about it yet.

695
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:56,541
I just wanted to take care of my family.

696
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:00,211
Tom, you were in Kandahar, weren't you?

697
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:04,448
Yes, sir. Fourth Infantry.

698
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,781
I was in Somalia.

699
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:08,094
First Battalion, Ninth Marines.

700
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:11,181
Civilians don't get it.

701
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:14,122
We make 'em nervous, man.

702
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,691
Sure, they thank you for your service,

703
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:17,826
but then they want to know
what you've done.

704
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,028
They want to know how many
people you've killed.

705
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:21,630
They don't understand us.

706
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,027
You died there, is what you did.

707
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:27,169
- Part of you, anyway.
- But you also learned

708
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:29,871
the value of life... tell me I'm wrong.

709
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:31,974
I know the technique
you're using. Just stop it.

710
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:34,009
Because every minute you breathe

711
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:37,245
is a minute a buddy would love
to have for himself.

712
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:41,350
Vets like us, we do not have
the right to throw that away.

713
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:44,005
We owe the dead.

714
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:46,788
Do you hear me, soldier?

715
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,525
Why do people always count to three?

716
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,494
No! Tom, don't do this. You have a son.

717
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:53,495
One.

718
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:55,703
You have a woman who cares about you.

719
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:58,533
Family is worth living for.
However, wherever!

720
00:33:58,568 --> 00:33:59,868
Two.

721
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:02,104
Tom, there is no shame in
staying alive and fighting, man.

722
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:03,420
Don't do this.

723
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:05,107
Three.

724
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:17,465
Now you know what a coward I am.

725
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,791
No.

726
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,836
I don't think you're a coward.

727
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:27,496
I think you love your family
too much to leave 'em like this.

728
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,801
The bravest thing for us is
to own what we've done.

729
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,333
All of it.

730
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:37,806
Come on, man.

731
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,875
Show me.

732
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,411
You show me what bravery
really looks like.

733
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:46,448
Show me, Tom.

734
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:08,070
Let me see your hands.
Show me your hands.

735
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:09,549
Down on the ground, face down.

736
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:20,947
What's your name?

737
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:25,027
Hondo.

738
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:30,138
This is 20-David to Air 17
and all D-Team units.

739
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:34,463
Code 4. Suspect is in custody.

740
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,850
Hey, Rick.

741
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:47,542
Thank you.

742
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:54,710
You saved me.

743
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:58,349
<i>- They</i> saved you.
- You got shot.

744
00:35:58,384 --> 00:36:00,322
You could have died for me.

745
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:02,357
I'm right here.

746
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,662
I look terrible.

747
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:10,265
You always say that,
and you're always wrong.

748
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,743
My parents... just got here.

749
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:23,311
Hey.

750
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,580
Oh, baby.

751
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:29,084
So, uh, they asked me to
apologize to both of you

752
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:30,085
on their behalf.

753
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,553
Phil, how hard would it be

754
00:36:31,587 --> 00:36:33,255
to just take care of your employees?

755
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:34,393
Oh, so you're blaming me now?

756
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:36,324
Workers' comp? Injury leave?

757
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,094
Okay, um, I'm gonna drive
my clients home now.

758
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:40,695
Thanks for doing your civic job.

759
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,764
Oh, and, you know, um,
you'll always be employees

760
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:45,400
if you can't understand economics, so...

761
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:49,273
I'm gonna need a shower
to wash the sleaze off.

762
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:55,076
You know Patty Hearst married
her bodyguard, right?

763
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:00,615
Happy ever after.

764
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,950
You gonna share that with Rick?

765
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:03,985
Think I might.

766
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,026
You know nobody's blind
around here, right?

767
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,028
Come on, man.

768
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:15,030
If she's your ride-or-die,
why don't you just go ahead

769
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:16,264
and make that happen?

770
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,200
Doesn't come around too often.

771
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:20,096
You got one of those?

772
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:23,738
You're looking at it.

773
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,907
Kill for, die for.

774
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:29,144
SWAT is exactly what I needed
when I left the Marines.

775
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:32,280
Yeah, I thought about becoming
a cop after I got out.

776
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:35,550
Like you, higher purpose, but...

777
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,986
My sergeant buddy said that you
didn't get charged for that incident.

778
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,922
Well, an MP arrest still
goes on your military record.

779
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:42,791
Sarge says that lieutenant
deserved a fist in his face.

780
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,492
Eh, a butter bar who thought
he was all that.

781
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:46,127
He had a girl up against
the wall, copping a feel

782
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:47,662
she sure as hell didn't want.

783
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:50,732
In uniform. Nothing happened to him.

784
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,968
Except your one-hitter quitter.

785
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:54,736
- Right.
- Right.

786
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,805
But assault on a superior
officer isn't exactly

787
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,341
the way into the police
academy, so... that's that.

788
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,675
Rick, there was a time in my life

789
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,344
when I needed a second chance.

790
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:03,845
Just running around,
looking for a righteous fight.

791
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,814
- Sounds familiar.
- Right.

792
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,315
Well, listen, if you think
you still want a life

793
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,584
in public service, I might
be able to help you out.

794
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:11,119
Yeah, how?

795
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:13,255
I can recommend you
personally to the Academy.

796
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:16,625
I've worked with you now,
and I've seen your dedication.

797
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:19,427
I know you'd be an asset to the force.

798
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:21,963
Semper fi.

799
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:23,965
All the way.

800
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,037
- The man's hopeless.
- More like helpless.

801
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:30,972
The graphics are nice.
She put in some work.

802
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:34,109
Did you hear Mumford's
getting married again?

803
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:37,145
Talk about a slow learner.
Has anybody met her?

804
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,480
He's barely met her.

805
00:38:38,514 --> 00:38:39,714
Says he's only known her a month.

806
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:41,883
Me and Street ran
a criminal background on her.

807
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,885
DMV, R&I, National Database...

808
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,520
Wait, you did what?

809
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:47,455
- It was Chris' idea.
- Snitch.

810
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,890
Find anything?

811
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,191
Nikki came back clean.

812
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:52,814
- Yeah, like not even an unpaid ticket.
- Heads up.

813
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:54,963
Background check.

814
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,032
Man, there's something
seriously wrong with all of you.

815
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,466
Just trying to look out for you.

816
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,502
Is happiness so hard
for you dopes to imagine?

817
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:01,903
Anybody can be a cynic.

818
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:03,838
That's the default mode.

819
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:05,540
He's the only one of all of you

820
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:07,309
who had the guts to get married
for the first time.

821
00:39:07,343 --> 00:39:09,077
That's one point of view.

822
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:13,048
Look, all I know is, I love
this woman, and she loves me.

823
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:16,251
And I hope that you'll come
and celebrate with us.

824
00:39:16,285 --> 00:39:18,965
Or... the hell with you.

825
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:22,390
And I'll have known her for
two months by then, Deacon.

826
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:23,658
Just to be clear.

827
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:24,693
Hey, look, Mumford.

828
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:26,761
Like you said, if it's right it's right.

829
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:29,097
But I just want you to
rethink your timetable.

830
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:31,533
- Why?
- Weddings are stressful.

831
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,145
No, divorces are stressful.

832
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:37,605
All right, you know what,
I expected some attitude,

833
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,175
so I asked her to pick me up from work.

834
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,376
She's here?

835
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,846
Any minute. Just meet her...

836
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,869
before you make up your minds. Okay.

837
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:01,841
So, this is, uh... awkward.

838
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,567
Got to admit, the suspense is killing me.

839
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:14,409
Is he punking us?

840
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,911
- Huh.
- Come on.

841
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:19,180
They'll love you. Don't worry about it.

842
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,651
Hey. I'd like you all to meet

843
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:26,154
Nikki almost-Mumford, my bride to be.

844
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,656
Jack's mentioned all of you.

845
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:29,891
Jessica, right?

846
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:31,059
How do you do?

847
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:32,727
- Chris?
- Nikki, nice to meet you.

848
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,796
- Street.
- Hi. Pleasure, ma'am.

849
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,632
Oh, now I feel old. Luca.

850
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,372
Oh, yeah. Roger that.
Pleased to meet you.

851
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:40,636
- Tan.
- Lots of happiness.

852
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:41,869
Oh, your mom trained you right.

853
00:40:41,903 --> 00:40:43,620
No congratulating the bride. Deacon.

854
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:44,740
Hi, Nikki.

855
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,141
And I recognize Hondo.

856
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,275
Truly my pleasure.

857
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:48,743
Jack told me that

858
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:51,513
marrying a SWAT officer is marrying SWAT.

859
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,615
So I'm happy to meet
all my future in-laws

860
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:55,150
before the wedding.

861
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:57,318
We got to go. We're gonna be late.

862
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:58,753
Where-where you headed?

863
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:01,256
The opera. My-my first time.

864
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,991
That's so crazy to me,

865
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:05,277
for a man with such a beautiful
singing voice himself.

866
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:07,095
- What?
- He's gonna love it.

867
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:09,764
A singing voice? You can sing?

868
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:11,366
- Yeah.
- Oh...

869
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,500
I didn't know that.

870
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:13,535
Well, you never asked.

871
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:15,562
He has an amazing tenor range.

872
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:17,205
One month.

873
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:19,474
One month, and Nikki knows more about me

874
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:21,587
than the rest of you heroes put together.

875
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:23,445
Deacon's been trying to get me

876
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:25,947
to rethink our timetable.

877
00:41:26,592 --> 00:41:29,684
You know what? I have.

878
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:34,522
Why the hell do we have
to wait a whole month, Nikki?

879
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:36,057
Vegas is five hours away.

880
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:38,226
We can leave right after the curtain,

881
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,772
and-and, look, we're dressed already.

882
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:43,231
I would love that, Jack.

883
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:46,701
We have a full tank of gas,
couple of credit cards.

884
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,837
All right, you don't need these.

885
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:51,639
All right? Gifts are still
being accepted.

886
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,643
See you Tuesday, suckers.

887
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:06,654
She's really great.

888
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:08,022
She's amazing.

889
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:11,426
Only took three divorces, but I
guess he finally figured it out.

890
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:15,864
Feel bad now... for running
the background check?

891
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:18,166
Yeah. I actually do.

892
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,567
I think we should have
warned her about him.

893
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:31,000

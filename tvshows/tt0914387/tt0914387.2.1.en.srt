1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,010
Previously on damages:

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,150
Uh, I'm ellen parsons.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,510
I'm here to interview.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,930
You're hired.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,210
A young lawyer with a fantastic
new job and a dreamy doctor fianc?

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,730
Arthur frobisher told his
employees to invest in the company,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,420
and then sold his own stock.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,070
It's classic
pump-and-dump.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,300
Let her depose me.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,520
We're going to trial, ray.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,030
There are 5,000 people
who lost everything.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,730
They deserve justice.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,340
I mopped your floors 34 years.

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,470
I cleaned your shit!

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,880
You watch what you say.

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,000
*******

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm done here.

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,310
********

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,920
You're blackmailing me, patty.

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,580
No one can ever know
what he was doing here.

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,120
You're a lawyer. Lies
come with the territory.

22
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,990
Make up your mind, ellen.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,710
Do you want to play mind games like these
people, or do you want to be yourself?

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,180
We crossed a line.

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,480
Do you regret what we did? Because I do.

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,950
You do?

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,650
While I'm gone, you're
welcome to stay here.

28
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,670
It's done.

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,330
I'm agent harrison. This is
agent werner. We're with the fbi.

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,630
What is this about?

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,940
It's about patricia hewes.

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,770
Mr. Nye tells us you might have reasons of
your own for wanting to take down ms. Hewes.

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,280
She tried to kill me.

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,530
Come back, ellen.

35
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,280
I'll come work for you
again on one condition.

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,650
Let me use the firm's resources to
prove that frobisher had david killed.

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,210
It's a deal.

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,970
You want me to go back and work for her?

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,610
Miss parsons...

40
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,090
you will be working for us.

41
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,410
See you on monday.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,640
What's the matter?

44
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,280
You shouldn't be scared.

45
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,600
Actually...

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,570
I take that back.

47
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,030
You should be scared.

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,970
You should be terrified.

49
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,580
It would just be so much
easier if you said the words.

50
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,150
I can never remember
the name of this song.

51
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,040
All I want you to do is tell the truth.

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,470
But I know that can be hard for you...

53
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,990
so...

54
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,630
I brought something that
i thought might help.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,250
And who knows?

56
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,800
Maybe the truth will set you free.

57
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,680
6 MONTHS EARLIER

58
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,050
And now, here's one of our good
friends, just off a big courtroom win.

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,330
- Please welcome back patty hewes.
- Yes!

60
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,770
Yes, look who's here!

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,010
- Patty, it's so good to see you.
- You're gorgeous.

62
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,780
- You're stunning. Good to see you.
- It is great to be here.

63
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,380
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

64
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,160
- You look good, patty.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,240
Oh, boy. So, be honest now.

66
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,860
- How much did you rake in on this latest case of yours?
- Oh, regis!

67
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,840
What? Really, what was it,
two-billion dollar settlement?

68
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,740
People want to know how
rich she is-- you know that.

69
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,610
Well, I'll tell you if you tell me.

70
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,440
Gelman, gelman, what do I make?

71
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,230
What do I make, the union scale?

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,660
Of course, that's all. That's all I got.

73
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,730
Oh, please. So, tell us
about this arthur frobisher.

74
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,480
Pretty wealthy guy, right?

75
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,600
Not anymore.

76
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,640
our plaintiffs were
very well taken care of.

77
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,680
So, what are you gonna
do with all that money?

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,660
Well, actually, I'm gonna use a good
portion of the money to fund a foundation

79
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,580
to fight hunger in new york city.

80
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,190
It's very important to
give back to the community.

81
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,990
Yeah, I think so, and I'm also partnering in
the charity with my good friend, sam arsenault.

82
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,380
Saving the world's great, but you've got to be
chomping at the bit to take your next case, huh?

83
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,830
Not at the moment.

84
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,410
It's my son's last year in high school, and
this charity is keeping my hands pretty full.

85
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,920
Wow, that's amazing.I mean, you know,
a high-profile attorney, of course,

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,070
but committed mother working full-time.

87
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,190
I don't know how you
manage to balance it all.

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,650
Well, I mean, you...
you do the same thing.

89
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,500
It is difficult, but I have
a fantastic team at the firm.

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,800
You know, I believe i chatted with one of
your associates backstage in the green room.

91
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,010
Ellen parsons, yeah. She's fantastic.

92
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,910
Isn't she standing in the wings?
You want to say hello, ellen?

93
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,870
- Ellen!
- There she is.

94
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,850
Ellen's been with, uh...

95
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,310
she's been with the
firm not even a year.

96
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,490
And I can tell you, I would be absolutely lost
without her, so she deserves a lot of credit.

97
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,160
The woman's full of shit.

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,250
A month ago, she tried to kill me, and
now she's acting like my best friend.

99
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,580
The bureau's putting together
a case we'll want patty to take.

100
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,270
We're gonna need you to pitch it to her.

101
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,230
Okay. What is it?

102
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,860
A setup.

103
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,590
We'll use you to monitor
it from the inside.

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,590
Great. When do we start?

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,860
Soon, ellen. We're just
working out a few details.

106
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,450
How soon?

107
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,930
You got to relax, okay? Lay low.

108
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,860
That's easy for you to say.

109
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,080
You just want to arrest patty hewes.

110
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,280
- And you don't?
- I want to destroy her.

Oh, no. No. Please.

115
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:46,190
Revenge fantasies are normal when
we're dealing with posttraumatic stress.

116
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,630
See, the right side of the
brain tries to process our trauma

117
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,910
to help us understand
what we've been through.

118
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,280
Ellen, how about you?

119
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,670
Have you had any more revenge fantasies about
the man that you think killed your fianc?

120
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,390
No!

121
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,660
Nothing comes to mind.

122
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,760
Ellen is in counseling
three or four times a week.

123
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,590
She's moving to the
sullivan grand hotel.

124
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,690
You don't need to
watch her anymore, pete.

125
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,880
Are you sure you can trust her?

126
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,950
Maybe it's best if I keep an eye on her.

127
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,500
No. That's all in the past.

128
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,040
Okay.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,890
Fine. Watch her.

130
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,190
I'm concerned about her well-being.

131
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,000
Tommy.

132
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,030
So, you gonna make me say it?

133
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,890
How about today? You
ready to jump back in?

134
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,690
The firm is trying plenty of cases.

135
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,790
But you aren'T.

136
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,960
I hear what you're saying.

137
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,070
Good. All right, I'll bring you
the top three cases, and you just...

138
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,700
you pick the one you like.

139
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,080
Excuse me.

140
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,060
We're hearing rumors their findings
could come out as soon as next month.

141
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,850
The kentucky operations
have been calling in nonstop.

142
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,180
They're getting nervous about new york.

143
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Tell them to relax. We're prepared.

144
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,140
Assure them that there's
nothing to worry about.

145
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,440
Mr. Purcell? Mr. Purcell.

146
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,970
This isn't my work.

147
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,570
Mr. Purcell, calm down.

148
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,820
This is... horseshit.

149
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,890
I'm not gonna sign off on this.

150
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,830
We're in a meeting here.

151
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,990
A very important meeting?

152
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,210
This ends today. You hear me?

153
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,670
Where are we with the irs?

154
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,350
They expedited our charitable tax-exempt status
based on sam arsenault's verbal commitment,

155
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,060
so as soon as he makes it
official, we're off to the races.

156
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,290
With any luck, we can
start doing some good.

157
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,900
That's the general idea.

158
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,800
- What, ellen?
- Nothing.

159
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,720
I think the foundation's great.

160
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,430
It will leave an
imprint for generations.

161
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,540
No.

162
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,290
You think I'm just creating
this to clear my conscience.

163
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,470
Why would you need to
clear your conscience?

164
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,160
Because of what we did
to win the frobisher case.

165
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,600
You mean, ray fiske's suicide?

166
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,470
My conscience is clear about that.

167
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,060
So how are you doing?

168
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,490
- Counseling...
- No, I'D... rather not talk about it.

169
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,270
Well, I just want you to know you
can have time off if you ever need it.

170
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,260
Work's the best thing for me right now.

171
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,400
Where are you on frobisher?

172
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,290
Is there anything new on david's murder?

173
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,410
Has my investigator been helpful?

174
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,310
He found out frobisher was in
critical condition after the shooting.

175
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,400
A construction crew found him and
had him airlifted to st. Anthony'S.

176
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,900
He had abdominal surgery there.

177
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,580
- Last week, he was transferred.
- Where?

178
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,120
Your guy doesn't know. There's
been a total press blackout.

179
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,950
Frobisher doesn't want
anyone to find him.

180
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,750
Mr. Frobisher? How you feeling?

181
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,570
Like shit.

182
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,990
Yeah, well, four surgeries in
a month will do that to you.

183
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,980
How am I doing?

184
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,960
The doc says the kidney should take.

185
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,190
I'm parched.

186
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,390
Thank you for taking
care of me like this.

187
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,840
Just doing my job.

188
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,730
You don't know who I am, do you?

189
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,620
Of course I do. Why do you ask?

190
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,970
'Cause I'm the most
hated man in america.

191
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,480
And you're being nice to me.

192
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,220
I want you on the board of directors.

193
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,750
Of course you can say "no."

194
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,640
But these things have a way of
coming to bite you on the ass.

195
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,400
We have a big problem.

196
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,810
Think about it, senator.
You've got 24 hours.

197
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,550
What is it?

198
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,350
Sam arsenault's people just
called. He's backing out.

199
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,030
They didn't want to tell me over
the phone, but I forced their hand.

200
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,670
He's withdrawing his entire
contribution from the foundation.

201
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,270
Hey, what can i get you? Coffee? Latte?

202
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,830
- Too early for bourbon?
- Never.

203
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,700
Ah, girls today could learn
something from you, patty.

204
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,650
You know how to wear a skirt, but
you're one of the boys, always have been.

205
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,950
Ah, except for the vagina.

206
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,360
I was just about to have one myself.

207
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,870
Explain it to me, sam.

208
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,120
The republican party is
going to back me for governor.

209
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,420
But you're an independent.

210
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,920
Not anymore.

211
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,480
So I got party politics to worry about.

212
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,940
The elephants don't like you, patty.

213
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,790
I can't be pissing these
people off right now.

214
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,570
I need your pledge, sam.

215
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,960
Why are you doing this?

216
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,460
Let me tell you a story.

217
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,480
Back in '83, I was
negotiating the syntec merger.

218
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,960
Neither side would budge.

219
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,630
The clock was running down.

220
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,580
Okay.

221
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,100
So I toss all the
lawyers out of my office.

222
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:08,580
I tell herb weiss to stop
over, hash it out mano a mano.

223
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,010
The whole time herb
was in there with me,

224
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,250
I've got this sizzling slice of ass from the
temp services under the desk taking dictation,

225
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,960
if you get my drift.

226
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,360
Yeah, it just wafted my way.

227
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,390
Hey, relax. I married her.

228
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,620
Jeanine?

229
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,620
No. No, it was the one before that.

230
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,530
Anyway, in the '80s, we
all did shit like that.

231
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,650
The point is, why did I do it?

232
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,290
Because I'm an asshole?
Because I want to feel powerful?

233
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,990
All of the above?

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,940
Nah, I don't give a shit about power.

235
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm just an old, free love hippie who
made a good bet on soybean options.

236
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,240
I did it because...

237
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,580
I wanted to see if I'd get away with it.

238
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,580
Sam, you're making a big mistake.

239
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,830
We could leave a real
mark with this foundation.

240
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,370
Your daughter's here, mr. Arsenault.

241
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,230
Great! Send her in.

242
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,870
Sorry, patty. We're grabbing lunch.

243
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,120
There's plenty of time for charity.

244
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,670
We can save the world another day.

245
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,590
Ms.Hewes. I'm sorry to interrupt.

246
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,250
Oh, it's nice to see you, lily.

247
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,480
I just ran into michael at this,
uh, college admissions thing.

248
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,480
Lily's earned herself a spot at yale.

249
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,180
Well, that's quite an accomplishment.

250
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,070
Yeah, I can't wait.

251
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,940
You want to join us for a quick bite?

252
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,570
Oh, I'd love to. No, thanks.

253
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,300
Hey, I'm sorry, patty.

254
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,870
But, uh, I always wanted to
run off and join the circus.

255
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,130
Well, be careful out there, sam.

256
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,120
There are a lot of
clowns under the big top.

257
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,940
Good luck at yale.

258
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,770
This was hand-delivered.

259
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,740
No return address. Security
x-rayed it. It's clean.

260
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,040
You open it.

261
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,500
What is it?

262
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,010
Charts, graphs... I have no idea.

263
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,400
Let me see.

264
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,120
Ms.Hewes, I have a daniel
purcell on the phone for you.

265
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,510
Danny purcell?

266
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,950
When's the last time you talked to him?

267
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,480
Ten years at least.

268
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,090
All right, put him through.

269
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,950
Daniel?

270
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,390
Did the package arrive?

271
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,680
Yes. What is it?

272
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,920
Just keep it.

273
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,580
Why did you send this to me?

274
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,700
You're the only one I can trust.

275
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,640
Please.

276
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,320
Keep it safe.

277
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,400
Daniel, I...

278
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,680
So you want me to get
patty to take this case?

279
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,230
Yeah. It's all in here.

280
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,110
Researched and vetted, everything you need
to present a legitimate infant mortality case.

281
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,750
Sounds right up patty's alley.

282
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,820
Built in social cause,
persuasive lead plaintiff...

283
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,910
billions in damages at
the end of the rainbow.

284
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,880
It's great bait, but how are you
going to use this to arrest patty?

285
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,510
One step at a time, ellen.

286
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,980
First you get her to bite, then
we'll fill you in on the rest.

287
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,040
Any questions?

288
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,380
Bad car tires made in china, deep pockets
is a major distributor out of jersey.

289
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,500
And it's wide: Over 14 million
units and 260 traffic deaths so far.

290
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,700
Could be bigger than bridgestone.

291
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,310
In this climate? Public hears
china, they scream bloody murder.

292
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,320
We think the complaint can survive
a twombly motion. All we have to...

293
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,740
I-I-I... I'm sorry,
patty. What's going on?

294
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,410
Are we wasting our time?

295
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,460
No. No, no, go on. I'm listening.

296
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,720
Okay.

297
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,820
We'll aim, aim a little higher.

298
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,960
Ellen brought this in, and i
think she found a grand slam:

299
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,770
Infant mortality.

300
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,830
The first time in decades it's going up.

301
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,450
- Why?
- Hmos.

302
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,370
Caesarean births cost them a fortune.

303
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,560
Insurance companies don't
want to pay, so at-risk,

304
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,550
low-income women are being
forced into natural birth,

305
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,790
and their babies are dying.

306
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,310
There are billions of
dollars worth of damages here.

307
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,060
Interesting.

308
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,140
We can take on the insurance industry.

309
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,870
We already have a lead
plaintiff lined up.

310
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,510
She'd make an ideal front
person for a class action.

311
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,640
Her name's monique bryant. She's
sympathetic. She has a story to tell.

312
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,760
It's all in the file.

313
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,020
All right. I'll look at it.

314
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,690
I truly, truly believe
that this is the one.

315
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,640
There are people in need here.
There are people we could help.

316
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,700
Let me know what you think.

317
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,660
You're not even going to
read it? Patty, come on.

318
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,690
I have a foundation to
launch and I have no funding.

319
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,200
We have our work cut out for us.

320
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,390
Do you have a meeting tonight?

321
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,200
I can cancel.

322
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,920
No-no-no-no, that's
more important.

323
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,960
- What's that?
- This? It's personal.

324
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,290
And the last time I
checked, we are in my office.

325
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,000
So I find the guy...

326
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,080
just laying there. Still drunk.

327
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,300
So I take a few steps back, like
I'm going to kick a field goal,

328
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,030
and I kick his head right
here. Right under his chin.

329
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,320
Well, his neck snaps back.

330
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,430
The back of his head smacks
between his shoulder blades.

331
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,090
And so I kick him again. Again.

332
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,980
Over and over.

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,610
And I'm wondering, "how many kicks is it
going to take before his head rips off?"

334
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,210
but...

335
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,970
I never found out 'cause I woke up.

336
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,890
That's very powerful, wes.

337
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,170
Ellen, how about you?

338
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,980
Have you had any dreams this week?

339
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,860
I can't sleep.

340
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,670
Her fianc? was murdered a month
ago. How's she supposed to sleep?

341
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,380
It's done.

342
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,290
Mom?

343
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,970
You fell asleep.

344
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,770
oh, boy...

345
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,430
what time is it?

346
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,940
Almost 1:00. Dad called.

347
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,830
He has to stay another week in dubai.

348
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,220
You going to go up to bed?

349
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,350
Yeah.

350
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,060
Everything all right?

351
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,030
Yeah... I'm fine, michael.

352
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,930
Dad?

353
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,830
Dad, I think someone's here.

354
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,320
Hey, baby.

355
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,400
I think someone's here.

356
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,020
Where?

357
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,080
Downstairs. I heard
him in the living room.

358
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,180
What's going on?

359
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,870
- Daniel!
- Call the police.

360
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,910
- Daniel...
- Do it!

361
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,890
you stay the hell away from my family!

362
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,890
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

363
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,280
Daniel, he was in your office!

364
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,300
What were they looking for?

365
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,170
You hear about lily?

366
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,130
My god, sam, I am so sorry.

367
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,430
Cops don't have anything else to do?

368
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,410
They only went after her
because she's my daughter.

369
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,420
You're right.

370
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,850
The one time she tries cocaine, she gets
arrested and splashed all over the front pages.

371
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,900
You got to help me, patty.
Uh, she's just a kid.

372
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,170
This kind of thing
could sink her for life.

373
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,680
What can I do?

374
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,530
Call the da. Get him
to drop the charges.

375
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,150
Why don't you call him?

376
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,940
Ah, he hates me.

377
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,370
I refused to testify in
that insider-trading thing.

378
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,620
look, I know that he's
your friend, patty.

379
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,750
He'll listen to you.

380
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,190
look, we both know that you
got me by the short and curlies.

381
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,240
But it's impossible for me to
join your foundation right now,

382
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,120
so if that's what it's going to take...

383
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,220
God, no, sam. I would never
hold you hostage like that.

384
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,630
Our kids have known each
other since kindergarten.

385
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,390
Oh, I'll make the
call, see what I can do.

386
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,580
Thank you, patty. Thank you.

387
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,260
No need to thank me,
sam. This is family.

388
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,620
Sorry to interrupt.

389
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,770
Frobisher is at the riveredge clinic.

390
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,240
- What room?
- No... that won't help.

391
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,050
He's under tight security.
Only his family's allowed in.

392
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,710
Listen, ellen...

393
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,840
if I were you, I'd want to
look him in the eye myself.

394
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,140
But give it time.

395
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,460
You'll get your shot to prosecute him.

396
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,790
Thanks, pete.

397
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,280
So, did they ever arrest
the guy who shot you?

398
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,920
No, no. I left the police out of it.

399
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,980
It's complicated. I knew the guy.

400
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,220
Anyway, I tell you, that bullet
was like a wakeup call for me, rudy.

401
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,420
It was a correction.

402
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,480
Silver lining, huh?
Lemons into lemonade?

403
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,010
No, I'm serious. Man, that...

404
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,560
- most people out there thought I was a real asshole.
- Yeah?

405
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,180
My wife wouldn't have
anything to do with me.

406
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,770
She filed for divorce.

407
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,570
Took our daughter.

408
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,090
Sent... sent my kid out west someplace.

409
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,270
- Night nurse said she called.
- When?

410
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,410
This morning.

411
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,220
it says she wants to visit.

412
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,540
Fantastic.

413
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,160
Now I got a chance to
put things right with her.

414
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,170
You know, maybe we could start over.

415
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,310
What?

416
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,710
I don't want her to see me like this!

417
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,790
I'm a goddamn cripple!

418
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,520
For christ's sake, I'm pissing myself!

419
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,010
I can't even eat solid food...

420
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,310
Relax. Hey, come on.

421
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,010
You got to calm down, man.

422
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,580
Calm down.

423
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,470
I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.

424
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,700
maybe, I tell you what. Let's
not shave. Let's not shave.

425
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,910
And you know those tubes?

426
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,730
Like, I know, I know I
don't need them anymore,

427
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,160
but maybe when she comes, we
could stick a couple up my nose.

428
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,160
Yeah, let's not shave.

429
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,760
The alarm people called.

430
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,980
They're going to activate
the new system tomorrow.

431
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,450
That's good.

432
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,500
- You have to make a decision, daniel.
- I know.

433
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,970
If that company is making people
sick, you have to stop them.

434
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,560
You think... I'm not grieving?

435
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,870
My concern is that clinging to david's
killer is your way of clinging to david.

436
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:55,420
The type of violence you experienced
could make a person retreat and collapse,

437
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,770
or be consumed with rage.

438
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,530
Neither one is healthy.

439
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,740
Let me ask you something.

440
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,790
What do you think would
make you feel better?

441
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,300
Seeing david again.

442
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,720
And you know what? Ellen...

443
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,360
That's not going to happen.

444
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:24,250
Ellen... ellen! Let's talk about this!

445
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,960
Thank you, perry.

446
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,760
Low 70s, lovely night for a walk.

447
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,710
Patty?

448
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,760
I need to talk to you.

449
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,950
I've come because I need your
help, patty. I'm in trouble.

450
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,310
Really? What kind of trouble?

451
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,750
I have information.

452
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,800
And I'm being threatened.

453
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:47,490
I've come because you know people
who can protect me, discretely.

454
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,390
Daniel...

455
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,210
My family isn't safe.

456
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:59,390
Patty, my wife... my kid.

457
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,580
The other night, they broke in.

458
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,290
Call the police.

459
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,080
I did. They filed a report.

460
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,330
I feel much safer now.

461
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,100
How is any of this my problem?

462
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,900
Jesus, patty, you
think I want to be here?

463
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,870
You think I enjoy begging you for help?

464
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:38,220
If I go public with what I know, it
could bring down an industry. Patty...

465
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,630
I don't want anything
to do with you, daniel.

466
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,790
You made that perfectly clear.

467
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:49,260
I respected your wishes, but
now, goddamn it, I need you.

468
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,930
Too bad.

469
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,290
Don't you turn your back on me.

470
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,120
You owe me.

471
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,360
I owe you nothing.

472
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,660
Another whiskey.

473
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,960
Couple more and you'll have to
change one group for another.

474
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,950
That's funny.

475
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,830
Please leave me alone. I'M...

476
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,240
I'm done with therapy.

477
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,040
You made that clear.

478
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,630
So, you followed me?

479
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,230
Well, it was only 15 blocks.

480
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,690
Yeah, well, I'm not interested.

481
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,950
In what?

482
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,630
In you...

483
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,780
and whatever bullshit
line you're gonna feed me.

484
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,390
The only bullshit I
was gonna feed you is...

485
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,040
you left that on your chair.

486
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,820
Thanks. Thank you.

487
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,240
Well, it was only 15 blocks.

488
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,960
My girlfriend hated whiskey.

489
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:37,220
Which is ironic because the guy that
ran her over was shit-faced on the stuff.

490
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,990
you have a good night.

491
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,130
- the guy who killed your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

492
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,020
- Do you know where he is?
- Attica.

493
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,280
But with good behavior,
he'll be out march 16, 2011.

494
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,700
You know the date?

495
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,060
It's a wednesday.

496
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,300
I know how you're feeling.

497
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:23,340
It took me five months
before I could sleep again.

498
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,260
What changed?

499
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,170
I realized something.

500
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,550
People like you and me--
we only have two options.

501
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,230
Got, uh, forgiveness, revenge.

502
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,800
Which did you choose?

503
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,280
Neither... yet.

504
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,940
You take it easy, parsons.

505
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,480
I'm over here, patty.

506
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,370
Oh, quit wallowing. Stop
worrying about all that.

507
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,380
What's done is done.

508
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,060
Come on, patty.

509
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,650
A charity?

510
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,590
Hungry children ain't gonna cut it.

511
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,740
You want to make amends,

512
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:05,420
start by telling the truth and
confess to ellen what you did to us.

513
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,890
- Patty?
- Yeah?

514
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,420
Is everything okay?

515
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,400
Yeah, just fine.

516
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,740
Actually...

517
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,610
we need to talk.

518
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,570
Sure. Fire away.

519
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,200
Not in the office.

520
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,860
It's, um...

521
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,090
it's personal.

522
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,970
Okay.

523
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,590
If you're not busy
friday after the gala,

524
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,770
there's a little place near the
waldorf I'd love to have a drink.

525
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,240
Look forward to it.

526
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,300
Can you give me the headlines?

527
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,460
It's about you and the frobisher case.

528
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,610
I didn't explain
everything that happened.

529
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,070
Okay.

530
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,600
I want to wear a wire.

531
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,730
This is a big step.

532
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,400
You do this, you become
a cooperating witness.

533
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,130
We can't keep your name confidential.

534
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,130
You'll have to appear in court.

535
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,650
Testify against her.

536
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,860
I'm fine with that.

537
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,370
Ellen, there is no
reason to jump the gun.

538
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,830
She wants to talk to me
about the frobisher case.

539
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,170
You don't want to hear it?

540
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,710
What, uh, what exactly did she say?

541
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,580
She said she didn't explain
everything that happened.

542
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,950
I told you she tried to kill me.

543
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,740
Her guilt is eating at her.

544
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,150
How do you know that?

545
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,960
I can see it.

546
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,660
She's not in a good place.

547
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,700
- When is the meeting?
- Friday after the gala.

548
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,630
- Where?
- A restaurant in midtown.

549
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,000
All right.

550
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,050
It's what we signed you up for.

551
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,410
It's time, mr. Purcell.

552
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,950
You ready to be reasonable?

553
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,260
Did you find anything interesting?

554
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,760
Yeah, very.

555
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,730
At least the parts I could understand.

556
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,760
Purcell was doing some
sort of chemical analysis.

557
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,230
- Get this to our guy at columbia.
- Will do.

558
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,690
Yeah? Thanks. Send him up.

559
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,870
it's sam arsenault.

560
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,070
So, where are you on
the charity foundation?

561
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,210
Nowhere.

562
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,400
Without arsenault's money,
there is no foundation.

563
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,720
Your visit's gonna do
him a world of good.

564
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,340
His painkillers are pretty strong.

565
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,690
But he's going to do just fine.

566
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:43,180
He'll be happy to see you when
he wakes up, mrs. Frobisher.

567
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,100
Baby.

568
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,450
david!

569
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,130
People like you and me--
we only have two options.

570
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,850
Forgiveness. Revenge.

571
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,760
It's time for his lunch. Mrs. Frobisher,
you could sit with him if you...

572
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,700
mrs. Frobisher?

573
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,960
Mr. Frobisher?

574
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,540
Is she here yet?

575
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,610
So, despite your best efforts,
the da wouldn't drop the charges.

576
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,830
Can you believe it?

577
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,450
If lily's name wasn't arsenault,
this never would've happened.

578
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,020
You're goddamn right.

579
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,350
She was set up.

580
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,080
What happened to your campaign?

581
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,550
It's dead in the water.

582
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,780
Republican chairman sees lily on the news,
dumps me, decides to back another horse.

583
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,010
Oh, sam.

584
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,520
Look, patty, uh...

585
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:35,070
it's hard for me to ask,
but, um, I want back in.

586
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,220
To my foundation?

587
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,070
I know, it's embarrassing.

588
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,070
I'm standing here with my
pants down around my ankles.

589
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,660
But I've always been a big fan
of the cause, you know that.

590
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,470
And after lily, I could sure use the pr.

591
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:52,860
We'd be happy to take your money, sam,
but I've promised away the naming rights.

592
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,120
It can't be the
arsenault-hewes foundation?

593
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,620
Patty, I want my name up there.

594
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,180
I wish I could help you.

595
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,770
Come on.

596
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,160
There's gotta be something i could do.

597
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,250
HEWES/ARSENAULT
CHILDREN'S HUNGER INTIATIVE

598
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,740
I will be eternally
grateful to patty hewes.

599
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,660
No, no. Sam is the real hero here.

600
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,020
At the last moment, he generously
decided to double our endowment.

601
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,440
Well, I'm thrilled that I can make a
difference with just the stroke of a pen.

602
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,790
Hey, mom.

603
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,600
Look at that guy.

604
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,540
He's out here celebrating and his
daughter's being sent to juvie.

605
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,570
Such a shame about lily.

606
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,230
I told you she was a cokehead.

607
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,730
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

608
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,260
God help you if I ever find out
you're doing anything like that.

609
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,070
I tried it, mom. Coke's not my thing.

610
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,980
- Patty, congratulations.
- Thank you.

611
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,760
Incredible evening. Oh, it's amazing.

612
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,070
Well...

613
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:11,120
So now that you've launched
this, uh, maybe we can...

614
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,900
Take a case?

615
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,740
It's just a thought.

616
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,630
I like ellen's infant mortality case.

617
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,430
That is just the kind of cause
that we should be advancing.

618
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,920
Well, then, let's do it.

619
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,420
Set up a meeting with
the plaintiff tomorrow.

620
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,470
Fantastic.

621
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,320
Nice find, ellen. It's a great case.

622
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,860
I'm glad you think so.

623
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,550
Patty.

624
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,620
Daniel, I had no idea
you were here tonight.

625
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,640
An important cause like this,
we didn't want to miss it.

626
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,160
I don't believe you
know my wife christine.

627
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,120
Christine, come say hi!

628
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,470
Uh, will you excuse me?
I really should go say hi.

629
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,930
Um, two minutes and we'll go, okay?

630
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,120
It's really nice to meet you.

631
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,810
I admire your work so much.

632
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,920
Thank you for your support.

633
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,160
She's lovely.

634
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,760
Listen, patty. I'm sorry
about the other night.

635
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,520
I don't want to drag you into this.

636
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,830
I can handle it myself.

637
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,720
Glad to hear it.

638
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,190
I should really get those
materials back from you.

639
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,250
I'll have them messengered
over to your office tomorrow.

640
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,770
Better to send them to my home.

641
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,530
Daniel, come say hello.

642
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,230
I promise you-- you
never have to see me.

643
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,070
Jesus!

644
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,750
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

645
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,630
What, you're stalking me now?

646
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,490
No. You just didn't come back to group.

647
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,090
Yeah, that's kind of what
I had in mind when I quit.

648
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,390
What do you want from me?

649
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,320
I don't want anything.
I... nothing. I don'T...

650
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,470
I was just concerned.

651
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,420
And, and, look, I-I-I
thought this might help you.

652
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,580
What's that?

653
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,200
It's a phone number.
Don't worry; it's not mine.

654
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,610
Call after midnight. Just ask for frank.

655
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,030
But if a woman answers,
you should hang up.

656
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,230
I don't do drugs.

657
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,610
Well, that's good 'cause
he doesn't sell any.

658
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,100
And they're bad for you.

659
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,680
Well, then, what am I calling him for?

660
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,350
Because frank's not the kind of
guy who gets hung up on permits.

661
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,910
A permit? For what?

662
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,770
- A gun.
- A gun?

663
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,860
You know what...

664
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,600
What. what the hell would make
you think that I want a gun?

665
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,570
Because I think you're scared.

666
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,280
Because I think you
feel helpless and alone.

667
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,530
Now, if you tell me I'm
wrong, then I'm wrong.

668
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,810
And I apologize--
my mistake.

669
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,650
I've been thinking about
this whole revenge thing.

670
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,730
Yeah?

671
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,640
It's not me. It's not who I am.

672
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:13,840
A gun's not gonna help, so i guess I'm
just gonna have to find a way to forgive.

673
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,520
It functions like a normal telephone,
but there's a microphone right here.

674
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:32,010
To activate it, you just turn it on.

675
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,470
Think I can handle that.

676
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:37,170
It records in and out of the case,
but out is better if you can manage it.

677
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,520
You don't want to talk too much.

678
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,870
That's the biggest mistake people
make. When they get nervous, they talk.

679
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,110
If patty's gonna give us anything,
we don't want you speaking over her,

680
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,100
so you can prompt her with questions, but
then you got to back off and you let her talk.

681
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,470
- I got it.
- You ready?

682
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,890
I'm fine. You guys are
more nervous than I am.

683
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,640
Okay.

684
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,990
This is agent randall harrison.

685
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,210
The date is june 14.
The time is 11:27 P.M.

686
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,190
Ellen parsons, do you give your voluntary consent
to have this recording device placed on your person?

687
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,510
Yes.

688
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,920
Well, sorry about that. Fox news.

689
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,010
Oh, you... you've got another bottle?

690
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,390
what is it?

691
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,480
Chגteau lafitte... something french.

692
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,770
I just picked the most
expensive one on the list.

693
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,570
so, you wanted to tell me something.

694
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,190
Ellen, I didn't explain everything
to you during the frobisher case.

695
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,840
That's all in the past.

696
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:13,550
No, no, it's important
that you know this.

697
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,810
Patty, I think we both need to move on.

698
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,690
The frobisher case was chaos,
and we weren't thinking clearly.

699
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:27,390
Still, I... I want to apologize.

700
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,120
Apologize? Apologize for what?

701
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:41,160
The weekend after
fiske committed suicide,

702
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:47,400
his death had a profound effect on me.

703
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:53,070
It, um, pushed me to a place
that I had never to been before.

704
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,260
I didn't know that.

705
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:01,930
I... I became too emotional.

706
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,100
I was afraid of being exposed,

707
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:10,150
of losing the case.

708
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,360
I lost control.

709
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,940
I had to leave the city.

710
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,710
While I'm gone, you're
welcome to stay here.

711
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:27,470
Ellen... everything's
gonna be all right.

712
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,880
You said you went to visit family.

713
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,290
Well, that wasn't exactly true.

714
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,560
No?

715
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,940
Years ago, I had a child.

716
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,300
I've never told anyone.

717
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,000
The baby, was, um, unhealthy.

718
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:15,670
The doctors said it was,

719
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,440
stillborn. It was a little girl.

720
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,890
I named her julia.

721
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:35,730
Sometimes, I think, if she'd lived...

722
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,500
I'd be another person.

723
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:49,310
So, when you went away, you...

724
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,070
I went to visit her.

725
00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:00,990
I hadn't been to that
cemetery in 30 years.

726
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,890
And while I was there,

727
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,540
someone attacked you in my apartment.

728
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,870
Whoever broke in was looking for me.

729
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,380
It's done.

730
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,650
I wish to god it had been me.

731
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:45,820
I want you to know that if
my daughter had survived--

732
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,910
if julia
had lived--

733
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,270
I'd want her to be just like you.

734
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,540
How did it go?

735
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:28,250
Hello? This is she.

736
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,380
I was wrong.

737
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,720
I didn't get anything.

738
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,850
It's just more lies.

739
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,450
What did she say?

740
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,930
She told me someone was
coming to kill her that night

741
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:45,700
and some bullshit about me
being the daughter she never had.

742
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,710
Well, you're building a
relationship, establishing intimacy.

743
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,990
These things take time.

744
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,770
I don't have time.

745
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,400
- Miss hewes?
- Yes.

746
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,750
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

747
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,470
Patty?

748
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,480
Now will you help me?

749
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:53,290
The important thing is she
took the infant mortality case.

750
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,290
Where are we on that?

751
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,110
Patty's meeting the
lead plaintiff tomorrow.

752
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,220
Good.

753
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,130
We'll get her, ellen.

754
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,610
How long do these things usually take?

755
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,330
Could be two, three years
before we have enough.

756
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,960
You got to be patient.

757
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,850
Can you do that?

758
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,660
6 MONTHS LATER

759
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,710
So, it's just the two of us.

760
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,520
Face to face.

761
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:55,560
It seems like you're not gonna
tell me the truth after all.

762
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,740
Well, that's okay.

763
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,880
I lied, too.

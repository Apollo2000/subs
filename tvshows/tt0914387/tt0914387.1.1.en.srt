4
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:34,493
Damages Season 01 Episode01

5
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,468
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am,
I'll take a look.

6
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,096
Bloody, half naked,
wandering the streets at 7:00 A.M.

7
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,598
Just your type.

8
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,391
You get a name?

9
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,935
She's not responsive.

10
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,728
All we found on her was this.

11
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:28,770
"Hollis M.
Nye, attorney-at-law."

12
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,110
The rest is a mess.

13
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:33,524
I guess we know her lawyer.

14
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,192
- Or her john.
- Or both.

15
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,992
You want to get
her some clothes?

16
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:47,623
Who the hell are
you, sweetheart?

17
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:53,042
Ellen, I think you'll find our offer
more than fair for someone just out of
law school.

18
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:53,843
6 MONTHS EARLIER

19
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:56,801
We'd like to bring you in
as a junior associate,

20
00:02:56,806 --> 00:03:01,051
five years guaranteed with
a starting salary of...

21
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:03,261
Holy shit.

22
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:07,220
Damn right,
"holy shit." Congratulations.

23
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,143
You can go ahead
and breathe now.

24
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,603
Saying yes is going
to be the easy part.

25
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,152
Ellen...

26
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,701
with whom else have you met?

27
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:26,491
No one, Mr. Nye, but Hewes &
Associates called me yesterday.

28
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:30,832
Wow, Patty Hewes.

29
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,421
Well...

30
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:35,003
good luck to you.

31
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:38,010
You might have mentioned
that sooner. Hmm?

32
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:43,053
All right, I'll tell Ms. Hewes.

33
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:45,933
$25 million is
their final offer.

34
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,391
No, it isn't.

35
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,233
They don't have the
stomach for a verdict.

36
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,151
The answer's "no, " Mr. Cutler.

37
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:54,691
Enough of this shit.

38
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:57,771
Would you please put
Patty on the phone?

39
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,153
He wants to talk to you.

40
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,861
Nothing's changed, Mr. Cutler.

41
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:06,373
$150 million to settle.

42
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,043
Put her on the goddamned line.

43
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,130
Yes, Martin.

44
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,710
You want to be
professional for a second?

45
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:23,343
Spring's almost here.
I adore it. Rebirth.

46
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,052
Do you think that's
because I'm a water sign?

47
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:28,101
I'm trying to do
you a favor, Patty.

48
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:30,180
You see the way that
forewoman was looking at me?

49
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,180
I'm a pisces, what are you?

50
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:33,852
Who gives a shit?

51
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,651
Fine. Aries.

52
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:44,403
April 3rd, house of the rising
retrograde Mercury bullshit.

53
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,451
$25 million, Patty.

54
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,791
Aries is a fire sign, Martin.

55
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,331
25, Patty.

56
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:53,761
Throw me back something
I can work with.

57
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,881
Your sign's function in life
is to resolve conflict.

58
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:01,263
You're right. 25.

59
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,920
I guess this time
you came up short.

60
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:06,431
This is charity, Patty.

61
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,140
I shredded your
experts on cross.

62
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:08,971
Did you?

63
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,180
You didn't prove my
client was at fault.

64
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:14,772
Children died, Martin.

65
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:18,233
Ms. Hewes?
The verdict's coming in.

66
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,570
It's your last chance
to get off cheap.150

67
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:24,240
50, Patty.Tops.

68
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,363
Reggie Dwayne Thomas.

69
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:27,913
Who the hell's that?

70
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,492
A second grader and a Mets fan.

71
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,410
You know him as patient 61.

72
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,291
As his immune system was being
decimated, Reggie asked me for
two things...

73
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,172
75, Patty.

74
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:42,423
That his team make the playoffs and that
someone punish the company that made
him sick.

75
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:47,763
All right, goddamn it, 150!
That's it, we're done.

76
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,763
Soon as you tell
it to the judge.

77
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,902
Martin Cutler for the defense,
your honor.

78
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:01,942
We've reached a
settlement. 150.

79
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:08,362
You're a real hard-dicked bitch,
you know that?

80
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:11,120
Afternoon, madam Foreman.

81
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,493
I thought you just
reached a verdict.

82
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,332
Not at quiznos, we didn't.

83
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,333
We broke for lunch.

84
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:22,000
If you were a man,
I'd kick the living dogshit out of you.

85
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,631
If you were a man,
I'd be worried.

86
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:34,850
And then I left 150
grand on the table.

87
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:39,651
That's twice the money my
parents make in a year. Combined.

88
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,230
Am I crazy?

89
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,272
I hope so.

90
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:53,782
You want to grab a table?

91
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,413
First round's on me.

92
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:59,922
What the hell is he doing here?

93
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:01,920
Who?

94
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,510
Mr. Nye.

95
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,262
I was told this is your spot.

96
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,722
All my secrets are out, huh?

97
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,312
I appreciate your offer today.

98
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:16,970
Oh, no, no, no, we're fine.

99
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,100
We have a lot of
good candidates.

100
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,311
It's you I'm worried about.

101
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,442
Say, is, uh...
is that your boyfriend?

102
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:27,073
Yeah.

103
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:31,491
- Are you two happy?
- Very.

104
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,451
I'm sorry to hear that.

105
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:34,453
Excuse me?

106
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:37,083
There won't be room
for him and Patty.

107
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:38,832
There won't be room
for you and Patty.

108
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:42,500
With Patty Hewes,
there's only Patty.

109
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:46,211
Oh, I came here for a favor.

110
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,840
Could you autograph
that for me, please?

111
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:51,683
It'll clear my conscience.

112
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:54,851
You're special, Ellen.

113
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:58,141
But that'll only make
the fall harder.

114
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:02,232
- What are you talking about?
- Your ambition.

115
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:07,360
Maybe we need people like Patty who see
their destiny in grander terms than the
rest of us.

116
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,573
But that doesn't mean that
you should go work for her.

117
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:13,163
So think about it.

118
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,911
My offer's still good.

119
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,290
My interview is on wednesday.
I haven't even gotten the job yet.

120
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,162
You will.

121
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:21,833
Once Patty meets you,
there's no turning back.

122
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:24,462
She'll see what I see.

123
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,882
And she'll own you.

124
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,781
I've invited you to the show
a hundred times before.

125
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:42,682
You've never come, so why now?

126
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,103
Well, actually,
I thought it was deal or no deal.

127
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,442
I mean, where's the bald guy?

128
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,940
He's backstage.
We stuffed him in a briefcase.

129
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,900
So what's the real story?
Why now?

130
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:55,070
I'm here because of
Arthur Frobisher.

131
00:08:55,075 --> 00:09:00,290
5, 000 of his employees lost their life
savings as a result of his actions.

132
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:03,832
Alleged actions. He was found
not guilty at a criminal trial.

133
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,670
No, it's a matter
of public record.

134
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:11,303
Arthur Frobisher told his employees to
invest in the company and then sold his
own stock.

135
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:12,973
It's classic pump and dump.

136
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:15,551
He claims he had a prior
arrangement with his broker to sell.

137
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,143
You believe that?

138
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:21,682
Arthur Frobisher made hundreds
of millions in personal profit

139
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,640
while his workers lost their pensions,
their 401ks, everything they had.

140
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:27,153
Government couldn't prove it.

141
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:30,070
Greta, I think there's a lot of
things our government can't do.

142
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:34,153
We're gonna take a quick break. We'll be
right back with high-stakes litigator,
Patty Hewes.

143
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,611
- And we're out.
- That was great.

144
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:37,580
It's good to meet you finally.

145
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,450
Nice to meet you.

146
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:41,494
- Tom confirmed the client reps for tomorrow.
- Good.

147
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,792
Wish my girlfriend could've been here.
We're huge Greta fans.

148
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,711
You have a girlfriend?

149
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,792
She teaches at
your son's school.

150
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,170
I thought you were gay.

151
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:57,433
Ms. Hewes, tell us what we can do.
You're our lawyer.

152
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,551
We're in the news every day.

153
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,053
Look at this.

154
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:04,812
Frobisher's lawyer called us
greedy in the wall street journal.

155
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:07,522
On CNN,
he said we're the bloodsuckers.

156
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:10,020
I warned you the
media war was coming.

157
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,481
Well, here it is.

158
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,901
I don't want my grandkids
hearing these lies.

159
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,493
I know, Larry,
it's deeply upsetting.

160
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:21,030
And Frobisher's people are spinning his
case exactly the way we would expect
them to.

161
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:22,743
Well, what can we do about it?

162
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:25,002
I need you to understand this.

163
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:28,332
We are engaging in
a battle with a man

164
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,593
who will stop at nothing
to preserve his fortune.

165
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:36,010
High-stakes litigation is
a long and painful process.

166
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:41,222
Frobisher will destroy us in the press,
he will attack us personally,

167
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:45,181
he will try to turn our lives upside
down so that we'll want to settle.

168
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:49,062
Meanwhile, his attorneys will
spin him as the good guy,

169
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,023
the aggrieved innocent victim.

170
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,071
So we have to be patient,
and we have to stay strong.

171
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:01,952
But most of all,
we have to all stick together.

172
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:06,661
If we do that, we'll win.

173
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,880
- Okay, enough already.
- Sorry.

174
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,050
Was I pushing it?

175
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:19,220
No, it's good, I just haven't
exercised in, like, three months.

176
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,803
The restaurant's killing me.

177
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,430
I've never worked
so hard in my life.

178
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:24,810
- Did you hire a staff yet?
- Starting to.

179
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:26,643
- Would you look over some contracts?
- Sure.

180
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:28,390
Saffron.

181
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:30,350
Good girl.

182
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,313
Oh, nice work. You actually
got my sister to break a sweat.

183
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:35,650
- Yeah.
- Oh, you ass.

184
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,532
Oh, my god.

185
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:40,321
- What is it?
- They bumped up my interview.

186
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,240
Hewes & Associates.
Can I help you?

187
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,802
Ms. Hewes, we're ready for your
briefing in conference room one.

188
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,503
Thank you, Felicia.

189
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,963
I'm sorry, someone helping you?

190
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:56,213
Uh, I'm Ellen Parsons.

191
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,131
Who?

192
00:11:57,137 --> 00:12:00,761
I'm here for, um, to interview.

193
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,142
Well, good luck to you.

194
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,721
Ellen? Tom Shayes.

195
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:09,141
We spoke on the phone.

196
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,731
- Hello.
- Right.

197
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,063
Uh, right this way.
Here you go.

198
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:19,820
So, one of the advantages, you know,
you're not going to be buried in
paperwork your first year.

199
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:26,700
Unlike big firms, Patty believes in
a team approach, that kind of thing.

200
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,831
Geez! Excuse me.

201
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,410
Sorry, Tom.

202
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,960
That's okay, it's all right.

203
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:33,673
Ellen, uncle Pete.

204
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,710
Uncle Pete's been with
Patty longer than any of us.

205
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,962
He's really the one who runs
everything around here.

206
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,011
- Good to meet you, Ellen.
- Nice to meet you.

207
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:44,513
It's dry cleaning. We've been
working on the Frobisher case 24/7.

208
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:48,183
Some of our associates haven't, uh,
haven't been able to go home yet.

209
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:53,642
It's best not to go into an
interview with Patty cold.

210
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,560
Most likely, she'll grill you on
precedents for our current case,

211
00:12:56,566 --> 00:13:01,320
but any topic is fair game--
constitutional law, torts, contracts.

212
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:02,280
No problem.

213
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:05,320
Patty is not looking to see
how you handle the facts,

214
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,160
she's looking to see
how you handle yourself,

215
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,412
how you think,
how you express yourself.

216
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,163
Okay, got it.

217
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,373
Yeah. No, you don't. Uh...

218
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:18,420
when it comes to reading people,
Patty lives and dies by instinct.

219
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:23,092
The woman has the sharpest
bullshit meter I've ever seen.

220
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:27,053
And you're at the most difficult step.
It's do or die.

221
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:32,390
If you're phony with her for one second,
she'll skewer you.

222
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,730
Good. Phony's not
my strong suit.

223
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:36,693
Good.

224
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:41,690
So we have you sitting
down with Patty saturday.

225
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,822
- Come again?
- Exact time TBD.

226
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:47,323
We're going to ask that you just
leave the whole day available.

227
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,740
I thought the
interview was today.

228
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:50,950
No, no.

229
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,953
No, we couldn't have you sit down with
Patty without you meeting me first.

230
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,790
But I can't do saturday.

231
00:13:56,926 --> 00:14:00,250
Work it out.
Patty's schedule is impossible.

232
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:03,050
My sister's getting
married on saturday.

233
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,923
All day?

234
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,392
You know, you didn't just think that.
You actually said it.

235
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:13,062
Look, Ellen,
most people never get this chance.

236
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:15,810
Do you want it or not?

237
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:25,610
Get your dog back!

238
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:26,951
Get that dog away from my dog!

239
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:28,231
- It's not my dog!
- Get it back!

240
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:31,873
Come on, Tito,
we're going home!

241
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:36,042
You long for the reasoned justice
of the courtroom, don't it?

242
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,711
Ray, I didn't know you
walked your own dog.

243
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,380
Which one is yours?

244
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:45,301
Under the tree.
The doberman. Yours?

245
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:48,381
That mutt over there trying
to hump the ridgeback.

246
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:50,470
Sorry.

247
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:54,522
Hey, you know,
I caught you on tv last night.

248
00:14:55,357 --> 00:14:59,601
Seems foolish to get your clients' hopes
up when the government already spit
and bit.

249
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:04,691
Federal prosecutors proved nothing
against my client. Heaven knows, neither
will you.

250
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,693
I'm at a dog park, ray.

251
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,530
You're right, you're right.

252
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:15,121
Let's not have this get
pissy like last time.

253
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:21,962
Give me a number, Patty.

254
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:25,342
Mr. Frobisher's already lost three
years of his life to a government trial.

255
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:28,723
Maybe I can talk him into
saving himself another three.

256
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,130
A jury will give
him a number, Ray.

257
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:35,853
You in this for your clients or
to destroy arthur Frobisher?

258
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,933
Both.

259
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:45,271
You are so full of shit, Patty.

260
00:15:47,575 --> 00:15:49,741
You know what I like
most about you?

261
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,450
You have no case.

262
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,912
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Nice seeing you, Ray.

263
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:07,801
Aunt Barb and uncle Fran
all the way from California.

264
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:12,263
And, Cathy and Rich, thank you so much,
coming all the way from New Jersey.

265
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:14,443
And I want to thank everyone...

266
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,930
You know you actually
make that dress work?

267
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,890
Thanks, babe.

268
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,272
You okay?

269
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:27,482
Yeah, it's...

270
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,653
the one day in the year I can't
interview, and they won't reschedule.

271
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,740
They're Hewes & Associates.

272
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,412
I know, I know.

273
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,750
I especially want to
thank my sister, Ellen.

274
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:48,963
And even though I've
got three years on her,

275
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:53,092
Ellie's always been my big sister,
you know?

276
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,552
Always giving me advice,
and um...

277
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:00,933
I swore to myself I was going to
make it through without crying.

278
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:03,351
I love you, Carrie.

279
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:05,482
Okay, here she goes again.

280
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:10,281
I wish I could have been a
better role model, you know,

281
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:13,612
but you were always
perfect at everything,

282
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:19,490
and there wasn't ever anything
you needed me for, so...

283
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,543
Carrie.

284
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,471
Well, if it isn't
the maid of honor.

285
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:44,850
Thought you might
need a breather.

286
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:48,273
Ms. Hewes.
What are you doing here?

287
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:50,771
I had to meet you.

288
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:52,903
Why?

289
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:57,032
Because, kiddo, you're the first
person stupid enough to turn me down.

290
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,292
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.

291
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:07,583
Family toasts, public displays
of affection-- absolute torture.

292
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,092
Bourbon?

293
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,381
Helps take the edge off.

294
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,632
I should probably
just bite the bullet.

295
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,802
So what about you, Ellen?

296
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:22,761
Do you see a husband
in your future?

297
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:27,023
Yeah, I guess. I hope so.

298
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,101
You know what they say.

299
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,650
"Hope is the thing
with feathers."

300
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:33,441
Emily Dickinson.

301
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,941
That bitch would say anything.

302
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,573
Ms. Hewes,
I'm sorry I missed our meeting today.

303
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:41,332
No, no. I understand.
I understand.

304
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:42,370
The good sister.

305
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:45,840
It's just that this is family, you know,
and if I skipped the wedding for a
job interview...

306
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,291
You'd confirm their worst fear.

307
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,671
Which is?

308
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:54,210
They're good, hardworking people,
and they're afraid of losing you.

309
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:56,590
Wait. How long have
you been here?

310
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:59,302
They actually remind
me of my family.

311
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,391
You love them,
you do anything for them.

312
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:05,432
The problem is they
don't have your ambition.

313
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:07,391
What's the problem?

314
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:12,562
You try to lead by example, and they
want you to lead, and then they resent
you for it.

315
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,693
They put you on a pedestal,
look up to you,

316
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,283
and then blame you for
the crick in their necks.

317
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:19,822
Oh, that problem.

318
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:22,870
I know how hard you worked
to get your shot with me,

319
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,911
but you turned it down
to be with your family.

320
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:30,122
That's an interesting choice.

321
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,382
Ms. Hewes?

322
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:42,263
Is there any way I
could still interview?

323
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,141
I think it would be a
waste of time, Ellen.

324
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,272
You're hired.

325
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:34,942
I hate to interrupt your morning,
Art, but it's not good.

326
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:36,403
All right,
how much does she want?

327
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,690
Say again?
I can barely hear you.

328
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,662
Yeah, I'm in the middle of
a shit storm here, Ray.

329
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:45,372
How much does she want?

330
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,913
She wouldn't give me a number.

331
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,872
If she's got a pulse,
she's got a price.

332
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,460
Well, it's one
you can't afford.

333
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:56,793
She's on a mission here, and she won't
stop till you're strung up in the
public square.

334
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,260
All right, you know what?
It's time you made the call, Ray.

335
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:02,511
We're not there yet, Art.

336
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:07,802
I'm sick of this shit. First the
government, now this bitch! Shit!

337
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,141
You know something? My wife's
about to leave me because of this.

338
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:17,611
My kids are getting harassed at school.
This bullshit never ends.

339
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:19,780
Make the call.
I want some leverage.

340
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:21,321
Give me some time.

341
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,282
No. Time's up.

342
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:26,662
Hey, Ray, what...
you called them "bloodsuckers"?

343
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,833
What's that about? Come on.
Lighten up on the rhetoric.

344
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,910
Art...

345
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:33,962
Yeah, I can't hear you.

346
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:37,793
Look, if you need me, I'm going to
be at the Brewster trauma center.

347
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,763
My idiot brother-in-law
can't drive for shit.

348
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:45,512
I'm going with you,
so wait just one second.

349
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,263
Arthur Frobisher's dossier,
and his broker, Gary Genow.

350
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:51,473
What do you know?

351
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:53,573
The government lost because
they couldn't link these guys.

352
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:56,273
Frobisher claimed he had a preexisting
agreement to sell his stock.

353
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,860
Genow backs him up,
but that's a crock.

354
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:00,481
Very good. However,

355
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:04,031
Frobisher and Genow were both in Florida
the weekend prior to the sell off.

356
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,822
We don't have a case unless we can
connect Frobisher with his broker.

357
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,832
Which the government couldn't do even
though both men were in Florida?

358
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:14,502
We interviewed every employee,
colleague and golf buddy

359
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:17,420
within 100 miles of Arthur
Frobisher on the day in question.

360
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:19,711
And we managed to piece together
Frobisher's whereabouts.

361
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:22,803
On saturday, June 19, from 9:00 A.M.
to 1:00 P.M.,

362
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:25,383
He plays 18 holes
in Palm Beach.

363
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:32,222
We interviewed club members, guests and
employees, but no sign of his broker.

364
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,271
From 1:00 P.M. till 3:00,

365
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:37,733
he lunches with a few of his fortune
500 pals-- lobster bisque, kobe beef.

366
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,193
But his broker is
nowhere to be found.

367
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:42,442
From 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.

368
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:45,320
Frobisher's at the spa
getting a full body treatment.

369
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:48,782
For three hours?
What was he getting waxed?

370
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,783
6:00 P.M.
Frobisher flies home in his private jet,

371
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,161
arrives at Teterboro
airport at 9:00 P.M.

372
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,580
He's home safe and
sound by 10:00.

373
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:01,752
So somehow Frobisher and his broker
communicated down in Florida,

374
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,251
but no one saw them together.

375
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:05,852
Then they probably used an intermediary.
Someone played messenger.

376
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:09,343
Unfortunately, that could be anyone
in the entire state of Florida.

377
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:12,762
Patty's got all her contacts in
the sunshine state looking into it.

378
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:16,890
Whatever happened,
someone down there must know something.

379
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,733
Ellen?

380
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:21,862
You've got a 4:00 P.M.
at Bergdorf's.

381
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,271
Go to VIP services.
Talk to Suzanne.

382
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,240
She knows what Patty likes.

383
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:29,823
First...

384
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,532
your home away from home.

385
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,751
Free piece of advice.

386
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:39,543
Don't... don't
make it your own.

387
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:40,173
Okay.

388
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:43,712
Patty doesn't want family photographs,
tchotchkes, knickknacks.

389
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,340
And don't bring anything you can't carry
out in one trip when she fires you.

390
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,010
I'm kidding... sort of.

391
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:53,850
Frobisher discovery.
Patty will need a full summary.

392
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,012
She wants to see how you write.

393
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,881
Her name is Ellen Parsons.

394
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:29,801
- You her lawyer?
- Is she okay?

395
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:32,432
- Are you her lawyer?
- No. A friend.

396
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:37,680
- You have a current address?
- Yes. Certainly.

397
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:43,021
She, uh...
she lives with her fiancי?

398
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:25,440
Okay, that was insane.
There's more.

399
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:27,441
- Let me grab those.
- Thank you.

400
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:31,612
There were, like, five women
helping me try on a pair of pants.

401
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:33,703
I'd enjoy that.

402
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:39,622
At one point, I was half naked, and
Barbara Walters walked into the
dressing room.

403
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:42,411
That... not so much.

404
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:47,421
They had everything ready to go,
pulled in my size.

405
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,462
Nice.

406
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,093
Can't wait for a
reason to wear it.

407
00:25:57,436 --> 00:26:00,353
Oh, wait. This isn't mine.

408
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,313
No?

409
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:04,353
How did this get in here?

410
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,400
I don't know.

411
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:22,333
Baby.

412
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:37,282
I hear we're a little behind
schedule for the opening.

413
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:38,700
Frank...

414
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:43,163
in the restaurant business,
a little behind is a lot ahead.

415
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,912
- We're doing just fine.
- Good.

416
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,293
But you did say you would
call before you came.

417
00:27:47,297 --> 00:27:51,332
Oh, my boss wanted me to
check up on his investment.

418
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:53,292
And good news...

419
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:56,552
I was able to push
this through.

420
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:03,512
Our liquor license!
Oh, excellent. Thank you.

421
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,972
Hey, there, fella.

422
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:10,141
- What's his name?
- Her.

423
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,811
Saffron.

424
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:15,022
Got one myself.

425
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,320
Most loyal creatures
on God's green Earth.

426
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:21,610
Oh, one more thing.

427
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,240
I need your Jane Hancock, uh...

428
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:29,042
here and here.

429
00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:34,133
I think I've already
signed one of these.

430
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:39,630
Oh, this just clarifies the scope of
your existing confidentiality agreement.

431
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,803
I do hate housekeeping.

432
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:45,893
it's standard boilerplate.

433
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:48,600
Okay, I'll get my
lawyer to take a look.

434
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:51,983
I gather there's some problem?

435
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:54,102
No, no problem. I just...

436
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:56,820
Permits are coming through,
you're getting everything you need?

437
00:28:56,828 --> 00:29:00,240
Yeah, absolutely.
You guys have been great.

438
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:02,863
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

439
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:06,532
I'd hate for anything to
hold up your opening.

440
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:09,120
Oh, so would I.

441
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,873
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to get back to work.

442
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,831
By all means.

443
00:29:15,926 --> 00:29:17,843
Good girl, Saffron.

444
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,922
You be a good girl, too.

445
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,192
My great-great
grandfather designed this.

446
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:41,781
He grew rich on the munition
demands of the civil war.

447
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:45,911
In fact, he started this club
over a hundred years ago.

448
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,452
I hear you know your way
around a rifle, Larry.

449
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,793
The marines was a
long time ago, Mr.

450
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:58,291
These guns are all that's
left of my family's fortune.

451
00:29:58,348 --> 00:29:59,921
The depression wiped us out.

452
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,463
I didn't know that.

453
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,303
Yeah.

454
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,801
Sit down, come on.

455
00:30:10,357 --> 00:30:12,603
- That's good lemonade, isn't it?
- Yeah.

456
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,810
I grew up with nothing.

457
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:20,480
At 17, I walked out of my
father's house without a dime,

458
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,491
bullheaded and full of pride.

459
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:28,073
It took almost three decades,

460
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:32,290
but I built my company
from the ground up.

461
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:37,830
That company meant
everything to me.

462
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,262
But what happened to you...

463
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:48,261
to all my employees,
is a tragedy.

464
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:50,890
Yes, it is.

465
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:58,353
But, Larry, Patty Hewes...

466
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:03,360
she's not the answer.
I mean, she's an egomaniac,

467
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:06,150
and she's going to lose.

468
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,243
You know why?

469
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,532
No, sir.

470
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,452
Because I didn't do it.

471
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:14,451
I'm a very rich man.

472
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,793
I make no apologies for that.

473
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:23,001
But I'm also an innocent man, and I want
to come to some reasonable solution
to this.

474
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,010
What do you want from me?

475
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,722
All right, um...

476
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:34,430
I know that you have the employees' ear,
that they trust you.

477
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:40,020
I think that you and I
together could end this.

478
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:42,562
Now, we'll...
we'll be discreet.

479
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:45,860
We'll take care of you
when this is all settled,

480
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:50,993
but all I'm asking for is a
number that you think is fair.

481
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:56,043
That's all.

482
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,551
Mr. Frobisher has
a number for you.

483
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:23,811
He wants to settle for $100 million?
That's ridiculous.

484
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:26,652
That's total bullshit, but it's
our duty to take it to the clients.

485
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,153
What if they accept?

486
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,822
It's never going to happen.
This is Patty Hewes.

487
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:33,371
Watch and learn.

488
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:37,373
Arthur Frobisher
stole your future.

489
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:43,172
He stole financial security from your
children and your children's children.

490
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:47,171
Now, this offer--
it might pay for today's bills,

491
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,803
but you've got to remember
there are 5,000 of you.

492
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,681
There's going to be
nothing left for tomorrow.

493
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:56,511
Frobisher wants this case settled
before we can expose the truth.

494
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,470
You want the truth?
We're broke.

495
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:01,442
$100 million.

496
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,443
Mrs. Hewes, that's a one with
a hell of a lot of zeroes.

497
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:09,442
Absolutely, but it's what Frobisher
wants to pay to get rid of you.

498
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:14,702
If you want to send a message to this
man, he has to pay a price that he
can't afford.

499
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:20,542
Frobisher's net worth is upward of
two and a half billion dollars.

500
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:24,543
now $100 million sounds like
a lot of money, and it is,

501
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:28,591
but it's less than five percent
of what this man is worth.

502
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:31,170
I think we have a strong case.

503
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:37,472
I'd like to take it to a jury and let
them decide what Mr. Arthur Frobisher
owes you.

504
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:41,270
Now, hold on,
hold on here, people.

505
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,890
We discussed this,

506
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:48,772
and we all agreed if Frobisher ever
offered $100 million we'd accept it.

507
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:51,241
Do you know about this?

508
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:53,450
Of course not.

509
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:57,031
I... it's ridiculous.

510
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:01,083
- Mrs. Hewes, you work the percentage, right?
- Right.

511
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:05,172
More money from Frobisher
means more money for you.

512
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,331
The rich get richer.

513
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:10,421
You're absolutely right.

514
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:14,303
I have made a lot of money.
I'm good at what I do.

515
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:17,053
But it also affords me the
luxury to only take cases

516
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:21,272
that I feel passionately
about this case.

517
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:22,851
If we turn this
settlement down,

518
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:26,561
the case could drag on for years
and we could end up getting nothing.

519
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:30,233
You can survive that--
we can't.

520
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:35,951
Let's stick to our plan.

521
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,950
Take this money and
get on with our lives.

522
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:47,250
Karen, Larry, if I may,
I just want to say one thing...

523
00:34:47,256 --> 00:34:51,460
All due respect, Mrs.
Hewes, I say we end this here and now.

524
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,510
On behalf of
custodial services,

525
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:57,802
I vote to accept
the settlement.

526
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:01,562
- I'm ready.
- Yeah.

527
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:20,951
I am pleased to present

528
00:35:20,998 --> 00:35:26,121
the american bar association's
national public service award

529
00:35:27,715 --> 00:35:31,631
to Patricia C. Hewes.

530
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:39,341
Thank you, George.

531
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,721
I'm particularly touched to
receive this award from you

532
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,852
and thanks to the ABA for
your recognition and support.

533
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,232
I'm deeply honored
and grateful.

534
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,692
And all of you for
coming out this morning.

535
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:56,491
I have to admit, I wouldn't want to give
up my saturday morning to listen to me,
so I will...

536
00:35:56,997 --> 00:35:59,111
I will try to be brief.

537
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,413
Look at her.

538
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:04,280
Normally, she turns this shit down.
She hates awards.

539
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:07,123
- Then why is she here?
- For the P.R.

540
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:09,330
Has just become another tool...

541
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:12,753
Most cases-- you get your clients
$100 million, you're a hero.

542
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:16,002
But if Frobisher
gets off that easy,

543
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:18,300
the whole legal world
will know she tanked it.

544
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:25,643
The powerful corrupt the law when they
use it as a club to bludgeon the weak.

545
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:31,102
Yes, ma'am, my produce is
100% locally grown, organic.

546
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:34,732
And I was trained at the
culinary institute, yes.

547
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,732
The culinary institute.

548
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:41,361
Ma'am, can I...
can I give you a call back?

549
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,803
- Hey, sis, what's up?
- David, where are you?

550
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:08,391
I'm at Ellen's.
Just got off a shift.What's up?

551
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:10,390
We need to talk.

552
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:19,651
There you are.

553
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,241
Is this the lawyer of the year?

554
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:24,743
Is this the man who
kidnapped my husband?

555
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,031
How's London?

556
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:30,580
London? Is that where I am?
I've lost track.

557
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:32,331
Michael's headmaster called.

558
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:34,172
Yeah, I know.
We're on for monday morning.

559
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:36,210
I'll have a talk with
Michael when I get home.

560
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:38,550
Another talk's going to help?

561
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:40,212
Probably not.

562
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,341
Any headway with the witness?

563
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,262
Um, no.

564
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:46,761
- You eating?
- Yeah.

565
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:47,511
More or less.

566
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:51,682
- Sleeping?
- Phil, stop it. I'm fine.

567
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,813
No, you're not.
I can hear it in your voice.

568
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:57,611
Fly safe.
I'll see you tomorrow.

569
00:37:57,656 --> 00:37:58,821
Bye.

570
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:06,700
The clients want to know to know why
Patty hasn't accepted the
settlement yet.

571
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:09,791
- What is she waiting for?
- I don't know.

572
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:17,923
Why the long face? Lighten up.

573
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,252
I just got a goddamn award.

574
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:27,091
So who's hungry?
I'm thinking steak.

575
00:38:27,476 --> 00:38:29,890
- Ellen, do you eat meat?
- Sure.

576
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:33,350
Attagirl. Tom here's a vegan.

577
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:35,060
Only for health reasons.

578
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,900
Health reasons... right.

579
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,283
I know everything about you,
don't I, Tommy?

580
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:47,360
Who's been with me
ten years come August?

581
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,202
I have.

582
00:38:48,246 --> 00:38:52,451
And who did I trust to be my
client liaison on this case?

583
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,080
You trusted me.

584
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:58,420
But who let me get blindsided
by their intentions?

585
00:38:58,428 --> 00:38:59,631
How could I have possibly...

586
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:04,210
How could you have possibly made
such a catastrophic screw up?

587
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,721
I wish I could answer that.

588
00:39:08,935 --> 00:39:11,560
Enjoy your tofu,
Tom, you're fired.

589
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,603
Are you serious? Wha...

590
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,603
- How about sushi?
- Patty...

591
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:16,483
Do you like fish?

592
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:19,813
- Your clients purposefully misled me.
- I know a great place.

593
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,442
- Listen to me...
- No, you listen to me.

594
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:22,691
Get out of the car!

595
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:23,580
- This is bull...
- Get out of the car!

596
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:26,782
This is bullshit.

597
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:35,123
Oh, Jesus.

598
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:40,753
Joe, you know the place
I'm thinking about.

599
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:44,633
That cute little japanese place,
second and what... in the 70s?

600
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:47,172
You're my sister.
How do you know Arthur Frobisher?

601
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,842
I catered a function for
him and some businessmen.

602
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:52,302
- When?
- A few years ago.

603
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:57,391
Then a week after the event, his lawyer
called me and told me Frobisher was a
huge fan

604
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,311
and that he wanted to help
me open a restaurant.

605
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,272
Katie, why the hell didn't you tell me
that you worked for Arthur Frobisher?

606
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,953
I didn't know anything
about him at the time.

607
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,573
But then the government tried him,
and he was all over the news.

608
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:11,113
Jesus, Katie, you didn't think
that you should mention it?

609
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:13,830
By that time,
I couldn't tell you.

610
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:17,082
I'd already signed the original
confidentiality agreement.

611
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:19,013
Yeah, and now you've got some
guy who's waiting outside your...

612
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:21,423
He needs them signed today?

613
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:25,091
Oh, okay.
I'll bring them right over.

614
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,222
What's wrong?

615
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:31,473
So this function you catered,
was that in Florida?

616
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,101
Yeah, Palm Beach.
How did you know?

617
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:36,562
Katie, this whole case turns on
one weekend, and you were there.

618
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,310
Turns how?

619
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,481
Somehow Frobisher communicated with
his broker down in Palm Beach.

620
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:44,941
You must have seen something that
they didn't want you to see.

621
00:40:44,948 --> 00:40:47,363
I never even spoke
to Frobisher.

622
00:40:47,366 --> 00:40:49,950
I just cooked for the guy.
What could I possibly know?

623
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:51,453
I'm not sure.

624
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:54,411
- The government never contacted you?
- No.

625
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:58,292
So obviously I thought that their case
had absolutely nothing to do with me.

626
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,471
I have to tell Patty you were down
there. She should interview you.

627
00:41:01,507 --> 00:41:02,752
She can't.

628
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:05,132
Katie signed a
confidentiality agreement.

629
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:06,710
A judge can override that.

630
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:10,260
Wait. You want me to be a
witness against Frobisher?

631
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,261
Yes, if you know something.

632
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,263
He's my investor.

633
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:17,060
He's the only reason I have this
restaurant in the first place.

634
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:18,532
If she goes to Patty,
she's going to be screwed.

635
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,142
She will lose everything,
won't she?

636
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,020
What should I do?

637
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:30,110
I don't know.

638
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,361
Shit!

639
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,530
Andrew, yes, yes, I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.

640
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:40,252
I have to go.

641
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:42,083
So are you going to tell Patty?

642
00:41:58,437 --> 00:41:59,571
Hi, I'm here to see Ms. Hewes.

643
00:41:59,608 --> 00:42:01,483
Certainly. Lucia.

644
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,651
Esta es la mujer.

645
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:07,483
- Are you Helen?
- Uh, yeah, I guess.

646
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:10,573
Ms. Hewes had to go to Michael's school.
She waits for you.

647
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:12,780
- Oh, okay.
- Goodbye, Helen.

648
00:42:25,965 --> 00:42:28,130
You're staring at me.

649
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:32,460
Sorry.

650
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,513
What, Ellen? Speak.

651
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,350
You think I shouldn't
have fired Tom?

652
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:43,101
It's not for me to say.

653
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:47,692
This moron always
keeps me waiting.

654
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,520
You might as well sit down.

655
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,832
Is everything all right?

656
00:42:59,835 --> 00:43:02,332
He's threatening
to expel my son.

657
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:06,211
I'm sorry.

658
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:11,171
Do yourself a favor, Ellen:
Don't have kids.

659
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:16,093
I read an interview once
with a Nobel prize winner--

660
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,640
physicist, genius,
married six times.

661
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:20,721
He said, "don't have kids.

662
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:24,021
Ruins your ambition,
keeps you from what you want in life.

663
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:27,233
He said to have wives instead.

664
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:29,523
You can leave wives.

665
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:32,111
You can't leave your own kids.

666
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:34,992
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

667
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:39,492
My son came out of me
perfectly healthy--

668
00:43:39,496 --> 00:43:43,580
ten fingers, ten toes,
everything works.

669
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:46,712
I've managed to keep
him alive for 17 years,

670
00:43:46,718 --> 00:43:50,580
but I am not a good mother.

671
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,091
I'm sure you are.

672
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,513
Kids are like clients.

673
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:03,312
They want all of you,
all the time.

674
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:11,731
I mean, um, don't get me wrong,

675
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,900
I love my son.

676
00:44:15,327 --> 00:44:18,322
- Well, that's the main thing.
- No.

677
00:44:18,787 --> 00:44:20,823
Love's nothing, love's easy.

678
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,913
They come out of you,
you love them.

679
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:26,040
What you do after that
is the hard part.

680
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,633
You know what I like about you?

681
00:44:40,017 --> 00:44:42,593
There's always
something going on.

682
00:44:43,186 --> 00:44:45,762
I could see it at your
sister's wedding.

683
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:51,233
And you don't fall
for bullshit.

684
00:45:37,155 --> 00:45:39,191
Patty knows about Katie.

685
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:42,403
- You told her?
- I didn't have to.

686
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,950
I mean, think about it.

687
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:52,003
My future sister-in-law is a potential
witness in the biggest case in
Patty's career.

688
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:55,542
I mean, that's a pretty big coincidence,
isn't it?

689
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,751
You think Patty hired
you just to get to Katie?

690
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:45,800
Keep your heels down, Megan.

691
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:51,471
So, you want to know if Patty knew
about your friend before she hired you?

692
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:56,480
I know I sound paranoid,
but you're the only one I can trust.

693
00:46:56,487 --> 00:47:00,113
No, you sound, you sound smart.

694
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:02,862
What?

695
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:05,330
Patty was right about you.

696
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,822
You are a force to
be reckoned with.

697
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:11,031
In less than 2 weeks, you're
already starting to think like her.

698
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,213
Did she only hire me to
deliver her witness?

699
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:20,882
Personally, I try not to guess what
Patty Hewes does or doesn't know.

700
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,461
And what about you?

701
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,343
Me? Of course not.

702
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:28,800
Today is the first I'm
hearing about your friend.

703
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:34,932
You know, Patty didn't even know
who you were until I briefed her.

704
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,142
Then she read your resume,
met you at the wedding,

705
00:47:37,197 --> 00:47:41,652
and in ten years, I've never seen her
more excited about somebody's potential.

706
00:47:43,537 --> 00:47:45,821
That's the only reason
she hired you, Ellen.

707
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:48,533
There's no way she...

708
00:47:48,537 --> 00:47:50,131
there's no way she knew
about your friend.

709
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,240
Daddy, look at me!

710
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,911
Yeah, it's looking good,
looking good, Megan!

711
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:58,872
So... what are you going to do?

712
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:26,441
Thank you.

713
00:48:26,996 --> 00:48:29,113
- Here you go.
- Thanks, dad.

714
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:35,290
Ray, make this quick.

715
00:48:35,298 --> 00:48:37,752
I got a meeting with the
chairman of the board.

716
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:40,421
We're cooking up
something big here.

717
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:44,091
Patty Hewes has
a new associate.

718
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:45,802
So what?

719
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:47,971
I thought they voted to
accept the settlement.

720
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:51,933
I haven't gotten the call yet,
and I'm worried.

721
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:54,513
The new associate's been
talking to Katie Connor.

722
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:56,060
Who?

723
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:58,312
Our chef.

724
00:48:59,947 --> 00:49:03,773
Ray, whatever it takes...
fix this.

725
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:22,290
Saffron!

726
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:24,960
It doesn't matter what Tom said,
I don't want Katie involved.

727
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,003
David.

728
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,800
Saffron?

729
00:49:27,846 --> 00:49:30,383
- Have you heard of Vanessa Tutto?
- Who?

730
00:49:30,388 --> 00:49:31,853
The whistleblower in
that airlines case.

731
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,512
Dateline did a
whole thing on her.

732
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:35,013
Her life turned to shit.

733
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,392
Saffron?

734
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:40,730
David, if I don't tell Patty about
Katie, the clients lose the case.

735
00:49:40,738 --> 00:49:43,121
I'm not sure that you can be
totally objective about this, Ellen.

736
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:44,122
What is that supposed to mean?

737
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,611
That you'll score
points with Patty.

738
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:49,692
I would never do
any to hurt Katie.

739
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:53,992
Then just keep her out of this!

740
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,653
Did you call the ER?

741
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:32,693
Yeah, they're waiting for us.

742
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:37,070
Enough of this Katie.
Just give these guys what they want.

743
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,581
No!

744
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:41,160
Call Patty.

745
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:48,462
I want to nail Frobisher.

746
00:50:51,808 --> 00:50:53,593
You know what this means?

747
00:50:53,978 --> 00:50:56,093
They're going to keep
coming after her--

748
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:58,972
Personally, legally,
in whatever way they can.

749
00:50:58,978 --> 00:51:00,563
Katie understands.

750
00:51:00,566 --> 00:51:03,433
If Frobisher thought this would shut
her up, it's done the opposite.

751
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,140
I want to be very
clear with you, Ellen.

752
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:09,230
This is a big step.

753
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:11,232
What about the settlement?

754
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:12,281
We'll depose Katie.

755
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:15,783
If she knows something,
we'll get our clients to turn it down.

756
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:19,661
Good. I'm glad.

757
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,871
Ellen.

758
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,830
I don't take this for granted.

759
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,292
I know how hard it is for you.

760
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:33,922
Well, if katie can help the case,
then we're doing the right thing.

761
00:51:34,637 --> 00:51:38,053
I'll do everything in my
power to protect her.

762
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:39,972
Good.

763
00:52:17,225 --> 00:52:18,760
I'm worried.

764
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:21,303
I know.

765
00:52:22,937 --> 00:52:24,642
But we're in good hands.

766
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:27,733
Patty knows what she's doing.

767
00:52:38,538 --> 00:52:40,531
You find this place okay,
uncle Pete?

768
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:43,872
Hey! I miss seeing you
around the office, Tommy.

769
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:46,330
Everyone thinks you
were actually canned.

770
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:47,910
Yeah, so did I.

771
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:49,331
What's this?

772
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:51,210
A souvenir for Patty.

773
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:54,383
I'll get it to her, uncle Pete.

774
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:16,112
Maybe one of these days,
I'll stop being impressed.

775
00:53:16,785 --> 00:53:21,740
Ellen figures out why you hired her, and
you still get her to deliver
the witness.

776
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:24,702

00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:06,752
Still swears she didn't kill her fianc×™?

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:08,701
Someone tried to kill me.

4
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:10,071
Who?

5
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:12,423
Did you identify the body?

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,789
- There was no body.
- Well, that's impossible.

7
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:16,830
It's about the case.

8
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,211
The Frobisher case?

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,105
Do yourself a favor,
Ellen, don't have kids.

10
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:26,052
I think you resent me,

11
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:28,970
but that doesn't justify your behavior.

12
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,086
First seven day, your son is allowed

13
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:34,952
absolutely no contact
with the outside world.

14
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:37,827
I'd love for you to join me.

15
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:42,013
I need somebody I can trust, and you'd
make a valuable addition to the team.

16
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:45,366
Gregory Malina dumped his Frobisher
stock the exact day

17
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,933
- Arthur Frobisher did.
- We have to bring him in.

18
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,549
Tom, draft the subpoena.

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,115
Do you understand the risk I'm taking
talking to you right now?

20
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,871
Remember me from the other night?

21
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:55,094
Of course I remember you.

22
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:01,784
Your boy, Gregory Malina?

23
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:02,999
<i>Yes?</i>

24
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,137
He's in danger.

25
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:05,247
I want to talk to him.

26
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:07,303
He doesn't talk to you.
You know how it works.

27
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:10,422
- You need to leave.
- Just give me five minutes, Ray.

28
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:14,582
There's a very important lesson
to be learned from all this.

29
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,083
Trust no one.

30
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:23,708
Someone's covering it up.

31
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,020
Who?

32
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:28,037
The police searched Patty's apartment,

33
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:31,985
and there was no one there
and no signs of a struggle.

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,069
But I'm telling you the truth.

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,093
Okay, then let's start
with what you know.

36
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:46,909
David and I had a....

37
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,004
Ellen, talk to me.

38
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,091
Take your time.

39
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:02,261
David and I had a fight.

40
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:10,289
So I stayed at Patty's apartment.

41
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:14,167
That's when the man attacked me.

42
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:19,475
She told me she was going away
for the weekend.

43
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:26,750
I'd never seen him before.

44
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:30,666
I don't know who he was.

45

46
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,117
I couldn't trust anyone.

47
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:47,582
I didn't know what I was doing.

48
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,250
I knew.

49
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:55,071
I knew I had to find David.

50
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:06,884
If you want to help me,
you've got to find Patty Hewes.

I said not so heavy.

56
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,321
I think you need more foundation.

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,440
I was hoping we'd have a chance
to talk before the taping.

That will be fine, thanks.

60
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:19,065
I don't know, Ray, I think
you went a little light.

61
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:22,319
I mean, you and I, we both
have these deep set eyes.

62

If I don't get a little color on me,
I look like a vampire.

63
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,083
How much sleep do you get, Ray?

64
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:32,383
Why you ask?

65
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:35,045
I'd say I've been getting about...

66
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:38,182
five hours for the last two decades.

67
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,902
Sounds about right.

68
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,729
What did you have on your mind?

69
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,260
Gregory Malina.

70
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,000
- Gregory who?
- Don't bother, Ray.

71
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:54,242
No bother at all.

72
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:56,238
So, are you guys making nice in here?

73
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,876
Well, I know I am.

74
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,889
Thank you both for coming, and,
let's have some fun out there.

75
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,471
Great.

76
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,939
Try a little bronzer, Ray.

77
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:12,462
If anything happens to Mr. Malina
before I can depose him.

78
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,854
I'm going to hold you
personally responsible.

79
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:20,076
What kind of man do you think I am?

80
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:57,940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay?

81
00:06:57,941 --> 00:06:59,533
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

82
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,431
It's okay. Yeah, I'm all right.
Thank you.

83
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:03,727
Gregory Malina?

84
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:05,579
Yeah. How...

85
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,431
You've been served. Good luck.

86
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,469
Excuse me.

87
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,826
I was wondering.
Is it okay if I park there?

88
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:46,095
Jesus, Ray. Knock.

89
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:51,187
Thought it was best not
to attract attention.

90
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,619
Accommodations okay?

91
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,623
Your boss is worth billions,
you stick me in this shithole.

92
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:03,913
Can't even get ESPN.

93
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,893
If you hadn't strayed
from the last place,

94
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,301
- I wouldn't have had to stick you here.
- I need air, Ray.

95
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:10,007
I can't stay inside all day.

96
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,249
I've filed a motion
to quash the subpoena.

97
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,333
When I win it, you'll be in the clear.

98
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,005
I just need to know one thing.

99
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,907
Did you ever tell anyone

100
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:25,778
about the stock sale?

101
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,000
I mean anyone, Gregory?

102
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,064
No. No one.

103
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,106
All right, then.

104
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,363
Wait, that's it? You're leaving?

105
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,595
Why, Gregory?

106
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,642
You want me to stay?

107
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:49,097
Don't start with that shit, okay, Ray.

108
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,471
I'm just checking on you.

109
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:55,211
I shouldn't even be here.

110
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,837
You got any money for the snack machine?

111
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,796
I was told you don't medicate.

112
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:16,057
That's right.
Not without parental consent.

113
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:18,544
Well, why aren't they speaking?

114
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:21,375
We require at least three
hours a day of silence.

115
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,705
It's important that they
turn their thoughts inward.

116
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,014
Do you think Michael's
ready to come home?

117
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:31,425
No. That's up to you.

118
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:34,044
But we operate on a
month-to- month basis, so.

119
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,815
So you need a decision.

120
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:39,585
It's hard, I know, but you're going
to get a much better idea

121
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:40,770
after you talk to your son.

122
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:45,068
Certainly is quiet here.

123
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,269
Yeah, that's the way we like it.

124
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,058
No music, no video games, no computers.

125
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:52,568
And you say Michael has
adjusted to all this?

126
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:53,569
Absolutely.

127
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:57,011
I mean, don't get me wrong, he's far
from perfect, but he's a good kid.

128
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:58,347
He's made a lot of progress.

129
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:02,838
I think sending your boy here may
have been a wake-up call he needed.

130
00:10:03,514 --> 00:10:04,514
I hope so.

131
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,825
Do you think Patty has
something to do with this?

132
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:25,070
She is the only one who knew
I was staying in her apartment.

133
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:29,947
You were right.

134
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,767
I was playing games with you.

135
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,401
I was very angry, and I was acting out.

136
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,366
Acting out?

137
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:40,755
You sent me a hand grenade and
almost killed your stepfather.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,032
It was a prank.

139
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,332
It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

140
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:54,062
Are you eating?Is the food terrible?

141
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:56,391
It's fine.

142
00:10:58,517 --> 00:10:59,714
They treating you okay?

143
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:02,365
They treat me the way
I deserve to be treated.

144
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,451
What does that mean?

145
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,897
I brought this on myself.
I'm responsible for my own actions.

146
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,572
- Well, I have a decision to make.
- I know.

147
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:16,325
The end of the month is coming,

148
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,415
and you need to decide
if you want to keep me here.

149
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:26,246
And?

150
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:30,947
I want you to come home.

151
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,097
I think that would be a mistake.

152
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:36,865
Why?

153
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:38,316
Because I like it here.

154
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:40,826
Life is simple, no distractions.

155
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:45,835
Michael, this isn't you.

156
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,673
Well, that was the point, wasn't it?

157
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,263
To change me?

158
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,978
Your behavior, not you.

159
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,216
I didn't send you here
to become someone else.

160
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,883
You sent me here to prove a point.

161
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,562
That you're in control,

162
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,687
that you dominate, that,

163
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,217
no matter what, you'll always win.

164
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:01,847
And you're right, mom, you will.

165
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,948
I've finally realized that.

166
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,056
I don't want to win anything.

167
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:08,067
Sure you do,

168
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:09,871
and I'm okay with that now.

169
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:14,181
Getting away from you was the best
thing that could've happened to me.

170
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:16,263
It gave me clarity.

171
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:18,720
Did it?

172
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,431
You wanted to completely
control of my life.

173
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:25,684
so you took away my free will.

174
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,247
Some pretty terrific parenting,

175
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:30,544
real mother-of-the-year type stuff.

176
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:34,571
And I'm glad you did it,
because I like it here.

177
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:37,936
No, you don't.

178
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:48,089
You're coming home.

179
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,460
I'm not going anywhere.

180
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,682
I've tried to contact her.
No one seems to know where she is.

181
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:19,073
I'm in conference with my client.

182
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,639
Your client's fingerprints
are over the murder weapon.

183
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,783
You had no grounds to
take her fingerprints.

184
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,520
We didn't have to,
the State already did.

185
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,813
Her application to the bar.

186
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:31,264
We found her prints in her
fianc×™'s blood on the murder weapon.

187
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:34,070
Ellen Parsons, you're under arrest
for the murder of David Connor.

188
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,396
You have the right to remain silent.

189
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:40,017
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

190
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,887
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

191
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,920
and have an attorney
present for any questioning.

192
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,021
<i>From me? Around me? Are you crazy?</i>

193
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:28,223
<i>I think it was more you.</i>

194
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:31,657
<i>No, it was definitely.
My side should be in my pocket.</i>

195
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:36,309
I'll just go grab my stuff.

196
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:38,039
I'll meet you down there in ten minutes?

197
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
- Cool.
- All right.

198
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:46,587
Heading out?

199
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:51,396
We may have some
useful background on Gregory.

200
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:53,576
The manager at his old
restaurant is willing to talk.

201
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:56,178
And Tom asked you to go along?

202
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:58,819
He thought it made sense because
I've met Gregory before,

203
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,254
but if you need me to stay here.

204
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:02,078
No. No, that's smart.

205
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:06,052
We need everything we can
get to fight Fiske's motion.

206
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,102
Is this a...

207
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:16,378
hydrangea?

208
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:19,303
My mother gave it to me.

209
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:24,648
You and Tom have...

210
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:28,255
really picked up from where
you left off before

211
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:30,409
he was fired, haven't you?

212
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,916
Tom and I have always gotten along.

213
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:34,874
Do you think he's...

214
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,273
fully committed to working here again?

215
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,233
As far as I can tell.

216
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:44,062
How often do you water this?

217
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:48,424
Not often, as you can see.
I don't have much of a green thumb.

218
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,000
Has Tom ever...

219
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,293
approached you outside the office?

220
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:58,571
Yeah. A few times.

221
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:02,558
You know, a few weeks ago, he was
thinking of starting his own firm.

222
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:04,031
I heard.

223
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:08,181
He was very angry with me.

224
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:11,366
Well, he hasn't mentioned anything.

225
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:16,587
I hope he didn't try to hire you.

226
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,107
Should I be offended?

227
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:27,420
Good luck at the restaurant.

228
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:34,406
Keep an eye on Tom for me, will you?

229
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:37,349
Let me know how he's doing.

230
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:41,325
I should've told her the truth?

231
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:42,412
What else did Patty say?

232
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:45,021
Nothing, she just asked
if you tried to hire me.

233
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,335
Out of the blue like that?

234
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:47,805
Basically.

235
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,512
- Jesus, Ellen, Patty knows.
- What?

236
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,340
Why else would she ask?

237
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:54,349
How can she? Unless you told her.

238
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,355
I didn't.

239
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,770
So then we're fine, right?

240
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:59,159
You didn't mention it to anyone?

241
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:02,159
- Not Andrew or Felicia or...
- No!

242
00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:03,718
Tom, I swear, I didn't.

243
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,063
I'm sorry if I screwed up.

244
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:12,916
No. No, you didn't.
We'll be fine. We're fine.

245
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,215
Come on, let's go.
The manager's waiting.

246
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,618
It's been years,

247
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,791
but I had this favorite little haunt

248
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,421
just off Plaza de la Revoluci×¢n.

249
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:26,525
Hola, muchacho.

250
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:29,806
Thank you, Hevelio.

251
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,064
I would appreciate
a little more discretion.

252
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,728
Where's Gregory?

253
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:36,918
You really think
I'm gonna tell you that?

254
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:38,758
- I think you should.
- You listen to me.

255
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:42,156
You are out of your goddamned mind,
going after him like that.

256
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:44,040
What are you getting all excited about?

257
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:48,060
I work for Art, not you,
and you're making a big mistake.

258
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,448
We are not animals. There are limits.

259
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,129
Gregory's a liability.
He's lost his nerve.

260
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:55,156
He's a liability?

261
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,855
Do you have any idea
the kind of scrutiny

262
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,785
we'll be under if anything
happens to that boy?

263
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:01,416
You are gonna bring us all
down with this commando shit.

264
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,360
I am not going to let your young

265
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,250
friend sit across a table
from Patty Hewes

266
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,548
and face an inquisition.

267
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:08,739
He won't have to.

268
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:11,174
I've filed a motion
to quash the subpoena.

269
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,471
We do have legal
options available to us.

270
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,188
And what if you can't quash it?

271
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:21,565
What does list do?

272
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,510
That list is for programs that
you've already recorded.

273
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:25,574
What are you trying to do?

274
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,649
I want to record Greta tomorrow night.

275
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,231
What? What happened?

276
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:34,739
I just deleted your Wild Kingdom.

277
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,958
You what? The one about the baboons?

278
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,003
Haven't you watched that?

279
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:40,088
No, I haven't. Never mind.

280
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,825
They always replay that stuff.

281
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,759
So tell me, what did you
think about the school?

282
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:49,455
It was like a cult compound.
All the kids looked like zombies.

283
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:51,316
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't go with you.

284
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,693
What am I doing here?

285
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,080
Pick programs to record.

286
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,354
- You want me to do it?
- I can do it.

287
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,736
But Michael is okay?

288
00:18:58,946 --> 00:18:59,946
I don't know.

289
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:02,757
He is who he is.
He isn't like other kids.

290
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,597
No? What's he like?

291
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:08,507
He's like me, he knows the place is
bullshit. He doesn't belong there.

292
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:10,872
So do we bring him back home?

293
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:15,003
- Let me do that.
- No! I can do it.

294
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:16,632
- Patty.
- Fine.

295
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
You do it.

296
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,006
There.

297
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:27,427
You know,

298
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,719
if he says he wants to stay,

299
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:32,732
maybe we should listen to him.

300
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:42,180
Your Honor, Gregory
Malina was in Palm Beach

301
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:43,791
with Katie Connor

302
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,081
on june 18, 2002.

303
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:49,318
Katie Connor, who perjured
herself at her own deposition.

304
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,939
Because Gregory Malina fed her a lie.

305
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,374
Really? And you have, what, an
audio recording of this?

306
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,719
Or videotape?

307
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,127
Mr. Malina suborning

308
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:00,973
perjury is not relevant
to this case, Ms. Hewes.

309
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:03,839
Your Honor, it's a clear indication that

310
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,646
Gregory Malina was a functionary
in Arthur Frobisher's conspiracy

311
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:10,164
to defraud his employees
and shareholders.

312
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,772
You have no proof of that.

313
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:13,848
Your honor, Miss Hewes is claim
of relevance

314
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,764
is based solely on a vacation

315
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:18,046
Mr. Malina took to Palm Beach.

316
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:20,852
My mother-in-law has a time-share
in Sarasota.

317
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,868
Perhaps Miss Hewes would like
to subpoena her.

318
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:24,842
We've also spoken to the manager

319
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:28,041
of the restaurant
where Gregory Malina worked in 2002.

320
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,017
He will testify that a wealthy patron
paid Mr. Malina

321
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:34,573
a huge sum of money
to go down to Florida.

322
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,403
And who was this patron?

323
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,481
I don't know, I'd like
a chance to find out.

324
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:41,295
This is nothing but hearsay.

325
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:42,296
Perhaps.

326
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,093
What's not hearsay...

327
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,758
is that Mr. Malina sold over

328
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,055
1 000 shares of Frobisher stock

329
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:53,040
the very same morning that
Arthur Frobisher dumped his.

330
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,378
You have documentation?

331
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:57,901
Yes, your Honor.

332
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,916
I would very much like to know how

333
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:13,895
Miss Hewes came upon this information.

334
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:16,309
You know I'm not required
to disclose that, Ray.

335
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,089
The subpoena stands.

336
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:23,653
And regarding your request, Miss Hewes,

337
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:26,797
to expedite Mr. Malina's deposition...

338
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,024
I'm going to go ahead and grant it.

339
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,512
Thank you, your Honor.

340
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:31,915
Call the next case, please.

341
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:58,778
Your lawyer's here.

342
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,530
Ellen, I'm so sorry.

343
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:11,220
I came as soon as I could.

344
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:14,043
Hollis Nye said you wanted to see me.

345
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:19,078
Tell me everything.
What happened to David?

346
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,668
You're the only one I can trust.

347
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:33,794
Deposition?

348
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:36,022
Nothing but. T minus what now?

349
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,058
27 hours, 14 minutes.

350
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,449
I need seconds, damn it! Seconds!

351
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,721
What's wrong?

352
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,010
I think we should talk to Patty.

353
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,637
Together.

354
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:54,516
What do you think?

355
00:22:54,777 --> 00:22:55,777
Honestly?

356
00:22:57,684 --> 00:22:59,560
Extraordinarily stupid idea.

357
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,541
Why?

358
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:04,807
Conscience is a liability, Ellen.

359
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,927
You feel guilty, you unburden
yourself, what happens?

360
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,658
You feel better, but the
people you're coming clean to?

361
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,014
Trust me.

362
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,747
Maintaining the illusion of loyalty

363
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,003
is far more effective
than admitting the breach.

364
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,862
Nice. Admitting the breach.

365
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:23,349
I like that.

366
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:25,468
What are you two talking about?

367
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,691
Fiduciary ethics.

368
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:30,390
Gregory Malina's stock sale.

369
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:40,212
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

370
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:58,003
Sorry to interrupt.

371
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,019
That's all right.

372
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:01,599
Ellen, there's something
I need you to address.

373
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:06,059
Can I trust your total discretion?

374
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,557
Of course.

375
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:12,071
I'd normally give this to Tom,
but I think you can handle it.

376
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:14,441
What do you need?

377
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:42,737
What is it?

378
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,060
You said we needed to talk, Ray.

379
00:24:56,844 --> 00:24:58,141
Not a bad view.

380
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:03,429
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know.
I've been staying away from the windows.

381
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:07,444
New York City.

382
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,735
I ever tell you what happened the week
after I moved here?

383
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:15,687
Blackout, right?

384
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,278
Well, what do you know about that?

385
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:23,482
Young Gregory actually listened
to me every once in a while.

386
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:26,987
Yeah, well, you told me some
pretty interesting stories.

387
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:30,087
It was a different city then.

388
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,328
The Mayor Beame years.

389
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:37,398
Porn in Times Square, pickpockets.

390
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,447
Seems almost quaint now.

391
00:25:42,555 --> 00:25:45,054
They say Giuliani cleaned
everything up, but...

392
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:49,935
someone will always find a
new way to cut your throat.

393
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,527
Is that why you came here, Ray?

394
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:54,638
Tell me a history lesson?

395
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,348
You need to disappear.

396
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:04,544
What are you talking about?

397
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:08,661
I couldn't kill the subpoena.

398
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:15,414
So I'll lie.

399
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:18,207
Look, I just want to get this over with.

400
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,634
That won't work anymore.

401
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:22,824
Patty Hewes knows about your stock sale.

402
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,307
I didn't tell anybody anything.

403
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,864
Whether you did or didn't makes
no matter now, she knows,

404
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,085
and there's no way around it.

405
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,962
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:41,424
Like you really give
a shit about me, Ray.

407
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:45,468
It makes no sense, and I'm embarrassed
to admit it,

408
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,685
but I do actually.

409
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:55,020
So why don't you

410
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,237
do me a favor,

411
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,410
and get the hell out of here.

412
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:01,937
Where am I supposed to go, Ray?

413
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:04,759
You're young yet.
You can still start over.

414
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,429
I almost envy you the opportunity.

415
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,181
You envy me?

416
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,940
You reach a certain point in life,

417
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:16,332
and it's too late to change.

418
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:19,926
You still have time.

419
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,575
I don't know why I
believed you would help me.

420
00:27:24,836 --> 00:27:26,096
I should've seen it.

421
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:28,080
Seen what?

422
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,014
That your whole life is a lie.

423
00:27:43,522 --> 00:27:45,094
Maybe I'll stay.

424
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,157
Tell the truth.

425
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,762
That would not be wise.

426
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:03,075
I cannot protect you anymore, Gregory.

427
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:15,888
Just leave.

428
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:34,920
Looks like our boy, Gregory
Malina, is gonna be deposed after all.

429
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,362
Make sure it doesn't
get screwed up this time.

430
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:42,793
I'll do it myself.

431
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,086
Get out of here.

432
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:53,088
- Tom, can I...
- Not now, Ellen, not now.

433
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:02,639
I should've just told her the truth.

434
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,026
Why didn't you?

435
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:07,025
It was instinct.
I was protecting Tom,

436
00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:08,856
or trying to.

437
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:12,508
Well, you said that he's
always been good to you.

438
00:29:12,678 --> 00:29:14,285
Why wouldn't you want to protect him?

439
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,165
Because you should never assume that
your boss knows less than you do.

440
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:20,173
And now if tom goes to Patty and
tells her that I lied,

441
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:22,141
then I'm totally exposed.

442
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,014
No, he'd be hanging himself.

443
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,317
Why would he do that?

444
00:29:26,318 --> 00:29:27,560
To protect himself.

445
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:29,648
If tom thinks that
I can't keep a secret,

446
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:31,466
he's going to want
to get to Patty first.

447
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,242
Wait, back up.

448
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:34,698
Why would...

449
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,568
Patty care if Tom tried to hire you?

450
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,948
Who knows?

451
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:41,305
Patty said to keep an eye on Tom.

452
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:43,929
Then she specifically
pulled me out of his office

453
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,077
and gave me a job that she
would normally give to him.

454
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:49,024
That's weird.

455
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:52,005
It's like she doesn't want me
and Tom to trust each other.

456
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:54,488
She's driving a wedge between us.

457
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:57,088
You know, I think you
may be losing your mind.

458
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:58,538
The worst part about it...

459
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,670
is whatever she's doing,
it's working.

460
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,789
Tom wouldn't even look
me in the eye today.

461
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:05,262
Everything I did, I felt
like I was trying too hard.

462
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,320
Wait, this is crazy.

463
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:09,533
Ellen, Patty's doing this, Tom's
doing that. What do you want to do?

464
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:12,063
It's not about me.

465
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:16,533
I have never seen you like this.

466
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:19,537
Just keep it simple, okay?

467
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:22,243
You'll feel better if
you tell Patty the truth.

468
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:23,418
If I do,

469
00:30:23,474 --> 00:30:25,796
Tom will be pissed,
and I need his support.

470
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,094
And then if I don't, and Patty finds out.

471
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:31,213
Just make up your mind, Ellen.

472
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:34,849
You want to play head games like these
people, or do you want to be yourself?

473
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:12,023
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

474
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,074
God damn it.

475
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:18,270
Shit.

476
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:25,813
Ah, it's good to meet you, Gregory.

477
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:28,077
Patty Hewes.

478
00:31:29,484 --> 00:31:31,041
I know who you are.

479
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,046
- That guy...
- Has been protecting you.

480
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:40,086
I imagine you're very
confused right now.

481
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:43,820
A lot of people are
making promises to you.

482
00:31:44,515 --> 00:31:47,778
But trust me, Gregory, I am the
only one looking out for you.

483
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,859
Yeah?

484
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:53,065
What about after I'm deposed?

485
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:57,072
I know how these things go.

486
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:00,890
You'll get what you need from me,
and then you'll toss me aside.

487
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,010
We've been keeping you safe,

488
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:04,950
and we'll continue to do so.

489
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:08,736
Arthur Frobisher's not the
only one with resources.

490
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:11,828
Gregory,

491
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:14,658
you're not a bad guy.

492
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,055
The people that you are protecting?

493
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,023
They are bad.

494
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:23,085
They have ruined people's
lives, including Katie Connor's.

495
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:24,662
Look, I...

496
00:32:24,663 --> 00:32:26,951
I never wanted that to happen.

497
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,096
Well...

498
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,845
this is your chance to make amends.

499
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:35,086
You think Katie's the only one?

500
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:39,539
There are 5, 000 people
who lost everything.

501
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,059
They deserve justice.

502
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:42,973
And believe it or not,

503
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,188
you're the only one
who can get it for them.

504
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:50,682
It's time to do the right thing.

505
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:53,465
Malcolm will escort
you to the deposition.

506
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:56,589
All you need to do is show up.

507
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,363
and tell the truth.

508
00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:05,089
Documents are all here.

509
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,009
Signature papers are flagged.

510
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:10,502
Tell Tom I'll be back in
time for Gregory's deposition.

511
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:12,293
Where should I tell him you're going?

512
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:13,647
You'll think of something.

513
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:17,070
Miss Hewes?

514
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,615
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

515
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:26,427
I appreciate your concern,

516
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:28,723
but I think it's necessary.

517
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,898
This is just between the two of us.

518
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:38,254
Of course.

519
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:43,979
Wait, so you can't
tell me where she went?

520
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,240
Or she told you not to tell me?

521
00:33:46,518 --> 00:33:48,001
Tom, it's a personal thing for her.

522
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:50,818
Patty said it wasn't important
enough for you to worry about.

523
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:53,708
Not important enough.
Those are the words she used?

524
00:33:54,473 --> 00:33:56,024
Yeah, I think.

525
00:33:56,305 --> 00:33:57,853
Don't.

526
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,321
Don't spin it for me.

527
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:01,393
What words did she use, exactly?

528
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:02,412
Look...

529
00:34:02,464 --> 00:34:05,001
when Patty gets back, why
don't you just talk to her about it?

530
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,408
You said yourself you never
try to guess what's in her head.

531
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:08,569
Right.

532
00:34:10,157 --> 00:34:12,040
I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

533
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:16,323
Forget about it.

534
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,041
Did you want me to lie?

535
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,295
I could have told you she had a doctor's
appointment, or made something up.

536
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:23,021
No, honestly, don't worry about it.

537
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,880
You know me.

538
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,598
I am not playing games.

539
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,555
No, you're doing the right
thing. You're a good soldier.

540
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:30,843
You're following your orders.
It's great.

541
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:32,088
Don't worry about it, honestly.

542
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:59,078
What are you writing?

543
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:01,476
A journal.

544
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:04,057
They make us write our
thoughts down every day.

545
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:07,038
I'd like to read that sometime.

546
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,093
It's private.

547
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:13,407
Any thoughts about me in there?

548
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:17,138
Next time you rummage through my private
stuff, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

549
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:22,429
We need to decide.

550
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,092
I already did.

551
00:35:24,243 --> 00:35:25,168
I'm staying.

552
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:26,634
I'm not paying for you to stay here.

553
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:28,193
Well, I'm not going back with you.

554
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:30,070
If you won't pay,

555
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:31,819
then I'll just go somewhere else.

556
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,805
Where?

557
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,924
I don't know.
But I'm not coming home.

558
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,061
All right.

559
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,082
Then I've brought you something.

560
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,864
What's that?

561
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:47,551
Emancipation papers.

562
00:35:48,176 --> 00:35:50,828
Signed and notarized.
All they need is your signature,

563
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,211
and you're free.

564
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,049
Emancipation papers?

565
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,093
A full parental divorce.

566
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,717
I've also included a form
to release your college fund,

567
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:06,124
so if you want to stay here, you
can pay for it yourself.

568
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:10,603
I'm tired of fighting you, Michael.

569
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:14,641
You sign these papers, and
you're officially on your own.

570
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:16,651
You want control?

571
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:18,646
You've got it.

572
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,848
You win.

573
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:27,043
I've tried it my way.

574
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,075
Let's try yours.

575
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,641
<i>This is Gregory. Leave a message.</i>

576
00:36:43,698 --> 00:36:46,068
Good.
Don't answer the phone.

577
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:49,658
Take care of yourself.

578
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:57,004
We on schedule?

579
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:59,182
- Haven't heard otherwise.
- Deposition's at 10:00.

580
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,373
And Gregory?

581
00:37:00,374 --> 00:37:01,781
We've got eyes on him.

582
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,751
Looking sharp.

583
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,025
You sure you can get
me out of here okay?

584
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,227
We'll be fine.

585
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,069
I just realized.

586
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:21,318
I never thanked you for saving my life.

587
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:24,055
I don't know what you're talking about.

588
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:26,727
Right.

589
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:29,871
Anyway,

590
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:32,539
you should thank Patty Hewes.

591
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,074
I will.

592
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,409
- Ray.
- Patty.

593
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:49,880
So, would you care for coffee, tea?

594
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,453
No, I'm good. Thank you.

595
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:56,692
You ever been deposed?

596
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,444
Easiest thing in the world.

597
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,160
All you gotta do is tell the truth.

598
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,316
After five years, that will be a relief.

599
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:05,097
We gotta go.

600
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:08,026
Shit, my watch.

601
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:18,669
Are you ready to go?

602
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:52,897
I think your witness

603
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,742
has other priorities.

604
00:39:13,672 --> 00:39:17,073
Gentlemen, i'm afraid we're going to
have to reschedule for another day.

605
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:20,052
Excuse me.

606
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:32,921
<i>I don't know what to say. I lost him.</i>

607
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:34,071
Then find him.

608
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:40,541
God dam it!

609
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,056
Can we clear the air, please?

610
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:05,385
Not now.
This Gregory thing is a disaster.

611
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:06,756
We really need to talk.

612
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:08,088
We need to work.

613
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,911
Tom, this is bullshit.

614
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:12,620
Get out of my office.

615
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,027
We need each other.

616
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:16,874
From day one you've had my back.

617
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,650
You're the only reason
I have a job here.

618
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:21,022
I would never do
anything to bet Ray that.

619
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:23,826
Did you tell Patty that
I tried to hire you?

620
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,780
No, I didn't. I already told you that.

621
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:27,393
I wouldn't lie about
something like that.

622
00:40:27,394 --> 00:40:28,759
Yeah, but since then.

623
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,323
No, I didn't.

624
00:40:30,651 --> 00:40:31,674
Did you?

625
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:33,654
You know the answer to
that of course not.

626
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:36,008
We need to make a decision right now.

627
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:38,482
We're either gonna trust
each other, or we're not.

628
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:40,391
There's no in between.

629
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:56,088
You're absolutely right.

630
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,737
Well, you can trust me.

631
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:04,719
Can I trust you?

632
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:10,617
100%.

633
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,656
I need you to find Patty.

634
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,719
Nobody knows where she is.

635
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,831
But you always know where to find her.

636
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:26,690
That's why I think she...
she doesn't want to be found.

637
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:28,535
Yeah, but why?

638
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:33,077
I don't know, but Fiske really,
really got to her.

639
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:40,042
It sounds like you were
the last person to see her.

640
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:44,046
Help me.

641
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:47,028
Ellen, I'm not a defense attorney.

642
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:50,005
But Hollis Nye used to be
one of the best in the city.

643
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:53,053
Please, Tom.
I need your help.

644
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,429
I'll do anything i can for you.

645
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,003
I've been thinking about
it, and I feel as though I...

646
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:08,687
I need to be honest with you.

647
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:13,000
when I was thinking
about going out on my own,

648
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:16,505
<i>I asked Ellen to come and work with me.</i>

649
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:21,901
<i>Thank you, Tom. I appreciate that.</i>

650
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,834
Ellen doesn't need to know
about this conversation.

651
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,035
Keep an eye on her.

652
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,051
Let me know how she's doing.

653
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,248
<i>I'm not here for myself.</i>

654
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:39,413
<i>I'm here as a spokesperson
for 5, 000 victims</i>

655
00:42:39,414 --> 00:42:41,121
<i>of Arthur Frobisher's greed.</i>

656
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:42,379
<i>Care to respond?</i>

657
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:46,021
<i>Greta, this is simply class warfare,</i>

658
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,053
<i>a crass attempt by Miss Hewes
to extort as much money</i>

659
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:51,087
Phil, is that you?

660
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:54,865
<i>The extortionist here
is Arthur Frobisher.</i>

661
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:56,552
<i>He milked his company dry.</i>

662
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:59,532
<i>Not according to
the 12 upstanding citizens</i>

663
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:02,444
<i>who exonerated my client
after that witch</i>

664
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,026
Well,

665
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,953
hello.

666
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:11,566
Hey.

667
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:28,039
Welcome home.

668
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:36,174
Hungry?

669
00:43:37,038 --> 00:43:38,638
Starving.

670
00:43:39,002 --> 00:43:40,401
You want a sandwich?

671
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,045
I'll make you a sandwich.

672
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,820
<i>Doesn't matter when you
don't have the evidence.</i>

673
00:43:50,613 --> 00:43:53,537
<i>Nor does it matter when the
accused is guilty as sin.</i>

674
00:43:53,538 --> 00:43:55,588
<i>Mr. Fiske, why isn't this case settled?</i>

675
00:43:56,162 --> 00:43:58,468
<i>You'll have to address
that question to Mis Hewes.</i>

676
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,411
<i>My client has tried to be
reasonable, but he was rebuffed.</i>

677
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,960
<i>Mr. Frobisher tried to get off
cheap,</i>

678
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,753
- <i>and we respectfully declined.</i>
- How's the case going?

679
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:13,044
Great.
It's going great.

680
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:15,023
<i>They want their day in court.</i>

681
00:44:15,308 --> 00:44:18,409
<i>And when I've lined up
my witnesses and my evidence</i>

682
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:19,816
<i>in front of a jury,</i>

683
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:22,030
<i>the facts will speak for themselves.</i>

684
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,047
Hey, it's me. I just saw Ellen.

685
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,077
You better not come back here, Patty.

686
00:44:34,316 --> 00:44:37,019
Mr. Nye, Tom just left.

687
00:44:38,365 --> 00:44:40,866
He's full of shit. Stay on him.

688
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,057
He'll lead you to Patty.

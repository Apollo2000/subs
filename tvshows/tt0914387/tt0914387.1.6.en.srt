2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:07,987
Pulling the settlement now is a move
wherein tremendous risk...

3
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:09,666
This is my legacy.

4
00:00:10,437 --> 00:00:11,615
I want my name back.

5
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,107
I want redemption.

6
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:16,194
I met a guy down in Florida.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,104
Gregory turns out
to be our missing link.

8
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,551
Gregory Malina dumped
his Frobisher stock

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,944
the exact day Arthur Frobisher did.

10
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,777
I burned her as a witness.

11
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:26,124
It's done.

12
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,551
Do you hear me? I'm done!

13
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,828
Patty Hewes will be looking
to depose you.

14
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:32,741
- How's it all been going?
- Great. We had our first fight.

15
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:36,332
The last thing I want is for my job
to come between us.

16
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,538
I heard you telling that other doctor
that you were gonna go see a movie?

17
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:43,992
I want you to know that we are doing
everything that we can

18
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,767
to make your grandfather comfortable.

19
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:47,904
I know. Thanks.

20
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:49,609
I'm not available.

21
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,611
I... I'm engaged.

22
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:55,891
We can... play this any way you'd like.

23
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,716
There won't be room for him and Patty.

24
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:02,726
With Patty Hewes, there's only... Patty.

26
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,427
I didn't kill, David.

27
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,960
Someone tried to kill me.

28
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:33,178
But, Ellen, there was no other body
in your apartment.

29
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:35,995
I wasn't in my apartment.

30
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:57,694
Did you identify the body?

31
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,549
- There was no body.
- Miss***.

32
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:02,710
Well, that's impossible.

33
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:08,556
There are things that I...

34
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,049
I can't talk about.

35
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:13,086
Why not?

36
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,371
It's about the case.

37
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,142
The Frobisher case?

38
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:27,836
3 1/2 MONTHS EARLIER ***

39
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:29,739
Is this seat taken?

40
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,225
No, no. Go ahead.

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,627
What happened to your face?

42
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,424
Consulting, you know.

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,646
It's a contact sport.

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,675
My friend dated a consultant.

45
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,495
Major heartbreak.

46
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:47,048
Sorry to hear that.

47
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,436
He lied to her,

48
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,278
pretended he was married.

49
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,300
Made up some shit about a guy
in a limousine.

50
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,279
I'm here alone, Gregory.

51
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,250
So, what, you're
Katie's lawyer friend, right?

52
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,870
She asked me to come talk to you guys.

53
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,220
Why didn't you?

54
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:12,585
'Cause I didn't know anything
about your case.

55
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:16,871
How is Katie?

56
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,081
I liked her.

57
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,454
Is that why you lied to her,

58
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:21,904
humiliated her and got her
to perjure herself?

59
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,988
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

60
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,807
Katie thinks someone put you up to this.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,701
Given the shape your face is in,
maybe she's right.

62
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,865
Who's pulling your strings, Gregory?

63
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:36,697
Nobody. Is Patty Hewes pulling yours?

64
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:38,187
Patty doesn't know I'm here.

65
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,399
Bullshit.

66
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:42,701
If she did, you'd be holding a subpoena
or facing criminal charges.

67
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,357
For what?

68
00:03:45,364 --> 00:03:48,357
Obstruction of justice,
conspiracy to cover up a felony.

69
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,521
You know, if you're lucky,
that's ten years.

70
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,103
You people are amazing.

71
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,334
Just give me a name, Gregory.
I'll keep you out of this.

72
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:00,490
So when I give you a name,
you won't come after me?

73
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,915
Not if you give us a bigger fish.

74
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,446
Barney.

75
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,803
What's his last name?

76
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:11,306
Rubble.

77
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,269
Lives in Bedrock. Hell of a right hook.

78
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,754
You got 24 hours.

79
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:21,102
Till what?

80
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,806
Until Patty Hewes finds out about you.

81
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:28,413
And once that happens, we subpoena you,
and we do it the hard way.

85
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:19,470
Do you think Gregory believed you?

86
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,596
I don't know. He's kind of a mess.

87
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:23,695
You mentioned Katie.

88
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:24,986
Yeah.

89
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:26,223
But he's pretty hard to read.

90
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:28,849
He kept acting like
he was being watched,

91
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:30,725
and he may have reason to be paranoid.

92
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,017
What makes you say that?

93
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,101
He had a bruise on his face.

94
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,799
Looked like he'd been in a fight.

95
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:37,107
Really?

96
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,682
I don't understand why
we haven't just subpoenaed him.

97
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:44,287
Well, it would be better
if he came in willingly.

98
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,139
If we subpoena him, he could clam up.

99
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,779
Do you think he'll talk to us?

100
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,819
I think he's scared,

101
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:52,652
and I think he may feel guilty
about what he did to Katie.

102
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,071
What about you?

103
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:57,395
What do you mean?

104
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:00,427
This was a big step.

105
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,587
Approaching a witness...

106
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:04,748
under false pretenses...

107
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,700
offering protection you can't provide.

108
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:09,938
Don't they teach that in law school?

109
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,156
So now what?

110
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:18,404
You don't hear from Gregory in 24 hours,
we subpoena him.

111
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:20,487
And in the meantime?

112
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:22,895
Dinner,

113
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:25,477
8:00 tomorrow night, my apartment.

114
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,310
Don't be late.

115
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,628
So let her subpoena you.

116
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,902
You knew this might happen.

117
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,024
All you've got to do is tell the truth.

118
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,857
Just leave out a few details.

119
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,879
Here.

120
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,271
What were you doing in Florida?

121
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,796
Vacationing.

122
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,263
Why was the apartment in your name?

123
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,346
I rented it with some friends.

124
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:45,443
What about your job?

125
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:49,150
Applied for a training program,
discovered I had a knack for consulting.

126
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:50,169
So what's the problem?

127
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:53,795
Something you want to say?

128
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:55,802
I want to talk to him.

129
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,532
He doesn't talk to you.
You know how it works.

130
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:01,322
Look, he's the whole reason
I got pulled into this thing.

131
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,767
I'm tired of protecting him.
I just want to talk to him.

132
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,031
Hold this a second.

133
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:10,677
My advice to you?

134
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,558
Anytime you get the urge
to think for yourself?

135
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,625
- Resist it.
- I told you...

136
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,439
I want my life back.

137
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,330
This is your life.

138
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:24,066
Throw that away for me, will ya?

139
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,816
- You want one of these?
- No,

140
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,687
I'm good with my espresso, thanks.

141
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,105
You look a little sleepy there, partner.

142
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,166
Everything all right?

143
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:41,809
It's just a touch of insomnia

144
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:44,855
and pesky dreams, nothing too worrisome.

145
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:48,077
I got just the person for you, Ray.

146
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,752
I couldn't get a good night's sleep
through that whole government trial.

147
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,028
This therapist did wonders for me.

148
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,689
Doesn't matter what you have...
either bruxism,

149
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,584
you know, hypnic jerks,
exploding head syndrome...

150
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,404
she's terrific.

151
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,276
Trust me, seriously.

152
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,178
So...

153
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,436
at your son's basketball game...

154
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:12,764
Last night.

155
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:15,102
I'm sitting up in the stands with Holly.

156
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:16,745
Other parents are

157
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,819
up there, you know, and this woman
about two rows behind me...

158
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,437
she spits on me.

159
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:24,717
Back of my head.

160
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:28,369
And you'd like me to... what?

161
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,499
All this woman knows about me is

162
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,441
what she reads in the newspaper
or sees on television,

163
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,393
and she hates me so much
that she can to spit on me?

164
00:08:38,997 --> 00:08:41,795
I'm not exactly a young man anymore.

165
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,172
Worried about your legacy.

166
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:45,927
Yeah, I'm not a monster, Ray.

167
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:48,628
I don't want to be remembered as one.

168
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:50,808
So what are you proposing?

169
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:54,885
A memoir. You know?

170
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:59,883
Show these people the real me,
the family me, you know,

171
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:01,661
the husband, the father.

172
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:02,662
You know.

173
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:03,786
Maybe...

174
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:08,142
I don't know. Show 'em a picture
of my childhood home.

175
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,547
You know, I grew up poor.

176
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:12,359
Maybe a chapter on my dyslexia.

177
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,932
You know, that's actually
a terrific idea.

178
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:20,299
We'll set you up with a publisher
right after the trial.

179
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:21,611
No. No, now.

180
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:23,695
Art, no, no.

181
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:25,516
You do this now,

182
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:28,642
people could perceive it as a sign
of desperation...

183
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,369
or worse, guilt.

184
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,606
Not if we do it right.
Just get me a ghostwriter,

185
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,037
somebody who has a lot of experience
in this sort of thing.

186
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,986
You're gonna allow
some complete stranger

187
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,240
to poke into your life?

188
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:40,770
No, Ray... he'll be working for me.

189
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:42,969
He'll be working for the publisher.

190
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:46,037
You'll never be able to control
the flow of information.

191
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,650
First thing you know,
they'll be down in your basement

192
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:50,908
- digging for bodies.
- You know something?

193
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,614
Set this up for me.

194
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:55,816
Get me a writer,
and stop being an asshole.

195
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:58,074
You're being an asshole. She spat at me!

196
00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:59,540
You know something? She spat at me.

197
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:02,842
In front of my kids.

198
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,762
The book's a good idea.

199
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,836
I can't wait to read it.

200
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,419
You still awake?

201
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:27,662

214

Well, I'm just glad that you're okay.

<i>Listen I forgot to tell you.

216
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,820
Tomorrow night, Patty asked us
to dinner at her place.

217
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,997
You forgot?

218
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:08,945
I know, I screwed up.

219
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,376
Come on, it's our one night together.

220
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:13,325
We were going to try
that new Mexican place.

221
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:15,395
<i>I know, I'm sorry, babe.

222
00:11:17,102 --> 00:11:18,163
Who's gonna be there?

223
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:21,423
I think it's just her and her husband.

224
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,491
And us? Jesus, Ellen...

225

227
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:30,997
After everything that happened
with Katie, why would I possibly want

228
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,791
to socialize with Patty Hewes?

229
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,987
She's my boss.

230
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:36,533
She wants to meet you.
What am I supposed to say?

231
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:42,155
I don't want to go.

232
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:44,956
David, can you please do this for me?

233
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,167
Fine.

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,620
I'll be a couple more hours.

235
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,415
The nurse at your station said
you'd be here.

236
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:14,660
Is everything okay?

237
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:19,068
I know when you guys discharged
my grandfather

238
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:21,557
from the hospital last week,
he was doing really great.

239
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,688
But saturday night things took a turn.

240
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:28,023
Did you call the paramedics?

241
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:29,563
Yeah.

242
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:32,074
He was dead by the time they got there.

243
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,960
Oh, my God.

244
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:38,622
I'm so sorry.

245
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,825
I've been so busy that
I didn't even hear.

246
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,325
Is there anything that I can do?

247
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:46,061
Actually...

248
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:48,608
I hate to ask.

249
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:49,858
What?

250
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,318
There's all this medical equipment
in our apartment... his machines.

251
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,776
The nurse said that I could sell them
on Craig's List,

252
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:59,352
but I just don't know
what they're worth.

253
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:01,262
Do you know
what kind of machines they are?

254
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,301
I'm not sure.

255
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:03,693
I'd need someone to tell me.

256
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,359
Do you think maybe
you could take a look?

257
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:13,592
I know I acted inappropriately before.

258
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,923
You're engaged.

259
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:16,491
I respect that.

260
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:21,501
I could really use your help right now.

261
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:31,544
Where do you live?

262
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,817
David Conner's phone records.

263
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:39,859
And?

264
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,257
Someone called him a half dozen times

265
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:44,072
- the night before he was killed.
- Who?

266
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:47,670
Her name is Lila Dimeo.

267
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,866
What's the occasion?

268
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,837
The occasion, Ray, is gratitude.

269
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:02,480
Thank you.

270
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,254
No, Ray, thank you.

271
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,570
16 years of service.

272
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:09,530
Government trial...
head to head in a ring with

273
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,193
Patty Hewes and we're still standing.

274
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,169
Miracles do happen.

275
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:16,657
You're a good friend, Ray.

276
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:17,950
Thank you.

277
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:21,886
Means a lot to hear you say that.

278
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:24,890
Bottoms up.

279
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,777
What's the matter?

280
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,146
What is it?

281
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,281
Goddamn it, man, what...?

282
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,808
<i>Mr. Fiske, it's time to leave
for the Frobisher meeting.

283
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,795
Thank you, Kitty.

284
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,022
You talk to the sleep therapist yet,
buddy?

285
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:16,665
No, no, I haven't had the time.

286
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:20,202
Ray, you got dark circles
under your eyes, man.

287
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,649
You're walking like a corpse.

288
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,674
You should call her.

289
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:28,571
What's up, Dad?

290
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,757
So, have you heard
from the publisher or not?

291
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:34,416
They chose your writer.

292
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,188
Fella from Yale.

293
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,658
Writes fiction no one reads,
but he's one hell of a biographer.

294
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,153
Fantastic.

295
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,870
Yeah, it is.

296
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:47,377
Look, I want you to know,

297
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:51,604
the publisher intends to have you talk
about your current litigation.

298
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:56,885
I won't be the sole focus of the book...

299
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:58,986
you can still get your story out... but

300
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:02,144
they're insisting that candid insight

301
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,331
into your company's collapse and your

302
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:08,032
perspective on the ensuing trials
will be a major selling point.

303
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,659
Now, obviously, you can still back out.

304
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,996
Frankly, that would be my advice.

305
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:19,890
No.

306
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,128
I want to do this.

307
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:26,580
I have to do this.

308
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:28,638
Tread lightly.

309
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,111
People need to know who I am, Ray.

310
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:39,906
Don't be afraid to put your nose
right in there.

311
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,333
Inhale that. It's

312
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,174
an incredible vintage. This is

313
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:46,953
a 2001 Cabernet Merlot blend.

314
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,444
Intense concentration.

315
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,299
What do you think?

316
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,045
Yes. It's got

317
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:59,110
a fantastic concentration.

318
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:02,888
Really, it's... incredible.

319
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,901
Do you like wine, David?

320
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:08,946
Wine?

321
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,142
Sure.

322
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:14,571
Come on, David,
we had Pinot Grigio the other night.

323
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:15,574
What was that?

324
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:18,931
I don't remember.

325
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:21,971
Phil knows everything about wine.

326
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,846
I only know two things: red and white.

327
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,833
Your sister must know a lot about wine,

328
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:35,878
what with a restaurant and all.

329
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,724
Yeah, she does.

330
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:44,461
How is Katie?

331
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:47,374
Not good.

332
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,110
I'm sorry to hear that.

333
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:50,963
Please send her my best.

334
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
Don't beg.

335
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,556
So how did you guys meet?

336
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,396
You tell, Phil. I always get it wrong.

337
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:05,232
Not a romantic bone
in this woman's body.

338
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:06,893
It was '94.

339
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:08,726
I was working for
the Indonesian government.

340
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,176
I was in Jakarta.
I was restructuring the national bank.

341
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:13,434
She was walking
through the hotel lobby...

342
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,247
I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me.

343
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,196
It's Dubai.

344
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,048
The market is just opening there.

345
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:21,109
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:22,286
Excuse me, please.

347
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,943
Yes.

348
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:33,990
So how did you two meet?

349
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:36,498
Berger?

350
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:39,064
Berber, it's with a "B."

351
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:40,530
George is fine.

352
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:44,546
So, George, I hear you're a smart guy.

353
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:47,151
I understand you're writing a novel.

354
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
That's right.

355
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:51,909
That's very impressive.

356
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:53,896
Thank you.

357
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:55,748
So how does this work?

358
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:58,411
Should I just start telling stories
about myself?

359
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:00,051
Or do you want to ask me questions?

360
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,343
It's up to us.

361
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:05,142
Although I do have a couple things
to get started,

362
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:07,568
just to understand some basics.

363
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:09,261
Shoot.

364
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:18,027
When the accounting irregularities

365
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,342
in your company were first discovered...

366
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:25,087
And this is just because I don't have
a degree in economics...

367
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:27,669
Listen.

368
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,798
George, we're going to get to it.

369
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,448
I have a lot I want to say about that.

370
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:34,915
Trust me.

371
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,638
But why don't I just tell you

372
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:41,300
things about who I am?

373
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,982
You know, like my childhood.

374
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:46,110
Absolutely.

375
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,963
Great, great.

376
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:54,078
Are you familiar with dyslexia?

377
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:59,382
Glass of port? I have a Ferreira Lagrima
that will make you weep.

378
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:02,162
Thank you, but I think that
we've got to get going, so...

379
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:05,257
No, we can stay for a glass.
I've always wanted to try port.

380
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:08,281
Good, Ellen,
come into the kitchen with me.

381
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:09,982
We can choose a dessert.

382
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,161
Sure.

383
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,037
You like cigars?

384
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:22,598
Like some coffee?

385
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,098
Sure. Thanks.

386
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:25,122
There you are.

387
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:27,767
- Sugar?
- Thank you.

388
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:30,604
Thank you so much
for having us to dinner.

389
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,788
Our pleasure.

390
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:35,948
I always like to get to know my new
associates and their significant others.

391
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:38,423
Well, we really
appreciate the invitation.

392
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:39,596
It's our pleasure.

393
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:41,286
It's fun for us, two.

394
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,759
I'm really sorry about David.

395
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,027
I think he's still upset about Katie.

396
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,725
He's lovely.

397
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,396
But he's started his surgical rotation.

398
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:55,096
He's doing these endless shifts.
He's very sleep-deprived.

399
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:58,339
I really understand,
but I don't think it's just that.

400
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:00,351
What do you mean?

401
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:04,218
Let's be honest: men are sensitive.

402
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,709
They don't like to be dragged anywhere.

403
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:10,699
We may not like it,
but we know how to play second fiddle.

404
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:12,411
We're bred for it.

405
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,884
Men can't do it.

406
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,245
At least,

407
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:20,044
not the ones worth
sharing a bed with.

408
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:23,916
We got to go. I got work.

409
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:26,261
Biscotti?

410
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,620
And then she's got to bring up Katie?!

411
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,390
Because Patty's concerned about her.

412
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,918
Bullshit.

413
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:34,995
You were acting like
you didn't want to be there

414
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,617
long before Patty mentioned Katie.

415
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:37,730
Because I didn't.

416
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:39,907
Yeah, you made that perfectly clear.

417
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:43,029
I'm so sorry if I'm not interested in

418
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:45,395
international arbitrage.

419
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:47,286
Phil was just trying
to make conversation.

420
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:49,238
And when Patty asked
you about the hospital...

421
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,320
I answered her question.

422
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,532
No, you grunted like a caveman.

423
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,805
I answered her, didn't I?

424
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,063
I had to apologize for you.

425
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:58,418
You what?

426
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,990
You can't do this to me, David.

427
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,745
Patty knew you were miserable.

428
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:12,528
These events are part my job.

429
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:14,279
- There are going to be more.
- I get it.

430
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:17,941
Patty's your boss. That doesn't
mean that I have to like her.

431
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:24,935
Hello?

432
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:29,437
<i>Hello.</i>

433
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:32,481
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- It's Gregory Malina.

434
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:35,749
I want to talk.

435
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:45,806
Where did you meet David Connor?

436
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:48,497
At the hospital.

437
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,936
Where he worked?

438
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,142
David treated my grandfather.

439
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,903
I'm sorry.
I just can't believe this.

440
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,206
Miss Dimeo,
how long were you dating David Connor?

441
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:58,815
Almost four months.

442
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:02,501
What?

443
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:06,834
Any idea why Ellen Parsons
didn't move out until two days ago?

444
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,242
She moved out the day
she found out about us.

445
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:11,856
So David Connor was cheating
on Miss Parsons with you?

446
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:15,752
3 1/2 MONTHS EARLIER

447
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:19,884
- Can I take your jacket?
- Yeah.

448
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:21,373
Thank you.

449
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,116
Oh, thanks.

450
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,804
Caught up there.

451
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,626
Sorry.

452
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:35,083
Oh, that's me and my parents.

453
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,264
They passed away when I was a kid.

454
00:23:38,424 --> 00:23:40,465
Your grandfather raised you?

455
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:44,121
Machine's in here.

456
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:57,624
It's a defibrillator.

457
00:23:59,557 --> 00:24:01,845
You know, on...

458
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:04,025
TV in hospitals when they put the...

459
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,345
paddles on people's chest and yell,
"Clear"?

460
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:08,185
Right.

461
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,242
That's what that is.

462
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:17,518
Did my grandfather ever tell you
that he was a medic in World War II?

463
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,523
No.

464
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,967
Did he go to med school?

465
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:22,418
He was a butcher.

466
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,104
I guess that qualified him.

467
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,256
Check it out.

468
00:24:29,686 --> 00:24:30,756
Is that a bullet?

469
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:32,506
From Iwo Jima.

470
00:24:32,507 --> 00:24:34,030
Made a movie about it, actually.

471
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:36,999
My, uh, grandfather got shot in the leg,

472
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:40,540
and he got this as a reminder.

473
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,319
Of what?

474
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,185
"Life is short. "

475
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,211
He had it inscribed.

476
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:50,824
Words to live by.

477
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,252
- I need to go.
- OK.

478
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:05,025
But, um, the defibrillator, it's used.

479
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:07,444
So you'll probably get
400 or 500 bucks for it.

480
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:10,367
But, just make sure that
you list it as AED...

481
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:12,377
M series,

482
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,001
okay?

483
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:19,280
I'll get your jacket.

484
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,504
I hate that bitch.

485
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,455
Stare at her every day at work.

486
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:34,254
Stands there holding her torch,
welcoming everybody.

487
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:35,522
It's bullshit.

488
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,135
She don't look after anybody.

489
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,947
No, she doesn't.

490
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:42,631
You got to look out for yourself.

491
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,172
When I first moved here,
I thought I'd just, you know,

492
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:48,677
figure out what I was good at.

493
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:50,383
And?

494
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,247
Turns out the only talent
I have is getting people to like me.

495
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:56,199
This is crazy.

496
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,677
This all comes down to getting
attention of someone at a bar.

497
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,826
I'm glad you called.

498
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,627
Yeah, you're glad I called.

499
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:06,874
- What?
- What, are we friends now?

500
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,912
Look, I'm only here because I'm sick of
these assholes, and I want it to stop.

501
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:15,454
Tell me who ordered you
to set up Katie and maybe it will.

502
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:19,125
Who was it, Gregory?

503
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:22,173
Do you understand the risk
I'm taking talking to you right now?

504
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:23,639
I can protect you.

505
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,019
Like you protected Katie?

506
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,075
Give me a break.

507
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,117
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

508
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:34,670
Wait. Gregory,

509
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:37,562
just give me a name, okay?
Was Frobisher's broker in the car?

510
00:26:37,717 --> 00:26:39,880
Forget about him.
It's not about the broker.

511
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,001
What do you mean?

512
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:42,687
It's more...

513
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,140
Gregory!

514
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:52,487
Shit.

515
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,519
If this is bad news,
I don't want to hear it.

516
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,355
They're talking to the kid.

517
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:18,908
It was only a matter of time.

518
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,465
He has been prepped, hasn't he?

519
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:22,610
Of course.

520
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:24,264
So what's the problem?

521
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:26,089
The problem is Gregory's conscience.

522
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:27,280
You...

523
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:30,087
I don't want to hear this shit right now.

524
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:31,339
We need a new strategy, Arthur.

525
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,704
So find one.

526
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,858
You guys said that you
were going to handle this.

527
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,711
Look, this wasn't my mess.
It was his.

528
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:39,543
I don't care whose mess it is.
Just deal with it. Jesus.

529
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:42,265
You know, next time you call me,
make sure it's for good news.

530
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,084
You know I can't beleve this shit.

531
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:52,248
Gregory said what?

532
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:54,634
He said, "Forget about the broker. "

533
00:27:55,782 --> 00:27:56,787
What does that mean?

534
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,011
I don't know. I think he wanted to say
more, but he seemed spooked.

535
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,244
We have to bring him in.

536
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,241
Tom, draft the subpoena.

537
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:07,269
You got it.

538
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:11,708
What, Ellen?

539
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:14,951
We know what Frobisher
did to Katie's dog.

540
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:16,184
Yes.

541
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:20,205
So is there anything
we can do to protect Gregory?

542
00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:30,569
Want a game of Horse?

543
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,824
- All right.
- You first.

544
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:37,552
I talked about you
all yesterday afternoon.

545
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:43,227
I'm writing a book, you know?

546
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,016
Yeah, Mom told me.

547
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,272
Yeah.

548
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:48,340
I used to be able to dunk this sucker.

549
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,582
Yeah, you always say that.

550
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:54,774
Yeah, I told him the story about...

551
00:28:55,207 --> 00:28:57,094
our camping trip.
You remember that?

552
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:59,435
You got all scared 'cause you thought

553
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:01,879
the jabberwocky was hiding behind a tree,

554
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:04,492
but you got all mixed up and
you started screaming,

555
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,399
"Liberace's behind a tree!"

556
00:29:07,987 --> 00:29:09,087
I was six.

557
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:11,397
Yeah, you were.

558
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:18,733
Look, I know being my son these
days, you're catching a lot of grief.

559
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,482
I don't listen to that crap.

560
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:24,865
That shit they're saying about me,

561
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:27,030
someday, soon,

562
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,613
they're going to eat that.

563
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:32,107
Then we'll just be, you know,

564
00:29:32,525 --> 00:29:34,164
a normal family again.

565
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,645
I believe you, Dad.

566
00:29:42,952 --> 00:29:45,287
Doesn't mean you're any
good at this game, though.

567
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:47,429
Look at that.
You're not bending your legs.

568
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,530
You got to go from your knees,
right, knees, elbow, follow through.

569
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:57,766
Hey.

570
00:29:58,613 --> 00:29:59,680
Mr. Frobisher.

571
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,249
I know. I know.
I know. It's late.

572
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,256
Yeah, look,
I'm not expecting you right now.

573
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:05,091
I know you weren't.
I'm sorry, George.

574
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:07,359
- This is nice. Very nice.
- Thank you.

575
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,215
Hi, I'm Arthur Frobisher.

576
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:11,809
That's my girlfriend, Indira.

577
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,417
Ah, that's nice.

578
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:18,188
Actually, look,
I had some thoughts, you know?

579
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:22,259
Do you have a couple of glasses,
'cause I bought us one hell of a bottle.

580
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,762
This is sipping whiskey.

581
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:26,586
Yeah, I would feel it on the way.

582
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:28,875
Were you ever
in the Boy Scouts, George?

583
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:31,625
I stopped after Webelos, but, yeah.

584
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,519
That's not Boy Scouts, man.

585
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:39,311
Pinewood Derby, right?

586
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:41,682
Yeah. Last place, this guy.

587
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,513
Ask me why I'm proud.

588
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,371
Because I made this myself.

589
00:30:46,618 --> 00:30:49,236
The other kids,
they had their dads do it for them.

590
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,693
It's after midnight, Mr. Frobisher.

591
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:57,092
No, see, look, this... this stuff.

592
00:30:57,093 --> 00:30:58,093
All...

593
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,080
This is my integrity.

594
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:03,240
See what I'm say...
Here, look, look, look.

595
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:05,313
What? Oh, yeah.

596
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:09,813
Third... third prize,
middle school spelling bee.

597
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:12,893
- Great.
- No...

598
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:14,253
I'm dyslexic.

599
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:15,814
Remember I told you that?

600
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:17,748
So that's determination.

601
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:19,219
Here, look, look.

602
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:21,805
Yeah, all right, varsity.
This is interesting.

603
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:25,245
Varsity... that's the first time
I realized that I was a natural leader.

604
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:29,284
Yeah, you know, all this stuff
that you're giving me is great.

605
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:31,285
But this book...

606
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,149
All right,
look, look, look, all right, here.

607
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,282
Come here.

608
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:35,530
This shirt, right?

609
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:37,031
The shirt you're wearing?

610
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:38,880
You own other shirts, right?

611
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:42,008
So, you know,
if I come along and say, you know,

612
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,838
define you as the guy
who wears this shirt,

613
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,472
I'd be wrong.

614
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,431
Right? 'Cause...

615
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:49,947
you know, you're not just one thing.

616
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:52,575
See, that's what I'm trying
to say: you're not just one thing.

617
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:57,327
Hey, I told you, right,
that I started off dirt-poor?

618
00:31:57,328 --> 00:31:59,137
You told me yesterday about that.

619
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:01,100
Well, why don't you write...? See...

620
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:02,638
All right, hey, listen.

621
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:05,430
17... I came this close

622
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:07,162
to joing the army, you realize that?

623
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:09,439
Look, look, Mr. Frobisher,

624
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,697
I haven't seen Indira for two weeks.
She has been traveling, understand?

625
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:15,281
This is our night together, so...

626
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,453
we'll just cut it short.

627
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:19,747
Wait. All right, let's back up here.

628
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:22,932
Tell me about your book.

629
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:24,061
My novel?

630
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:25,369
Sorry, your novel.

631
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:28,675
It's... it's hard to describe.

632
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,461
Just tell me what it's about, will ya?

633
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:35,055
On the face of it, it's a love story.

634
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,098
It's about...

635
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:39,428
nostalgia...

636
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:42,567
and how that affects
our core relationship.

637
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:44,206
Jesus, George.

638
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,179
I mean that sounds like crap.

639
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:50,208
Are you kidding me?!
Look what you're doing here. I mean,

640
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,944
you're living on...
you're sleeping on a futon.

641
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,583
Come on.
You know...

642
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:56,974
Of course you're writing about my life.

643
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,848
You don't have one, you know?

644
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,476
And you're screwing the
immigrant because what...

645
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:02,750
Excuse me?!

646
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:04,801
- ...you appreciate their culture?
- Excuse me?!

647
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:06,161
Is that what you say to yourself?

648
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:08,558
The truth is you're just
trying to feel superior.

649
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,574
Try running a $40 billion industry.

650
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:13,493
- See how that makes you feel.
- Get out!

651
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:16,550
Yeah, try managing 11,000 employees.

652
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:18,251
I bet that gives you a hard-on,
you little...

653
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:19,417
Just leave!

654
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:20,441
Shit!

655
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:22,203
You want to know

656
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:24,941
why they're suing me,
you invisible piece of shit?

657
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:26,343
'Cause I'm worth it.

658
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:29,357
I hope that you lose everything.

659
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:32,361
- Now you be careful.
- 'Cause you are an arrogant asshole.

660
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:36,065
Hey, guess what?

661
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,488
You're fired.

662
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:45,356
He's fired.
Tell him that, will ya?

663
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,212
MY...

664
00:33:49,213 --> 00:33:51,918
MY LIFE BY...

665
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:00,950
Dad?

666
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:02,415
Yeah?

667
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,641
I- I'm writing.

668
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,227
- What?
- The police are here to see you.

669
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,124
You think they'll arrest him?

670
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:29,472
Simple assault's a misdemeanor.

671
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:31,420
They'll slap him on the wrist.

672
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,665
But publicity like this
is never a bad thing for us.

673
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:36,734
You heading out?

674
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:40,007
No, David's working,
so I'm sticking around.

675
00:34:40,206 --> 00:34:42,124
I've been thinking about you and David.

676
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:43,797
You want a drink?

677
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:45,484
Sure.

678
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:50,491
I hope it works out for you two.

679
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:53,027
Well, why wouldn't it?

680
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,634
It's really tough, Ellen:

681
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,799
juggling a man and a career.

682
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:01,517
Cheers.

683
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:02,612
Cheers.

684
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:05,445
Now...

685
00:35:06,342 --> 00:35:09,079
my college boyfriend was...

686
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:13,524
the sweetest,
most loyal guy you'll ever meet.

687
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:16,676
We moved in together
after graduation and

688
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:18,439
he helped put me through law school.

689
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:20,897
He worked two jobs...

690
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:23,094
thankless, menial stuff.

691
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,347
And...

692
00:35:24,934 --> 00:35:26,821
he was my first love.

693
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,478
I dumped him as soon as I got my JD.

694
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:32,986
Why?

695
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:34,668
He had no ambition.

696
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,490
It disgusted me.

697
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:38,862
Really?

698
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:43,725
It's biology, Ellen.

699
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,995
A man should want to be in charge.

700
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,794
Now the trick is...

701
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:51,933
making him feel like he actually is.

702
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,235
Is that why Phil did
all the talking at dinner?

703
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,933
Yeah, he likes to hold court.

704
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:09,377
What?

705
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:13,533
I didn't tell David I met with Gregory.

706
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,253
Really?

707
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,861
I guess I didn't want him to worry.

708
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:25,986
Most men can't
handle an ambitious woman.

709
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:28,961
It may take you a few tries,

710
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:32,116
but make sure you find one who can.

711
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,301
It's David Connor.

712
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:41,821
Hey, uh, listen.

713
00:36:41,822 --> 00:36:45,897
I'm sorry to bug you, but, I'm just
leaving work and I can't find my keys.

714
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:47,134
Oh, that sucks.

715
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:49,179
Yeah, I had them in my jacket pocket.

716
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,267
I don't know if they
fell out at your place.

717
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:53,086
<i>No, no.
I would've seen them.</i>

718
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,354
I'll take another look.

719
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:55,535
<i>Uh, anyway,</i>

720
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:57,365
give me a call if you find them, okay?

721
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:58,366
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

722
00:36:58,367 --> 00:36:59,587
Thanks.

723
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,628
- Who was that?
- How you feeling, Grandpa?

724
00:37:01,629 --> 00:37:04,273
- Like a hundred bucks.
- I'm going out; I'll see you later.

725
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:12,626
To tell the truth, I'm not
really sure what to expect, but...

726
00:37:13,307 --> 00:37:15,827
Mr. Frobisher sings your praises.

727
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:18,858
Oh, sleep therapy is
more of an art than a science.

728
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,034
I can't sleep...

729
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:25,545
and when I do, I have nightmares.

730
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:27,872
What's the nature of your dreams?

731
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:30,458
In one,

732
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,509
my teeth fall out.

733
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:34,237
It's pretty common.

734
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:35,901
It's thought to signify...

735
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:37,120
Insecurity...

736
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:39,679
anxiety... I know.

737
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:43,187
Well, that's one interpretation,
but it can also signify...

738
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:45,398
a secret you're keeping.

739
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,109
More specifically,
your overwhelming fear

740
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,537
that people will find it out.

741
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:56,671
What?

742
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:58,428
What's going on, Mr. Fiske?

743
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:01,423
Tell me.

744
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:07,674
Let it out.

745
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,013
<i>Remember me?</i>

746
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:22,472
- From the other night?.
- Yeah.

747
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:23,893
Of course, I remember you.

748
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,750
I came to see if you were okay.

749
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,002
Yeah.

750
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:28,939
I wanted to give you my number.

751
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,296
Yeah?

752
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,183
<->Your boy, Gregory Malina?</i>

753
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,492
<i>Yes?</i>

754
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:04,626
He's in danger.

755
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,786
<i>What happened?</i>

756
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:07,199
You don't need to know.

757
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,679
And if I want to subpoena him?

758
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,890
Better do it quick.

759
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,968
I need to talk to you.

760
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,465
You can't be here.

761
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:35,659
<i>Ray?! Who is it?!</i>

762
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,035
It's the wrong address!

763
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:39,050
Just go back to sleep, Mallory!

764
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:40,767
You need to leave. You...

765
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:42,700
Just give me five minutes, Ray.

766
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:44,989
Just give me five minutes.

767
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,674
I- I've got a Doberman.

768
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:48,190
Please?

769
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,558
Please?

770
00:42:11,806 --> 00:42:12,878
Surprise.

771
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,369
I said hello, and you didn't answer.

772
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:20,514
So you figured I was one of those
murderers who leads you to your death

773
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:22,555
with music and bubble baths?

774
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:23,591
No.

775
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:27,927
No, I lost my keys and the door was open.

776
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:31,961
I guess I forgot to lock it.

777
00:42:32,988 --> 00:42:34,128
Right.

778
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:40,365
Are you going to get in?

779
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,463
What's the special occasion?

780
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:47,192
I miss you.

781
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:05,631
Look...

782
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,704
I'm not proud of it,
but it's what David wanted.

783
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:11,764
And last night, where were you?

784
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:13,631
Here, at home.

785
00:43:13,865 --> 00:43:16,108
Why aren't you talking to Ellen Parsons?

786
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:18,801
- Why should we?
- Because she's crazy...

787
00:43:18,987 --> 00:43:20,409
and jealous.

788
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,381
<i>This is Ellen Parsons.</i>

789
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:25,306
<i>Stay away from my fiance</i>

790
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:27,981
<i>or I swear to God,
I will come after you. </i>

791
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:31,399
You called David six times yesterday.

792
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:33,325
About the apartment.

793
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:35,280
We were making arrangements.

794
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:37,421
I was going to move in.

795
00:43:43,478 --> 00:43:44,756
See?

796
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,694
David made me a set of keys.

797

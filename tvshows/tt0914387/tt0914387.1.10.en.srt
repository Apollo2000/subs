Previously on damages...

3
00:00:03,322 --> 00:00:04,632
Someone tried to kill me.

4
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:07,025
And, uh, where is this body?

5
00:00:07,026 --> 00:00:08,536
I've been trying to reach patty.

6
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:09,964
Go to the beach house.

7
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,593
Patty, where the hell are you?

8
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:15,525
Ellen wants to use your beach house.

9
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:16,526
Be my guest.

10
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:19,216
I am trying to settle this case.

11
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:20,217
Try harder.

12
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:22,577
Katie, katie, it's me.

13
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:24,547
Start by looking into arlington.

14
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:25,564
Arlington, Virginia.

15
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,792
Some girl was killed in a car crash.

16
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,187
It was Frobisher's car.

17
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:31,683
The girl's family went from living
in a trailer park to being

18
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:33,437
the biggest landowner in arlington.

19
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:34,438
I'm sorry,

20
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,290
Gregory, for everything.

21
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,021
It's done.

What's the matter, david?

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,883
Where's Ellen?

25
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,738
I'm right here.

26
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:03,288
What's wrong?

27
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,245
I could get used to this.

28
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:16,346
What are you doing with her?

29
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:20,941
What do you mean?

30
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:24,891
Look, I like her.

31
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:29,564
She's smart, capable, but...

32
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:31,958
Come on...

33
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,568
she's not your type of lawyer.

34
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,602
How long you going to keep her around?

35
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:42,446
Ellen brought us Katie,

36
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:45,557
Katie brought us Gregory.

37
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:46,902
Right.

38
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,257
So as long as Gregory's still in play,

39
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:51,893
so is Ellen.

40
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,943
Simple as that.

41
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:08,821
- It's katie.
- Oh, yeah?

42
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,554
What's the matter?

43
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,296
Gregory Malina's dead.

44
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:21,517

47
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,100
Patty was at the beach house.

48
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:16,189
<i>- What did you tell her?
- She was there.</i>

49
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,403
By the time I showed up, she was gone.

50
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,221
Looks like she left in a hurry.

51
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,249
Look, Ellen,

52
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,725
I want to help you.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,828
I want to get you out of here.

54
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,578
But I don't know what
to believe anymore.

55
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,589
Someone tried to kill me, Tom.

56
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,235
It was a hit-and-run.

57
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:38,203
Gregory Malina died at the scene.

58
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:40,096
1 MONTH EARLIER

59
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:41,583
So we move on...

60
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,116
to Frobisher's deposition.

61
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,429
Here's the game plan

62
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,520
with one major addition.

63
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,695
Arlington, Virginia, 1983,

64
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:54,839
Frobisher's jaguar crashes,
killing the girl he's with.

65
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:58,260
Frobisher denies he was driving,
but he was drunk at the time.

66
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:00,937
He's never charged, so
there's no wrongful death suit

67
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:02,250
but last week...

68
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:04,054
we received a tip that

69
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,725
Frobisher gave the girl's parents

70
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,829
stock in his company.

71
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:11,076
It's hush money, so we're going

72
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,739
to use it to show Frobisher's
history of obstructing justice.

73
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:18,613
If we can crack his slick facade
in the deposition

74
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,499
and get him to show his true colors,

75
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,410
it'll be a victory.

76
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:25,035
Thanks, everyone.

77
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:26,071
Thank you.

78
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,008
Hey, there she is.

79
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,333
Do you really have to go, dad?

80
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,714
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

81
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,054
Daddy's lawyer's helping him prepare.

82
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,569
This way he can focus better, not
be distracted by all of us.

83
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,390
Mohammed Ali used to hole
up for six weeks before a fight.

84
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,456
Who's that?

85
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,889
Greatest fighter of all times after me.

86
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,943
I'm not going to have
time to do that, sweetheart.

87
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,461
Thought you could use this.

88
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:55,454
Look at you.

89
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:57,369
What's that for?

90
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:01,262
The night before
your stepmom and I got married,

91
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,344
I was staying in a hotel
room nervous as shit.

92
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,424
Dad!

93
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:07,599
You're old enough.

94
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,538
Anyway, I was cooped up,

95
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,588
sweating bullets and holly
sent me my three iron.

96
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,330
Why?

97
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,925
It's your dad's good luck charm.

98
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,076
You're my good luck charm now.

99
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:27,623
What are you doing?

100
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:29,569
Come on, it's just another deposition.

101
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,224
Everything's going to be okay.

102
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:33,991
We're going to be fine,

103
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:35,374
trust me.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,747
How ugly is this going to get?

105
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:42,138
We're reasonable people.

106
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,065
Yes, we are.

107
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,572
No video camera.

108
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:48,569
- Unreasonable.
- Patty...

109
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,941
What are you worried about?

110
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,085
Your client is a matinee idol.

111
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:54,848
Unless his herpes has
flared up, he'll be just fine.

112
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:55,849
Nonnegotiable.

113
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:58,413
- I'll give you home-court advantage.
- Not interested.

114
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:01,224
But since we're on the topic...

115
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,573
how many sessions?

116
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:04,574
Seven.

117
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,775
Two.

118
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:06,910
Five.

119
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:10,566
I have a lot of questions.

120
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,340
That's what wikipedia is for.

121
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,581
Okay,

122
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,372
three.

123
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:19,051
But I get the video camera.

124
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:26,366
That's a big concession.

125
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,814
So is three days.

126
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:31,855
Deal.

127
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:39,278
Gregory Malina's dead.

128
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:41,684
Oh, my...

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,981
Hit-and-run.

130
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,039
That's horrible.

131
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:53,356
I guess we'll never know
what really happened.

132
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:59,206
Maybe the police will find the guy.

133
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:03,973
I won't hold my breath.

134
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:07,584
And, Ray...

135
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,930
shame on you.

136
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:30,546
What's the matter with you, Ray?
You look a little green.

137
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:33,723
Listen, I got it down to three days,

138
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:36,046
but she's going to have a camera.

139
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:40,578
That's okay, right?
We've prepared, I'm ready.

140
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,451
Yeah, but, Art,

141
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:44,918
listen...

142
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:46,593
What?

143
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:50,769
You're going into this
deposition exposed.

144
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:51,828
How so?

145
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,548
Well, I don't know what to do about
this arlington business, I'm sorry.

146
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,865
She's going to attack you with it

147
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,596
and there's no clear way
I can see to stop her.

148
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,309
I'm not settling, Ray.

149
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:07,572
I don't know how to protect you.

150
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:13,297
I'll just have to protect
myself then, won't I?

151
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:17,026
How are you going to do that?

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,537
You wanted to see me?

153
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,266
How was the beach house?

154
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:34,569
Amazing. I've been meaning to thank
you all day, but it's been so busy.

155
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,108
David and I would love
to take you and phil to dinner.

156
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,804
Oh, forget the dinner, Ellen.

157
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,999
I've decided to take
you off the deposition.

158
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:47,095
I would like you to report to felicia.

159
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:50,579
She needs some work done
on a pro bono she's heading up.

160
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,590
Vacation's over.

161
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,176
Get back to work.

162
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,605
Yeah, I'll do that.

163
00:10:03,928 --> 00:10:05,536
What are you doing?

164
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:08,573
Patty's making me do all
this paralegal bullshit.

165
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,096
For the deposition?

166
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:12,885
No, it has absolutely nothing
to do with the deposition.

167
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:16,162
Then put that shit away, huh

168
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:21,565
Oh, wait.

169
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:24,923
<i>In 1983, shortly after the tragedy</i>

170
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:26,837
<i>of their daughter, cindy's, death,</i>

171
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,779
<i>I gave the Lambert family</i>

172
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:30,846
<i>stock in my company.</i>

173
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,414
Holy shit.

174
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:35,895
<i>There's some people who might think
that that act was a sign of guilt...</i>

175
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,989
<i>or worse, an attempt to obfuscate
a crime and to buy the...</i>

176
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,985
<i>Lambert family's silence.</i>

177
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,933
<i>To respond to that,
I'm going to turn this part</i>

178
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:48,147
<i>over to cindy's father, Carl.</i>

179
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,593
<i>Thank you, Arthur.</i>

180
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:55,224
<i>Folks, for my wife and I,
the particulars of this tragedy were</i>

181
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:58,067
<i>put to rest almost three decades ago.</i>

182
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,577
<i>Now this is the police
report from the accident.</i>

183
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,540
<i>It documents the angle of impact</i>

184
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:07,451
<i>and the numerous injuries sustained
by both Cindy and Arthur.</i>

185
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,222
Now, this report...

186
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,778
convinced us at that time

187
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,519
and we remain convinced,

188
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,938
that our daughter was driving that car.

189
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,097
Unbelievable.

190
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,311
<i>Arthur Frobisher provided financial</i>

191
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:25,593
<i>support to my family because
he loved my daughter.</i>

192
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,523
<i>The fact that it wasn't made public</i>

193
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:29,831
<i>is to his credit.</i>

194
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:31,594
<i>Character is what you do in the dark.</i>

195
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,949
<i>Isn't that what christ teaches us?</i>

196
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:35,880
Oh, Jesus.

197
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:36,881
<i>Thank you, Carl.</i>

198
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,463
<i>And thank all of you for coming today.</i>

199
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:42,481
<i>I just want to say
I'm relieved and grateful</i>

200
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,777
<i>that this issue can
finally be put to rest.</i>

201
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,381
1 MONTH LATER

202
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:52,593
<i>I don't know what to believe anymore.</i>

203
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,119
Someone tried to kill me, Tom.

204
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,374
Come on, Ellen.

205
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,666
When I left patty's apartment,
there was a dead body.

206
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,407
There was blood on the floor,
a window had been broken.

207
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:02,643
You've got to go there.

208
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:04,554
You've got to go to patty's apartment.

209
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,390
The police didn't find anything!

210
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,165
Then someone's covering it up!

211
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,099
Look, without any evidence,
what can I do?

212
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,944
Let's go, Parsons.

213
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:17,267
Get me bail. I'll do the rest myself.

214
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,857
Okay, boy, okay.

215
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:45,574
There's a good boy.

216
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,091
Yeah, good boy.

217
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:52,582
Patty?

218
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:54,884
We were set up.

219
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:56,846
Or there's a leak in the office.

220
00:12:56,847 --> 00:13:00,158
I don't want anyone in
the deposition but you, Tom.

221
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,555
We're going into lockdown.

222
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:05,032
Miss hewes, I'd like to meet
with Mr. Moore and question him.

223
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,269
No.

224
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,806
He could be the source of the leak.

225
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:10,140
This thing was buried for 25 years.

226
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,331
I said no.

227
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:23,559
Call George Moore, set up a meeting.

228
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,548
What the hell was that press conference?

229
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,696
It was Art's idea, he did it on his own.

230
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:31,729
And you let him? Your job
is to control your client.

231
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,554
He won't listen to reason.

232
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:35,560
This incompetence is staggering.

233
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,057
Listen, asshole, this
arlington fiasco's on you.

234
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,548
I warned you from the start
this was a jackass move,

235
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:44,568
and now you've exposed
yourself to patty's people.

236
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:47,194
Now just lay low and let me do my job.

237
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:48,979
Clearly, you can't.

238
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,753
Maybe I'll tell him about
you and Gregory Malina.

239
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,926
You don't want to do that.

240
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,569
You gave that kid stock and
told him when to sell it.

241
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,499
Arthur finds out the full story,
he'll have to settle.

242
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,326
You better be careful.

243
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,624
I can take you down at any moment.

244
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,593
Go ahead.
You'll be taking yourself down as well.

245
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,563
You can't touch me, Ray.
Arthur needs me.

246
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,193
So do you.

247
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,043
Which one do you think looks best?

248
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:21,567
I like this.

249
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:24,974
Use a windsor.

251
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,577
It's assertive and formidable.

252
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:29,976
You know, I never learned
how to tie that, actually.

253
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,291
Can you believe that?

254
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,162
Billionaire doesn't know
how to tie a rich man's knot?

255
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:37,402
Here, sit down, I'll do it for you.

256
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,705
Holly usually helps me with this.

257
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:48,871
Yeah?

258
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,592
I want to thank you, Ray.

259
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:05,480
For my invaluable sartorial assistance?

260
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,785
No, for everything.

261
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:12,036
The last 16 years.

262
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:17,934
Especially the last five.
I mean, I know it hasn't been easy.

263
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:23,547
I know I can sometimes be kind of A...

264
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,271
Bull in a china shop?

265
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,598
This life is so full of people
trying to screw you, you know?

266
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:39,566
You shake hands with them one day, the
next day they're trying to stab you.

267
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,722
But you...

268
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,578
you may be the only
one I can trust, Ray.

269
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:58,474
You're a good friend.

270
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,576
Let's go show 'em what we got.

271
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:25,020
<i>SPE stands for special purpose entity.</i>

272
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,897
<i>I'd like to mark as exhibit seven...</i>

273
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:29,960
a chart entitled

274
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,754
Frobisher value analysis
dated march 4, 2001.

275
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:37,419
Do you recall seeing
this exhibit seven before?

276
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,008
It's important to establish that
it wasn't me personally

277
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,262
that set up these entities.

278
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:47,653
They were incorporated under
the direction of...

279
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,610
the chief operating officer.

280
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,154
Despite running the company,

281
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:56,421
you take no responsibility
for these entities that

282
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:58,590
your COO created?

283
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:02,867
Insofar as I was his superior,
yes, a certain

284
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,177
amount of responsibility

285
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:06,858
must be inferred.

286
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,580
But as far as direct
responsibility, no.

287
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:14,564
I don't believe that I can be
held personally responsible.

288
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,829
Mr. Frobisher, you were...

289
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:19,755
intimately involved in

290
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:23,114
founding your
company, running your company,

291
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,547
bankrupting your company,

292
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:29,047
and yet you sit here today
wanting us to believe that you...

293
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,476
have no idea where the money went.

294
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:33,543
Objection.

295
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:36,796
One more of those, counselor, and we're
going to have ourselves a problem.

296
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,191
Look,

297
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,250
all those SPEs and-and hold co's

298
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:44,571
every company has them.

299
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,796
I know when you see them up
there on a big chart

300
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:48,628
with all those colors and arrows

301
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:52,539
and unrestricted this and
offshore that, you...

302
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:56,084
you think they've been designed
purposefully...

303
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,270
to confuse the heck out of you.

304
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:00,529
And you know what?

305
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,471
It works,'ause it
confuses the hell out of me,

306
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:07,380
which is probably why I'm a
CEO and not a CFO

307
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,966
or a COO.

308
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:11,678
So,

309
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,122
you don't consider it
your duty as chief

310
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,104
executive of your company

311
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,884
to understand its
financial underpinnings?

312
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,802
A chief executive's job is to set

313
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:25,743
his company's agenda.

314
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:28,217
You're like A... you're like a coach.

315
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:32,130
Sometimes even a cheerleader.
You-you provide goals.

316
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,582
You lead by example.

317
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:40,418
I always believed
that it was my duty to...

318
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:43,780
to inspire my employees so that...

319
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:47,527
so that together we
could build something...

320
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,680
remarkable.

321
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:03,547
<i>Hello.</i>

322
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:06,568
Mr. Moore, it's Ellen parsons.

323
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:11,217
She spent the day lobbing
me softballs, loosening me up.

324
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,514
It's going to get a lot tougher.

325
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:16,562
But Ray says the day went well.

326
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,182
Good, I'm glad.

327
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,586
Is there anything you need?

328
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:25,322
<i>Anything I can do to
make this easier for you?</i>

329
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:28,972
No, just talking to you helps.

330
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:30,846
<i>I love you, Holly.</i>

331
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,576
<i>I miss you guys.</i>

332
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:38,305
We miss you.

333
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,298
Night.

334
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,854
Good night, Arthur.

335
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:53,563
He's going through so much.

336
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:56,964
It's been hard for you, too.
Don't forget that.

337
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,740
I'm so grateful I found you.

338
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,637
I don't know how I would...

339
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:09,578
Hey, we'll get through this.

340
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:11,872
It'll be easier once you tell him.

341
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:17,298
We have to wait until
after the deposition.

342
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,480
Miss Parsons.

343
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,674
I put my ass on the line for you.

344
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,572
Mr. Moore.

345
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:48,878
I trusted you with Arlington,

346
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,051
and your camp leaked it.

347
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:53,197
Why would we do that?

348
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:57,870
You don't understand how
Frobisher operates, do you?

349
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,731
Someone in your office...

350
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,384
is in his pocket.

351
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:05,375
Or you are.

352
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:07,072
Grow up.

353
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,794
I could get killed for what i told you.

354
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,450
You people had the opportunity to
take down Frobisher,

355
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:16,159
and you blew it.

356
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,570
The case isn't over yet.

357
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:21,182
Well, we are.

358
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,033
You get nothing else from me.

359
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:29,688
And tell Tom Shayes to stop calling.

360
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,061
Mr. Moore?

361
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:41,173
If there's a connection between you
and Arthur Frobisher, we will find it.

362
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,269
Watch yourself.

363
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,291
George Moore is full of shit.

364
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,359
He's saying we leaked arlington.

365
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,055
What have you found?

366
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:21,294
Moore was one of five SEC
commissioners appointed.

367
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:22,494
By who?

368
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:23,625
The president.

369
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,460
Moore headed up a team of investigators
to look into possible

370
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:28,251
fraud in Frobisher's company.

371
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:36,599
Who's Laura Watkins?

372
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:38,426
One of Moore's investigators.

373
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:41,819
But, in 2002, just before the
government trial, she was fired.

374
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,152
Moore said her methods were unsound.

375
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:46,962
After the trial, Watkins
did this interview.

376
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:50,703
She said that Moore removed her
for investigating too aggressively.

377
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:53,743
It was the first and last
interview she ever did.

378
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,154
You think Moore shut her down?

379
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,046
Now she works for an accounting
firm here in the city.

380
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,944
Have you told patty about this?

381
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,079
No.

382
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:09,030
And I'm not going to until I'm
absolutely sure I have something.

383
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:13,176
George Moore made a big show
of going after Frobisher.

384
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:15,204
- But you didn't believe he was?
- No.

385
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:17,598
Behind the scenes, Moore did nothing.

386
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,818
He forced us to keep investigating
Frobisher's stock broker

387
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:25,839
months after it was clear
that it would be a dead end.

388
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,147
Did you ever figure out Moore's agenda?

389
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:29,390
No.

390
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:31,684
But, the weekend before
Frobisher dumped his stock,

391
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:35,096
we were getting ready to expose
the accounting fraud in his company.

392
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,316
The same weekend Frobisher
was in palm beach.

393
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:38,503
Yeah. Exactly.

394
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,266
And you know where George
Moore was that same weekend?

395
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,308
No. We had no reason to look into that.

396
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,214
Well, he was in jacksonville, florida,

397
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,989
less than four hours away,

398
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,135
at an SEC commissioners'retreat.

399
00:23:49,342 --> 00:23:51,428
George Moore chose
that location himself.

400
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,210
He said he wanted to play
the 17th hole at sawgrass.

401
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,071
Good morning.

402
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,202
Arthur Frobisher.

403
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:05,818
I know who you are.

404
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:10,578
I probably shouldn't
be talking to you, huh?

405
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:13,313
How's the coffee here?

406
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,369
You know, when I was your age,
I used to run from moments like this,

407
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:23,408
standing two feet from
somebody who hates your guts.

408
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,746
Now I live for this shit.

409
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,859
Was your trip to palm beach
in june 2002

410
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,731
primarily business or pleasure?

411
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,919
Business.

412
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,062
I was there to deliver
a speech at a luncheon.

413
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,404
That's where you met katie connor?

414
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,574
No, we never met in florida.

415
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:45,594
I was told later that she
was one of the caterers.

416
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:49,328
And, afterwards, you approached
her about financing a restaurant?

417
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,968
My attorney contacted
her on my behalf, yes.

418
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:56,919
Why such interest in a novice chef?

419
00:24:57,428 --> 00:24:59,292
Objection. Vague.

420
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,155
At the luncheon,

421
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,873
an herb-encrusted pork loin
made quite an impression.

422
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:09,652
I was told later that it
was ms. Connor's creation.

423
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:13,927
Yet your financing of
Miss Connor's restaurant

424
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:17,275
halted shortly after she agreed
to testify in this case.

425
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:19,789
Why was that?

426
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,710
Ms. Connor went through a series...

427
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,787
of personal struggles.

428
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,271
Exhibit 41.

429
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:32,597
Please mark as exhibit 41.

430
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:35,565
Do you recognize this man?

431
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:38,267
No, I don't.

432
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:42,826
Let the record reflect that exhibit
41 is a photograph of

433
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:44,397
Gregory Malina.

434
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:50,910
Were you aware that Mr. Malina was in
Palm Beach the same weekend you were?

435
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,639
No. I've never seen him before.

436
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:57,585
So you didn't know he was
romantically linked to Ms. Connor?

437
00:25:58,566 --> 00:25:59,903
No, I did not.

438
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:02,966
Or that he owned a thousand
shares of stock in your company?

439
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:06,842
My stock was publicly traded.
A lot of people had it.

440
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,176
Or that in june, 2002,

441
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:12,470
he sold his stock the very same
morning you sold yours?

442
00:26:14,643 --> 00:26:16,595
No. No, I didn't know that.

443
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:22,475
Are you aware Mr. Malina is dead?

444
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:28,719
No. No.

445
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:35,545
but, like I said, I've
never seen this man before.

446
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:40,177
I'm very sorry to hear that.

447
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:49,862
I think that will be all for today.

448
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:04,478
Did you give Gregory Malina
stock in my company?

449
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,194
Absolutely not.

450
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,579
Then who the hell tipped him off?

451
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,182
I have no idea.

452
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,067
It doesn't matter, Art.
Malina can't hurt you.

453
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,149
You know what I think?
I think...

454
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,019
George Moore engineered
this whole hit-and-run.

455
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:25,894
Well, George is capable
of a lot of things.

456
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,558
What does that mean?
What do you mean?

457
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:32,576
I think he leaked Arlington.

458
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:34,756
Well, for christ...
Why would he do that?

459
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,376
Save his own ass. Get you to settle.

460
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:39,605
No, don't...

461
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:42,639
Senior partners wanted to meet with you.

462
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:45,571
We'll talk about this later.

463
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:47,583
Hey, Marshall, come on in.

464
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,283
Amos, good to see you.

465
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:52,551
Arthur, you remember Marshall
Phillips, amos denninger,

466
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:55,597
my superiors in everything
but shortness and baldness.

467
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,057
Come on in. Sit down.

468
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,315
Amos, you look good.

469
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:00,758
Thank you very much.

470
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,655
Mr. Frobisher, we just want
to assure you

471
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:05,361
that every one of our firm's
resources is at your disposal.

472
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:08,539
Well, marshall, i appreciate
that, but I'll tell you something.

473
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,586
With Ray, here, I never
felt more confident.

474
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,561
Can I get you fellas a drink?

475
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,463
No, nothing for me, thanks.

476
00:28:16,464 --> 00:28:19,097
Ray? I'm going to freshen
myself up here a little bit.

477
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,586
I'm fine thank you

478
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,064
Why do I would this pleasure?

479
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:31,822
Ms. Hewes, I found a way to help.

480
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,894
- I went back to George Moore, and he...
- You did what?

481
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:36,596
I spoke with George Moore.

482
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:40,560
Who told you to do that?

483
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:42,695
It was my initiative.
I thought we should follow...

484
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:43,696
Thought?

485
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,887
Who told you to think?

486
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:51,189
You are in this office
to wait for instructions.

487
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,335
You don't have license to think.

488
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,092
You have jeopardized...

489
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,946
the only serious lead we still have.

490
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,631
How could you be so...

491
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:05,111
stupid?

492
00:29:10,277 --> 00:29:11,993
Just get out of my office.

493
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,401
I'm so sick of your bullshit.

494
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:32,851
What did you say to me?

495
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,151
You heard me.

496
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:44,865
Get out.

497
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:48,579
And don't bother coming back.

498
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:10,676
Give this to patty.

499
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,226
What you looking for, boy?

500
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,102
You a good boy?

501
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,567
Excuse me.

502
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:52,752
Jeez...

503
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,254
Does Ms. Hewes know you're here?

504
00:30:56,742 --> 00:30:58,488
She gave me an extra set of keys.

505
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:02,891
How did you get in?

506
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,591
Service elevator.

507
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:08,765
Ms. Hewes had a water delivery.

508
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:16,684
Make sure you lock up when you go.

509
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:18,956
Will do.

510
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:57,810
I was just fired.

511
00:31:58,254 --> 00:31:59,561
What happened?

512
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:01,672
The thing is, I'm fine.

513
00:32:02,707 --> 00:32:04,852
Seriously, I feel great.

514
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:06,598
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

515
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:09,394
Let's go out.

516
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:11,081
Let's get drunk.

517
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,562
We still have some friends, don't we?

518
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,350
- Hey, there he is.
- Art, come here.

519
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:19,544
I tried to head you off.

520
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:21,626
I've got some bad news.

521
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:30,135
She's divorcing me.

522
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:32,088
I am so sorry, Art.

523
00:32:36,174 --> 00:32:37,372
Where did you get this?

524
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,266
The papers were filed this morning.

525
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,009
God...

526
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,349
who else knows about this?

527
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:52,599
Well, it's just us and the
court, it's not public yet.

528
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,699
Look, I'm going to
reschedule today's session.

529
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,079
I've prepared for this.

530
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:01,573
Art, listen to me.

531
00:33:01,685 --> 00:33:05,065
You are distracted.
I cannot have you in that room

532
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,047
in anything less than top form.

533
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:12,795
I'm fine.

534
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,328
Put this away.

535
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:19,579
Come on.

536
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,931
Mr. Frobisher, two days after you
returned from your trip to florida,

537
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,150
you gave a speech to your employees.

538
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:31,894
Yes, that's correct.

539
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:35,253
Exhibit 67.

540
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:38,551
It's a transcript of mr.
Frobisher's remarks dated...

541
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,550
june 21,

542
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,474
2002.

543
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:44,211
<I>Were you aware</i>

544
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:47,427
<i>that your company was being investigated
by the sec at the time?</i>

545
00:33:47,436 --> 00:33:48,721
<i>Yes, I was.</i>

546
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:51,850
<i>And yet you still told your employees</i>

547
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:55,007
that the company was
on sound financial ground?

548
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,016
I was confident that we were.

549
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,598
I firmly believed that the
sec investigation would turn up

550
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:04,090
no financial irregularities whatsoever.

551
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,209
Exhibit 68.

552
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,266
This is an e-mail you sent
your CFO, is that correct?

553
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:13,056
Yes, it is.

554
00:34:13,057 --> 00:34:15,065
It's a rough draft of the...

555
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:18,017
speech you wrote, the one you intended
to give your employees?

556
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,434
Yes, it appears to be that.

557
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:24,601
In the margin, you wrote the words,
too rosy,

558
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,692
followed by a question mark.

559
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:28,660
Too rosy.

560
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,783
I think I was...

561
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,323
wondering about the tone of the speech.

562
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,261
I was debating whether or
not to acknowledge the...

563
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,566
the climate that we were in at the time.

564
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:44,111
By climate, you mean the SEC

565
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:46,633
was about to expose
your accounting fraud.

566
00:34:46,694 --> 00:34:48,034
Objection.

567
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:52,285
For me to ignore the pending sec report

568
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:54,281
would have threatened my credibility,

569
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:56,057
so in my final speech,

570
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:58,648
I decided to mention the investigation

571
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,246
and even a...

572
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:03,418
possible action against us by the sec.

573
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,099
But...

574
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,940
you also continued to insist that
your company was financially sound?

575
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:12,031
- Yes
- And your employees trusted you?

576
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:13,587
Absolutely.

577
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:17,922
For almost 35 years, they knew
that I was fully committed to them.

578
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:22,577
There's nothing more important
to the well-being of a company

579
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:25,409
than the relationship
between its workers...

580
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,377
and its management.

581
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,406
That's...

582
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,229
sort of like a family, isn't it?

583
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,581
Yes, it's very much like a family.

584
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:42,473
And you were the head of the household?

585
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:45,521
You might say you were both husband

586
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:47,814
and father to your employees.

587
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:49,575
Objection.

588
00:35:54,313 --> 00:35:55,970
You could say that, yes.

589
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,690
And was it your job to
hold the family together?

590
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:06,347
Yes, it was.

591
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:08,951
- And you failed.
- Objection.

592
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:10,557
I'll rephrase.

593
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:13,916
I mean...

594
00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:15,026
was it...

595
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:18,021
very painful for you when you failed?

596
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,651
Objection.
I'm warning you...

597
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:21,550
- I'm merely asking Mr. Frobisher...
- counselor.

598
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:23,584
about his commitment to his company.

599
00:36:23,913 --> 00:36:25,434
Would you agree...

600
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:28,542
that the crumbling of
that relationship is nothing less,

601
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:31,175
really, than the
dissolution of a marriage?

602
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:35,194
You watch what you say.

603
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:38,410
Your position...

604
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,002
is that the collapse of your company

605
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:43,270
wasn't your fault, is that right?

606
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,563
Yes, that's correct.

607
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:49,070
I was misled by the accountants.

608
00:36:49,661 --> 00:36:52,347
I take full responsibility
but not the blame.

609
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,934
I understand, it's like marriages.

610
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:57,465
Companies just fail sometime.

611
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,329
Irreconcilable differences.

612
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,666
No one is to blame.
Is that your position?

613
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,679
One more like that,
and we will walk out.

614
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,494
Is that your position, Mr. Frobisher?

615
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:10,758
Or is the failure of this relationship,
as you call it,

616
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:13,889
- your failure? Your breach of trust...
- Patty, I'm warning you.

617
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,709
- your infidelity...
- You are out of line...

618
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,422
This is bullshit!

619
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:21,699
- This is bullshit!
- Art...

620
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,682
I'm done here. This is bullshit.

621
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:25,575
This is absolute
bullshit, and you know it.

622
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:27,285
<i>No, I'm done.</i>

623
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,573
- No, I'm done.
- Arthur...

624
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:30,939
I'll see you in court, you bitch.

625
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,298
Are you kidding me? Divorce?

626
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:51,556
You blindsided me, you know that, holly?

627
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:52,922
We'll talk about this later.

628
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:55,581
Did you want patty hewes
to use this against me?

629
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:58,274
- Of course not.
- Is that what you wanted? Then why now?

630
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,681
- Why now, Holly?
- This isn't

631
00:37:59,682 --> 00:38:01,804
- about the case, it's about us.
- Bullshit!

632
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:02,824
You screwed me!

633
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,712
You screwed yourself,
too, you know that?

634
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:07,583
This is our money. We're
talking about our money here.

635
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,092
- I'm sorry, Arthur.
- Look at this.

636
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,932
I gave you everything you ever wanted!

637
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,102
Stay away from me.

638
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:15,292
I could've ended this
anytime I wanted, you know.

639
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,586
I could've made this go away months ago.

640
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,111
- What are you do... Come on.
- Move the car.

641
00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:25,699
Did you even think about the kids?
You ever think about that?

642
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,890
You move that car, I will kill you.

643
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,585
Open the window; let's talk. Come on.

644
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:34,293
Holly, come on, open the window...

645
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:35,758
Open the...

646
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:41,993
Holly, talk to me, will ya?

647
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:44,108
Talk to me, will ya?

648
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:46,572
Stop the car!

649
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,393
Stop the damn car!

650
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:12,590
The hell with this.

651
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:16,797
I can't take any more of it.
Just make an offer.

652
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,310
How's my favorite divorce attorney?

653
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:26,597
Men and women still hate
each other, so I'm good.

654
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:31,954
Oh, boy, thanks for the tip.

655
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,284
I hope it didn't get you
in trouble with your client.

656
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,843
I just blamed it on
the clerks at the court.

657
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:41,597
High-profile divorce like this...

658
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,585
Yeah, they would have leaked
it to the press anyway.

659
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:47,668
Besides,

660
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:49,725
this thing's going
to be about custody...

661
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:51,530
and infidelity.

662
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:54,786
I owe you one.

663
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:01,028
Very nice.

664
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:02,714
Ellen, where are you going to work now?

665
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:05,543
I don't know. I have
no idea! I don't care.

666
00:40:05,544 --> 00:40:08,133
Do you know where I can
work? Where can I work?

667
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,367
You could a sushi photographer.

668
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:26,239
Raymond.

669
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:29,316
- 500
- 500?

670
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:31,773
<i>You heard me, patty.</i>

671
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:36,438
I daresay, it's as much
as you could've hoped for.

672
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,599
More than fair.

673
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,555
Let's wrap this up.

674
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,386
Patty?

675
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,922
Oh, it's tempting, Ray.

676
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:54,291
I could use a vacation.

677
00:40:55,312 --> 00:40:56,880
You deserve one.

678
00:40:57,564 --> 00:40:59,810
But I've still got work to do.

679
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,584
- Patty...
- No deal.

680
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:08,269
If Gregory Malina was worth killing,
he must have known something.

681
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:12,615
<i>If he testified, my guess, we'd
be talking ten figures.</i>

682
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,591
not so chatty now, are you, Ray?

683
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:24,868
You won't get more than
500 out of my client, Patty.

684
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,337
Evening, Ray.

685
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,891
It didn't matter, grades were in, and
she goes, what would I do in that case?

686
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:50,566
I'll tell you what I would do, Calder,

687
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:53,553
I'd... let me tell it.
I'll tell you what I would do.

688
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,534
I'd sub-penis'him.

689
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:57,590
she said sub-penis!

690
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,575
She said penis in law school.

691
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:02,362
And he was, like, who do you think
you are, Ms. Parsons?

692
00:42:02,363 --> 00:42:04,531
Calder with his silver streak,
right? Calder?

693
00:42:04,532 --> 00:42:07,022
I didn't know what I was
saying. He was so sleazy.

694
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:08,544
He kept asking me out on dates.

695
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:10,555
Who the hell is this guy?
where is that guy?

696
00:42:19,464 --> 00:42:20,526
Who is it?

697
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:21,547
Oh, it's my mom.

698
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:24,539
He wanted to take you to
a drive-in of viva zapata.

699
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:26,552
<i>This is Ellen Parsons.</i>

700
00:42:26,553 --> 00:42:28,916
<i>You can leave a message here or
reach me at my office:</i>

701
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:31,841
<i>212-752-4708.</i>

702
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:35,589
This is some pretty
interesting stuff you found.

703
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,587
I don't even want a goddamn centerpiece.

704
00:42:43,585 --> 00:42:45,527
Sorry, I didn't realize
it was the honeymoon.

705
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:46,975
I'm sorry. I hate that shit.

706
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:53,183
<i>You were right.</i>

707
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:58,406
Whoever tried to clean up
the body missed something.

708
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,564
What?

709
00:42:59,565 --> 00:43:02,138
Blood. I saw... the blood.

710
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:04,269
Look, I got to take
this to the police.

711
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,582
Did you get any word from patty?

712
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,435
I've left messages.

713
00:43:07,436 --> 00:43:09,509
I've told her that she's
got to come back here.

714
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:10,867
She doesn't want to come back.

715
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,049
Why not?

716
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,593
Patty is a lot of things, but
she's not a murderer.

717
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,504
I know things, Tom.

718
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:31,861
Things that could destroy her.

719
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:37,972
You think patty tried to kill you
to protect herself?

720
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,579
Well, the only way that I'm going
to find out is if I talk to her.

721
00:43:46,343 --> 00:43:47,808
Face-to-face.

722
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:51,733
<i>So call her.</i>

723
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:56,572
<i>Tell her I know she wants me dead.</i>

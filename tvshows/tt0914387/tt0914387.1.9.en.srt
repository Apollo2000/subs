2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,922
David and I had a fight.

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:07,410
Did you contact my parents?

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,720
They're on their way.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,940
And Patty?

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,570
We can't find her, but we're
still watching tom shayes.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,860
Bail is set at $1.5 million.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,010
Where are they taking her?

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,365
Riker's island.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,030
We are doing everything that we can
to make your grandfather comfortable.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,349
You've been great.

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,805
Lila.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,965
Patty needs to know who got
in that limo with Frobisher.

14
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,049
I didn't know who he was
when we first saw him.

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,330
What's his name?

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,905
He set Katie up to perjure herself.

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,853
Who's pulling your strings, Gregory?

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,790
This guy worked for
the SEC for 20 years.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
He was a lead investigator who
tried to take down Frobisher.

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,490
Five years ago, I went
out on a limb for you.

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,850
Gregory's a liability.
He's lost his nerve.

22
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,433
- We need a new strategy, Arthur.
- So find one.

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,808
I'd like to bring in a specialist,

24
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,143
help prepare you for the deposition

25
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:58,240
Mr. Malina's life was threatened.

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,161
It's quite possible that
the other side got to him.

27
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,200
You need to disappear.

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,180
I cannot protect you.

29
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,310
Without Gregory Malina,
we're going to lose the case.

Please don't do this.

32
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,760
I don't want this life.

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,495
We're done.

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,659
He called off the engagement?

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,070
Maybe we went too far.

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,310
Do you regret what we did?

37
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,190
6 WEEKS EARLIER

38
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,730
Cocoa.

39
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,094
Katie, Katie, it's me.

40
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:28,129
Get out of here!

41
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,280
Katie, please.

42
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,799
Get away from me, Gregory, or
I will call the police!

46
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,350
Nothing would make me happier than
to help take down Arthur Frobisher.

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Thank you for meeting
with us again, Mr. Moore.

48
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,195
I know it's frustrating,

49
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:27,087
but there was simply no proof
that Frobisher did anything wrong.

50
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:29,290
But you think he did?

51
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,139
Who doesn't?

52
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:34,443
Dumping his stock, accounting
irregularities.

53
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,060
I really wish I could be more helpful.

54
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,436
In the meantime,

55
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:41,673
if you want to talk strategy,
I'm at your disposal.

56
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,710
Well, there was one other thing
we wanted to ask you about.

57
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,140
We were wondering about one
of Frobisher's shareholders.

58
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,560
Does that name mean anything to you?

59
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,420
Gregory Malina.

60
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,143
Doesn't ring a bell.

61
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,550
But let me make some calls.
I'll see what I can find.

62
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,561
If there's one thing Arthur Frobisher
is good at, it's tying up loose ends.

63
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,680
All right, I'll see you soon, okay?

64
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:10,250
Hey, geez.

65
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,889
- David, hey.
- Lila.

66
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,790
You know what? You rescheduled
your rotation. I almost missed you.

67
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,206
That would have sucked.

68
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,319
Is everything okay, or.

69
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:23,480
I sold the defibrillator, and
you were amazingly helpful.

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,238
Which is why I'm going
to take you to dinner.

71
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,720
as a thank-you.

72
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,087
It's a little italian place.

73
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,110
I've got to pass on that.

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,290
Why?

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,850
You know why.

77
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,782
It's just dinner.

78
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,800
It is not just dinner,
and you know that.

79
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,429
Look,

80
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,938
your grandfather was sick.

81
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,777
I was the doctor who was
trying to help him.

82
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,880
It's very common for emotions
to get mixed up.

83
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,900
My emotions aren't mixed up.

84
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:55,660
We have talked about this.

85
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:58,300
I'm not available.

86
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,560
Gregory Malina owned Frobisher stock?

87
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:09,889
I don't know what you're talking.

88
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,290
Is there anything you
didn't do for that kid?

89
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,540
Gregory worked for me. That's all.

90
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,880
Save it, Ray.

91
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,870
I wouldn't give a shit about
your pathetic schoolgirl crush.

92
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,901
You watch yourself!

93
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:22,550
But I'm not gonna let
your bullshit take me down.

94
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,130
Malina emptied his bank account.

95
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,200
He's back in the states.
Did you know that?

96
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,760
So what do you want from me?

97
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,859
I want you on my team.

98
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,870
I don't understand.

99
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,927
I don't like you, Ray,

100
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,869
but I realized an amazing
thing on the way over here.

101
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,783
You're not my problem.

102
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,478
- Arthur is.
- Look, I have a duty.

103
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,360
Patty hewes is a ball's hair away
from breaking this thing wide open.

104
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,750
So I'm going to do
what you couldn't, Ray.

105
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,160
What is that?

106
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,041
Put an end to this thing.

107
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,820
The SEC has been a dead end so far.

108
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,050
But Mr. Moore is looking into
Gregory Malina's stock sale.

109
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,970
Good, because Gregory's back in play.

110
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,770
What did you find?

111
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,536
When Frobisher told larry popler
that Gregory Malina was alive.

112
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,070
he was telling the truth.

113
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:21,100
A flight manifest?

114
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,381
The day Gregory disappeared, he was
booked on a plane to mexico city.

115
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,250
Outside the reach of the court.

116
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,740
There was no sign of him until
he used his credit card yesterday.

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,734
He rented a car about 40 miles
north of the border in alamogordo.

118
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,072
Any idea why he'd come back?

119
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,095
When is the last time
you spoke to Katie?

120
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,273
Not since she went back home.

121
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,779
That could be it. He felt
bad about setting her up.

122
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,410
He tried to call her after
he burned her as a witness.

123
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,020
Get in touch with her.

124
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,020
I got one of these in the mail, too.

125
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,430
You going to this thing?

126
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,530
The gala for the blind justice project?

127
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,940
No, I'm not.

128
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,230
Says Patty hewes is
giving the keynote speech.

129
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,830
Could be interesting.

130
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,380
Art, don't even think about it.

131
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,675
You're not going.

132
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,515
Nancy, it's good to see you.

133
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:55,143
- Good to see you.
- This is art.

134
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,810
Thank you for coming in.

135
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,120
Pleasure.

136
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,430
- Yeah, let's, uh, sit down there.
- All right.

137
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,213
So, Ray says you're
the best out there at,

138
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:07,298
well, preparing a witness.

139
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,330
I hope I can help.

140
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,700
Good.

141
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,670
What exactly are we gonna do?

142
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,040
Do you ever sing around the
house? Maybe in the shower?

143
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:19,920
Nope.

144
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,020
Oh, come on.

145
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,200
I hum.

146
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:25,880
This exercise will help you relax.

147
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,420
You want to look for
a way in, not a way out.

148
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,320
I'd do a lot better
with Simon and Garfunkel.

149
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,140
You can do whatever you want,

150
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,049
but you're going to have
to look comfortable answering

151
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,571
Patty's questions about
corporate malfeasance,

152
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,905
about accounting irregularities

153
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:48,593
and about why you stole
the life savings of 5,000 people.

154
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,220
That might be easier than singing.

155
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,170
All right.

156
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,560
Yes, mom, I'm fine.

157
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,880
How's montreal?

158
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,196
<i>Montreal is great but
I left my video camera.</i>

159
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,224
Yeah, I know.

160
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:15,510
Dad left a message. He left it behind.

161
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,390
He didn't give me an address, though.
Where do you want me to send it?

162
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,630
Hold on, mom; that's your phone.

163
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,010
<i>Okay, dear. You can answer it.</i>

164
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,820
Hello?

165
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,080
<i>Katie?</i>

166
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,490
Katie, it's Ellen. I've been trying.

167
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:30,540
Shit.

168
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,940
Ms. Parsons. Ms. Parsons.

169
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,470
Mr. Moore.

170
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,260
Please get in.

171
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,896
Look, I want to help you.

172
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,887
I wasted years of my life
going after Frobisher,

173
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:13,000
and my hands were tied
every step of the way.

174
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,215
Why?

175
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,510
Why?

176
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,595
Because the man has
friends in high places.

177
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,122
But I know things,

178
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:25,655
information that we couldn't use
in the government case

179
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,510
that would be invaluable to
Patty hewes in a civil trial.

180
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:31,820
Like what?

181
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,120
I sit on boards, Miss Parsons.

182
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,760
I advise political campaigns.

183
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,140
I will not go public.

184
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,601
If you call me as a witness,

185
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:43,331
I'll lie.

186
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,920
Frobisher is a powerful man.

187
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,471
You want my help?

188
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,760
That's the deal.

189
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,458
Talk to your boss.

190
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,563
But for now,

191
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:05,942
start by looking into Arlington.

192
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,600
I have bad news.

193
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,270
What?

194
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,549
It's confirmed.

195
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,325
What is?

196
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,360
You've lost your mind.

197
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,889
Your keys.

198
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,620
How is that possible?

199
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,625
You must've had a psychotic break.

200
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,440
You know what you need?

201
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,346
A weekend at the beach,

202
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,029
the hamptons.

203
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,260
You serious?

204
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,310
Tom told me about a great place.

205
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,244
I think if we don't get
away, I may lose you forever.

206
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,240
<i>Yes, absolutly.</i>

207
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,470
<i>And these were the spvs
that you had created?</i>

208
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,212
<i>Yes, I think in our country,</i>

209
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:23,547
<i>the more popular term is spe.</i>

210
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:25,110
<i>Spe?</i>

211
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,850
<i>That's right, spe.</i>

212
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,230
<i>Special purpose entity.</i>

213
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,642
<i>And aren't these spes</i>

214
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,194
<i>commonly incorporated
toward illegitimate ends?</i>

215
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,595
Do you have a question or are you
just trying to ruin our concentration?

216
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:42,490
Neither.
George moore came to see me last night.

217
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,590
Where?

218
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,520
Outside my apartment.

219
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,190
He met with you alone?

220
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,430
He wants to help us off the record.

221
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,580
How?

222
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,706
Arlington. He told me to look into it.

223
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,870
Arlington, Virginia.

224
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,480
Some girl was killed in a car crash.

225
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,690
It was Frobisher's car.

226
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,620
It was 25 years ago. It's old news.

227
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,120
There were conflicting accounts.

228
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,836
But the official police report backed
Frobisher's story

229
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:12,300
that the girl was driving.

230
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,160
Yeah, it did, but I ran a history.

231
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,450
And in the last 25 years,

232
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,621
the girl's family went from
living in a trailer park

233
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,092
to being the biggest
landowner in Arlington.

234
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,150
So you think Frobisher's
paying people off?

235
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,050
He screws up, he buys silence.

236
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,709
Katie,Gregory, it's Frobisher's M.O.

237
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,342
That won't help us in the deposition
unless we can back it up.

238
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,584
I want to meet with Moore again,

239
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:36,229
push him further, work the relationship.

240
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,261
All right.

241
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,839
I'll go with you.

242
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,630
No, wrong move, Tom.

243
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,010
He approached Ellen alone,
that's the way he wants it.

244
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,693
Just hear me out, please.

245
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,630
Hanson police department, please.

246
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,280
There's a warrant out for my arrest.

247
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,750
Yes, it's an emergency.

248
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,149
You talk to the police, they're gonna
send me back to New York

249
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,699
and Frobisher will kill me.

250
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:16,921
I'm not running anymore.

251
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,110
You can do whatever you want.

252
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,500
You tell me one lie, and
I will cut your dick off.

253
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,760
Ms. Parsons?

254
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,209
Yes?

255
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,593
I'm sorry to bother you, but
we really need to talk.

256
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
I'm sorry, what is this in reference to?

257
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,830
Your fiancי.

258
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,040
What about him?

259
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,287
I think we're gonna
want to talk privately.

260
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,955
Everything that happened
to you was my fault.

261
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:07,361
The only reason why you got involved
in any of this was because

262
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:09,525
I brought you to the condo that night.

263
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,777
Ray fiske gave me a thousand shares of
Frobisher's stock to go down to florida,

264
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,569
rent the condo in my name.

265
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,810
What for?

266
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,989
At the time, I had no idea.

267
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,062
I didn't ask, it was a lot of money.
I was broke.

268
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,086
It turns out that Frobisher
was going to meet 

269
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:27,520
with some guy from the government.

270
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:28,730
Who?

271
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,570
I can't tell you that.

272
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,871
It would put you at
too much risk, trust me.

273
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:38,133
But this whole thing started
because he thought that you saw him.

274
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:39,153
But I didn't.

275
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,680
I told them that, but
they didn't believe me.

276
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:48,750
So they just try to buy
me off with a restaurant.

277
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,669
But they kept postponing it.

278
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,391
They had to keep you quiet
during the government trial.

279
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,900
And what about you? How long
have you been on their payroll?

280
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,258
A few weeks after florida, they...

281
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,077
hooked me up with a job
at the consulting firm.

282
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,428
And who was the guy in the limo?

283
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:16,840
I have no idea.

284
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,311
Once you started talking to Patty Hewes,

285
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:20,049
they just needed to burn
you as a witness.

286
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,130
So they gave you luke
Richards'name to set me up.

287
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,900
They used us both.

288
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,430
And we let them.

289
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,592
These guys have all the power,

290
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,530
and they're convinced
everyone's out to get them.

291
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,090
How do you know David, Miss.

292
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,640
Dimeo. Lila Dimeo.

293
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,236
I met him at the hospital,
he was treating my grandfather.

294
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,668
And what exactly can I help you
with, Miss. Dimeo?

295
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,190
God, I'm a terrible liar.

296
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,856
I'm not here about David.

297
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,568
Then why are you here?

298
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,890
I'm here about you.

299
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,511
David doesn't love you anymore.

300
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,690
Excuse me?

301
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,300
Who are you?

302
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,170
I must seem crazy,

303
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:19,791
but I thought you should know.

304
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,830
I've been sleeping with him.

305
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,110
I think you better leave.

306
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,930
Ellen, there's no point in getting mad.

307
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,384
You need to leave.

308
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,517
We can't change how we feel.

309
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,830
What are you doing?

310
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,520
Security.

311
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,210
Fifth floor, Hewes and associates.

312
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,481
Ellen Parsons'office.

313
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,860
I feel sorry for you.

314
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,100
Right away, thank you.

315
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,573
You didn't deserve this.

316
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,722
<i>Why weren't you at my arraignment?</i>

317
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:06,749
I tried.

318
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,520
<i>I tried, but with everything
that's been going on.</i>

319
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,140
<i>What?</i>

320
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,001
<i>What happened with you and Patty?</i>

321
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,149
I know that you're not
telling me everything.

322
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,903
He called off the engagement?

323
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,300
Maybe we went too far.

324
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,710
Do you regret what we did?

325
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,173
So there's bourbon in the kitchen.

326
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,300
And remember to walk cory.

327
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:51,940
Where can I reach you?

328
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,204
I'll be at the beach house.
Tom has the number.

329
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,470
Storm cleared montauk last night.
Should be a perfect weekend.

330
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,800
Thank you, Perry.

331
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,260
Ellen.

332
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,690
everything's going to be all right.

333
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,857
That's insane. She is crazy

334
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,740
Who is she?

335
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,200
Her name is Lila Dimeo.

336
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,610
She's lying, we did not sleep together.

337
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,944
She said that you
treated her grandfather.

338
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,440
Yeah, I did.

339
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,949
I met her at the hospital.

340
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,850
But then her grandfather was released.

341
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,232
And did you see her after that?

342
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,750
Yes.

343
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,030
No. yeah.

344
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,490
Yes or no?

345
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:16,780
She had this medical equipment
that she wanted to sell,

346
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,354
so I took a look at it for her.

347
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:19,950
What?

348
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,910
She asked me to price
a defibrillator for her.

349
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,345
Where?

350
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,890
At her apartment.

351
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,430
So you were at her apartment?

352
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,690
What the hell were you
doing at her apartment?

353
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,220
I just, I gave her a price and
that's it. Nothing happened.

354
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,180
Then why are you so uncomfortable?

355
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,540
Because I feel like you're
accusing me of something.

356
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,529
David, a woman came into my office today

357
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,219
and told me that she was
sleeping with you.

358
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,790
Listen to me.

359
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:47,219
I hardly know her.

360
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,800
Clearly, the woman is nuts.

361
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,360
Well, stay away from her.

362
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,004
Tell her to stay away from me.

363
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,940
Patty Hewes knows about Arlington.

364
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,942
- How in hell did.
- I told her associate.

365
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,400
Jesus!

366
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,982
The last thing Arthur wants is for
that shit to come out in a deposition.

367
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:14,290
That is a mighty risky
game you're playing.

368
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,520
Relax.

369
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,360
Arlington's all his.

370
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,620
You and I have nothing to do with that.

371
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,497
And when that asshole finds out that
Patty Hewes knows about it

372
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:24,676
he'll have to settle.

373
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,110
Just shut up and play your part.

374
00:22:38,595 --> 00:22:40,270
- Ms. Hewes.
- Chin.

375
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,270
- I was stunned when I learned.
- Elbows off the table.

376
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,264
Ms. Hewes, I was stunned when I learned
that the accounting firm had...

377
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,365
defrauded my company.

378
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,642
Don't blink when you say that.

379
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,270
You were stunned?

380
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,500
Why is that?

381
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,440
I mean, you cashed out just in time.

382
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,164
You walked away with millions.

383
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,467
I gave that company everything I had.

384
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,443
and I failed.

385
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,410
my employees.

386
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,488
my family.

387
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:27,961
I failed pretty much everyone
who ever believed in me.

388
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,700
Bullshit.

389
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,434
Stop making speeches.
You're trying too hard.

390
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,800
Bullshit?

391
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,610
Don't you tell me bullshit.

392
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,710
You have no idea what I've been through.

393
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:45,723
Art.

394
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:48,310
This is why she's here.

395
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,300
Don't tell me bullshit.

396
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,617
People expect a ceo to be strong.

397
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,567
They see too much of the soft side,

398
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:04,406
looks like an act.

399
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,821
You've got to be heartfelt

400
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,426
without sounding like a pussy.

401
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,740
Now, you think you can do that?

402
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,930
All right.

403
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,753
All right, fair enough.

404
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,456
Let's do this again.

405
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,372
Since when does the sec
investigate car accidents?

406
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:37,930
I'm not going to give you everything.

407
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,720
Okay.

408
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,148
Cindy lambert died in
a car crash in 1983.

409
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:46,720
Frobisher said he wasn't driving, and
the lambert family backed him up.

410
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,700
- And now they're very rich.
- Is that so?

411
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,242
So I'm guessing the lambert
family was given Frobisher stock.

412
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,040
If the SEC knew this, why didn't
they use it in the criminal trial?

413
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,690
The judge excluded it on relevance.

414
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,670
We were going after Frobisher for
insider trading and accounting fraud.

415
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,381
What are you getting out of this?

416
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,040
I tried to take Frobisher
down and I failed.

417
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,540
I still want justice. No.

418
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,150
If you did, you'd go public.

419
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,860
I think you have other reasons.

420
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,930
What happened between you two,
Mr. Moore?

421
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,520
Did Frobisher block
your political career?

422
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,309
Blackball you from his country club?

423
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,830
Sleep with your wife?

424
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,640
You have the truth.

425
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,980
Now use it against him.

426
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,622
Patty Hewes doesn't like
surprises or hidden agendas.

427
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,790
I better not find out you have one.

428
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,340
Why did you tell me
that you were married?

429
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,497
It was their idea.

430
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,053
So you wouldn't tell anyone about us.

431
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,767
And after Florida,

432
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,619
when you helped me
with all of that stuff,

433
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,590
was that all a part of the setup, too?

434
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,987
No.

435
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,750
That was me.

436
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,620
This is gonna sound crazy. I know.

437
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,271
what I did to
you, Katie, is unforgiveable.

438
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,530
but I liked you.

439
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,102
I've always liked you.

440
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,050
When I was in Mexico hiding, I thought.

441
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,245
I just.

442
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,100
I just wanted to see you again.

443
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,504
I thought.

444
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:40,213
maybe if we spoke, if I...

445
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,177
if I could just...

446
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,523
explain things, then
maybe we could just...

447
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,140
You ruined my life.

448
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:36,100
- Hello?
- Hey.

449
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,370
<i>It's me.</i>

450
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,430
I know I shouldn't be calling.

451
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,748
I just wanted to say I've realized.

452
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,772
I was wrong back then.

453
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:52,281
Well.

454
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,960
you were?

455
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,345
<i>Yeah.</i>

456
00:27:57,482 --> 00:27:58,994
To let you.

457
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,070
expect more from me.

458
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,801
<i>You know, the last time I saw you, you
told me</i>

459
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:08,328
it was too late to change.

460
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,539
It's not.

461
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,790
You can change.

462
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,630
<i>And you can withdraw from the case, Ray.</i>

463
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,978
Cut those guys off.
All they do is hurt people.

464
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:22,870
It's not that simple.

465
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,760
<i>It is. You're not like them.</i>

466
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,160
I know you want to do the right thing.

467
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,708
I'm sorry, Gregory.

468
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,657
For everything.

469
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,273
Take care, Ray.

470
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:08,723
The hotel's totally booked.

471
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:10,970
I don't know where we can
go on such short notice.

472
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,110
This is your first weekend off in what.

473
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,260
Forever.

474
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,760
So ask for the beach house.

475
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,889
Ask who?

476
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,810
No, thanks.

477
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,480
Mr. Moore insists on total anonymity.

478
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,270
We'll never get him to testify.

479
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,974
I question the guy's motives.

480
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,730
That's all right.

481
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,760
If we can confirm that the lambert
family was given Frobisher stock,

482
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,374
we can use it against
Frobisher in the deposition.

483
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,410
Good.

484
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,310
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

485
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:42,930
Ellen wants to use your beach house.

486
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,420
No. I was just.

487
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,148
She wants to go away for thweekend.

488
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,433
Be my guest.

489
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:49,789
Thank you, but I couldn't possibly.

490
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,023
Ellen, it's just sitting there empty.

491
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,439
I have the gala this weekend.

492
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,220
Well, okay. Thank you.

493
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,570
Get the keys from uncle pete.

494
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:07,480
<i>I've been trying to reach Patty. </i>

495
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:08,689
She won't call me back.

496
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,390
<i>Go to the beach house.</i>

497
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,872
I will, I will.

498
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:13,819
But, Ellen.

499
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,709
<i>Go to the beach house, Tom.</i>

500
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,340
Patty, it's me again.

501
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,161
You need to call me back.

502
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,810
Ah, Tommy!

503
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,754
Didn't hear you coming.

504
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,710
Have you seen Patty?

505
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,810
I was gonna ask you.

506
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,470
I need the keys to the beach house.

507
00:31:59,163 --> 00:32:01,172
My name is Gregory Malina.

508
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,560
I've made this tape because right now,

509
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,846
I don't trust anyone...

510
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,850
and I want to make sure
my story gets out.

511
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,988
In 2002, I met Ray fiske.

512
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,855
I didn't know it at the time,

513
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:24,330
but he was Arthur Frobisher's lawyer.

514
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,824
Shortly after,

515
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:30,486
Mr. Fiske sent me down
to Florida to help set up a meeting.

516
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,549
I didn't know what
this meeting was about,

517
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,329
but I know that Arthur Frobisher

518
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,314
was in contact with a member of
the securities and exchange commission.

519
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,596
The name of that member...

520
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:50,588
is George Moore.

521
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:58,100
Ah, keys to the castle, my lady.

522
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,360
Ah, thanks, pete.

523
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,170
And your chariot.

524
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:02,279
What's this?

525
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,429
Patty heard you're renting
a car and she won't have it.

526
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,380
Insists that you take hers.

527
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,980
Thank you.

528
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:38,590
What's the matter, boy?
Need to go out?

529
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:42,237
You were right about
lila dimeo, she's nuts.

530
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,514
What do you mean?

531
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,010
I did a background on her.

532
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,240
Sophomore year, she got kicked out of
college for stalking her professor,

533
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,520
and since then, she's had three
restraining orders put on her.

534
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:54,250
Jesus.

535
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,076
Stay away from her, David.

536
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,100
Come on boy

537
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,476
Stay.

538
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,260
Oh, my god.

539
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:25,939
Holy shit.

540
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,650
Gregory?

541
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:50,130
It's done.

542
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,285
It was Katie Connor's area code.

543
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:56,231
You were right.

544
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,940
Good.

545
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,180
Oh, my god!

546
00:36:34,271 --> 00:36:35,920
This is amazing!

547
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,372
I can't this !

548
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,433
Come here.

549
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:44,920
Come on

550
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,370
Arlington?

551
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,860
She's gonna dredge up that shit?

552
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,584
I thought we had it sealed!

553
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,120
Well, Patty's people came to me.

554
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,310
They know the family owns stock.

555
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,145
Patty's gonna say you paid him off.

556
00:37:00,581 --> 00:37:03,527
You know something? I don't give a shit.
You know what? I'll handle it.

557
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,627
You know, Arlington,

558
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:09,036
Katie Connor, Gregory Malina.
Let her depose me.

559
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,670
We're going to trial, Ray.

560
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,260
No, we're not.

561
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,650
It's not even relevant! That was
25 years ago, for christ's sake!

562
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,230
It has nothing to do with this trial!

563
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,058
Patty gets it into the deposition,
she'll undermine your credibility.

564
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:24,250
Burden of proof's lower
in a civil trial, Art.

565
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,043
Fact is, she'll use it
to establish an M.O.

566
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,724
She'll say it proves
you have a history...

567
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:33,044
of buying off witnesses.

568
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,670
You got to settle.

569
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:38,940
He's right, Arthur.

570
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,330
I heard him, George.

571
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,907
What are you gonna do?

572
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,681
When the blind justice project asked me

573
00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:57,379
to present this award tonight
to richard lamontagne,

574
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,948
I didn't know what to say.

575
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,015
Not because I was flattered,

576
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,817
but because I didn't even
know who he was.

577
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,480
so I googled him, and you might
be surprised to learn that richie,

578
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,809
in his youth,

579
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:13,709
won three atv motocross championships.

580
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,048
I mean, I was.

581
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,682
until i realized I
spelled his name wrong.

582
00:38:19,704 --> 00:38:22,007
How is it that a woman
who's argued cases

583
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,260
before the supreme court hates
to give a speech in public?

584
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,986
There are nine people
on the supreme court

585
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:30,541
and only six are awake on any given day.

586
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:33,080
Excuse me.
May I?

587
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,420
- Okay.
- Thank you.

588
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,472
Shall we?

589
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,560
I caught you on tv last week.

590
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,377
You don't like me very much, do you?

591
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,780
Why would you say that?

592
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,480
But why should you?
You don't really know me.

593
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,203
So that's why you're here.

594
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,317
I'm here...

595
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,904
because I'm willing to negotiate.

596
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:10,540
There's nothing to negotiate.
This isn't about money.

597
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,220
Oh, no, no, no, of course not.

598
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,850
I know you don't give a
shit about justice, Patty.

599
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,478
So what do you want?

600
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,049
I want you disgraced.

601
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,052
I want history to erase
your every achievement.

602
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,060
I want you to feel the disgust

603
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:32,672
in your children's eyes when
they look on you in shame.

604
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:40,350
This has been lovely.

605
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,918
It's rude to abandon a
girl on the dance floor.

606
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:48,022
The song's over, Patty.

607
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,750
Almost as bad as abandoning
a girl in a burning car.

608
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,610
All right.

609
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,550
Let's get this over with, shall we?

610
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:06,550
$300 million.

611
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:07,904
Must have been horrible,

612
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:11,126
her face smashed clear
through the windshield.

613
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,110
$450 million.

614
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,833
Blood everywhere,

615
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,868
gasoline, searing heat.

616
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,030
I'm told that you never forget
the smell of burning flesh.

617
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,040
$850 million, that's my final offer.

618
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,289
Did she shout out your
name when she died?

619
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:29,930
Arthur!

620
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,350
Coffee's ready.

621
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,790
Or do you just want to call it a night?

622
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
No.

623
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,310
No, sorry.

624
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,720
No, I want you to keep
playing Patty Hewes.

625
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,860
6 WEEKS LATER

626
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:25,360
Patty, it's me again.

627
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,720
Where the hell are you?

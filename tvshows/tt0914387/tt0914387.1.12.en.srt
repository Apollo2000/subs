3
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:04,899
<i>I don't know how to tell you this.</i>

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,699
<i>Somehow Ellen's in jail.</i>

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,700
<i>She was arrested for killing David.</i>

6
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,300
David doesn't love you anymore.

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,800
I've been sleeping with him.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Clearly the woman is nuts.

9
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,399
There's always a solution.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,612
What kind of a solution?

11
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:17,830
A permanent one.

12
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:19,099
My name is Gregory Malina,

13
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,850
and I want to make
sure my story gets out.

14
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,900
I got a letter from Greg Malina.

15
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,400
It's over, Art.

16
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,999
The photos link Ray
Fiske to Gregory Malina,

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,999
and the documents prove that
Fiske's guilty of insider trading.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,199
You should be able to use that.

19
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,599
You can have your job back.

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
I don't want it.

21
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
Gregory?

22
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:38,500
You're blackmailing me, Patty.

23
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,600
We really have to wear
these for the rest of our lives?

25
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,600
It's kind of terrifying, huh?

26
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
I don't know.

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,300
Maybe we're making a big mistake.

28
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,600
Excuse me?

29
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,914
About the rings.

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,327
Maybe we should've gone gold.

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,700
What are you smiling at?

32
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:20,700
You're gonna look sexy when you're bald.

33
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:26,600
Bald?

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
No way.

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,562
I'm going toupee all the way.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,200
No, no, don't.

37
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,900
- Why?
- It's bad luck.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,300
We should put them away,
you're making me nervous.

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,700
We should lock them up.

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,900
They're not insured yet.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Who's gonna take them?

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,700
No one, if they're hidden.

43
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:57,800
Please, babe, it'll put my mind at ease.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All right.

45
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,400
Do you have your key?

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,900
It's on the desk.

47
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,600
Put them in our hiding place.

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Hello?

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
What's wrong?

50
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,191
I'll be there right away.

51
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:32,400
Who was that?

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,700
It was my sister.

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,400
She's in the Village.
They had another fight.

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Patty?

55

56
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:57,500
He shot himself.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,029
I need your help.

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,300
Have you called the police?

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Not yet.

60
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,000
Who else knows about this?

61
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:09,800
Just us.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Take this.

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,600
Put it somewhere safe.

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,548
No one...

65
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,571
can ever know what he was doing here.

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
I understand.

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,900
Not even David.

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Ellen?

69
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,900
I can trust you?

70
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:45,100
Yes.

71
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:56,573
Damages Season 1 Episode 12
There's No 'We' Anymore

Capture: Swsub.com
Synchro : Gaillots.

73
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
Parsons.

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Got a roommate.

75
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,100
What's a matter, rich girl?

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,900
Daddy won't post bail?

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,500
Lower bunk's mine.

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,099
Bitch, don't even.

79
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,999
I ripped off a convenience store

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,293
and a bodega before they busted my ass.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
I killed my fianc×™.

82
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:12,528
A WEEK EARLIER

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,500
Babe?

84
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,400
How's your sister?

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,799
Oh, she's fine.

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,900
You know, Carrie...
it's always a crisis.

87
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,195
You're leaving?

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,399
Yeah, I just got called in.

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm gonna see you later. Okay?

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Okay. Hey.

91
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
I love you.

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I love you, too.

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
How do you know Raymond Fiske?

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Patty?

95
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,989
We were opposing counsel on a case.

96
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Is it common practice
to conduct business this late?

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,699
Ray called me at the last minute,

98
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,000
he said he needed to see me urgently.

99
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,200
What happened when he got here?

100
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,999
He'd proposed a settlement offer.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,219
When...

102
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:23,500
I told him that my clients didn't
accept it, he got upset.

103
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,700
Did he threaten you?

104
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,900
No.

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,488
He just got up and left. I...

106
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,200
I thought the meeting was over.

107
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,628
But then he came back and...

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
did it.

109
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,625
There are no powder burns on the woman.

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,100
Blood spatter, angle of the trajectory,
position of the body.

111
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
This was a suicide.

112
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,900
Okay.

113
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:58,294
Can I take her home now?

114
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,500
Yes.

115
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,200
You're free to go, Ms. Hewes.

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,200
But we'd like you to stay available
in case we have any other questions.

117
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Of course.

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Hello?

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,300
What? No, slow-slow down. What...

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,700
You're... What?

121
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Where?

122
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,023
Jesus Christ.

123
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,850
How long have you
been standing out there?

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,500
No, no, hold on. Hold on a second.

125
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,600
Jesus.

126
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,999
These are Detectives Wright
and Fleming. They have a few questions

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,999
they need to ask you.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Nah, excuse me. But where-where's Ray?

129
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,499
Why don't we come inside.

130
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,119
- Nah, where...
- This is about Ray.

131
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:57,937
What do you mean?
What happened?

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,000
Last night, he took his own life.

133
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,485
We have reason to believe

134
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:07,092
that they were meeting
to discuss your latest settlement offer.

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,700
That's entirely possible.

136
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,699
We're in negotiations.

137
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,400
Were you aware that there was
a meeting scheduled for last night?

138
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,800
No. No, I wasn't.

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,700
Has Mallory been told?

140
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,000
Amos is there now.

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
We should be with her.

142
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,400
Mr. Frobisher,

143
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,425
when was the last time
that you spoke to Mr. Fiske?

144
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,100
Yesterday on the phone.

145
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,600
George Moore is dead.

146
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:41,200
I heard.

147
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,499
I don't even really remember
what we were talking about.

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,399
Some... probably details
about the case.

149
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Did Mr. Fiske give any indication
that he was distressed or...?

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,800
No.

151
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,000
It's over, Art.

152
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
What is?

153
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,999
Are you aware of anything
in Mr. Fiske's life

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,100
that could have driven
him to take this action?

155
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
No. No, there was nothing.

156
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
You all right?

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,100
I'm fine.

158
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Why did he do it?

159
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
I don't know.

160
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
Must have been horrible.

161
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,200
I want you to shut down the office.

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Send everyone home for a few days.

164
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,700
Okay.

165
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:50,059
There's going to be
a hearing with Judge Toomey.

166
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,400
I want you to take it.

167
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:56,600
I'll, uh, I'll-I'll handle it.

168
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:58,200
I'll be gone for a while.

169
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,700
Sure.

170
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:03,113
Anything you need.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Thanks, Tom.

172
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,225
Come on, boy. Come on.

173
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,000
I think I should cancel my flight.

174
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:19,700
Phil, go to your conference.

175
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:22,600
Not if Michael's going upstate
tonight with Henry's family.

176
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm happy to bail, Mom.

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,299
Henry and I can go up anytimewe want.

178
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,400
No, no, I don't want
you two changing your plans.

179
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,800
Patty, you shouldn't be alone.

180
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,600
I prefer to be alone.

181
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Really.

182
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
You sure?

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,700
You know I'd tell you otherwise.

184
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,176
I want to go to the beach house.

185
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,800
I want to get away.

186
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,008
I knew Ray Fiske

187
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:47,302
well over 20 years.

188
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:49,599
He was a great lawyer.
<i> A WEEK EARLIER</i>

189
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,700
And a friend.

190
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
We're all devastated, Your Honor.

191
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,700
You have my sympathies.

192
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
Something like this happens,

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,400
it gives us all pause.

194
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,500
Needless to say,
we've been forced to regroup.

195
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,883
New attorneys are just beginning

196
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:08,300
to familiarize themselves with
 Mr. Frobisher's case.

197
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:09,500
I appreciate that.

198
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,499
The trial was set
for the end of next month

199
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,896
and I see you're requesting
a six-month extension.

200
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,600
Mr. Shayes?

201
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:19,414
Well, first of all,

202
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:22,226
let me express my condolences
to the entire firm.

203
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,799
We respect the difficult position
Mr. Phillips finds himself in.

204
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,200
We understand the challenge of getting
new team members up to speed, but...

205
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,999
our responsibilities lie with
Mr. Frobisher's 5,000 employees

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,895
who can't pay their bills.

207
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,078
For them, justice delayed...

208
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,200
-  is truly...
- I'd have to agree, Mr. Phillips.

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,500
You have a proposed order?

210
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,400
A one-month continuance.

211
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,100
Mr. Phillips,
the court empathizes with your position.

212
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,561
Thank you, Your Honor.

213
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,566
But after one month,

214
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,917
we press on.

215
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,755
Ray left something for you.

216
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
It's on the desk.

217
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,300
Take your time, Arthur.

218
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Thank you.

219
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,181
<i>In case anytihing happens to me, I made
a videotape explainning every thing.</i>

220
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:25,152
<i>I wanted you to know. There's still time
to do the right thing. Gregory.</i>

221
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,300
Ray Fiske killed himself last night.

222
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,900
It's all over the news.

223
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,500
I heard.

224
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:00,400
David, what is it?

225
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
Your sister called
to see how you were doing.

226
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
She said she hasn't spoken
to you in three weeks.

227
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,100
Where were you last night?

228
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
You told me that you were fired.

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,499
I was, but Patty needed me
to meet with George Moore.

230
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,899
You didn't think you should tell me?

231
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
I didn't want you involved.

232
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,299
These people are dangerous.

233
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,817
I thought the less that
you knew, the better.

234
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:37,234
This information that
you got from George Moore...

235
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:40,399
Shows that Ray Fiske is
part of the whole conspiracy.

236
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,900
So Patty used it as
leverage against Fiske.

237
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,400
Is that why he killed himself?

238
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:47,199
I don't know.

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,499
Patty was blackmailing him.

240
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,099
- Fiske was guilty of corruption.
- Enough, Ellen!

241
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
David, listen,

242
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,100
these men killed Gregory Malina.

243
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,194
They probably killed George Moore.

244
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,717
They do whatever the hell they want,

245
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:02,121
and they'll keep doing it
until somebody stops them.

246
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,791
Frobisher has to take responsibility.

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,900
Winning this case is the only
way that that is going to happen.

248
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And then what?

249
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:10,299
What do you mean?

250
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,900
Are you going to go back to Patty?

251
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,152
This is the kind of work
that I want to do, David.

252
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,800
Patty may be a horrible person, but...

253
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,900
these guys are ruthless.

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,400
I don't know what you are doing anymore.

255
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,700
I know exactly what I'm doing.

256
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Really?

257
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,699
A man's dead now. Was that the plan?

258
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,388
You of all people should understand
after what they did to Katie.

259
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,099
I don't care about them;
I care about us.

260
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,199
This is what it takes.

261
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,599
I don't want this life.

262
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,499
Someone has to hold
these guys accountable.

263
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,300
You decide right now:
do you want us or do you want this job?

264
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,900
- Please don't do this.
- Right now.

265
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:50,449
Right...

266
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:51,611
now!

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,500
You can't decide, can you?

268
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,900
- David...
- No.

269
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,300
We're done, Ellen.

270
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Hello?

271
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,200
Stop, stop it, just stop. Listen to me.

272
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,100
Damn it, will you just... no!

273
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,800
Lila, you need to stop calling me!

274
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm sorry to disturb you.

275
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
What do you want?

276
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,099
One of your neighbors called and said
they heard a bit of a commotion earlier.

277
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,700
I just wanted to make
sure you two are all right.

278
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah, we're fine.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
Is your fianc×™e here?

280
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
She went out.

281
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,600
But everything's okay?

282
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,100
We're great.

283
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
- Have a nice night.
- Hey, you, too.

284
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,865
Malina made a goddamn videotape.

285
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:36,902
<i>Where is it?</i>

286
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't know, I don't know,
but right now that tape is my life.

287
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,900
<i>When he came back into the country,
Malina went to the chef.<i/>

288
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,700
Katie Connor?

289
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,194
Do you still have people on her?

290
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,400
<i>Of course.</i>

291
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,599
All right,
all right, good, good, good, all right.

292
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,399
Just do anything you have to do,

293
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,700
but get me that tape.

294
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,000
Hey, it's me.

295
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,899
I... I'm so sorry.

296
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,763
Just please...

297
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,499
Just please call me back.

298
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,300
Okay?

299
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,900
Jesus Christ.

300
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Katie.

301
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Can I come in?

302
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Of course.

303
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I just saw Ellen go. She seemed upset.
Is everything okay?

304
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

305
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Good.

306
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,400
You're back in town?
You didn't call.

307
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,565
What are you doing here?

308
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
What is this?

309
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
Gregory left it with me.

310
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,800
Give it to Ellen. She needs to see this.

311
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,100
Okay.

312
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
I gotta go.

313
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:45,681
Wait a minute. That's it?

314
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,799
You're leaving?
I haven't seen you in months.

315
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,700
I don't want to be
here when she gets back.

316
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,950
I'll call you tomorrow.

317
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:40,099
You okay?

318
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,212
Yeah, I...
I just came by to grab some stuff.

319
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:46,700
I thought it would be
better when no one was around.

320
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:49,791
You heard about Fiske?

321
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
Yeah, it's awful.

322
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,700
Doing it in front of Patty.

323
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,900
How is she doing?

324
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,500
She's pretty shaken up.

325
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,386
Have you seen her since she...

326
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:06,799
let you go?

327
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,900
I don't think Patty wants to see me.

328
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,799
Yeah, what you said was pretty...

329
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Stupid?

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,291
I was going to say ballsy,

331
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,800
but, yeah, stupid... stupid works.

332
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,200
So, you know, we should...
we should get some coffee sometime.

333
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,600
Yeah, I'd like that.

334
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

335
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:35,100
- Take care.
- You, too.

336
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,500
- Who is it?
- Mallory Fiske.

337
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,800
Oh, shit.

338
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,279
Ray was...

339
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,887
medicated, you know.

340
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,500
For the last several years.

341
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,200
He could just get...

342
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,100
so depressed sometimes.

343
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,200
Hey, do you want a...?

344
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,900
Do you want a drink?

345
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,500
- No, no thank you.
- No?

346
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,700
Well, he probably didn't

347
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,800
want you feeling
obligated to solve his problems.

348
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,300
You know Ray.

349
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
He'd bend over backwards
to help someone he cared about,

350
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,799
but God forbid any of us
should worry about him.

351
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
God forbid, right?

352
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,400
How was the case going?

353
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,300
Well.

354
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,500
Exceptionally well.

355
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,200
Arthur, the night Ray...

356
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:52,688
He...

357
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,217
told me to pack my bags.

358
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,971
Said he wanted to leave the country.

359
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
He said that?

360
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,300
Why?

361
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,100
I don't know.

362
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,499
But, Arthur, if this had
anything to do with the case...

363
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,800
No, no, no, no.
I would have known that.

364
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,945
Maybe if...

365
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,505
I'd understood him, I could have...

366
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,900
Why did he do it?

367
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:31,500
Arthur, you knew him better than anyone.

368
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,599
Mallory, you were married to him.

369
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,900
I mean, if you... if you don't
know why he did this, no one does.

370
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,399
- Oh, sure. I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

371
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,084
I'm so sorry to take your time.

372
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:55,099
No, no, it's me.

373
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:57,655
Can you just hold on one second?

374
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Listen, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, Mallory.

375
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:02,900
Look, you know,
don't-don't beat yourself up.

376
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:05,800
You can't blame yourself.

377
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:07,400
You know what I mean?

378
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Good night.

379
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:14,500
Yeah.

380
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,500
Yeah, no. Good. Send 'em up.

381
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,300
Ah, yeah.

382
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,800
Oh, Jesus...

383
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,180
- Good evening, Miss Parsons.
- Good evening, Perry.

384
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,359
Thank you.

385
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:08,600
Yes.

386
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,000
He called off the engagement?

387
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,100
I'm so sorry, Ellen.

388
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
Maybe we went too far.

389
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,100
Do you regret what we did?

390
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,100
Because I do.

391
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
You do?

392
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:48,300
We crossed a line.

393
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,279
How could we know that Ray...?

394
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,977
Is the folder in a safe place?

395
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:12,100
It's locked up...

396
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,800
in my apartment.

397
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,200
We'll deal with it on Monday morning.

398
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,800
While I'm gone,
you're welcome to stay here.

399
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,300
The guest room's all made up.

400
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:30,000
Thank you.

401
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,460
You and David can work this out.

402
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,163
I wouldn't be surprised if you were...

403
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,088
together again by the time I get back.

404
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,200
<i>Shortly after, Mr. Fiske sent me
to Florida to help set up a meeting./i>

405
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:00,700
<i>I didn't know what
this meeting was about,</i>

406
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,100
<i>but I know that Arthur Frobisher</i>

407
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,000
<i>was in contact with a member of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</i>

408
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,700
<i>The name of that member is...</i>

409
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,800
<i>George Moore.</i>

410
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,000
<i>If anything happens to me,</i>

411
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:17,300
<i>George Moore and Arthur Frobisher
are responsible.</i>

412
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,151
So, there's bourbon in the kitchen,

413
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:38,801
and remember to walk Corey.

414
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,799
Where can I reach you?

415
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll be at the beach house.
Tom has the number.

416
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,299
Storm cleared Montauk last night.
Should be a perfect weekend.

417
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,400
Thank you, Perry.

418
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:51,200
Everything's going to be all right.

419
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,300
Hey, Ellen, Ellen, it's me.

420
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,134
Look, there's something
here that you really got to see.

421
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,100
Katie brought you a videotape
that Gregory Malina made.

422
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,500
It's about the case.

423
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,400
Gregory confessed everything
about what happened in Florida.

424
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,271
Look, I got the early shift,

425
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:21,481
but I'm going to leave it
in our hiding place, okay?

426
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,100
You scared me.

427
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Sorry.

428
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Where's my mom?

429
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
She went to the beach house.
She said I could stay here.

430
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:55,700
Cool.

431
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm just grabbing some stuff.

432
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,700
Don't tell my mom you saw me.

433
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Sure.

434
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,700
If anyone asks,

435
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,474
I wasn't here.

436
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,200
- I'm sorry, David.
- Ellen?

437
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:05,700
Jesus.

438
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,600
- Ellen's gone.
- What are you doing here?

439
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
- I'll run you a bath.
- Just get out of here.

440
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,799
- Enough of this shit.
- Don't do this.

441
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,300
Just get out!

442
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,099
You don't know what we had.

443
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm calling the police.

444
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,900
You really should lock your door.

445
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,919
<i>Jesus! Patty,</i>

446
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,851
<i>where the hell have you been?</i>

447
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,400
Visiting family.

448
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,200
<i>Well, you need to get back here.</i>

449
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,400
Ellen thinks you tried to kill her.

450
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,800
I'm coming home.

451
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
Parsons.

452
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,519
School's out early.

453
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
What's going on?

454
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,700
Your bail was posted.

455
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
By who?

456
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,400
You know a Patricia Hewes?

457
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,200
All right, sweetheart,
all you've got is a set of keys.

458
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,700
And your attorney sent you
a change of clothes. Sign right here.

459
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:41,899
Maybe I should go
in and get your things, huh?

460
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,500
No. Thanks.

461
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,734
I think I just want
to be alone for a while.

462
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,600
You really should lock your door.

463
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:22,900
Where is it?

464
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,400
Where's the videotape?

465
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,900
Check the bedroom.

466
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,065
What have you got?

467
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:14,381
Bring him in here.

468
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,897
Where... is the goddamn videotape?

469
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,200
I don't know.

470
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
All right.

471
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,065
I think I got something.

472
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,300
Jesus Christ.

473
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,600
What about the tape?

474
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
It wasn't there.

475
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,900
What?

476
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,900
So we went to Patty Hewes' apartment.

477
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:26,900
And?

478
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,500
Things got a little fouled up.

479
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,299
What the hell is that supposed to mean,
"things got a little bit fouled up"?

480
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,925
Let's just say we didn't find the tape.

481
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,600
Where the hell have you been?

482
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,200
Ellen...

483
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,300
no matter what you think,

484
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,100
I didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

485
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,900
I know.

486
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,400
But Tom told me that you
accused me of trying to kill you.

487
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,400
How else was I supposed
to get you back here?

488
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,521
So this videotape...

489
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,045
implicates Frobisher?

490
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,100
Yes.

491
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,804
<i>You have one new message.</i>

492
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,126
<i>Ellen, it's me.</i>

493
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,202
<i>Katie brought you a videotape
that Gregory Malina made.</i>

494
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
<i>I'm going to leave it
in our hiding place, okay?</i>

495
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,400
That's why Frobisher
had someone try to find it.

496
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,800
But Frobisher's people didn't
find the tape in my apartment.

497
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,900
So they went to mine.

498
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,292
But they didn't know
that I would be there.

499
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,600
That's when they tried to kill you.

500
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,600
If they never found the tape,
where is it?

501
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,800
I have it. It's safe.

502
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,600
Good.

503
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,700
- Then we...
- There's no "we" anymore.

504
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,400
I've had some time to think over
the past few days.

505
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,799
The only reason you hired
me was to get to Katie.

506
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,149
- Ellen...
- Don't bother.

507
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,499
I had that figured
out pretty early actually,

508
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
but then you had Tom
convince me otherwise,

509
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
and I was stupid enough to believe him.

510
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,946
At the time, I didn't realize
he's a scared, weak, liar

511
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,439
who would do anything to please you.

512
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,900
- I would never...
- Bullshit.

513
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:48,499
And then you tried
to break up me and David,

514
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,000
you trashed Katie as a witness,
and you fired me for no good reason.

515
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,300
But you did teach
me one valuable lesson.

516
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm glad.

517
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
"Trust no one."

518
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,800
Well, I don't anymore, Patty.

519
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,900
Least of all you.

520
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,100
I see.

521
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,665
I'll give you the tape...

522
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
but you're going to
do something for me first.

523
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,100
What?

524
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,500
Be my lawyer.

525
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:30,900
I've been accused of murder
and you're going to exonerate me.

526
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,100
I need your power and your connections.

527
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Clear me of this, and then help me find
who killed David.

528
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,500
If you do that...

529
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,200
then I'll give you the tape.

530
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Ellen Parsons is out on bail.

531
00:42:03,893 --> 00:42:05,291
You know where to find her.

532

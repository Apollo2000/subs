2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:07,444
We found her prints and her
fiancיs blood on the murder weapon.

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:10,297
Ellen Parsons, you're under arrest
for the murder of David Connor.

4
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:12,357
Hollis nye said you wanted to see me.

5
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:13,750
I need you to find Patty.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,127
Nobody knows where she is.

7
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:17,436
Mr. Nye, Tom just left.

8
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:18,941
Stay on him.

9
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:21,412
He'll lead you to Patty.

10
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,464
We had our first fight.

11
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:27,751
You and david need to take some
time together. You're both so busy.

12
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:30,878
They're good, hardworking people, and
they're afraid of losing you.

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,568
You try to lead by example.

14
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,450
And they want you to lead, and
then they resent you for it.

15
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,591
Looks like our boy Gregory Malina's
going to be deposed after all.

16
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:41,278
I am not going to let your young friend

17
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:44,526
sit across a table from Patty Hewes
and face an inquisition.

18
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:47,474
Your witness has other priorities.

19
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:48,674
<i>I lost him.</i>

20
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:49,743
Then find him.

21
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:52,468
I think that you and
I together could end this.

22
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,451
Let's stick to our plan.

23
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:57,555
Take this money and
get on with our lives.

24
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,445
Your cooperation has been invaluable.

25
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:03,791
I want to double our arrangement.

27
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:21,431
You still didn't make new keys.

28
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:23,479
There's no time.

29
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:25,910
Your sister was going
to bring over the extra set.

30
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,491
But she didn't. I'm sorry.

31
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,360
What is this?

32
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:39,853
The cake lady sent them over...

33
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:41,317
for the wedding.

34
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:43,120
We have to choose?

35
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,249
But I gotta go, so whatever you like is
great with me, just nothing too...

36
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:50,061
- lemony.
- Wait. No, no!

37
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:51,377
I'm not deciding.

38
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:52,399
Why not?

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,365
Because I'm the guy.
I don't give a shit.

40
00:01:58,137 --> 00:01:59,995
Okay, fine, fair enough.

41
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:06,360
Oh, this one.

42
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:07,924
 It's great.

43
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,754
So, the last time you saw david alive.

44
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:35,422
What happened between you two.

45
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,190
David and I had...

46
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,107
Take your time.

47
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:47,271
David and I had a fight.

48
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,445
<i>I don't know what you're doing anymore.</i>

49
00:02:52,446 --> 00:02:53,913
<i>I know exactly what I'm doing.</i>

50
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:54,982
<i>Oh, really? </i>

51
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,670
A man's dead now. Was that the plan?

52
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,265
This is what it takes.

53
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,219
I don't want this life.

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,448
You decide right now.

55
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,065
Do you want us or do you want this job?

56
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:07,460
- Please don't do this.
- Right now.

57
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,489
Right... now!

58
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:16,077
You can't decide, can you?

59
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,754
No. No.

60
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,836
We're done, Ellen.

64
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,465
- Bye, Michael.
- Bye, mom.

65
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,236
First family breakfast in over a year.

66
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,451
We can't find Gregory Malina.

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,475
What, Tom?

68
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,489
There's a court order
for Gregory to appear.

69
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:01,795
Useless.

70
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,494
The police will never find him.

71
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,486
Either he's in hiding or he's dead.
Either way, 

72
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:09,404
we have to plan our next move.

73
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:14,130
Yeah?

74
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:16,344
<i>Ms. Hewes, one of the client
reps is here to see you.</i>

75
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:18,172
Who?

76
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:19,302
<i>Peter Hassett.</i>

77
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:21,459
Send him in.

78
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,453
What are you going to tell him?

79
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,112
I'll tell him the truth.

80
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:29,906
Without Gregory Malina,
we're going to lose the case.

81
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:36,460
Peter have a sit

82
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:50,933
Come here for a second, will you?

83
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,109
Kevin, hey!

84
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,107
You ding up a caddy this morning?

85
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,132
Did I what?

86
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,495
Got a guy in there saying
his door's all scratched up.

87
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,466
Yes or no?

88
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,310
If it's the guy I'm thinking of, 

89
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,633
they may have been there before.

90
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,439
The brushes have to be replaced, Kevin.

91
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,643
I've been telling you that.

92
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:09,331
It's not the brushes, Larry.

93
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,080
Manny doesn't have these issues.

94
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,087
Neither does wanda.

95
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:14,726
Wanda wears jeans that let
her patooty show,

96
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:17,454
is why nobody complains about her.
And manny just got fired.

97
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,529
Manny just graduated high school.

98
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,432
He gave notice and left for college.

99
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,097
Is this about me being more careful?

100
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:24,938
Larry, I can't keep covering for you.

101
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,030
At this point, my ass is on the line.

102
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,490
I gotta make a change.

103
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,018
You're firing me?

104
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,571
My daughter went to prom with you,
I drove you there myself.

105
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:34,655
That was 20 years ago.

106
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:37,582
I tried to do you a favor here,
and it just didn't work out, okay?

107
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:41,489
Turn your shirt in to gloria, and
I'll pay you for the week.

108
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:43,773
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:54,610
- Yeah?
- So I called your parents.

110
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:55,957
They were already on their way.

111
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,655
But you told them i couldn't have lunch.

112
00:07:58,213 --> 00:07:59,436
Not really.

113
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,499
- What?
- Well, they wouldn't cancel.

114
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:03,940
Okay, in the future
when I'm unavailable,

115
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,438
you just need to explain it to them.

116
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,426
Say I'm with a client or in a meeting.

117
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,455
I know. I'm sorry.

118
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,164
I should have said that.

119
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,176
You asked for me?

120
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,335
Yeah, the paralegals have finished
annotating the sec memos.

121
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,500
I'd like you to review
them and report to Tom.

122
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,268
What am I looking for?

123
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:23,678
Inconsistencies, anything
that even hints at a red flag.

124
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:25,986
Would you pull the files, please?

125
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:26,987
Right away.

126
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:28,704
Anything else?

127
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,838
How's your new assistant working out?

128
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,485
It's a little bumpy, but he'll catch on.

129
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:36,239
I don't like him.

130
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,475
That's all. Get to work.

131
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:56,058
Hey! There he is!

132
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,297
Mr. Frobisher.

133
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,452
Good to see you, Larry.

134
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,465
Hey, you need breakfast?
You want an omelet?

135
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:01,435
No?

136
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:03,691
I'll tell you something,
we got some great lemonade here.

137
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:05,868
No, thank you, Mr. Frobisher.

138
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,788
Sit down, please.

139
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:11,442
I get famished after racquetball.

140
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:12,686
It's a great workout.

141
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,117
A lot more exciting than
tennis, too, I'll tell you.

142
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:16,093
You play?

143
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,421
Bowling was my game.

144
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:18,585
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,301
Once hit a 900 series in league play.

146
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,253
But you know, I haven't been
out since my eyes started to go.

147
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,500
These days, I couldn't even
pick up a two-pin spare.

148
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,469
Exactly. Exactly.

149
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:35,011
So, sorry about that.
What can I do for you?

150
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:38,463
I'm going to be direct with you,
Mr. Frobisher. Please.

151
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,105
We had a deal.

152
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,326
I know that.

153
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,237
I got the employees to vote
for your settlement offer.

154
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:47,498
I tried to get 'em to fire Mrs. Hewes,
I did everything you asked me to.

155
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,223
Yes, you did.

156
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:50,911
You said I'd be taken care of.

157
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,442
And after the trial, you will be.

158
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:57,051
That could be a year from
now. I can't wait that long.

159
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:00,493
Larry, I was very clear about that.

160
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:04,042
You said you were going
to double our arrangement.

161
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:09,739
All right, yeah, tell you what I'll do.

162
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,449
I'm gonna call my people, all right?

163
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,781
We'll see if we can get
something set up for you here.

164
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:16,501
In the meantime, keep doing
what you're doing, all right?

165
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:19,493
We're gonna get through
this... together.

166
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,047
They're here.

167
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,410
Who is?

168
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,414
Your parents.

169
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,050
- What did she bring?
- Muffins.

170
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:36,762
I think they're for you.

171
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,165
Honey!

172
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:42,166
I assumed the office was nice, but geez!

173
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,108
- Hi, dad.
- Hey.

174
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:48,455
My assistant called, right,
told you I couldn't make lunch?

175
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,691
I was a little surprised
you didn't call us yourself.

176
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,869
We had a plan.

177
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,058
I know. Let me make it up to you
later this week, I promise.

178
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,916
Yeah. Ellen, we have to talk.

179
00:10:58,453 --> 00:10:59,696
What's wrong?

180
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,638
We were in a car accident.

181
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,542
Oh, my G... are you okay?

182
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,451
It was a month ago. We're fine.

183
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:09,192
But, I hit a crossing guard.

184
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,926
Outside a school.

185
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:16,036
Was he hurt?

186
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:18,247
She. Linda reynolds.

187
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:20,477
Linda broke her hip.

188
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,462
She had surgery at hudson general.

189
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,410
- When?
- Two weeks ago.

190
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,428
He wouldn't let me call you.

191
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,777
You're busy.
I didn't want you to worry.

192
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,022
We have insurance.

193
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,382
I met with the lawyer
from the company.

194
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:36,445
And?

195
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,470
These guys are sleazeballs.

196
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,447
Lady's in the hospital, all
they care about is bottom line.

197
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:43,154
Dad, what did the lawyer say?

198
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,842
I've got it under control.

199
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,500
My deposition is tomorrow afternoon.

200
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:49,445
Tomorrow?

201
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:50,481
I told him.

202
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:53,188
Your daughter's a successful
attorney, talk to her.

203
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,890
It's under control, denise.

204
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:56,950
Okay, just tell me what happened.

205
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,674
We were headed to your sister's,

206
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,764
I made a crack about
your brother-in-law,

207
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,282
and your mother got angry.

208
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:04,700
What does that have to do with it?

209
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,580
We were arguing when I hit the guard.

210
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,833
So it's my fault?

211
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,451
No, I'm just saying we were fighting...

212
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,628
And maybe that's why I got...

213
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:13,501
Patty wants to see you.

214
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:17,592
I want to talk about this more,
so just wait here, okay?

215
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,388
We have to go to the hospital.

216
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,426
What for?

217
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,602
To say hello.

218
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,290
I told linda we'd stop by.

219
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,838
Your mother made muffins.

220
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,839
No, no.

221
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:27,467
You don't give her anything.

222
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:29,220
I'll explain when I get back.
Please,

223
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:31,478
just wait in my office.

224
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,939
For crying out loud.

225
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,199
You know...

226
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,921
I just don't understand
how we could win at trial, Mrs. Hewes,

227
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:45,879
unless you got something
you're not telling us.

228
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:48,759
The truth is,

229
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:50,896
we may never get to trial.

230
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:54,471
Then what the hell are you doing?

231
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:59,201
I can't imagine the pressure
you must be under these days.

232
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,494
No. You can't.

233
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:04,991
How many years did you
work for Mr. Frobisher?

234
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,762
34. Since your daughter
Chloe was born.

235
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,443
That's right.

236
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:11,464
And nothing to show for it.

237
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:14,850
In a litigation like this,
every move we make...

238
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,164
has a purpose.

239
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:20,289
Pushing for a trial is also how
we get a higher settlement offer.

240
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,147
So you'd be willing to settle.

241
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:24,144
Well, I don't want to.

242
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:27,554
But if Frobisher's people
came up with a fair offer,

243
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:31,694
I'd have to advise you all
to seriously consider it.

244
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:33,227
What's fair?

245
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:38,359
After losing Gregory
Malina, I'd like to go in at...

246
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:41,455
$350, $400 million.

247
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:45,075
But it's a negotiation,
and at this point,

248
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:48,885
we might have to
accept as little as...

249
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,758
175.

250
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:52,615
175?

251
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,824
Only as a last resort.

252
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,032
Makes sense.

253
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,525
In the meantime, Larry,

254
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:04,186
I need you to be supportive...

255
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:05,750
of our efforts.

256
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,469
Patty's willing to settle now.

257
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:09,646
I doubt it.

258
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,707
Popler has got a lot of sway
with the client reps.

259
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,725
I'm sure she's just
trying to get him on board.

260
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,480
You didn't fire him yet?

261
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:18,338
Why would I do that?

262
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:19,490
Well, Patty wants you to.

263
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:20,809
She didn't say that.

264
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,472
She said she didn't like him.

265
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,158
And that means...?

266
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:25,582
Get rid of him.

267
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,494
- S.EC files?
- Yes.

268
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:34,777
This is... it.

269
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:37,055
You brought me everything from 1998?

270
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,445
1998?

271
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,840
Yeah, I need everything from the
beginning of the sec investigation.

272
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:44,452
Not just the trial.

273
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,125
Sorry.

274
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:50,958
Where did my parents go?

275
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:54,588
Your dad said something about
a woman in the hospital, so...

276
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:06,161
Parsons! Let's go.

277
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:07,997
Your attorney's here.

278
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:14,490
Turn around and face the wall.
Put your hands behind your back.

279
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:20,155
And then you'll enter your plea.

280
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,672
Did you contact my parents?

281
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,034
They're on their way.

282
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:24,223
And Patty?

283
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,693
We can't find her.

284
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,894
But we're still watching Tom Shayes.

285
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,545
Ellen Parsons.

286
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,752
Six-percent grade,

287
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:55,849
fast greens, breaks to the left.

288
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:59,466
It's all about focus and concentration.

289
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,527
As much as I wish this case

290
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,061
could be decided by your short game,

291
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,417
we've got a deposition
to prepare you for.

292
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:12,484
I've gone through your transcripts
from the government trial,

293
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,035
and there are a couple of areas...

294
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,460
I feel we can handle better.

295
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:21,089
You think I gave away too much?

296
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,233
I'd like to bring in a specialist,

297
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,955
help prepare you for the deposition.

298
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:29,851
Patty Hewes's whole case
now is about tripping you up.

299
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:31,744
Let's do it.

300
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,080
Get us a barracuda. Get us the toughest
son-of-a-btich attorney you can find.

301
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,708
But I'm telling you something, Ray.

302
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,305
She's scared, man.

303
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,038
She's losing her confidence.

304
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,491
What makes you think so?

305
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,800
I have it on good authority
that she's willing to settle.

306
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:51,913
Whose authority?

307
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:55,285
$175 million is what it would cost.

308
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:59,310
A few weeks ago, this woman was,
like, gung ho for a trial, right?

309
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,460
She's scared, man.

310
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:03,222
What do you mean, on good authority?

311
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,487
No, don't worry about it. It's just...

312
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,370
Jesus, no.

313
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:11,990
What?

314
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:19,173
Don't tell me you've been
talking to someone on the inside.

315
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,941
Look, he's a good guy, Ray.

316
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,726
He's a straight shooter.

317
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:27,168
You know something, we should
be showing him some gratitude.

318
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,126
Seriously, I want you to,

319
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:31,019
you know, get him set up
with some account,

320
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,286
you know?

321
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,289
Offshore, however we do that.

322
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,104
Absolutely not!

323
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,794
Who knows about this?

324
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,721
No one.

325
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,662
You haven't paid him anything, have you?

326
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,931
- I gave him my word, Ray.
- All right, 

327
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:48,279
in no uncertain
terms, I am telling you...

328
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:51,267
to shut this down!

329
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:54,337
Never again are you to have
contact with this man,

330
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,480
under any circumstances!

331
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,122
You can go to jail for this.

332
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,015
You understand?

333
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,211
No more.

334
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:10,453
All right.

335
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:13,093
I understand.

336
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,245
175?

337
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,463
Well, isn't this a swell picture.

338
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,765
What, rRay?

339
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:43,238
Your little precious never takes a shit?

340
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,727
I wish I caught you in a better mood.

341
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:48,464
I'm fine.

342
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,251
Well, then perhaps you'd care to
humor me for a moment,

343
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:53,987
off the record.

344
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,146
I'm listening.

345
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:59,319
Understand, I'm not authorized.

346
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,196
I'm making no promises.

347
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:02,511
I'm not taking any.

348
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:06,140
My client pulled his
offer of a hundred million.

349
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,571
What if I could get him to reconsider,

350
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,996
maybe even sweeten the pot a bit?

351
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,202
Why would he do that?

352
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,601
Let's you and I do the math here, Patty.

353
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:18,789
- Okay.
- All right,

354
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,363
here's what you've got.

355
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:24,171
A billionaire who the public already
believes is corrupt,

356
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,480
whether he is or isn't.

357
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,612
He is.

358
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,270
And here's what I got.

359
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:31,617
No smoking-gun witness

360
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:35,278
or any credible evidence that
my client did anything wrong.

361
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:36,451
You're sure about that?

362
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,934
It's a draw, Patty,

363
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:42,218
 and we both know it.

364
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:44,957
Now, we go in that courtroom,

365
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:47,570
we might as well flip a coin.

366
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:52,096
Is that any way for two old friends...

367
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:53,739
to do business?

368
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,867
What's your number?

369
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,545
Well, I'm not saying I could
go as high as 200, but...

370
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,236
But in the ballpark?

371
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:06,628
Oh, we're just talking here,

372
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,992
but I think 150...

373
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,696
would probably get you a deal.

374
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,042
Maybe even...

375
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,076
175.

376
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,780
So...

377
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,237
Was I right about Larry?

378
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,255
Yes, Peter.

379
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,758
Mr. Popler's leaking
information to Frobisher's camp.

380
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:41,303
How do you know?

381
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:44,433
I gave him 175 as a settlement number.

382
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,155
Ray fiske brought it right back to me.

383
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,269
So what are you going to do?

384
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:54,836
Unfortunately, we don't have the
evidence to use this against Frobisher.

385
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,460
There won't be a paper trail,
money exchanged.

386
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:02,013
I think the best thing to
do right now is nothing.

387
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,641
We'll keep an eye on Larry.

388
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:08,662
In the meantime, let's not mention
this to the other client reps.

389
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:11,602
Our investigators are trying
to locate Gregory Malina

390
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,855
since he skipped out on his deposition.

391
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,079
Unfortunately, Mr. Malina
seems to have disappeared.

392
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:19,491
So that's it?

393
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:21,445
We don't have his testimony?

394
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,142
Relax, Larry. Just let them talk.

395
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:26,020
Of course, we're still looking for him,

396
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,678
but once someone leaves the state...

397
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:31,498
How the hell does a witness
just up and disappear?

398
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:37,468
I think you all should
know what we're up against.

399
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:39,016
We have reason to believe

400
00:21:39,017 --> 00:21:42,536
that Mr. Malina's life was threatened
prior to the deposition.

401
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:46,220
It's quite possible that
the other side got to him.

402
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,175
What are you saying?

403
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:50,508
He's been killed?

404
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,731
We're seriously looking
into that possibility,

405
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,044
yes.

406
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:11,825
<i>This is the voice mail
of Arthur Frobisher,</i>

407
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:14,203
<i>please leave a message
and have a nice day.</i>

408
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,463
I've been leaving messages all week.
Call me back.

409
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,309
We got to get going here.

410
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,438
Call me back.

411
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:27,494
Larry, dinner's ready.

412
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:34,667
You think they killed this Gregory guy?

413
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:37,889
We don't know.

414
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:44,831
He never tried to call
Katie again, did he?

415
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:46,724
No.

416
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:50,331
No, just that once.

417
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:56,083
- Ellen, if this is true...
- I know.

418
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:07,940
Thank you guys for showing up.
I appreciate that.

419
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:09,484
See you Tomorrow.

420
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,996
Oh, boy. Take me home, man.

421
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:16,030
Did you kill that kid?

422
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:18,799
What?

423
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:21,130
What kind of man are you?

424
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,579
אWhat the hell are you talking about?

425
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:29,957
That witness, Gregory Malina.

426
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:32,445
Patty Hewes says he was knocked off.

427
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:34,071
Oh, for christ's sake.

428
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:36,762
How many times I got to tell
you, that woman is crazy, Larry.

429
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:39,079
I don't know what
you're talking about.

430
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,269
I don't know any Gregory Malina.

431
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:42,693
What's the matter with you?

432
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:44,461
I've been calling you all week.

433
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:46,650
All right, just relax, will you?

434
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:48,067
It's late.

435
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,335
Can't we do this tomorrow, please?

436
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:53,417
I need my money!

437
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,466
Hey, derek, derek, derek, come on.

438
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,886
Hey, it's all right.

439
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,405
Larry's a friend of mine.
Come here, come here.

440
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,455
You don't want me to give
you any money right now.

441
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:04,723
Trust me.

442
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,926
So far neither of us has
done anything illegal.

443
00:24:07,927 --> 00:24:09,193
You gave me your word.

444
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,711
Listen to me, will you?

445
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,195
Giving you money is a crime, all right?

446
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:16,482
It's bribery, obstruction of justice.

447
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,639
We could both go to jail.

448
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:21,752
Come on.

449
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,359
It's the best way for both of us.

450
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:25,812
All right?

451
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,942
Hey, come here.

452
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:30,416
You live in jersey, right?

453
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:32,244
Give him a 20, will you?

454
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,839
Just do yourself a favor,

455
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,139
get a cab and go home, please. Come on.

456
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:39,721
Patty Hewes has ears, too.

457
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,756
Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person.

458
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:48,100
Larry, you don't want to threaten me.

459
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,557
- Take the money.
- I mopped your floors, 

460
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,445
- you son of a bitch!
- Oh, shit.

461
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:56,809
34 years I cleaned your shit.

462
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,220
What are you doing?
Be gentle here, man.

463
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:02,207
I hope you burn in hell!

464
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:06,658
Oh, for chri... yeah, it's me.

465
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,238
We need to talk.

466
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,941
I'm sorry we had to run off like that.

467
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,281
Dad, I admire you wanting
to visit this woman,

468
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:25,612
but legally it was not a good move.

469
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,333
- It wasn't a move.
- I get it.

470
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:30,413
But bringing her muffins, that kind
of thing can be used against you.

471
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,089
It's an admission of guilt.

472
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,054
I hit the woman with my car.
I sent her to the hospital.

473
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,807
I'm not supposed to go visit her?

474
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,485
Unfortunately, no.

475
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,606
And you can't apologize, either.

476
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:41,779
You're involved in a lawsuit.

477
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,673
You have to protect yourself.

478
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:46,270
Mom, you know what? I'm not hungry.

479
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:47,454
Nonsense.

480
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,904
I met the woman.
I looked her in the eye.

481
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:54,002
She's going to need physical
therapy for the next two years.

482
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:55,641
It's not your job to get her bills paid.

483
00:25:55,642 --> 00:25:56,665
It's her lawyer's.

484
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,294
I don't trust her lawyer any more than

485
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,374
I trust the guy from
the insurance company.

486
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,955
It's all a game to them.

487
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,440
Yes, it is.

488
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:04,614
And you could lose.

489
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:08,451
That is why, in this deposition, you
have to keep your answers brief.

490
00:26:08,452 --> 00:26:10,477
- Do not elaborate.
- Fine.

491
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:12,734
Keep it simple.
Stick to the facts

492
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,861
where the woman was standing,
how fast you were driving.

493
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:16,446
That kind of thing. Understand?

494
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:18,003
Yeah, got it.

495
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,304
I think I should be there with you.

496
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,458
Not necessary.

497
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:25,446
Gary, she's not a 12-year-old
anymore; she's a lawyer.

498
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:27,654
- Let her help you.
- She has to be at work.

499
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:29,937
Don't you?

500
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,172
I'll make time. I'll be there.

501
00:26:58,294 --> 00:27:01,485
This looks like a whole lot of nothing.

502
00:27:02,315 --> 00:27:04,802
You know who built up
this part of the state?

503
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,452
Wasps.

504
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:07,764
Beavers.

505
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,449
You lost me.

506
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,019
No, I'm not kidding.

507
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,621
Place was flush with them.

508
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:15,781
Indians used to trap them and
then trade them for everything...

509
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:18,473
blankets, hatchets, iron kettles.

510
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:21,952
Then when they got hooked
on the white man's goods,

511
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,871
they started trading the only
other thing they had left.

512
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:26,530
Otters?

513
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:29,174
No, you idiot. Land.

514
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,816
I'm going to develop this.

515
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,482
Real estate, that's not your thing.

516
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:38,251
I'm sick and tired of standing around
the sidelines like this, you know?

517
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:40,286
I need to... I need to build something.

518
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:46,122
You want to tell me what
happened to Gregory Malina?

519
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:50,477
Don't ask me; ask Ray Fiske.

520
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:53,921
And while you're at it, ask him how
he knows Malina in the first place,

521
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,514
and why he used him to set
up the condo in palm beach.

522
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:57,531
- What difference does that make?
- I don't trust him.

523
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,465
Five years ago, I went
out on a limb for you.

524
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,739
You're not the only one in
the line of fire here.

525
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,836
What happened to Gregory Malina?

526
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,031
Looks like our boy Gregory Malina's
going to be deposed after all.

527
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,747
Make sure it doesn't
get screwed up this time.

528
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,455
I'll do it myself.

529
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:21,894
I thought you didn't want to know.

530
00:28:21,895 --> 00:28:23,322
I do now.

531
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:49,045
Excuse me. Sorry.

532
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,597
- What's his name?
- Theo.

533
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,563
Miss Hewes, when we were in your office,

534
00:28:56,564 --> 00:28:58,911
were you suggesting
that I should fire him?

535
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:00,099
Why?

536
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:01,804
You want to fire him?

537
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:05,169
He just started. I thought
I should give him some time.

538
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,476
He's your assistant.
Do what you want.

539
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:10,022
Anything jumping out at you?

540
00:29:10,554 --> 00:29:11,602
Not yet.

541
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:14,231
There is an official from the S.E.C

542
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:16,455
who was aggressive in
going after Frobisher's company.

543
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,554
Tom and I thought he
might be worth talking to.

544
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:19,555
His name?

545
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:20,949
George Moore.

546
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,450
I don't think there's anything there.

547
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,299
Moore was interviewed extensively
for the government trial.

548
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,838
I thought we'd just pick his brain.

549
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,514
If Tom thinks it's useful,
it's fine with me.

550
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:34,482
Miss Hewes, is it okay if tomorrow
I step out for a few hours?

551
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,018
What for?

552
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,441
My father hit a woman with his car.

553
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:41,439
He's being deposed, and
I thought that I should be there.

554
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,629
Well, of course.

555
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:45,718
Is he at fault?

556
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:47,457
He seems to think so.

557
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:50,478
I mean, he's the kind of guy who
likes to take responsibility.

558
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:51,664
Better be careful.

559
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,527
We plaintiff attorneys can be vicious.

560
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,475
His best strategy is
to blame the victim.

561
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:58,679
I know.

562
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,305
At all costs. It was her fault, period.

563
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:08,766
He's in the bathroom, but
he'll be back in a minute.

564
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:11,739
I'm so sorry to interrupt your dinner.

565
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:15,556
Hello. You must be chloe.

566
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,246
Patty Hewes.

567
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:19,477
And Rob. Hello.

568
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:21,174
What are you doing here?

569
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:22,485
I was in the neighborhood.

570
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:24,099
Thought I'd meet the family.

571
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,961
Now is not a good time.

572
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,931
How about I come by the office Tomorrow?

573
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:30,045
Ah, afraid it can't wait, Larry.

574
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:32,865
Ray Fiske came to see me.

575
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:35,165
He offered a settlement.

576
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,572
Hey, that's terrific.

577
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,279
$175 million.

578
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:44,464
Should we take it?

579
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,466
Why are you asking me?

580
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,085
Because 175 is a...

581
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:51,213
interesting number.

582
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,790
I don't know what you're implying.

583
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,294
You've been talking to the other side.

584
00:30:57,295 --> 00:30:58,968
- Are you nuts?
- No,

585
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:00,877
you don't want to do that.

586
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:03,472
Don't speak without a
criminal attorney present.

587
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,617
You're already facing three to five.

588
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:08,026
How dare you come in here and
hijack me with accusations?

589
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:10,197
Yeah, the truth is, Larry, I like you,

590
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:12,445
but I think you're in over your head,

591
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:15,754
and prison is the last
place where you belong.

592
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,757
Arthur frobisher is smart.

593
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,447
I'm sure he's got a way to
get you your blood money,

594
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:23,349
with no paper trail, so

595
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,102
I'm really just here tonight
to make you a promise.

596
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,484
Oh, yeah? What's that?

597
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,364
I'm going to wait and watch...

598
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:33,695
until you buy a house,

599
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:36,277
or mildred buys a car, or...

600
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,232
chloe here buys a toothbrush.

601
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:41,292
You need to understand this, Larry,

602
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:46,429
no popler for the next hundred years
will be able to spend

603
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,260
a nickel of that money

604
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:52,310
without being humiliated,
disgraced and locked up.

605
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:00,645
You all have a nice night.

606
00:32:18,474 --> 00:32:19,866
How do you plea?

607
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,243
Not guilty.

608
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:25,342
Not a flight risk, your honor.

609
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,780
No prior criminal record.

610
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,643
An upstanding member of the community.

611
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:31,719
Bail is set at $1.5 million.

612
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:33,483
Next.

613
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:38,758
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

614
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,445
and nothing but the
truth, so help you god?

615
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:42,581
I do.

616
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:48,349
And when you pulled even with the
stop sign, did you see Miss Reynolds?

617
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:50,443
Yes.

618
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:53,490
She was standing to my left,
about ten feet away.

619
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:55,823
Did you see miss reynolds
walk towards your vehicle?

620
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:56,824
No.

621
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:58,449
Not even out of the corner of your eye?

622
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,087
Move on. You already said no.

623
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:03,106
Mr. Parsons...

624
00:33:04,577 --> 00:33:07,596
what was your general state of
mind leading up to the accident?

625
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,125
How about being a little more specific?

626
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:12,973
Were you upset? Angry?

627
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:20,002
Well, just before it happened,

628
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,300
my wife and I...

629
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:23,272
May we take five minutes, please?

630
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,106
Mr. Parsons, I told you before,

631
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,254
no one needs to know
your emotional state or

632
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:33,194
that your attention was somewhere else.

633
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:35,442
My wife and I were arguing.
I'm telling them what happened.

634
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:37,460
- And as your attorney...
- You're not his attorney.

635
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:39,625
You represent his insurance company.

636
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,690
I'd like a moment with my father.

637
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,195
Dad, he's right.

638
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:46,643
You agree with that creep?

639
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:49,272
Your policy only covers $200 000.

640
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:52,041
- If the plaintiff is awarded...
- She has a name--

641
00:33:52,245 --> 00:33:53,474
Linda Reynolds.

642
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:56,312
If you admit fault and
she's awarded more than $200, 000,

643
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:57,719
you're personally liable.

644
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,073
- It was my fault.
- It was an accident.

645
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:04,482
If that's work, you should go.

646
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:08,108
Look, this guy isn't even
fighting for me anyway.

647
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,913
He's just trying to save his company
money by refusing

648
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:13,415
to pay linda's medical expenses.
Why should I help him?

649
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:16,810
Because she's got a lawyer who's
going to go after every penny he can.

650
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:18,437
So I should just go in there and lie?

651
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:19,764
I'm saying that they will.

652
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:21,768
They'll spin into gross negligence.

653
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:23,473
This is the real world, dad.

654
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:28,015
I don't need you to teach me
about the real world.

655
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:31,504
I swore under oath.

656
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,463
But you're the lawyer, Ellen,
tell me what to do.

657
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:38,396
I've told you what
to do again and again.

658
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:44,479
Mr. Parsons,

659
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:48,187
what was your general state
of mind leading up to the accident?

660
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:08,106
Thank you for seeing me again.

661
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,406
Well, thank you for calling, Larry.

662
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,121
I was sick about the other night.

663
00:35:12,122 --> 00:35:13,868
That was a terrible thing that happened.

664
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:16,060
Nah, I should apologize to you.

665
00:35:16,061 --> 00:35:17,655
It's just I got all these pressures.

666
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,486
I get it, I get it.

667
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:24,076
Larry, the truth is, my attorney
doesn't even want me talking to you,

668
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:27,878
so I'm not going to be able to
make good until after the trial.

669
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,757
I understand, and i can hold
out. Just don't forget about me.

670
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:32,452
Please...

671
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,737
don't cut me out.

672
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:38,490
Oh, that other thing, the witness?

673
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,072
I'm looking into it.

674
00:35:40,697 --> 00:35:41,697
Thank you.

675
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:44,917
You know who you remind me of,
don't you?

676
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,640
My dad.

677
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,752
That means a lot.

678
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:52,584
Guys like you are what make
this country great, Larry.

679
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:05,175
The guy from the sec wants to push
up our meeting.

680
00:36:05,254 --> 00:36:06,427
You ready in ten?

681
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:07,615
Sure.

682
00:36:10,698 --> 00:36:13,796
Mom. What happened.
What's going on?

683
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:18,161
Your father wouldn't call you,
but I thought you should know.

684
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,256
Know what?

685
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,062
They're not just suing us
for hospital bills anymore.

686
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:24,376
It's okay.

687
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,185
This woman's hurt worse
then they thought,

688
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,749
and she may never work again.

689
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:31,579
How much are they asking for?

690
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,075
Over a million dollars.

691
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,250
They can't do that, can they?

692
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,923
I mean, they can't just say
we owe them all that money.

693
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,753
Yeah, mom, they can.

694
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:47,467
Your father didn't have to
tell them we were arguing.

695
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,488
Car's here.

696
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,175
Your mom called earlier.

697
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:03,397
I just... it's my fault.

698
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:06,467
I didn't have a chance
to... tell you earlier.

699
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:07,668
It's fine.

700
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,091
You know what?

701
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:16,751
It's not fine. You're fired.

702
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:28,611
<i>- Where are they taking her?
- Rikers island.</i>

703
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,455
What will it cost to post bond?

704
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,392
We can't afford that.
Not after the settlement

705
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:41,018
This guy worked for the S.E.C.

706
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:42,895
who tried to take down Frobisher.

707
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,484
Really?

708
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:49,017
We're looking for Mr. Moore.

709
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:52,913
Hello there.

710
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,744
Oh, Tom shayes.

711
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:56,261
Ellen parsons.

712
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:58,440
The pleasure's mine.
Come on in. Take a seat.

713
00:37:58,441 --> 00:37:59,580
Thank you.

714
00:38:01,597 --> 00:38:03,492
Hey, Larry, you got a second?

715
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,112
Listen, I want to...

716
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:08,867
I want to reassure you
that thing with the witness...

717
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:12,355
I looked into it, and I can personally
guarantee you that

718
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:14,483
Gregory Malina is safe.

719
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,157
I'm glad to hear that.

720
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:19,457
Yeah, evidently he had his own
reasons for not wanting to testify;

721
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,804
drugs or something like that.

722
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,469
I shouldn't have accused you.

723
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,788
<i>No, it all right.</i>

724
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:27,698
- All right, I'll talk to you later.
- <i>OK.</i>

725
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,877
He says Gregory Malina is alive.

726
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:34,481
Do you believe him?

727
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:35,817
Do you?

728
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:38,490
Well, we're going to find out.

729
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,861
I'm glad you and I could
come to an arrangement, Larry.

730
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:47,847
Me, too.

731
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,228
Whatever I could do
to make things right.

732
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:20,148
Please don't do this.

733
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,322
You decide right now...

734
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:23,825
do you want us or do you want this job?

735
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:25,232
Right...

736
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:26,438
now!

737
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,113
We're done, Ellen.

738
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,490
Hey, it's me. I'm so sorry.

739
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:04,036
Just please...

740
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,288
call me back, okay?

741
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:13,516

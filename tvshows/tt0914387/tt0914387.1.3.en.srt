1
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,383
All we found on her was this.

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,183
I want to help you,
Ellen, 'cause I know 

3
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:11,720
you didn't do it.

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,390
Called me yesterday.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,270
Once Patty meets you,
there's no turning back.

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,729
She'll see what I see,
and she'll own you.

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,980
Ms. Hewes.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,660
Is there any way I
could still interview?

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,901
You're hired.

10
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:28,690
A young lawyer with a
fantastic new job and a

11
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:30,370
- dreamy doctor fianc×™?
- You're my sister.

12
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:32,854
How do you know
Arthur Frobisher?

13
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:34,902
I catered a function for
him and some businessmen.

14
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:37,361
Arthur Frobisher told his
employees to invest in the

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,492
company and then
sold his own stock.

16
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,260
We don't have a case
unless we can connect

17
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:45,423
Frobisher with his broker.

18
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:47,181
Frobisher's lawyer
calls three times a day.

19
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,021
He's just trying
to intimidate you.

20
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,340
But if Patty Hewes gets
that girl in front of a

21
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:53,800
jury... all bets are off.

22
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:55,561
I miss seeing you around
the office, Tommy.

23
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:58,111
Everyone thinks you
were actually canned.

24
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:00,643
Katie's hiding details.

25
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:04,481
I met a guy down in Florida,

26
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,561
had a stupid one night stand.

27
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,110
- Did you see him again?
- No.

28
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:11,440
You were right.

29
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,443
She's using me.

30
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,081
Patty Hewes needs
people who are driven.

31
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,413
You'll never change her.

32
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:18,370
Learn everything you can,

33
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,281
then get the hell out
before it's too late.

34
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,200
Do yourself a favor, Ellen--
don't have kids.

35
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:23,862
He must've hired strippers.

36
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,263
You mean our son had
them in our apartment?

37
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:28,281
Patty, I'll have
a talk with him.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,074

39
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:39,151
That lawyer you asked for--
he'll be here shortly.

40
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:05,140
Judge Toomey will see you now.

41
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:13,113
Your Honor,
I cannot make a case if Mr. Fiske

42
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,070
refuses to participate in
the discovery process.

43
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,361
My office has delivered over

44
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,530
850,000 documents.

45
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:20,972
Yes, but not the
ones we requested.

46
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:22,902
You've requested everything.

47
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,572
And we haven't received it.

48
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,110
Because everything takes time.

49
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:28,403
Patty, Ray,
I'm sick of you both.

50
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:30,870
Your Honor, I don't see...

51
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,291
No, really, Ray, I am.

52
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:35,163
You with the grandstanding
and the media attacks and the

53
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:37,372
unrelenting tsunami of arcane
and irrelevant motions.

54
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:40,753
Stall tactics, Your Honor.

55
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,981
He's trying to bog me
down in paperwork.

56
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,340
No doubt.

57
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,863
And I wouldn't mind, except that
I have to read them all, too.

58
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:49,142
Your Honor,
every motion we've filed has merit...

59
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:50,933
Shut up.

60
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:53,252
And you, Ms. Hewes, well,

61
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:55,532
I guess I should be
grateful to you.

62
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,640
You don't waste my time
with unnecessary paperwork.

63
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,823
Thank you, Your Honor.

64
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:03,533
But you,
you present a far greater problem.

65
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:06,372
- Which is?
- Right about now, Ms. Hewes,

66
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:07,893
you don't seem to have a case.

67
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,451
With respect, I disagree.

68
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,540
I'll bet you do.

69
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,862
But I'm afraid Mr.
Fiske's motion to dismiss is beginning

70
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:17,092
to feel like it has some merit.

71
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:24,340
So, here's what's going to happen--
you will cut the crap

72
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,863
and give this lady
every last shred

73
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,310
of discovery she is asking for.

74
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,273
Certainly, Your Honor.

75
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:34,562
And you, my dear, by Friday--
you will submit a brief

76
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,962
that lays out for me
why in God's name

77
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,902
I should not dismiss your case.

78
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:43,240
No problem, Your Honor.

79
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:45,572
We've got a big problem.

80
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:49,661
I need every attorney to
contribute on this brief.

81
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,262
Andrew, you'll analyze
the SEC filings.

82
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:55,811
Felicia and Craig, Frobisher's
personal financial transactions.

83
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:59,520
The "duty of care" argument
will be handled by

84
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,173
Sean, Mike and Nelson.

85
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,010
Ellen, help Sean's team.

86
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:05,633
We're under the gun here.

87
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:08,263
So nobody plan on going home.

88
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:09,721
That's it, get to work.

89
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,143
Ellen, stay here for a second.

90
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,820
Take a crack at summarizing our

91
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:35,500
application of
the ERISA statute.

92
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:37,103
Neither ran nor sleet

93
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,000
nor cataracts and arthritis.

94
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,710
Thank you, Pete.

95
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:43,033
Just get a draft on its feet
and give to to Sean Eckhart.

96
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:48,301
He'll do whatever
rewrite is necessary.

97
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,153
Oh, God,
it's going to be a shitty week.

98
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,801
Who would want to
do this to you?

99
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,890
How much time do you haveN

100
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,272
Sorry I didn't call you back.

101
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:51,290
They evacuated our building.

102
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:53,580
Yeah, no, I saw it on the news.

103
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:55,381
They shut down our office
so we moved to Patty's

104
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,811
apartment, and now we have a
brief to prepare, so she won't

105
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:01,253
- be able to meet with you this.
- Oh, okay.

106
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,061
Don't worry,
I'll set something up as soon as

107
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:03,882
I can, I promise.

108
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,042
Well, the sooner the better.

109
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,591
The type of work you do is
particularly high-profile,

110
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:09,682
Ms. Hewes.

111
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,322
Maybe you could help
us by assembling a...

112
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:12,461
You'd like a list of names.

113
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,131
Anybody who may currently
hold a grudge against you.

114
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:16,601
That's a long list.

115
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:18,680
- Do you have a lot of enemies?
- You could say that.

116
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:21,573
Hey, are you still good
for Friday for the

117
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,373
- engagement party?
- They want a deposit.

118
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,120
You know what,
I'm going to have

119
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:26,581
to check with Patty.

120
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,012
Things are pretty
crazy right now.

121
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:30,491
Okay, well, let me know.

122
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:31,741
Listen, I got to go.

123
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,623
I'm, uh, I'm at the gym.

124
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,582
I'll talk to you later.

125
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,622
Have a good workout.

126
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:38,540
Am I correct,
you've been attacked in the past?

127
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:40,870
Yes.

128
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,752
Would you like to tell
us about that incident?

129
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,832
It happened ten years ago.

130
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,592
I was slashed, I almost died.

131
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:08,401
You think maybe next time
you could take this off?

132
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,151
Actually, it's stuck.

133
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:15,031
Hmm, how ironic.

134
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,111
His name is Gregory Malina,
and as far as I can tell,

135
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:19,212
Katie told the truth
about how she met him.

136
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,910
He was down in Florida?

137
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,893
The same weekend she
cooked for Frobisher,

138
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,252
that is 100% confirmed.

139
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:28,250
- Any ties to Frobisher?
- Not that I can tell.

140
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:32,802
What about the bomb threat?
Any ties to Frobisher on that?

141
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:34,381
The feds are the feds.

142
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,742
You're almost better off trying
to figure it out yourself.

143
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:46,402
- What is it, Tom?
- Look... Patty,

144
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:48,680
I know that this is not the best time,
and I'm happy to do

145
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:56,280
whatever you need
me to do right now,

146
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,344
but following Katie
Conner around...

147
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,912
- Yes?
- I'm a lawyer, Patty.

148
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,913
I miss it.

149
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,961
Be patient, Tom.

150
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:09,630
Oh, hi, Cory.

151
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:11,921
Oh, good boy.

152
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:12,973
Hi, Collie.

153
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:14,602
Could you take him out?
I'm sure he needs it.

154
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,352
Cory, Cory, Cory, go on.

155
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,481
Ms. Hewes.

156
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:27,363
- May I help you?
- I'm here to help you, ma'am.

157
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,110
I see you've met.

158
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:32,672
- A friend of yours?
- John Petroni,

159
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:33,863
Patty Hewes.

160
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,581
You've no reason you'd remember this,
but we've

161
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,910
actually met before.

162
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,372
Forgive me, Mr.

163
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,332
- Mr. Petroni, where was that?
- The South Lawn of

164
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:41,553
the Clinton White House.

165
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,162
Spring of '98.

166
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:46,170
John is former Secret
Service, Patty.

167
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,050
He couldn't come with a
higher recommendation.

168
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,750
It's an honor to see you again.

169
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:54,302
It's very nice to
see you as well.

170
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,343
Secret Service?
This is a bit much, don't you think?

171
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:57,803
Not after last time,

172
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:01,723
no, and this is
not up for debate.

173
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,312
So, this means what?
You'll be accompanying me...

174
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:09,730
Everywhere.

175
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,162
I'm sorry about the
troubles at your office.

176
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,423
I know this couldn't have
come at a worse time.

177
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:21,971
Thank you for being
so understanding.

178
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,463
I can't tell you how
embarrassed we are

179
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:25,543
to be here again.

180
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:27,820
In 30 years of adolescent education,
I have learned that

181
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,042
the best way through these
situations is candor.

182
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:32,432
Mr. Lalas,
we know you've gone above

183
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:34,511
and beyond.

184
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:38,803
If you have to expel Michael,
we won't fight it.

185
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,403
I don't think we're
there yet... quite.

186
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,223
But we're close.

187
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,702
This latest stunt
was quite serious.

188
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,162
We've confiscated
Michael's computer.

189
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,781
He used it to hack into
our school system.

190
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:53,053
He accessed student records,
upcoming exams-- which he

191
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,740
distributed to
the student body.

192
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:59,941
Along with passwords
to our faculity's

193
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:01,743
personal e-mail accounts.

194
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:02,912
Oh, Jesus.

195
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,013
I'm sure you appreciate

196
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,203
the privacy issues involved.

197
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,412
Michael made public a lot
of delicate information.

198
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,583
Your son is very bright.

199
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,101
I see enormous
insight and potential.

200
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:16,620
And there's a recent dream of
his that I find troubling.

201
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,220
- He told you a dream?
- I normally don't put

202
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:23,213
a lot of weight on adolescent dreams,
but this one seems

203
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:27,391
revelatory and he has given
me permission to relay it.

204
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:33,773
In the dream, eight black
limousines pull up in front of

205
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:39,032
your apartment,
and out of each one steps a Michael,

206
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,743
who all look exactly alike.

207
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:44,263
So much so,
that even Michael can't tell

208
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,202
which one is the real him.

209
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:50,162
But he knows that the other
seven are body doubles

210
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,293
he has hired.

211
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:52,893
- Hired to do what?
- To prevent him from

212
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:56,502
being assassinated.

213
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:01,002
I see you've met my son.

214
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:02,720
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:10,271
Ho home.
Mikey, come on, let's go.

216
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,011
Understand, Mr. Frobisher,

217
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:21,212
you're not being
accused of anything.

218
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:22,572
I appreciate that.

219
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:25,052
And for the record, I just want
to say that I sympathize with

220
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,741
the position you guys are in.

221
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,303
As a party to this litigation,
I can understand

222
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:32,663
why I'm in your crosshairs.

223
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,040
Mr. Frobisher is too polite
to express his outrage at

224
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,760
this intrusion into
this life and privacy.

225
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:39,591
Ray...

226
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,312
My client had nothing to do
with these threats against

227
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:43,310
Patty Hewes, and quite frankly,
he's not required

228
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,340
to answer your questions.

229
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,231
Mr. Frobisher,
you could clear your name really quickly

230
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:48,613
if you could just give us
access to your computer

231
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:49,612
and your cell phone records.

232
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:53,232
How about some probable cause?

233
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:54,811
You show us a warrant and Mr.

234
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,213
Frobisher will be
happy to comply.

235
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,111
Ray, you give them
whatever they need.

236
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:01,241
I have nothing to hide.

237
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,881
Gentlemen, I'm sorry,
I got to take off.

238
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:03,820
It's been a pleasure.

239
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:04,631
Thank you, Mr. Frobisher.

240
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:08,530
Yeah, we will cooperate fully.

241
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,213
Hey.

242
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:17,882
Stall, you know, stonewall 'em.

243
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,090
Be a lawyer.

244
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,131
Art, you just promised...

245
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,680
I'll be damned if I'm
going to let the feds poke

246
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:25,723
around in my personal life.

247
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:29,432
Don't give them
a goddamn thing.

248
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:31,351
Hey, sweetheart,
I'm going to be a little late.

249
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,273
Yeah.

250
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:45,320
My God, Ellen.

251
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:51,290
Are you okay? What happened?

252
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:56,210
If you needed a lawyer,
why didn't you ask for Patty?

253
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,843
Just get me out of here.

254
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,721
Morning.

255
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,732
You're home early.

256
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,141
Ha-ha.

257
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,022
36 hours.

258
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,402
You made it.

259
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:23,232
- Did you get any sleep?
- I think I might have

260
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:26,710
nodded off during a
catheter insertion, but...

261
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:29,321
I can't really be sure.

262
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,990
- What about you?
- Couple hours.

263
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:37,292
Mmm? How's the brief coming?

264
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:39,292
Great.

265
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,881
Yeah, it's fine.

266
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,090
I have no idea.

267
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:44,373
I'm gonna go with "great." Huh?

268
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,541
Well, I hope I have it done in time,
because Katie's

269
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,510
invited everybody for Friday.

270
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,760
Hey.

271
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,850
Hey.

272
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,411
You put too much
pressure on yourself.

273
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:00,653
Look, I am fine rescheduling.

274
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:03,613
When? You don't
have a weekend off

275
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:07,611
for another two months.

276
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,773
Besides, if we can GE Friday now,
my mother will have a

277
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,320
nervous breakdown.

278
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:17,543
We've collected prints
and DNA from the packing

279
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,550
materials and run them
through our database.

280
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,362
And?

281
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:21,643
Unfortunately, there
was no match.

282
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:24,432
The device itself
was an Army-issue

283
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,390
M67 fragmentation grenade.

284
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:27,580
The serial number was filed
off so we can't trace the

285
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,363
source, but we do know that it
was sent through the US mail,

286
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,081
originating at a
Midtown drop box.

287
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:34,720
What you're saying is that
anybody can take a bomb,

288
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,691
put it in a mailbox
and mail it to my wife.

289
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:38,671
The device wasn't live,
Mr. Grey.

290
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:40,733
This tiDA.

291
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,211
Is someone trying
to kill me or not?

292
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,730
This type of threat usually
has one of two profiles.

293
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:47,483
It may just be a warning.

294
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:49,560
- And the other profile?
- The threats will continue,

295
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:52,703
and they will escalate.

296
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,070
I'll speak with you outside.

297
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,252
Thank you.

298
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,410
Now, a lot of you are probably
aware of the fact that

299
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:05,193
after yesterday's events, six of
your coworkers took personal days...

300
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,710
and I fired them.

301
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:14,971
All of you are members of an
extraordinary team, and I value

302
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:16,760
each and every one of you.

303
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:20,642
If you want to quit,
just tell me now.

304
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,202
But if you call in sick
Thursday or Friday,

305
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:24,912
don't bother coming in Monday.

306
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:26,381
Your jobs won't be
waiting for you.

307
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,100
That grenade was never
meant to destroy our office.

308
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,420
It was meant to
destroy our resolve.

309
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,763
We have two days left to show
Judge Toomey that there's a case

310
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,243
to litigate here.

311
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:41,083
Frobisher's former
employees lost everything.

312
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,571
Right now, we are their only
hope for restitution, and

313
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:48,731
nothing-- nothing-- is going to
keep us from getting a clear and

314
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:53,102
powerful opposit on
brief to the court. So...

315
00:16:55,058 --> 00:16:57,101
back to work.

316
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,643
Um, Ms.
Hewes, Sean's not returning my e-mails.

317
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,023
I fired him.

318
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,060
Get your section to me.

319
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,403
I'll rewrite it for the brief.

320
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,521
You know what we should do?

321
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:12,261
We should box up a couple of these,
send 'em over to Patty's,

322
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,951
watch the bomb dogs go nuts.

323
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,060
Get me the relish, will you?
What were you were saying?

324
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,042
Look.

325
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:23,481
Arthur, I can keep those agents at bay,
and I'm not pointing

326
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,151
fingers here, but if there's
something that you've done...

327
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,342
Why would I do anything, Ray?

328
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:36,142
Because the brief Patty
has to write to save

329
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,332
her case is due Friday and
all this pandemonium is hardly

330
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:42,681
helping her concentration any.

331
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,021
Wow.

332
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:46,232
You think?

333
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:52,280
That better not be
a confession, Art.

334
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,490
Guess how much it costs
to send a hand grenade

335
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:04,412
through the mail.

336
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,920
Don't say another word.

337
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:09,682
Does your wife ever
just want to reach over

338
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,712
there and pinch your cheeks
'cause you're so adorable?

339
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,722
No.

340
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,811
You should go outside
and get some sun, Ray.

341
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,273
You look like crap.

342
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:31,573
Hi. I'm Ellen Parsons.

343
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:32,610
Good morning.

344
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:33,612
I need to talk to Patty.

345
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,883
I'm not sure what
the procedure is.

346
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:38,321
Knock.

347
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:42,663
We'll see what happens.

348
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:45,203
Hi. Walk with me.

349
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,200
Um, Ms. Hewes,
I don't know if you got my e-mail.

350
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,820
About your engagement party?

351
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,763
I know it's bad timing--
it's just the only

352
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,040
night my fiance and I can
make it work is Friday.

353
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:54,660
- This Friday?
- I know, I know,

354
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,650
the brief is due, and my section
will be done well in advance.

355
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:58,681
I promise.

356
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,442
Well, then, by all means,
enjoy your party.

357
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:01,511
Thank you, Ms. Hewes.

358
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:03,180
Ellen, you're an adult.

359
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:04,993
You do your work,
your life's your own.

360
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:06,683
Oh, and, Ellen, call Katie.

361
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,200
I want to get a
meeting on the books.

362
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:10,903
Sure.

363
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,283
You got something
against hotels?

364
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,201
No.

365
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:28,621
It's just that we never seem
to finish our conversation.

366
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,042
So let's talk.

367
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,441
You were good to
me after Florida.

368
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,211
You did the right thing.

369
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:35,171
I was half responsible.

370
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:37,591
Still, we hardly knew
each other and you helped

371
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:39,773
me through it,
which you didn't have to do.

372
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:41,010
I was grateful.

373
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:42,213
So why'd you stop calling me?

374
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:46,010
I was kind of...

375
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:47,721
confused back then.

376
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,481
Have you been following
the Frobisher case?

377
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,333
Arthur Frobisher?
Sure, on the news.

378
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,770
Yeah, well,
do you remember that we actually saw

379
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:55,901
- him down in Florida?
- Vaguely. Didn't you cater

380
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,152
- some event for him?
- Yeah, um... he helped

381
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,263
set me up in a restaurant,
and now I'm being asked to be a

382
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:03,202
witness against him.

383
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:04,882
- Do you know anything?
- I don't know yet,

384
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,690
but, um... I saw him several
times that weekend and the

385
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:13,711
lawyer thinks that maybe I
can contradict his testimony.

386
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:14,713
You're kidding.

387
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,210
No, I wish I was.

388
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:18,710
I had to tell her about us.

389
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,752
I had to account for my
time time down in Florida.

390
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:23,410
I mean, I didn't tell them your
last name, I didn't want...

391
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:24,262
It's okay.

392
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:25,783
...to get you in
the shit like I was.

393
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:27,470
It's okay.

394
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,642
It's okay. Thank you.

395
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,803
Maybe, if you do know something,
you should come down

396
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,713
and speak to the
lawyers with me.

397
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:35,811
No, I don't.

398
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:37,892
I mean, the only time I
saw Frobisher was with you.

399
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,163
Look, I'm sorry you're
going through all this.

400
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,090
If there's anything
I can do, okay?

401
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:46,031
Hey, if you need anything...

402
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,973
Okay. First off,
want to applaud the three

403
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,010
of you for being here.

404
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:03,293
Family dynamics aren't easy
to talk about, and just your

405
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:06,242
presence in this room is cause
for optimism that, together,

406
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,633
we will be able to
get to the source of

407
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:10,613
what's troubling Michael.

408
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,642
That's our goal as well.

409
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:13,311
Gat.

410
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:15,752
Just so I can understand
some basics here--

411
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:18,870
Mr. Grey, you're Michael's stepfather,
is that right?

412
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:20,940
Yes. We've been living
together as a family

413
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,363
for 12 years now.

414
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,161
Phil is my father,
Dr. Herschenfeld.

415
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,411
I see.

416
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,773
Well, then, as Michael's parents,
I'd like to hear from you,

417
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:35,043
why you think we're here today.

418
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:39,342
Well, I think we're here
today because Michael has

419
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:41,782
manipulated you
people into thinking

420
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:43,673
he deserves yet another chance.

421
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:44,133
Patty.

422
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:46,683
No. No, no, no,
no, that's okay.

423
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,723
Go on, Ms. Hewes.

424
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,263
No, there's no more.

425
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,720
I was finished.

426
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,563
Having spoken with Michael,
I have to say,

427
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,460
as a therapist and educator,
my immediate concern is a recent

428
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,131
dream of his regarding
his mortality.

429
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:03,932
And my paralyzing
fear of death.

430
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:05,821
Right.

431
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,142
Are you familiar
with the dream?

432
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,911
Oh, yes, we are.

433
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:14,042
It's not Michael's.

434
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,372
- No?
- No.

435
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,923
Michael heard that
from somebody else.

436
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,312
Come in.

437
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:37,980
Are you gonna be
here all night?

438
00:22:37,985 --> 00:22:39,312
It looks like it.

439
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:42,522
- How's it going?
- Great.

440
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:44,280
I think I'm gonna finish
it a little early.

441
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,923
I know how hectic
it's been for you.

442
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,711
Ellen, I don't give out awards

443
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,532
for beating deadlines.

444
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,660
Make sure you're putting
your best foot forward.

445
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,540
I will.

446
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:59,040
I always liked this office.

447
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,343
You're lucky-- no distractions.

448
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,843
You have your work
and you do it.

449
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:12,680
How are you holding up?

450
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,221
Fine.

451
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:16,022
Fine.

452
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,220
It turns out my son isn't
gonna be expelled after all.

453
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:21,691
That's great news.

454
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:24,232
Yeah, great.

455
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,283
- New pictures?
- Oh, yes. Sorry.

456
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:30,990
I know you don't like personal
stuff around the office.

457
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:33,992
- Who told you that?
- Tom.

458
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,661
Tom.

459
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:39,670
Always speaking out of turn.

460
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:41,792
I wonder how he is.

461
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:43,193
- Can I see them?
- Sure.

462
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,672
It's just my family.

463
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:50,680
Let me see.

464
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:54,012
I like that family's
important to you.

465
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,571
When did you say your
engagement party is?

466
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:02,732
Friday night.

467
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,572
Soon.

468
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:12,033
Very.

469
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:14,531
So.

470
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,702
That's exciting.

471
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,041
Yeah.

472
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:25,042
Those bookends are hideous.

473
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,053
Take them home.

474
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,980
Hello? Did I wake you?

475
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,863
That's okay.

476
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:50,742
- Are you still working?
- Do you think I should invite Patty?

477
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,321
Where?

478
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,321
To the engagement party.

479
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,993
I don't know.

480
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,351
She was hanging
around my office.

481
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:00,890
I think maybe she
wants to be invited.

482
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:05,333
- Really?
- Do you think it's rude not to?

483
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:07,091
I don't know.

484
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:12,971
Do you have to invite
her bodyguard?

485
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,683
I'll just give her the address.

486
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:18,013
- Right?
- Okay.

487
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:21,353
All right. Just come home.

488
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:29,111
- Come in!
- Sorry to bother you.

489
00:25:29,115 --> 00:25:31,193
If you're free,
we'd love you to come Friday night.

490
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,790
Or not.

491
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:41,291
If you can't.

492
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,700
It's a lovely thought.

493
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,673
Now close the door,
I've got work to do.

494
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,672
Sure.

495
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:20,450
- Hey. Can't sleep?
- I'm sorry.

496
00:26:20,457 --> 00:26:21,950
Go back to bed.

497
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:25,410
You know I can't
sleep without you.

498
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,933
The guard has changed
shift in the lobby.

499
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,223
The door's locked.

500
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:42,511
Michael is sound asleep...

501
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:45,353
and you are safe.

502
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,900
I'll never be safe.

503
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:52,192
You can't let yourself
think that way.

504
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:07,541
Good morning.

505
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:09,041
Morning, Ms. Hewes.

506
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,042
Uh, here's the brief.

507
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:10,831
There's an index...

508
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:11,831
And good morning to you.

509
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:13,412
- You stay all night?
- Yeah.

510
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:15,740
You have more time
if you need it.

511
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:17,673
No, I'm good, thank you.

512
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:20,840
Hmm, we'll see about that.

513
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,393
Thank you.

514
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:22,142
You're welcome.

515
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:25,520
And how's your morning?

516
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:27,321
Every day above ground
is a Pyrrhic victory.

517
00:27:28,235 --> 00:27:32,771
- How about yourself?
- I let it get to me last night,

518
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,493
Pete, but today's another day.

519
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:38,152
That's my girl.

520
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,700
Thank you. Morning.

521
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,321
Got so much work to do.

522
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,921
- Did you get this taken care of?
- My guy petitioned

523
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:48,120
the hard drive, indexed the content,
then ran a purge.

524
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:50,003
Which means?

525
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:51,252
It's been wiped clean.

526
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,011
Here's a list of what
Michael had in there.

527
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:58,551
- What's a M-I-L-F?
- I have no idea.

528
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:02,553
Michael also
enjoyed SororitySluts.com,

529
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,313
JugBangers.net and
Cornhole Capers.

530
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:07,773
Stop it.

531
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,613
Oh, hell, Patty,
it's just teenage curiosity.

532
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,380
Miss Hewes,
your limo's waiting.

533
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:15,730
Talk later.

534
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,132
So he works for a
consulting firm.

535
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:20,521
Yeah, but back when he met
Katie in Florida, he was

536
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:22,430
waiting tables in
the West Village.

537
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,021
That's an interesting
career path.

538
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:28,542
The thing is,
Frobisher has had no dealings

539
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:29,623
with Gregory's firm.

540
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:33,963
I can't find a link
between these guys.

541
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:36,840
Gregory wears a wedding ring.

542
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:39,040
So it's possible that
Katie's just lying

543
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,431
to hide their affair.

544
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:44,232
- Why not subpoena him?
- No, we're gonna wait

545
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:47,313
until we know what's there.

546
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:49,751
Oh, Tom, could you see if there's
anything we can use in this?

547
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,102
If not, rewrite it.

548
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,363
- Who wrote it?
- Ellen.

549
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,793
What's the problem?
I thought you wanted

550
00:28:58,828 --> 00:28:59,202
some legal work.

551
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:01,150
Do you think rewriting
a first-year's draft

552
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:03,910
is what I had in mind?

553
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,500
Come in.

554
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:18,961
Just checking on you.

555
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,971
Thought, uh, you can use this.

556
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:28,101
Sure.

557
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:36,811
If someone really wanted to kill me,
be honest, there's not a

558
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,571
damn thing you could do about it,
is there?

559
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:40,622
No one's going to touch you,
Miss Hewes.

560
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:43,860
Not on my watch.

561
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:50,543
You know, ever since I was little,
I've always thought

562
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:52,582
I'd die violently.

563
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:59,551
This, uh, man who attacked you,
who was he?

564
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:05,342
He was a former CEO.

565
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:08,642
At trial, he lost everything.

566
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:16,311
I came out of the courthouse
so pleased to have won...

567
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:20,021
I didn't see him coming.

568
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,783
- I learned something, though.
- What's that?

569
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:28,620
Taking power away from a
man is a dangerous thing.

570
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,542
Someone always pays.

571
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,383
Okay, Jorge.

572
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:48,592
Evening, Mr. Grey.

573
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,103
Evening, Jorge.

574
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:51,892
Thank you.

575
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:01,020
Jorge, the seat.

576
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,063
You have to put the seat
back after you've driven.

577
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:04,823
I've got long legs, okay?

578
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,581
Mr. Grey!

579
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,742
- Is he okay?
- He's gonna be fine.

580
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,891
We're gonna take him in,
run a few tests.

581
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,272
Just make sure
everything's okay.

582
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:09,100
His head hit the windshield
after the scare.

583
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:11,052
Hey.

584
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:14,812
Hey.

585
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:18,023
- What scare?
- I was reaching for my

586
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:19,382
glasses in the
glove compartment.

587
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:21,812
There was another grenade.

588
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:26,530
I'm so sorry.

589
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:56,600
- Hell of a night, huh?
- I'm glad Phil's okay.

590
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:03,562
Thank you, Tom.

591
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:04,921
Do you have Ellen's
draft for me?

592
00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:08,030
Yeah. Although, uh,
there's nothing I could do.

593
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,190
- It's that bad?
- No. Besides a

594
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,992
formatting error, it's perfect.

595
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:26,881
- How's Ellen doing?
- She's a little naive,

596
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:30,841
works hard, but...

597
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:35,000
But what?

598
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:38,143
I question her priorities.

599
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:49,980
This is great work.

600
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,242
Thank you.

601
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,320
We've assembled the brief.

602
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:56,061
I want you to personally submit
the chambers copy to Judge

603
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,661
Toomey.

604
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,223
I want him to put a
face to your name.

605
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,243
You'll be making a first
impression that could serve us

606
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,123
well if we go to trial.

607
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,042
Thank you, Miss Hewes.

608
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:09,062
Don't thank me, Ellen.
You earned it.

609
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:12,922
I want the man to
know who you are.

610
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,003
Heading out?

611
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,393
Delivering the brief to Toomey.

612
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:22,592
- No shit?
- Yeah.

613
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:23,802
Hope you cleared a few hours.

614
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:25,351
No, I'm just handing it in.

615
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:26,970
Then I have my
engagement party.

616
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:28,582
Toomey will keep you
waiting all night.

617
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:30,900
He's notorious for it.

618
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:34,443
It's Uncle Pete.

619
00:34:34,497 --> 00:34:36,210
My guy did some research
on that Web site.

620
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:38,011
- What is it, Pete?
- I think you're

621
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,541
gonna want to see for yourself.

622
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,152
Hi. Ellen Parsons
for Judge Toomey.

623
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,242
- Regarding...?
- I'm delivering the

624
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,850
opposition brief in
the Frobisher case.

625
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,201
You can just leave it with me.

626
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,723
Miss Hewes asked me to
deliver it personally.

627
00:34:58,846 --> 00:34:59,512
Suit yourself.

628
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:01,352
The Judge is holding a
settlement conference.

629
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,642
It'll be a while.

630
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:11,900
- Water?
- I'm fine, thanks.

631
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:27,153
Why didn't your
bodyguard come in?

632
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:32,093
You gonna risk your life
for a bowl of ziti?

633
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:34,010
I told Mr. Petroni that

634
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:35,510
I wanted to talk to you alone.

635
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:39,380
More like yell at me alone.

636
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:45,270
Why did you tell my dream
to everyone at school?

637
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,523
You saw.

638
00:35:46,528 --> 00:35:48,482
They thought it was cool.

639
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:49,693
It's not yours.

640
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:52,273
So?

641
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,322
So, you lied to everyone.

642
00:35:56,328 --> 00:36:00,242
Yeah. What's your point?

643
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:03,871
Thank you.

644
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:07,041
Could we have some
water, please?

645
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:11,040
I am not accusing you.

646
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,842
I am just confused.

647
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,963
I am trying to understand you.

648
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:17,802
Okay.

649
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:22,013
If you're angry with me,
why don't you just tell me?

650
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:27,473
Angry. I don't evenve know
what you're talking about.

651
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:31,142
Yes, you do.

652
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,190
If you say so.

653
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,741
Hey, everybody wants to know

654
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:42,910
when you're gonna get here.

655
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,872
I have no idea.

656
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:47,350
I should probably just leave
the brief with the receptionist.

657
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,573
You said it's a big deal
to meet the judge, right?

658
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:51,680
Yeah, but is it more
important than...?

659
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,663
Ellen, look,
I can keep your family occupied for a

660
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:59,673
while longer,
but the decision's yours.

661
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:07,683
Do you think you
might be depressed?

662
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,602
No. I think I'm tired.

663
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:12,563
That's just 'cause I
purposely stay up too late.

664
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:14,762
You stay up too
late on purpose?

665
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:21,993
I want to feel tired so
that I can feel stupid.

666
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:23,993
Michael, I don't understand
why you would want

667
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,780
to feel stupid.

668
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:28,241
Because I'm scared.

669
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,283
Of what?

670
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:31,501
Of being smarter than you.

671
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:32,943
I'm afraid you're
gonna realize it.

672
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:34,372
Stop playing games.

673
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:36,543
Fine, I won't explain.

674
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,631
All right, okay, okay.

675
00:37:39,638 --> 00:37:42,673
Go ahead, explain.

676
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:50,970
When I make you angry
or I make you laugh,

677
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:54,482
I do it because of
controlling you.

678
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:55,680
So you enjoy manipulating me?

679
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,272
No, God, no.

680
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,192
It's way too easy.

681
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:00,401
I don't enjoy it.

682
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:01,492
I feel sorry for you.

683
00:38:01,498 --> 00:38:03,611
You make me sad.

684
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:08,030
I don't believe you.

685
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,750
I think you resent me,
you resent my work.

686
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:16,953
You have every right to,

687
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:20,840
but that doesn't
justify your behavior.

688
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:24,761
What behavior?

689
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,511
It has to stop, Michael.

690
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:33,142
- What has to stop?
- It has to stop now.

691
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,312
Do you understand me?

692
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,611
We done?

693
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,412
I guess so.

694
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:11,972
- How you doing, man?
- What's up?

695
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,023
Spare a cigarette?

696
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:15,561
Sure.

697
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,901
Thanks. Appreciate it.

698
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,361
Got a light?

699
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:37,713
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

700
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,551
Holy Christ!

701
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:56,260
If you change your mind,
just leave that on my desk.

702
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,310
I'm off to karaoke.

703
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:00,520
I should probably stay.

704
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:01,861
You know, it's just a brief.

705
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:05,233
Attorneys leave them
with me all the time.

706
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:14,323
The first step to discipline
is control through fear.

707
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,301
The first seven days, your son
is allowed absolutely no contact

708
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,001
with the outside world.

709
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:24,300
How about the Internet?

710
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:26,300
Nothing.

711
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:31,091
Good.

712
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:33,373
Who the hell knew
that a 17-year-old

713
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:35,720
could buy a grenade online?

714
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:41,770
Ma'am, you did the right thing.

715
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,240
Oh, I forgot about you.

716
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,910
True to form,
the Judge was running three hours late.

717
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:58,552
She was still there
when I left at 9:15.

718
00:40:59,548 --> 00:41:00,702
That's an intersting choice.

719
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,542
Thanks, Delia.

720
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:21,520
- Miss Parsons?
- Yes.

721
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,522
Patty insisted I damn well
be wer make it a point

722
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,443
to meet you.

723
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:26,600
It's a pleasure, Your Honor.

724
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:29,060
Patty says you're the best
and the brightest and she's

725
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:30,942
not one for hyperbole.

726
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:35,620
- You got time for a chat?
- Uh, sure, sir.

727
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,290
Yes, definitely.

728
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,042
Thank you, sir.

729
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:41,122
You are one of the
lucky ones coming up

730
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,711
under Patty Hewes.

731
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,790
She cut the shit
and come clean?

732
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:58,312
Still swears she didn't
kill her fiance.

733
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,553
Well, technically, she didn't.

734
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:02,250
What do you mean?

735
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,773
He wasn't her fiance.

736
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:05,190
We canvassed the building.

737
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:07,593
The neighbors said they
had a hell of a beef

738
00:42:07,948 --> 00:42:08,861
and she walked out.

739
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:11,940
Really?

740
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,571
The engagement was called off.

741
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,581
Sounds like he
really liked you.

742
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:26,793
- You're the best, huh?
- And the brightest.

743
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:35,221
- Was it worth it?
- I don't know.

744
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:37,221
Depends.

745
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:38,982
How pissed is my family?
You know your dad.

746
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:50,860
I'll make it up to them.

747
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:52,461
I'll make it up to
them at the wedding.

748
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:09,672
I didn't kill David.

749
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:12,843
Someone tried to kill me.

750
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:19,636

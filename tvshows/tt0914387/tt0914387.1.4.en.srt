1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,089
My God.

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,424
Ellen.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,509
What happened?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,719
I didn't kill David.

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,389
Someone tried to kill me.

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,978
Arthur Frobisher told his
employees to invest in

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,648
the company and then
sold his own stock.

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,192
We don't have a case
unless we can connect

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,444
Frobisher with his broker.

10
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:28,320
You're my sister.

11
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,800
How do you know
Arthur Frobisher?

12
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:33,614
You and I, we meet at some
boring luncheon down in Florida,

13
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:36,282
and the next thing you know,
we're-we're partners.

14
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:38,530
Katie, this whole case
turns on one weekend,

15
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,541
and you were there.

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,542
You're stepping into
the spotlight now.

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,792
Details of your life
are going to come out.

18
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,291
I think Katie's lying about
the guy she met in Florida.

19
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:47,922
His name is Gregory Malina.

20
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:50,630
Do you remember we actually
saw him down in Florida?

21
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:52,883
If you do know something,
you should come down

22
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:54,420
and speak to the
lawyers with me.

23
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,842
The only time I saw
Frobisher was with you.

24
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:59,762
If Patty Hewes gets that
girl in front of a jury,

25
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,011
all bets are off.

26
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:04,022
Ten years, one box, one trip.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:05,390
You didn't deserve this.

28
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,901
I miss seeing you around
the office, Tommy.

29
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:10,772
Everyone thinks you
were actually canned.

30
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,032
What is it, Tom?

31
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,701
Following Katie Connor?

32
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,153
I'm a lawyer, Patty.

33
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,493
I miss it.

34
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,630
Hey, everybody wants to know

35
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,123
when you're going to get here.

36
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,002
I have no idea.

37
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,412
The decision's yours.

38
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,920
Ellen was still there
when I left at 9:15.

39
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,550
Well, interesting choice.

00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:49,563
Palm

42
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:51,060
Beach

43
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,450
Florida

44
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:21,600
Can I just say what
a bad idea this is?

45
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,350
Gregory.

46
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,393
Katie.

47
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:33,691
What the hell was that?

48
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,743
Come on, follow me.

49
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,201
Wait, wait, wait.

50
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,862
How many drinks did you have?

51
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:43,333
The two, with Gregory,
and then...

52
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:45,042
before that maybe another beer.

53
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,620
And no drugs?

54
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:47,701
No drugs.

55
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:49,501
And you never caught
his last name.

56
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:50,670
We have been over this.

57
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:53,633
It's no like it
was a formal date.

58
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:55,882
I love Florida!

59
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:57,560
Let's go to another
club.Come on.

60
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:58,220
Oh, I can't.

61
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,343
I got a big day tomorrow--
I've gotta be up early. I can't.

62
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:02,091
Who doesn't?

63
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,623
If you don't go to sleep,
you don't have to wake up, right?

64
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:05,892
Huh? Huh?

65
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,852
Oh, God.

66
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:10,351
Okay!

67
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:12,190
Wait for me!

68
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:14,313
And you didn't see
Frobisher in the nightclub?

69
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,361
No, I didn't even know
what he looked like

70
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:17,451
until the parking lot.

71
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:17,941
No shit.

72
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,151
You live in Brooklyn, too?

73
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,862
"It's better in
the the boroughs."

74
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:21,992
I live in Williamburg.

75
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:22,872
Isn't that crazy?

76
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,050
You come all the way to Florida
and meet someone who lives,

77
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:26,370
like, five minutes away.

78
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:28,080
What are you doing down here?

79
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,910
Business. You?

80
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:32,040
Oh, shit.

81
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:34,332
Friends of yours?

82
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,502
I wish.

83
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:36,432
That's Arthur Frobisher.

84
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,522
The guy's got more
money than Trump.

85
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:38,630
Huh!

86
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,342
You think that guy eats beef?

87
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:43,973
I think that guy eats
small cows for breakfast.

88
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,891
I'm catering a function
for him tomorrow.

89
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,020
Ah, you're a cook.

90
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,732
We prefer to say "chef."

91
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,020
I'm a waiter.

92
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:54,230
I guess that means
I'm beneath you.

93
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:55,983
Not yet.

94
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,401
You want me to keep going?

95
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:02,743
We still don't have enough

96
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,282
unless you can identify the
man who got in the limo.

97
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:11,462
I only saw him for,
like, a split second.

98
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,620
Is there anything
you can remember?

99
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:15,792
Was he tall, short?

100
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:16,961
Young, old?

101
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:19,713
It was five years ago.

102
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,802
But I can tell you that he
wasn't any of these people

103
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:24,593
you showed me from
the government trial.

104
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,393
And what about your
one-night stand?

105
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,263
Greg lived in Williamsburg.
He was a waiter.

106
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:31,311
He was staying in
his friend's condo.

107
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,391
Which we can't find
because you don't remember

108
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,401
what part of town you were in.

109
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:38,323
Why don't you try hypnosis?

110
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,730
It helped me quit smoking.

111
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:42,692
Still stuck in the parking lot?

112
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,741
Afraid so.

113
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,873
Hmm. Well,
you know what's going to happen

114
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:49,592
if we don't come
up with anything?

115
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:52,252
The clients are going to
accept Frobisher's settlement.

116
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:56,712
Unless Katie turns out
to be a viable witness.

117
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,342
What is this?

118
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,220
A Ding Dong.

119
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,050
A what?

120
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:10,350
A Ding Dong.

121
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,100
It's delicious.

122
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:16,940
Go home. It's late.

123
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,311
Try again tomorrow.

124
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,033
It tastes like a Ho Ho.

125
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:38,583
Ms. Connor,
is that your brother?

126
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:43,173
Y... Yes!

127
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,303
Oh, my...

128
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,470
Oh, God!

132
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:41,612
Hewes, Michael.

133
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,531
His mother.

134
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,240
What?

135
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,280
Why not?
He's been there a week.

136
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:54,163
He's entitled to
phone privileges.

137
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,083
Listen...

138
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:03,542
I've waited seven days
to talk to my son,

139
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:06,210
and now you're
telling me I can't?

140
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,092
Fine.

141
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:13,140
I said fine.

142
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:16,060
I'll call again next week.

143
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,330
Mr. Frobisher's case
is fully staffed.

144
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:46,960
We're billing roughly
$550,000 per month.

145
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:48,260
And the payments?

146
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,464
Always prompt.

147
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,092
Our client's aware of
all the exigencies one

148
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,932
encounters when trying a
case against Patty Hewes.

149
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,103
Ray, what does she have that

150
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,643
she has not accepted Mr.
Frobisher's settlement offer?

151
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,060
Nothing.

152
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:07,942
Ms. Hewes has been unable to provide
even one significant witness.

153
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,742
She's failed to
produce any evidence

154
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,910
that Mr. Frobisher breached
his duty to his employees,

155
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,162
or participated in the
alleged fraud that she...

156
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,283
Ray...

157
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:19,120
Yes, Amos?

158
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:24,000
You know how much Mr.
Frobisher's case means to this firm.

159
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,592
Get it done.

160
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:33,302
Yes, sir.

161
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:37,680
Roughly 5,
200 employees are involved in the suit.

162
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:43,232
Arthur Frobisher-- he wiped out
our whole retirement account.

163
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,603
$1.4 billion.

164
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,110
Gone.

165
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:51,240
So, you know, most of us,
we just lost everything we had.

166
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,953
You have to stop
torturing yourself.

167
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,993
You're doing
everything you can.

168
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,291
Am I?

169
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,040
Yes, Katie, you are.

170
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:06,921
Patty needs to know who got
in that limo with Frobisher.

171
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,712
And she keeps
asking about you--

172
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,801
my one-night stand.

173
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,300
What if I can't keep this up?

174
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:18,010
What if I slip, or they back
me into a corner or something?

175
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:22,102
You're going to be fine. Okay?

176
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,811
Maybe you should come in.

177
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:28,651
Why won't you just
talk to them?

178
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:30,483
And tell them what?

179
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:33,573
I saw the same thing you did.

180
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:36,990
Maybe you'd remember something
if you saw the pictures.

181
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,661
Hey, if I go in there,

182
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:42,790
then my wife is going
to find out about us,

183
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:45,163
and then we'll be over,
and I don't want that.

184
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:46,833
It's not about us.

185
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:51,340
It's about Frobisher and those
people whose lives he ruined.

186
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,841
Patty is the only one holding
him responsible for this.

187
00:09:56,018 --> 00:10:00,011
You really think Patty
Hewes cares about you?

188
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:04,770
Here is the complete
dossier on Katie Connor.

189
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,601
Is she still seeing Gregory?

190
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,600
Almost every day.

191
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:11,363
You think she knows anything?

192
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,903
I'm not sure.

193
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:15,442
Keep an eye on her.

194
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,542
If she's going to
give us something,

195
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,910
she's going to have
to get it from him.

196
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:26,082
My guy says he can get Greg's stock
portfolio by the end of the week.

197
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:27,123
Good.

198
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:29,830
No. No, it's not good, Patty.

199
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:33,001
This kind of thing
could get me disbarred.

200
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:37,092
Are you okay?

201
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:39,341
I'm fine.

202
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,853
Are you still on the board of the
Jazz Society at Lincoln Center?

203
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,393
Why?

204
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,783
Well, the head of the Trilling
School is on it, too,

205
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:49,131
and I was wondering if you'd
put in a word in for Megan...

206
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:50,651
Tom, wake up.

207
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,311
People think I fired you.

208
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:55,903
Find another connection.

209
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:03,870
What is it?

210
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,621
I guess it's a rite of passage.

211
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:06,911
What is?

212
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,663
It was the ICU.

213
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:11,251
I assisted on my first
bypass yesterday,

214
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,792
and the patient's
not doing so hot.

215
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:15,093
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

216
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,591
The family looks at
you like you're God.

217
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,883
If they only knew...

218
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:23,393
Ugh!

219
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,890
Shit.

220
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:29,812
So much for exercise.

221
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,193
What?

222
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:32,980
What are you doing tonight?

223
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:34,363
I got a couple hours.

224
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:35,360
So?

225
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:36,480
Catch a movie?

226
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:37,532
I'm in.

227
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,192
Movie, tonight.

228
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,031
You got your
saxophone, sweetheart?

229
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:41,911
I'm holding it.

230
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,753
Daddy, I'm going to
be late for assembly.

231
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:44,833
Okay, okay.

232
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,581
You look bellisima.

233
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:47,412
Bye, Dad.

234
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,040
Bye-bye.

235
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,660
Good luck with the solo.

236
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,920
I'll be thinking of you.

237
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,803
You didn't tell me
she was a musician.

238
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:58,632
Martin, twice in one week.

239
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:01,013
We got to stop
meeting like this.

240
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:03,843
I was hoping we could
finish Monday's chat.

241
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:07,061
I appreciate the offer.

242
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:08,490
I've been doing some
soul searching--

243
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,020
I'm just not ready
to start work yet.

244
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,060
Bullshit.

245
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:18,281
I know what's going on
between you and Patty.

246
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,490
Excuse me?

247
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,452
The whole world sees it.

248
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,701
She treats you like
dirt for ten years,

249
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,160
won't share the spotlight,

250
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,493
then she refuses to
make you a partner.

251
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:31,910
You don't know what you're
talking about, Martin.

252
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,123
Sure, I don't.

253
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,330
You're not a battered wife

254
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,291
defending her abusive
husband to the end, huh?

255
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:37,380
Oh, geez.

256
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:38,600
Yeah, that's it.
No, you got it.

257
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:39,250
That's me.

258
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:42,592
You know, your little girl--
she's terrific.

259
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,010
She's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

260
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,391
She serious with the music?

261
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:50,523
Yeah, she's pretty serious,
considering she's ten.

262
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,271
I ask 'cause I know that she's
got an application at Trilling.

263
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,321
How do you know that?

264
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,241
Well, I'm president elect
of the parents' board.

265
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,320
You guys have put together
an outstanding app.

266
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:05,912
Good, good.

267
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,551
Megan's got her heart
set on Trilling.

268
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:09,162
All her friends are going.

269
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,203
Got to say, it's...

270
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,461
it sure is tough though
to accept an applicant

271
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,582
whose father checks
the "unemployed" box.

272
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,552
Martin...

273
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,010
Don't do this.

274
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:24,221
Come on, take it easy, Tom.

275
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:25,881
There are other schools.

276
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,590
Some of them even pretty good.

277
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,972
But, at Trilling, we've got the
music department in the entire city.

278
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:33,811
Harvard, Yale, Princeton--

279
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:37,483
without Trilling,
they don't have orchestras.

280
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,322
I'd love to see Megan get in.

281
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,043
Comedy or drama?

282
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,791
I'm sorry?

283
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:56,482
I heard you telling
that other doctor

284
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,671
that you were going
to go see a movie.

285
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,552
Oh, I'm sorry you overheard
my personal conversation.

286
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:06,883
Oh, I shouldn't have
been listening.

287
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,021
I want you to know that
we are doing everything

288
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:12,852
that we can to make your
grandfather comfortable.

289
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,600
I know. Thanks.

290
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,100
And I really appreciate all
the time you take with him.

291
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,270
You've been great.

292
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,521
So...

293
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:24,993
comedy or drama?

294
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,650
Uh, I don't know.

295
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:32,202
I was thinking maybe the Cassavetes
retrospective at Film Forum.

296
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,453
I've never heard of that.

297
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:34,912
Is it funny?

298
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,250
No.

299
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:37,460
It's pretty serious.

300
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,001
'70s stuff.

301
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,831
I guess I'm more
the drama type.

302
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:41,590
Oh, not me.

303
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:42,342
I love comedies.

304
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,091
You know,
they're just so funny.

305
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:45,961
Oh, oh, check it out.

306
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:54,353
My grandpa got me into
these old radio shows.

307
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,391
Here.

308
00:14:58,608 --> 00:14:59,850
Who is this?

309
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,652
It's Jack Benny.

310
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,153
It's good.

311
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:09,203
Grandpa loves the guy,
so I downloaded it for him.

312
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,163
That'll be nice.

313
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,333
Yeah. Well...

314
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,740
Enjoy your big night out.

315
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:17,542
Thank you.

316
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:18,913
And have some popcorn for me.

317
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,502
'Cause I'll be here.

318
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,880
Sure thing.

319
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,923
Oh, and Dr. Conner...

320
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,722
Be a little naughty.

321
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,762
Excuse me?

322
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,641
Get something chocolate.

323
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,972
You got it.

324
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:43,900
Ellen?

325
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:44,953
Hey, can you come in tomorrow?

326
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,651
I pulled more photos
to run by you.

327
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:49,030
Minor players,
but we should check them out.

328
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,490
Okay, I can try.

329
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,830
Cool. I'll be in
the office at 8:00.

330
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,203
Look, I got to go.

331
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:58,371
What are you doing here?

332
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:00,870
I know who he is.

333
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,420
The guy in the limo.

334
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,422
With Frobisher?

335
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:08,210
Katie, I don't want to get
involved in any of this, okay?

336
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:10,763
But you saw his face.

337
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,931
I didn't know who he was
when we first saw him.

338
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,261
Then I recognized
him on Court TV.

339
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:19,032
They did this thing on Frobisher's
broker during the criminal trial.

340
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,931
And who is he?

341
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:21,983
Katie...

342
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,152
What's his name?

343
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:27,732
His name is Luke Richards.

344
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,070
Luke Richards?

345
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,740
He was one of the
broker's assistants.

346
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,450
But Ellen said all of the
assistants had alibis.

347
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,672
Well, Richards must be lying,

348
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:38,083
because I definitely saw him.

349
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,952
Gregory, if you could have
linked Frobisher to his broker,

350
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:41,882
why didn't you tell me?

351
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,540
Because I'm not going
to get involved.

352
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:44,750
What?! Why not?!

353
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,843
I don't want to be
another Kato Kalen.

354
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:49,132
Let 15 minutes of bullshit
ruin the rest of my life.

355
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:49,772
Gregory, for Jes...

356
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:50,513
No, no.

357
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,502
Maybe I'm an asshole,

358
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,653
but I'm not going to let these
people use me and throw me away.

359
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:55,111
Which is exactly what
they're going to do.

360
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,113
Okay, well, forget about them.

361
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,391
What about me?

362
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,471
I have risked everything I
have to put this guy away,

363
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:01,762
and now you're just going...

364
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,190
Going to be a
selfish prick? Yeah.

365
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,770
And you should, too.

366
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:07,731
Think about it, Katie.

367
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,732
You're going to lose
your restaurant,

368
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:13,533
your privacy,
any shot at having a normal life.

369
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:16,621
I do care about you.

370
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,703
I don't want to
see you get hurt.

371
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:22,290
Stay out of it.

372
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:26,331
Just stay out of it, okay?

373
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,251
Katie...

374
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:56,032
Darrell Goldstein interned
at Frobisher's company.

375
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:57,203
No, not him.

376
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,661
Paul Ordell-- he was a temp.

377
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,700
No.

378
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:03,003
Luke Richards.

379
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:10,753
Katie, what is it?

380
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,050
Hi, there.

381
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:14,512
I'm Arthur.

382
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:16,760
Oh, my God.

383
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:18,391
Katie?

384
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,391
You want me to be a
witness against Frobisher?

385
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,972
Yes, if you know something.

386
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:23,112
She's going to be screwed.

387
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:26,272
She will lose everything,
won't she?

388
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,782
Nothing. Keep going.

389
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,702
Stephen Gilbride.

390
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:40,660
No, not him.

391
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,793
Jason Raber.

392
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,041
No, not him.

393
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,411
You and I,

394
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:50,961
we never really spoke when we
were down in Florida, did we?

395
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,341
No, no, that's right.

396
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,261
I want the straight story,

397
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,193
and until you tell me,

398
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:57,142
you're worthless to me.

399
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:59,972
I don't give a shit about you.

400
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,141
No, go back to that other guy.

401
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,932
No, before him.

402
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,561
Yeah, him.

403
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,113
You recognize him?

404
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,230
When was this picture taken?

405
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,442
Last year. Why?

406
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,110
Yeah, he was younger,

407
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:20,662
but...

408
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,530
But what?

409
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,793
It could be Luke Richards.

410
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,873
I think this could be the guy.

411
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:33,750
The guy you saw get in
the limo with Frobisher?

412
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,421
Yeah.

413
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:37,973
But a second ago you
said it wasn't him.

414
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,092
Because he looked familiar,

415
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:41,510
and...

416
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:44,052
Yeah, this is definitely him.

417
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:46,521
Katie, are you 100% sure?

418
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,433
It's okay if you're not.

419
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:53,190
Our fates are
intertwined, Katie.

420
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:55,860
Isn't that remarkable?

421
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:04,992
I'm sure.

422
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,201
Who is he, anyway?

423
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:13,170
Richards was an assistant
to Frobisher's broker.

424
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:16,000
You're kidding.Seriously?

425
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:30,733
You farted in your
sleep last night.

426
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,062
David!

427
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:33,651
You're on speaker.

428
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,483
Classic.

429
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:36,940
My bad.

430
00:20:37,115 --> 00:20:38,823
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

431
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:39,743
It's a great day,

432
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:40,822
David.

433
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:41,610
Oh, yeah?

434
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:42,653
Why's that?

435
00:20:42,786 --> 00:20:45,623
Your sister really
came through today.

436
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,620
We're moving forward.

437
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,041
Oh, God.

438
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,293
David?

439
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,581
We're going to prepare
Katie's testimony.

440
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:54,752
What?

441
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,091
She made an ID.

442
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,671
Babe, are you busy?

443
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,630
Uh... yeah, kind of.

444
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,092
Can I, um...
can we talk tonight?

445
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,931
Yeah, sure.

446
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:11,271
I don't think he's
getting much sleep.

447
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,523
I don't think he's
getting laid.

448
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,850
Hey, okay, too far.

449
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:18,770
R-I-C-H-A-R-D-S, Luke.

450
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:22,440
Find out where he was on
the Frobisher weekend.

451
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:23,123
All right, Patty,

452
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,992
I'll look into it.

453
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:43,673
Martin, Tom Shayes.

454
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:45,303
Make me an offer.

455
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:47,723
I'm ready to listen.

456
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,972
Bad news, Ray.

457
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:55,273
Looks like they got a witness.

458
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,743
Such a sweet girl.

459
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:09,163
I was hoping it wasn't
going to come to this.

460
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,741
A mock deposition is

461
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,953
just a tool to see where
you're at in your testimony.

462
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:16,040
Patty's brought
in Roger Kastle.

463
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:17,500
Who's he?

464
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:19,633
Big name in
medical malpractice.

465
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:20,883
He's kind of a legend.

466
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,382
Is he a sleazeball?

467
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,970
Patty's asked him to play
the role of Ray Fiske.

468
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,552
Perfect.

469
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:31,140
And you're certain this
is the man you saw enter

470
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,513
Mr. Frobisher's limousine?

471
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:35,430
Yes, 100% certain.

472
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,851
Okay.

473
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:39,562
Good.

474
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:41,610
So, Ms. Connor,

475
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:46,492
how would you characterize your
stay at the Maxwell Clinic?

476
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,030
What do you mean?

477
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:49,041
I was simply wondering

478
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:52,333
if your stint in
rehab was successful.

479
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,293
You had an extremely
difficult time

480
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:55,702
overcoming your drug addiction,

481
00:22:55,837 --> 00:22:57,333
did you not?

482
00:22:57,467 --> 00:23:00,541
Eyes on me, Ms. Connor.

483
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:04,843
How is this relevant?

484
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,172
Blurred vision,

485
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:09,263
paranoia, auditory
hallucinations, unfortunately,

486
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:14,010
are all documented long-term side
effects of serious cocaine abuse.

487
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:17,062
I did one line in
the parking lot.

488
00:23:17,685 --> 00:23:18,693
But earlier that evening,

489
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,371
how many lines did
you do in the club?

490
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:21,361
And more importantly,

491
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:24,150
how much cocaine had you
consumed prior to that night?

492
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:25,362
I don't know.

493
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,780
Enough not to remember?

494
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,072
No, I didn't say that.

495
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:30,243
And this mystery man who
supplied you with cocaine,

496
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,532
what was his last name?

497
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:32,621
I don't remember.

498
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,873
I'm better with faces.

499
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,002
Oh, so yours is more
of a visual memory?

500
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,372
Yes.

501
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,710
Was he circumcised?

502
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,750
Was he circumcised, Ms. Connor?

503
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:44,840
You're kidding, right?

504
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:46,641
Well, now you said you
went back to his condo.

505
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,213
So what?

506
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:49,682
So I assumed you
had intercourse.

507
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,593
No.

508
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:56,771
did you schedule a procedure
at Hudson General to

509
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,391
terminate your pregnancy?

510
00:23:58,526 --> 00:23:59,811
Jesus Christ.

511
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:00,440
Ms. Hewes,

512
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,940
maybe we should take a break.

513
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:05,273
I thought we had
an understanding.

514
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,993
Ms. Connor,
would you characterize your life

515
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:14,913
as one big blur of
narcotics and intercourse?

516
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:17,370
Would you characterize
yourself as an asshole?

517
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,713
Let the record reflect that
the witness is refusing...

518
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,831
Somebody shut this guy up!

519
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:24,423
Katie, sit down.

520
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:29,091
Wow, she's not ready.

521
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:33,013
You signed their
medical release waiver.

522
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:37,890
Go on, sit down.

523
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,643
I told you that the truth would
have to come out eventually.

524
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:45,231
I also warned you
that the spotlight

525
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:48,902
is a pretty goddamn
awful place to be.

526
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:49,990
And Mr. Kastle's right,

527
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:51,861
you're not ready for it.

528
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:55,030
Because this deposition
isn't about the facts.

529
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:59,663
It's about Katie Connor and do
we like her and is she credible.

530
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,462
Yes, you saw this
man in Florida,

531
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,331
but it's your word
against theirs.

532
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:06,212
And if Ray Fiske
can embarrass you,

533
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:10,761
piss you off,
rattle you in any way, it's over.

534
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:12,973
He's done what he's
set out to do--

535
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:18,013
neutralize your testimony
and weaken our case.

536
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:23,771
Katie, why don't we go
outside for a moment?

537
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:27,061
No, I want to keep going.

538
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:29,151
Good.

539
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,573
Try again.

540
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:39,082
Oh, my God.

541
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,753
Can I talk to her?

542
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:44,673
Not until her
attorney gets back.

543
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,460
You really think she
killed my brother?

544
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,682
They were due to get
married in two weeks.

545
00:25:55,848 --> 00:26:00,643
Katie, you didn't know they
called off their engagement?

546
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:03,273
No. No.

547
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:05,152
We had a falling out,

548
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,112
we haven't spoken in months.

549
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:15,453
Katie, why didn't you tell me?

550
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:17,163
What,

551
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,451
that I got pregnant
and ended up in rehab?

552
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:22,700
Isn't it obvious?

553
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:28,333
I wanted to forget it ever
happened and then... this case.

554
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:31,551
What about Gregory?

555
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,382
He never even knew you were...

556
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:37,760
No, I never had a chance
to tell him the truth.

557
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:44,472
...the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

558
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,393
I do.

559
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,811
Ms. Connor,

560
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:52,401
thank you for joining us today.

561
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,650
And many thanks to the
plaintiff's attorney

562
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:56,783
for the use of her
conference room.

563
00:26:56,905 --> 00:27:00,700
Now, as for the subject
of today's deposition,

564
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:04,331
I've been instructed
by the court to limit

565
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:08,371
my questions to the 18th
and the 19th of June, 2002.

566
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,381
Those dates ring
a bell for you,

567
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,000
Ms. Connor?

568
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:14,343
Yes, sir.

569
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,461
I was in Palm Beach,

570
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:17,800
working for a catering
company at that time.

571
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:22,223
We were doing a business
event for Arthur Frobisher.

572
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:23,311
Ms. Connor,

573
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,811
do you recognize the
man in this photo?

574
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,600
Yes, that's Arthur Frobisher.

575
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:34,271
And the man in this photo?

576
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:36,440
Luke Richards.

577
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:37,241
Luke Richards.

578
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,283
Thank you, Ms. Connor.

579
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,462
Let the record reflect that the

580
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:43,702
witness has correctly
identified both men.

581
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,003
Now, Ms. Connor,

582
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:51,292
if you permit me to
cut to the chase...

583
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:54,091
you claim that
you saw these men

584
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,261
together early
morning on June 19,

585
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,972
do you not?

586
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:01,050
Yes, I did.

587
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:06,682
And where did this alleged
sighting take place?

588
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:10,601
In a parking lot on the
200 block of Ocean Avenue.

589
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:12,233
Mr. Frobisher was
in a limousine

590
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,400
and Mr.
Richards got into that limousine.

591
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:19,781
And where were you
when this happened?

592
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:22,610
I was in that same parking lot.

593
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:25,033
Alone?

594
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,703
No, sir.

595
00:28:29,378 --> 00:28:33,333
With whom were you
in this parking lot?

596
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:38,213
With a man I met in a club
earlier that evening.

597
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:45,393
If these next few
questions make you blush,

598
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,763
Ms.Connor,

599
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,352
I apologize.

600
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,730
To screw.

601
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm sorry?

602
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:57,072
That's why I was in
an empty parking lot

603
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,903
in the middle of the night.

604
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:03,113
And later on a couch
and then on the floor.

605
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:06,490
Do you find cocaine
is like Viagra?

606
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,950
Or are you more of a tantric
breathing kind of a guy,

607
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:11,753
like Sting?

608
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,422
If these past few answers
make you blush, Mr. Fiske,

609
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,421
I apologize.

610
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,473
So you saw Mr.Richards get into
a limo when it was parked,

611
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:32,813
what, 25, 30 yards away?

612
00:29:32,947 --> 00:29:35,812
I got my best look at
his face as he left.

613
00:29:35,988 --> 00:29:38,232
He turned his face
toward the window.

614
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:43,071
I couldn't have been more than
ten feet away at the time.

615
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:46,322
And this was when exactly?

616
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:50,412
Between 1:15 and 1:45 a.m.

617
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:54,621
You checked your watch.

618
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:57,541
Gunshots forced us
to leave the club.

619
00:29:57,677 --> 00:30:00,302
It's my understanding that
the police report documents

620
00:30:00,427 --> 00:30:02,760
this at approximately 1:15 a.m.

621
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,681
So, you saw Mr.
Frobisher with Mr. Richards

622
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,512
some time after 1:15 a.m.

623
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:12,893
Saturday morning June 19, 2002.

624
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:16,903
I remind you,
you're under oath, Ms. Connor.

625
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:21,572
Yes, that's when I saw them.

626
00:30:23,328 --> 00:30:27,610
Would you agree that a man
can't be in two places at once?

627
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:28,820
Objection to form.

628
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,491
Vague and ambiguous argument.

629
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,412
Noted.

630
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:35,393
Go ahead, Katie,

631
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:38,082
you can answer.

632
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:39,922
Yeah, I'd agree.

633
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,463
A man cannot be in
two places at once.

634
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:46,553
So, when Mr. Richards told
investigators he was at the

635
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:51,640
Jersey shore with a college buddy
pulling cod out of the Atlantic,

636
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:55,141
it's your contention
he was lying.

637
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:59,810
Yes, sir.

638
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,322
Mine, too.

639
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:05,491
Let's not get cute
here, Counsel.

640
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:06,953
Ms. Connor,

641
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:09,571
can you identify the
man in Exhibit 15?

642
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:11,332
Objection.

643
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:15,583
This exhibit was not made
available to us during discovery.

644
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,503
We've only just discovered
this ourselves.

645
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:22,173
We have every
intention of producing

646
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,841
it to Ms.
Hewes at the close of this deposition.

647
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,721
Noted.

648
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:30,432
You can answer.

649
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:35,520
The man in the picture,

650
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,811
Ms. Connor.

651
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:42,400
Luke Richards.

652
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,572
Luke Richards.

653
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:49,821
And the text there...
what does that say?

654
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:58,001
Out loud, Ms. Connor.

655
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:01,833
But this isn't true.

656
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:02,582
Ms. Connor,

657
00:32:02,718 --> 00:32:03,911
I'm not asking for an opinion,

658
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,212
I'm asking you to read.

659
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,590
Now what does it say?

660
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:20,520
"June 19, 2002, 1:37 a.m."

661
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:23,231
Let the record reflect
that Exhibit 15 shows

662
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:25,270
Mr.Richards withdrawing cash

663
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:30,783
from an ATM located at 333 Casino
East Boulevard, which is where,

664
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:31,412
Ms. Connor?

665
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:34,910
I'm telling you Luke Richards
was in that parking lot.

666
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,501
Can you read the last four words,
Ms. Connor?

667
00:32:38,627 --> 00:32:40,212
I am not lying, he was there.

668
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:43,581
The last four words.

669
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:47,670
"Atlantic City, New Jersey."

670
00:32:47,808 --> 00:32:48,712
But I swear to God,

671
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:52,473
he was in that parking lot.

672
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,760
Luke Richards did lie,
Ms. Connor,

673
00:32:54,898 --> 00:33:00,102
but I suspect it had everything
to do with that woman

674
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:06,232
standing next to him with the
muscular arms and Adam's apple.

675
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,783
He wasn't hiding Arthur
Frobisher's transgressions,

676
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,150
he was hiding his own.

677
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,163
Why are you lying?

678
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:16,993
Objection.

679
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:19,410
Argumentative.

680
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:21,912
This is bullshit!

681
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:28,211
I think we're finished here.

682
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:35,681
You hear that, Patty?

683
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,601
That's the sound of the zeroes

684
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:42,853
dropping off of Mr.
Frobisher's revised offer.

685
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,921
I heard everything went well.

686
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:12,013
The threat's gone.

687
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:14,593
She lied under oath.

688
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:16,972
I want you to know,

689
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,601
we ruined her life.

690
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:21,161
If you kept your
dick in your pants,

691
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,023
we wouldn't have had to.

692
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,731
It's been five years.

693
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:25,543
Starting today,

694
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,620
I want you guys to
leave me alone.

695
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:28,940
Just let me live my life.

696
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:32,110
I don't think that's
going to happen.

697
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,411
I don't even think
she remembers you.

698
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:39,743
Did I ask what you think?

699
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:51,182
Let's go to another
club.Come on.

700
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:51,921
Oh, I can't!

701
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,050
I got a big day tomorrow!

702
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:53,761
I can't!

703
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:54,330
Who doesn't?

704
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,652
If you don't go to sleep,
you don't have to wake up, right?

705
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:58,093
Right? Huh?

706
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,682
Okay!

707
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:02,763
Wait for me!

708
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:07,730
Five years from now,

709
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,693
what is Katie Connor doing?

710
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:15,323
I'd like my own little
restaurant in Brooklyn,

711
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,410
but that is not
going to happen.

712
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,202
Why not?

713
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,241
Because I have got the biggest
gig in my life tomorrow,

714
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,622
and I've got to be at
work in five hours,

715
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:27,501
and I am,

716
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:29,670
like, totally wired.

717
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:30,133
Oh...

718
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:30,630
Relax.

719
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:33,460
Hey, hey, relax.

720
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:37,800
Here, try one of these.

721
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:41,472
You'll be out in ten minutes.

722
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:47,232
I'm going to hit the shower.

723
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:48,483
Okay...

724
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,443
Only the white ones, okay?

725
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,983
Hmm.

726
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:37,362
You were right, you know?

727
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:40,703
Gregory turns out to
be our missing link.

728
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,293
Gregory Malina owned
Frobisher stock?

729
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,122
Guess when he cashed out.

730
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:56,502
June, 2002.

731
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:59,882
Katie Connor never
knew what hit her.

732
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,430
But you had the
photo before anyone,

733
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:05,472
so why would you
let her be deposed

734
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:08,182
if you knew she wouldn't
hold up as a witness?

735
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:11,311
Because now Ray Fiske thinks
we don't have anything.

736
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:17,151
And watch, his next step will be
to pull the settlement offer.

737
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,153
Which is what you
wanted all along.

738
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:32,040
Why? Why would you
do this to me? Why?!

739
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:33,921
Katie, Katie, come here.

740
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,423
Don't touch me.

741
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,000
You lied to me, asshole!

742
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:37,960
Hey, hey, hey...

743
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:38,893
Greg, are you cool?

744
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,051
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.

745
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:40,842
You lied to me!

746
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:43,552
Why did you lie to me?!

747
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:46,350
Answer my question!

748
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:47,693
Why don't you just
call me later, okay?

749
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:48,892
Yeah, I'll call you later.

750
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:50,853
I'll call your wife later.

751
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,482
Dude, you're married now?

752
00:37:57,158 --> 00:37:58,233
Katie...

753
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:02,951
Why would you do
this to me, Gregory?

754
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,411
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,870
Go to hell.

756
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:12,791
Katie.

757
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:15,750
This is your solution?

758
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,290
Katie, what about
the restaurant?

759
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:19,841
You can't just run
away from this.

760
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:20,960
I know. I tried.

761
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:22,381
You wouldn't let me.

762
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:23,720
What?

763
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:25,380
This is my fault?

764
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:28,303
I only tried to help your case.

765
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,260
Katie, you perjured yourself.

766
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,681
People go to jail for that.

767
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:33,482
There was an answer you wanted,

768
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,810
and you hounded me
until you got it.

769
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:37,310
That is bullshit.

770
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:39,441
You know,
you are not mad that I lied.

771
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:43,650
You are just pissed that I got
caught and made you look bad.

772
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,491
I only ever wanted the truth.

773
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,160
No, Ellen,

774
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:51,330
all you ever wanted was
to impress Patty Hewes.

775
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:55,160
Katie? Katie!

776
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:58,212
From day one,

777
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,302
I never wanted her
involved in this!

778
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,651
I'm so sorry, Miss Hewes.

779
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,483
I thought I knew her.

780
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:26,781
I trusted her.

781
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:31,123
Katie's a very
good liar, Ellen.

782
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,831
She had me fooled, too.

783
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,463
You're a lawyer,

784
00:39:36,586 --> 00:39:39,580
lies come with the territory.

785
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:42,960
Will the clients accept
a settlement now?

786
00:39:43,137 --> 00:39:45,051
I assume so,

787
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:49,680
which is too bad because I think
we could have gotten them more,

788
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,311
but Frobisher's in
the driver's seat now.

789
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,563
It just doesn't make any sense.

790
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:57,643
Fiske had pictures.

791
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,900
He was right there waiting
with Richard's alibi.

792
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:04,610
Ray Fiske is a brilliant lawyer who
made us look very foolish today.

793
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,861
It happens.

794
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:16,251
Ellen, I understand how
it must hurt right now--

795
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,830
what happened with Katie--

796
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:26,550
but... there's a very important
lesson to be learned from all this.

797
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:29,173
Which is?

798
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:35,391
Trust no one.

799
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:02,080
Hey.

800
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:06,630
Listen, I don't want
to be presumptuous.

801
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:09,091
I'm not available.

802
00:41:09,268 --> 00:41:11,933
I'm engaged.

803
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:16,262
We can play this
any way you like.

804
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:47,290
I don't even think
she remembers you.

805
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,610

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,529
Did you get any word from patty?

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,214
I've told her that she's
got to come back here.

4
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,690
She doesn't want to come back.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,795
You think patty tried to kill you

6
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:11,097
to protect herself?

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,204
I am trying to settle this case.

8
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:15,239
Try harder.

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,757
She's divorcing me.

10
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,701
Maybe I'll tell him about
you and Malina.

11
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,700
Give me five minutes, ray.

12
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,300
I think george moore engineered
this whole hit- and-run.

13
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,810
I think he leaked arlington
to get you to settle.

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,660
George moore made a big show
of going after frobisher.

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,100
But you didn't believe he was?

16
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,110
I could get killed for what I told you.

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,290
If there's a connection between you
and arthur frobisher, we will find it.

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,350
I spoke with george moore.

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,980
How could you be so stupid?

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,724
Don't bother coming back.

21
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,070
Thanks for the advice...

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,540
but I guess I won't be
needing this anymore.

23
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,930
What happened?

24
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,535
I told her I was sick of her bullshit.

25
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,050
You what?

26
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:56,910
You're a first-year associate.

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,330
When patty was my age, do you think she
would have tolerated a boss like her?

28
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,460
No.

29
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,993
Then why should I?

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,345
Was this about the case?

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,090
Sort of.

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,540
I uncovered some evidence on my own...

33
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,645
But patty was more interested in putting
me in my place than what I found.

34
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,021
I see.

35
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,847
She says it's all about
the case, but it's not.

36
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,000
It's about her and her mind games.

37
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,130
Yes.

38
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,320
I want the clients
to win their case, but...

39
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,260
I'm not going to be
patty's punching bag.

40
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,930
Oh, you'll bounce back.

41
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,550
Which is why I'm here, Mr. Nye.

42
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,701
I need a job.

43
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,637
The law will always be here, ellen.

44
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,768
But, your wedding
is coming up, isn't it?

45
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,690
Yes.

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,944
You know, I made similar
mistakes early in my career.

47
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,912
Never took a honeymoon.

48
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,700
Don't let your life pass you by.

49
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,387
I don't know.

00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,888
Babe, this is a nightmare.

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,102
What is?

57
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,670
The seating arrangement.

58
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,830
It's...

59
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:50,656
more complicated than the bar exam.

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,266
Can I sit your cousin
jake next to heather?

61
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,791
Why are you always trying
to pimp heather out, huh?

62
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,940
I just thought, you know, they both...

63
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,030
they both love hiking...

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,289
and narcotics.

65
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,240
they have lots to talk about.

66
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,773
How'd it go with Nye?

67
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,946
He wouldn't give me a job.

68
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,670
He told me to take a vacation.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,405
I love this man.

70
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,994
All right...

71
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:17,770
I will see you later.

72
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,175
- Okay?
- Okay.

73
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,836
Hello, David.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,109
Patty.

75
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,178
May I come in?

76
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,402
Do you want to call me later?

77
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,822
Yeah.

78
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,228
I will.

79
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,672
I was wondering when you would show up.

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,555
You impressed me with this.

81
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:05,272
I wasn't trying to.

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,335
Just take the information and use it.

83
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,221
It's all very intriguing, but
how does it help our case?

84
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,974
George Moore was heading up
the SEC investigation

85
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,691
into Frobisher's company,

86
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,367
but according to a
former sec investigator...

87
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:23,700
Laura Watkins.

88
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,720
I met with her.

89
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,270
She believed that moore was making a big
show of wanting to take down frobisher,

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,644
but behind the scenes he was
torpedoing the investigation.

91
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,850
And all the rest of this:

92
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,380
the hotel records, the rental
car receipts, a flight manifest...

93
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,890
All show that george moore
was in Jacksonville, Florida

94
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,340
the weekend before
frobisher sold his stock.

95
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,887
Moore drove down to palm
beach to tip off frobisher.

96
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,374
It's a nice theory.

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,156
No proof.

98
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,561
Use it anyway.

99
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,514
Put pressure on moore.

100
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
To do what?

101
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,651
Get frobisher to settle.

102
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,190
I could never understand
why moore leaked arlington,

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,286
but now it makes perfect sense.

104
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,393
He must be afraid of what
would come out in a trial.

105
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,128
Moore wants the whole case to go away,

106
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,407
and if he knows that
you're closing in on him...

107
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:17,466
He'll give us more dirt we
can use against frobisher.

108
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,321
So...

109
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,872
we need to go back to moore.

110
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:28,435
I think so.

111
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,830
And you're the only lawyer
in my firm he'll talk to.

112
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,767
It's a nice apartment.

113
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,670
Isn't it?

114
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:55,936
Go back to moore.

115
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,274
And...

116
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,324
of course you can have your job back.

117
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,723
I don't want it.

118
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,892
But I'll talk to moore.

119
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,310
I want you to win this case.

120
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,246
Our court date...

121
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:26,830
six weeks, Folks.

122
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Tom's running point, so if he
needs you to do something, do it.

123
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,670
Exhibits, witness prep.

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,570
It is deadline time.

125
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,585
Felicia,

126
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,316
do you have the expert list?

127
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,884
You'll get it tomorrow.

128
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,186
That's it.

129
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,983
Make your mothers proud.

130
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,986
Where was ellen this morning?

131
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,687
I don't know.
Maybe she wasn't feeling well.

132
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:51,080
Tom, half the office saw
her storm out the other day.

133
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,096
- Did patty fire her?
- Just focus...

134
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:54,455
on the case.

135
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:55,609
Everyone's talking about it.

136
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,269
- What are we supposed to tell ?
- Whatever you want. Tell ellen's dead.

137
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,595
Just get me the goddamn expert list.

138
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:05,640
I hope she was fired.

139
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,190
I never liked her.

140
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,303
Ray?

141
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,940
What are you doing here?

142
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,680
I thought you could use some lunch.

143
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,414
What do we got here?

144
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,590
A nice filet, some asparagus, and
some blackberry cobbler.

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,930
Sweetie, this is stupendous.

146
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,204
I finished my meetings this morning,
and I just

147
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,480
realized how much I missed you.

148
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,133
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

149
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:36,240
This case has just taken over my life.

150
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,096
They all do, Ray,

151
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,137
but this one...

152
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,180
this one's different.

153
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,405
I worry about you.

154
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,605
You're so quiet these days.

155
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,460
What?

156
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,660
You never accused me of that before.

157
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,216
Well, it's true.

158
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:58,938
Soon as the case is over, I'll be
a regular ol'chatterbox again.

159
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,710
Well, that'll be nice.

160
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,187
We'll take a few days,

161
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,436
go see your sister in tacoma.

162
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:06,286
I'll believe that when I see it.

163
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:07,854
I promise.

164
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,104
Sit, sit, eat.

165
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,453
Oh, that smells good.

166
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,818
Seeing this night, sweetheart.

167
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,320
MAY 2002

168
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:24,768
More wine?

169
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,860
Why not?

170
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,885
We're going to be closing soon, so...

171
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,444
Looks like I'm your last customer.

172
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,995
I suppose I just lost track of the time.

173
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,747
You're always coming in here
with work. What do you do?

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,461
I'm an attorney.

175
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,752
You know, I don't believe
I've ever caught your name.

176
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:49,850
Gregory.

177
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,060
Ray.

178
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,770
A blackout?

179
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,480
You were probably still in kindergarten.

180
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,961
This was 1977,

181
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,595
the very first week I arrived.

182
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:09,233
An auspicious debut. Shit.

183
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,660
Guess when I got here.

184
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,840
When?

185
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,219
Last september.

186
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,847
You don't say. Yeah.

187
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,420
Before or after?

188
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,004
Just before.

189
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,682
It almost made my change my mind,
but then I thought...

190
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,946
if I leave now...

191
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,735
They win. Right.

192
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,005
I probably should have left, though.

193
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,160
Why's that?

194
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,690
I don't know, I...

195
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,622
I just can't...

196
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,661
get going, you know?

197
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:39,497
I live in a shithole, and I...

198
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,569
barely make enough to pay my rent.

199
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,220
Why did you decide to move
here in the first place?

200
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,342
I'll try anything once, I guess.

201
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,794
Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,050
That's my wife.

203
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,610
You're married?

204
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,380
Never seen her;
you never bring her in.

205
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:06,257
I come in here to work,

206
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,260
clear my head.

207
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,271
You like being an attorney?

208
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,854
I like the relationship...

209
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,517
between attorney and client.

210
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,853
There's an intimacy there,

211
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:22,606
a trust.

212
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,417
Someone...

213
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:27,732
puts himself in your hands.

214
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,445
And you like that.

215
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,679
I do.

216
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,229
What the hell are you doing here?

217
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,850
Oh, a couple downstairs
said the ceiling was dripping.

218
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,180
Just...

219
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,264
checking for a leak.

220
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,402
And the lamp?

221
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,896
Noticed a bulb was out.

222
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,906
Does ellen know that you're here?

223
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,474
No.

224
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,144
Patty hewes told me to
extra special care of you.

225
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,047
Next time,

226
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,030
you call me.

227
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,212
Don't ever do this again.

228
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:39,107
6 DAYS LATER

229
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:42,721
<i>You have 57 new messages.</i>

230
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,129
Patty, it's Tom.

231
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,555
<i>It's Tom.</i>

232
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,916
<i>I'm in rome now.
I'm worried about you...</i>

233
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,121
<i>It's tom, I really...</i>

234
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,161
<i>Yeah, mom, I'm up at
Henry's. Everything's fine...</i>

235
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,170
<i>I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from Hollis Nye.</i>

236
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,582
<i>Somehow, Ellen's in jail.</i>

237
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,780
<i>I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from Hollis Nye.</i>

238
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,390
<i>Somehow, Ellen's in jail.</i>

239
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,120
<i>She was arrested for killing David.</i>

240
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,267
How was sawgrass?

241
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm sorry?

242
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,702
Did you hit the green on 17
or end up in the drink?

243
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,970
Depends on when you're talking about.

244
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,890
June,2002.

245
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,777
You were in Jacksonville, Florida

246
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:18,922
the weekend before frobisher
dumped his stock.

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,520
Ah, yes.

248
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,148
I hit the green.

249
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,471
I'm sure you did.

250
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,910
Then you drove four hours to palm
beach and tipped off frobisher that

251
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,109
the SEC was about to release a
report damning his company's finances.

252
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:34,514
Frobisher give you a nice kickback?

253
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:37,280
I was trying to prosecute
arthur frobisher.

254
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,686
Not according to Laura Watkins.

255
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,879
- I don't know what you think...
- I think you want this case to be over,

256
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,857
and I think that we can help each other.

257
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,973
Give us something on frobisher.

258
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:50,518
And if I don't?

259
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,655
Then patty hewes
starts looking into you.

260
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,580
Your finances, your investments,
your bank accounts...

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,021
anything you have hidden,
she'll find it.

262
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,230
I told you, I can't give you frobisher.

263
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,010
But I can give you somebody.

264
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,190
Who?

265
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,297
Same time, tomorrow night, meet me here.

266
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,220
I'll bring you a present.

267
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,310
Jesus...

268
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,270
You scared me.

269
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,871
You're so cute when you
think you're alone.

270
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:09,790
I'm living life in reverse.

271
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,661
First breakfast then bed.

272
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,620
What's that?

273
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,330
It's our first wedding gift.

274
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,627
Don't get too excited, though. It's
from aunt marge and uncle fran.

275
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,318
A garden gnome?

276
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,733
We live in an apartment.

277
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,381
Thank god your family has some taste.

278
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,858
What did patty have to say?

279
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,044
She offered me my job back.

280
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,456
What did you say?

281
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,276
I said no.

282
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,087
Good.

283
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,140
I don't like having her in our lives.

284
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,632
Neither do I.

285
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,526
You want breakfast?

286
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,006
Sure

287
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,530
Who is it?

288
00:16:58,531 --> 00:16:59,960
Lila Dimeo.

289
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,164
Don't answer it.

290
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
But this is the third time
she's called this week.

291
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,543
Well, we need do something.

292
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,614
This girl's pissing me off.

293
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,132
We need to talk.

294
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,899
How did it go with judge Toomey?

295
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,770
When are you going
to announce Ellen's firing?

296
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,718
I'm running around the office,
avoiding people's questions...

297
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,810
And?

298
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,305
And I'm a partner now,

299
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,302
and I need you to treat me like one.

300
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,930
If you have plans for ellen,
I need to know them.

301
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,243
There are no plans.

302
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,780
Then you should tell
the associates that.

303
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,262
Ellen approached a key informant

304
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,555
without our knowledge,
and she was fired.

305
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:47,940
People should know that.

306
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:49,500
Go announce it.

307
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,648
Thank you.

308
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,399
And, Tom?

309
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,521
You're right, you're a partner,

310
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:04,052
I should start treating you like one.

311
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,020
God damn it, gregory, you had one task.

312
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,163
One task, and you screwed it up.

313
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:40,439
How was I supposed to know
the guy was gonna show up early?

314
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,359
You shouldn't have been in
the condo in the first place.

315
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,323
You were supposed to rent it, leave
the key, and take a goddamn vacation.

316
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,802
I'm sorry, ray.

317
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:50,161
But I'm telling you, the
girl didn't see anything.

318
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,752
The important thing now...

319
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,866
is for you to say nothing.

320
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,282
You just forget any of this
ever happened, understand?

321
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:00,028
Yes, I understand.

322
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:05,325
Look, I'm sorry for
raising my voice at you...

323
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,885
It's my fault.
I screwed up.

324
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,313
I'm the one who sent you down there.

325
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,071
Listen.

326
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,781
That gift I gave you,
for going down there...

327
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,570
The stock.

328
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,863
Do yourself a favor.

329
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,784
Sell it tomorrow.

330
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,846
Give me a double scotch.

331
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,814
Do you believe this?

332
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,818
I'm staying in a hotel room.

333
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,331
I can't be in that house anymore.

334
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:54,814
You better get me the best goddamn
divorce attorney in this city.

335
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,456
Of course.

336
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,724
One battle at a time.

337
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,441
Thank you, that's enough.

338
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:01,476
Art...

339
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,376
we were right.

340
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,530
About what?

341
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,843
George Moore.

342
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,098
He sold you out.

343
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:16,241
Arlington...

344
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,255
gregory malina...

345
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,924
it's all him.

346
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,188
He sold you out.

347
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,648
So you're meeting with moore again?

348
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:40,921
Yeah.

349
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:42,703
He won't give up frobisher,

350
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:45,094
but he's going to give us someone else.

351
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:47,520
You've got him desperate.

352
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,625
He's trying to make the case go
away before it closes in on him.

353
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,428
If moore tipped off
frobisher, that's a crime.

354
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:58,080
Why shouldn't we just
go after him for that?

355
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,280
Because our clients come first.

356
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,540
Criminal charges would take precedence.

357
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,607
Our case could get pushed
another three years.

358
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,670
We'll get there, ellen...

359
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,363
once step at a time.

360
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:25,850
Here.

361
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,167
What's this?

362
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,356
It should hold you over for a few weeks.

363
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,300
I'm not doing this for money.

364
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,399
I know you're not, but take it.

365
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,596
Don't be foolish, ellen.
Everyone needs to eat.

366
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:38,765
<i>Mom?</i>

367
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:39,919
Yeah.

368
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,090
Sorry to interrupt.

369
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,833
Michael, this is ellen parsons.

370
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,150
Nice to meet you, michael.

371
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,850
Yeah, cool.

372
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,686
Are you using the car tonight?

373
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,470
Me, Henry and Julius are
going to head to foxwoods.

374
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,910
To the casino?

375
00:21:58,331 --> 00:21:59,582
You can't get in.

376
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,010
Mom... fake ids?

377
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,699
You guys have a nice night.

378
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,854
She's kind of hot.

379
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,730
Where the hell have you been?
I've been waiting for over...

380
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:36,370
Are you sure you're all right?

381
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,898
I'm fine.

382
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:41,358
Here.

383
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,592
I'm sorry you went through that.

384
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,738
I hate these people.

385
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,070
Photos link ray fiske to gregory malina,

386
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,374
and the documents prove that
fiske's guilty of insider trading.

387
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:03,842
You should be able to use that.

388
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:07,822
It's blackmail, ellen.

389
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,439
Just do what needs to be done.

390
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,967
So Mr. Frobisher offered
$500 million to settle,

391
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:18,817
and patty hewes turned it down.

392
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,710
At that price, this case should be over.

393
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,410
She's overplaying her hand.

394
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,304
Gone and convinced herself that arthur's
outburst in that deposition room

395
00:24:28,305 --> 00:24:31,050
will be worth more
to a jury than it actually is.

396
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,429
My grandfather adored you, ray.

397
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,344
I'm told people thought
you were his son.

398
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,257
He was a fine man,
an even better mentor.

399
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,972
He'd be tickled pink to see what
you've made of yourself, marshall.

400
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,340
We all have the utmost
respect here for you, ray.

401
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,544
We truly do.

402
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:55,209
I won't mince words.

403
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,242
The senior partners have lost confidence

404
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,654
in your ability
to effectively try this case.

405
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,678
You've got to be kidding me.

406
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,400
And as you know,

407
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,892
Mr. Frobisher's case bears
enormous consequence

408
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:10,875
to the future well-being of this firm.

409
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,664
The partners want me to
shadow you from here on out.

410
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,849
You'll consult me on any and all
tactical decisions as we move to trial.

411
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,381
Look, arthur frobisher...

412
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:24,000
is a stubborn man.

413
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,960
Stubborn and complicated.

414
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,308
There are complexities to the case...

415
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:32,149
that are beyond the normal scope of...

416
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,155
Look, Ray...

417
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,030
Marshall, I'm sorry, no offense,

418
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,750
but I'm going to have to
talk this over with amos.

419
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,220
It's been decided.

420
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,972
I'll be looking over your shoulder
every step of the way, so...

421
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,000
you'll turn over everything you've got,

422
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,139
get me up to speed by
the end of the week.

423
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,340
What do you have there, girl?

424
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,520
Let me see.

425
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,640
Come on.

426
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,679
Come on, girl, open up.

427
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,490
Don't you just love dogs?

428
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,039
Yeah.

429
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,680
They're like people.

430
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,892
Only without the bullshit.

431
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,875
Go play, girl, go.

432
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,893
Client reps rethink the offer?

433
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,150
What's this?

434
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,876
It's our counter.

435
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:41,753
The wealthy patron...

436
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:44,789
who paid gregory
malina's way down to Florida,

437
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,399
I'm guessing it was you, ray.

438
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,475
Where'd you get these?

439
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,088
Does it matter?

440
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,582
They're just pictures, patty.

441
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,370
They don't mean... anything.

442
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,342
Read the document.

443
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:11,814
You transferred stock to gregory malina,

444
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,401
then told him to sell using
information you got from your client.

445
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,248
I don't give a shit about
your private life, ray.

446
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,151
But I can't sit on
this kind of information.

447
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:28,610
Unless you and I come
to some arrangement.

448
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,625
There is no way...

449
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,389
frobisher is going
to offer you a better settlement.

450
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,842
I don't want one.

451
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,560
This case is going to
be tried in a courtroom.

452
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,271
I am not tanking my own case at trial.

453
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,140
Think about it, ray.

454
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,201
Take your time.

455
00:27:47,202 --> 00:27:48,710
I don't have to think about it.

456
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,057
Frobisher's my client.

457
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,300
And my friend.

458
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:56,206
We wouldn't be having this conversation
if gregory malina were still alive.

459
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:59,685
You're a baptist, right, ray?

460
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,467
Repent.

461
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,640
Thank you.

462
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,086
Mr. Phillips wants to
sit down with you later.

463
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:25,261
I'll be here.

464
00:29:28,624 --> 00:29:29,939
I think...

465
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:33,830
we just got our second wedding gift.

466
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:35,870
- Really?
- Yeah.

467
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,820
<i>It's probably from aunt barbara.</i>

468
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,050
<i>She told me she ordered
something online last week.</i>

469
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,840
Okay, hang on, mom.

470
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,755
Hang on. I'll open it.

471
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,363
- You know...
- Hang on.

472
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:50,604
<i>ordering gifts on the internet
is not as easy as people say.</i>

473
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:53,371
<i>I tried to find your
name on the registry page,</i>

474
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:57,050
<i>but there were six ellen
parsons in new york alone.</i>

475
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,554
<i>Anyway, you know</i>

476
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:00,935
<i>this means you're going to have
to start sending thank you.</i>

477
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,140
Oh, my god.

478
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,160
<i>What?</i>

479
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:05,760
Who would send this?

480
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,011
<i>What is it?</i>

481
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:11,720
<i>What is it?</i>

482
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,480
<i>I miss you David. Love Lila</i>

483
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:25,750
Hey, ellen?

484
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,230
What's going on?

485
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,330
Yeah, do you still have
Lila Dimeo's phone number?

486
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,987
yeah, I think.

487
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,753
<i>Hey, there, it's lila.</i>

488
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:46,483
<i>Sorry, I'm not around, but i bet ya
know what to do and when to do it.</i>

489
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,760
This is ellen parsons.

490
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,401
Stay away from my fiancי?

491
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:52,976
or I swear to god
I will come after you,

492
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,944
you crazy bitch.

493
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:00,890
2 DAYS LATER

494
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:03,921
We're done, ellen.

495
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:33,379
Hello?

496
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,600
Li... stop, stop it.

497
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,966
Just stop. Listen to me.

498
00:31:37,454 --> 00:31:39,030
Damn it, will you just...
No!

499
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,596
Lila, you need to stop calling me!

500
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,450
<i>That was...</i>

501
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,486
that was great, Ray.

502
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,990
Thanks for dinner.

503
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,337
- Had to celebrate your new job.
- Yeah.

504
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:12,290
JULY 2002

505
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,998
It's gonna feel strange
going to work in a suit.

506
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,850
Looks good on you.

507
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,883
Thanks.

508
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,985
Gregory...

509
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,354
What is it?

510
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,837
We can't be in contact anymore.

511
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,944
Why not?

512
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,533
Looks like the government
is charging my client.

513
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:37,520
I don't know anything.

514
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,525
You know enough.

515
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,567
We can't be seen together.

516
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:45,934
Okay.

517
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:50,802
I'm gonna miss you.

518
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:53,340
I'll miss you too, Ray.

519
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:01,317
What?

520
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:04,463
What is it?

521
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,574
- No, ray...
- Gregory, please.

522
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:13,068
Please...

523
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,220
No, Ray, come on. That's...

524
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,270
that's not who I am.

525
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,470
I don't believe you.

526
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,790
Please.

527
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,399
Jesus, Ray!

528
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,758
I'm sorry.

529
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,019
I'm sorry, ray.

530
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,158
I'm sorry. I...

531
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:14,846
What is it, ray?

532
00:35:16,163 --> 00:35:18,175
George Moore is dead.

533
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
I heard.

534
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:27,181
I got a letter...

535
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,401
from gregory malina.

536
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:30,910
<i> When?</i>

537
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,191
It's over, Art.

538
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,958
What is?

539
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:41,835
It's over.

540
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:43,182
<i>Ray, what's over?</i>

541
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,920
Ray, what the hell are you talking...

542
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,421
Mallory.

543
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,023
What time is it?

544
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,129
Did you eat?

545
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,232
There's some grilled
salmon in the fridge.

546
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,565
First thing in the morning...

547
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,983
we have to leave.

548
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,196
To go where,

549
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:37,498
my sister's?

550
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,884
We have to get out of the country.

551
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,735
I don't understand.

552
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,462
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
Right now I need you...

553
00:36:50,661 --> 00:36:52,330
to pack our things.

554
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Ray, you have to tell me what...

555
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,350
Mal...

556
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,911
you have to trust me.

557
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,841
Will you do that?

558
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,468
Yes...

559
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,810
Yes, of course.

560
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:07,726
Okay.

561
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,295
I have a few things
I have to take care of.

562
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,543
You got my message?

563
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:31,712
<i>I did.</i>

564
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,420
Yeah, so...

565
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,757
I've been mulling things over.

566
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,910
I'd like to sit down with
you, see how we can work this out.

567
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,967
I'm glad to hear it, ray.

568
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
We can get together first
thing in the morning.

569
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,569
I'd prefer sooner.

570
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,710
I don't want this hanging over me,
you understand?

571
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,020
<i>Of course.</i>

572
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,834
What are you doing later tonight?

573
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,290
I can be anywhere you want me to be.

574
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:10,478
It was the first movie
I saw in four months

575
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,564
where I actually stayed awake.

576
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:14,665
- OK
- Yeah

577
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:16,879
<i>I got in hour at home, you know.</i>

578
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,240
Okay, babe. I love you, bye.

579
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,250
<i>I love you.</i>

580
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:15,813
Hey there, ray.

581
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,669
Hello, patty.

582
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,847
You want a drink?

583
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,904
Thanks, no.

584
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:27,043
Well, sit.

585
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,785
How you holding up?

586
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,839
I've been better.

587
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,804
Did I ever tell you why
I became a lawyer, ray?

588
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:01,488
No, you never told me.

589
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,274
I thought I could change the world.

590
00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:07,923
Silly, huh?

591
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,288
I just liked getting
to wear a tie every day.

592
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,844
You and I are two
sides of the same coin.

593
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:21,752
How's that?

594
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,284
We love the game.

595
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:28,352
Another case, a bigger win.
It's an addiction like any other.

596
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,405
You're blackmailing me, patty.

597
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,550
Yes.

598
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
I'm sorry.

599
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,936
Long as we're clear.

600
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,617
Frobisher is guilty, ray.

601
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,265
Help me set things right.

602
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:48,811
You're a friend.
We bring out the best in each other.

603
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,347
After this, we have a
hundred more rounds to go.

604
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,502
I don't see how that's possible.

605
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,231
I am not looking to destroy you.

606
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,969
We attorneys survive.

607
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,678
It's the clients that come and go.

608
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,250
I can't go into a courtroom...

609
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,639
and deliberately lose my case.

610
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,429
I know it will be painful, ray.

611
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,705
But six months, a year from now,
it'll all blow over,

612
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,008
and you'll come work with me.

613
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,500
Patty...

614
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,531
I'm serious.

615
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,520
You would do that?

616
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,230
Hire the finest goddamn litigator
I've ever come up against?

617
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,580
Yes, ray.

618
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,808
Absolutely.

619
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:42,457
There's a place for you here.

620
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:49,303
It's win-win, for both of us.

621
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,864
Okay.

622
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
Good, ray.

623
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:15,158
I'm glad.

624
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,670
You know...

625
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,785
I always wanted to work with you.

626
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,545
Not anymore.

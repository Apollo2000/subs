00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,088
Ms. Connor,
is that your brother?

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,801
You really think she
killed my brother?

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:15,015
Arthur Frobisher-- he wiped out
our whole retirement account.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,811
The law is on our side,
evidence is on our side,

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:24,316
but if Patty Hewes gets that girl in
front of a jury, all bets are off.

7
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:28,320
Th new witness was in Florida the
same weekend as Arthur Frobisher.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,281
I met a guy down in Florida.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,200
Gregory turns o to
be our missing link.

10
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,610
Grory Malina owned
Frobher stock?

11
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,020
Keep an eye on her.

12
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:38,054
If she's going to
give us something,

13
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:39,992
she's going to have
to get it from him.

14
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,081
I know who he is,
the guy in the limo.

15
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:43,710
Yeah, this is definitely him.

16
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:46,501
You claim that you saw
these men together?

17
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,883
a limousine that Mr.
Richardsin got into that limousine.

18
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:51,710
Why are you lying?

19
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:54,381
I only tried to help your case.

20
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,180
Katie, you perjured yourself.

21
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:57,010
The threat's gone.

22
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:58,602
She lied under oath.

23
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,391
It's been five years.

24
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:02,072
Starting today,
I want you guys to leave me alone.

25
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:03,311
Just let me live my life.

26
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,981
What is it, Tom?

27
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:08,310
Following Katie Connor around?

28
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,323
I'm a lawyer, Patty.

29
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:11,281
I miss it.

30
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,490
She treats you like
dirt for ten years,

31
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:17,780
won't share the spotlight,
then she refuses make you a partner.

32
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:18,703
Martin...

33
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,491
Tom Shayes.

34
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,291
Make me an offer.

35
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:30,213
Ellen, please.

36
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:32,712
Help me to help you.

37
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:34,512
I mean, tell me what happened.

44
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,012
I'm sick of her shit.

45
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:20,183
That's right, Tomahawk,

46
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:21,891
break the shackles.
Take the power.

47
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:24,681
Always identify your
oppressor by ne.

48
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,180
So w's shit are you sick of?

49
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:27,183
Patty's.

50
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:28,811
Say it loud!

51
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,313
I sick of Patty Hewes' shit!

52
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:16,250
And then she tells me

53
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:19,113
I got to learn how
to fall on my sword.

54
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:20,113
Bullshit.

55
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,702
You gave her every drop
of blood and sweat.

56
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:23,992
Pro and con 'em for me.

57
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:26,792
There were morepros. Trust me.

58
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,410
No, come on, seriously,
make a list.

59
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,293
This is important.

60
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:30,052
All right, all right.

61
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,503
If I take the Cutler job,
I make more money,

62
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,082
become a named partner.

63
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,803
Uh, get equity stake in the firm,
better benefits.

64
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:39,212
What are the cons?

65
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:43,510
Nothing, Tomahawk.

66
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:45,510
Look, listen, I understand.

67
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:46,863
Okay, you've been
with her ten years.

68
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:49,810
You want to respect spoken
and unspoken commitments,

69
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,892
but you got to forget that shit,
all right?

70
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,783
I can be objective here.

71
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:53,952
I'm on the outside looking in,

72
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:56,482
and this bitch is
jerking you around.

73
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,482
I know, I know.

74
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:59,193
Right? Plain and simple. Yes.

75
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,250
Plus, she's high on this
new associate, right?

76
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:02,780
You got to make
Patty feel the sting.

77
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,381
The only way they ever
let me run European

78
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,412
at Lehman was by
me stepping away.

79
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:08,172
I thought he said that

80
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,292
he was grooming you for
SVP right out of B-school?

81
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:12,502
He said all kinds of stuff.

82
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:15,792
Tom, listen, with certain bosses,
the Pattys of the world,

83
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:18,301
the only way to earn their
respect is to show them

84
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:21,013
that you don't need the that you
got somethg going on for yourself

85
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,181
that's better than being
at their beck and call.

86
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,302
I was gone one qrter,

87
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:27,303
and etrich would have swallowed
oken glass to get me back.

88
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,311
He had to fork over a
signing bonus of 13 mil.

89
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:30,812
Really?

90
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:32,391
That is what I'm talking about.

91
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:32,980
Jesus.

92
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,402
Yeah. So take the
job at Cutler,

93
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,403
and just devote yourself
to it entirely,

94
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:39,611
and give it time, all right?

95
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,402
And if Patty Hewes
doesn't come after you...

96
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,203
Yeah, well, she was not going to
make me a named partner anyway.

97
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:47,202
Exactly, but at least you're
in the driver's seat.

98
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,753
And handling the wheel's
a beautiful thing.

99
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,410
Trust me, it's win-win.

100
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,002
You're steering
your own destiny.

101
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,413
Right, definitely.

102
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:54,413
You're right.

103
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:58,000
So, when are you going to break
her heart and break the news?

104
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:00,880
Tonight.

105
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,210
Power.

106
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:06,011
Good. That's it.

107
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,300
Now, fluidity of motion.

108
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,602
That's it, right through.

109
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:11,103
Fuse your mind and body.

110
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,393
Right through your powerhouse.

111
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:13,682
Oh, shut up!

112
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,100
Good, let it out.

113
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,192
Just let it out.

114
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,481
Accentuate the
strength of your body.

115
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,823
That's it.

116
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:21,690
Correct your weakness.

117
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,782
Squeeze. Correct
your imbalance.

118
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,903
And... we're done.

119
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:27,990
You're going to see Katie?

120
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,783
For how long?

121
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:30,703
Couple days.

122
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,793
Gonna leave after my shift.

123
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:36,081
And the hospital's okay
forou to take time off work?

124
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,003
She's my sister.

125
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:39,383
They have to be.

126
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:43,591
Second shelf.

127
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,511
Flight's still got some available
seats if you're interested.

128
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,393
Of course you can't.

129
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,601
David, don't do this.

130
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,101
What am I doing?

131
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,322
Katie lied in her deposition.

132
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,111
Uh-huh.

133
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:04,613
I am working 20-hour days
trying to get Frobisher to

134
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,782
pay for what he did. Right.

135
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,493
Baby, there are 5,
000 employees that need Patty to...

136
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:10,702
Enough, okay?

137
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:12,582
I've heard all of this before.

138
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,581
I'll call you when I land.

139
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:20,382
Wait.

140
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:24,210
For the plane?

141
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,513
We have to pick one.

142
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:27,380
What is it?

143
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,182
Wedding bands.

144
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,900
Cocoa, don't eat that.
don't eat

145
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,490
Leave me alone.

146
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,294
Hey, it's Katie.

147
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,082
I'm going to be out
of town for a while.

148
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,290
Leave a message.

149
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:06,510
I just want to impress upon you

150
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:09,171
that pulling a
settlement now is a move

151
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:14,892
wherein tremendous risk may
outweigh negligible reward.

152
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,070
Yeah, well,
I didn't get to where

153
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:18,483
I am by playing it safe,
right, Ray?

154
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:19,690
And when you say,

155
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:24,900
"Where I am, " Art, I can only
assume you don't mean on trial

156
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:26,982
for corporate malfeasance.

157
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:28,191
Hey.

158
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,993
Look, all I'm saying is,

159
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:33,623
putting your life in the
hands of 12 strangers--

160
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:36,580
who most certainly will
not be your peers--

161
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:38,700
is a dangerous proposition.

162
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:42,003
It's my job to protect you
from that at all costs.

163
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:44,501
You ever play a
team sport, Ray?

164
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,211
Fencing.

165
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:51,013
I specialize in \p\e.

166
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:54,513
No, I mean a team sport,
like football.

167
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,013
You know, God I love that game.

168
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:58,392
I hate the way it's being
micromanaged right now,

169
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,393
but I love the sport.

170
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:03,980
The prevent defense--
have you ever heard of that?

171
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,322
Well, it's the strategy that
you're advocating right now.

172
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,692
You roll it out when you're
not really playing to win.

173
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,780
You're just playing
not to lose.

174
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,911
I'm afraid you lost
me there, Art.

175
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:17,283
Yeah, well,
I would rath play straight man-to-man.

176
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,502
You know, blitz the shit out
of them and take my chances.

177
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:21,083
Chances.

178
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:23,711
Look, just think of this
as a small deductible

179
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,380
on a $2 billion
insurance policy.

180
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:27,850
Well, that's easy for you to say,
isn't it?

181
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:33,093
'Cause it's not your money.
Or your reputation.

182
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:38,392
Look, Katie Connor is gone now.

183
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:41,893
We get to trial,
I can clear myself completely.

184
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:45,900
You know that girl's just one
small piece of the puzzle.

185
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:48,480
And I'm worried the sun don't

186
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,282
shine on the same
dog's tail all week.

187
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:54,281
I have no idea what that means.

188
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:56,112
It means we got lucky.

189
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,503
This is my legacy.

190
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:08,000
I want my name back,
goddamn it.

191
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,213
I want redemption.

192
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,210
Look, I understand.

193
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,712
No, you don't.

194
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:13,723
You can't, Ray.

195
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:14,880
You don't have kids.

196
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,810
I settle now,
I admit guilt on the front page of

197
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:24,180
every newspaper in the world,
and that never goes away.

198
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:27,311
They'll write that
on my tombstone.

199
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,401
Patty.

200
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:34,402
Hey, Tom.

201
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,700
Hey, there, Tommy.

202
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,203
Ray Fiske called.

203
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,200
He pulled the settlement off the table,
which is...

204
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,580
Exactly what we wanted.

205
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:42,913
I need to talk to you.

206
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,290
Sit. Eat.

207
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:44,792
Phil's away.

208
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,500
He never allows me
to order this crap.

209
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:47,553
We have to finish everything.

210
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:48,850
You have to hide
all the evidence.

211
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,291
The dates checked out.

212
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:53,591
Gregory Malina dumped his
Frobisher stock the exact day

213
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:55,010
Arthur Frobisher did.

214
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:56,683
Interesting.

215
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:03,021
How did a waiter in the West Village get
the same inside information as a
big CEO?

216
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:04,681
Look at you.

217
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,190
Two peas in a pod.

218
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:09,190
It's a beautiful thing.

219
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,693
Fiske and Frobisher
have no idea

220
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:14,191
you're onto them,
all thanks to little Ellen Parsons.

221
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,782
ah, but the one problem is,

222
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,911
if we subpoena
Gregory immediately...

223
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:21,281
Ellen will realize that
we've known all along.

224
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,702
So let's just wait until she finds
out about Gregory on her own.

225
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,210
What if she doesn't?

226
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,050
All right, we'll deal with it.

227
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:29,081
I mean,
she's just not our priority.

228
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,212
In the meantime, Tom,
I want you to keep digging...

229
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,091
No.

230
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:35,513
No?

231
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:36,511
Is there a problem?

232
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:38,881
Yeah, there is a problem.

233
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,093
Martin Cutler extended himself.

234
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:42,601
He made an offer.

235
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,311
It's a good one.

236
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,391
Congratulations.

237
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,192
Look, I'm not here
to negotiate, Patty.

238
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,111
He offered to make
me a partner.

239
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,121
Named partner.

240
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:05,291
Plus, a signing bonus.

241
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,583
I'd fight to keep you, Tom...

242
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,502
And a base of 950 grand.

243
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:12,500
I don't think it would be
in your best interest.

244
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:18,802
Cutler's offering to make
you a named partner?

245
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,680
You have that in writing?

246
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:26,520
Along with all
the other points.

247
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,402
Sounds like the
deal of a lifetime.

248
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,110
Deb must be thrilled.

249
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,202
Absolutely.

250
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,781
You know, do me a favor,

251
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:48,413
when the checks start rolling in,
don't just save up.

252
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:49,502
Spend some on yourself.

253
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:50,912
I know how hard you work.

254
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,211
You deserve to enjoy it.

255
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:53,971
Patty, I want you to know...

256
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,292
Buy Deb that house

257
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,382
by the lake that she wants.

258
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,510
Put in a real fire pit.

259
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:00,801
Don't forget to invite me over.

260
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:02,061
I appreciate all
you've done for me.

261
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,801
I mean, Martin's got a much
bigger shop over there, Tom.

262
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,600
Incredible room for movement.

263
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,181
Don't give it another
moment's thought.

264
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,983
I just wish I
could top his offe

265
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:22,400
UNCLE PET Would you
like a beer, Tommy?

266
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:26,411
No.

267
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,202
I, uh...

268
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,503
I can't stay.

269
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,211
Walking out of your
own last supper?

270
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,603
Hey.

271
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,281
You pulled the settlement.

272
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,952
I thought we were
going to work this out.

273
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:04,403
Oh, we've still got a
long road ahead of us.

274
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,882
Win or lose, you'll be taken care of.
Don't worry about it.

275
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,282
I'm not just in this for myself,
I work with those people.

276
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,083
They're friends.

277
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:11,911
And I tried to be fair with them,
didn't I?

278
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,080
I know.

279
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,381
I don't know what to say.

280
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:17,292
You know, I'm...

281
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:24,881
My wife's got diabetes,
Mr. Frobisher.

282
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,391
I've got a mortgage,
medical bills.

283
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:31,680
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:36,191
Look, you have...
you've really come through for me.

285
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,403
So even if this...
even if this gets to a trial,

286
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:45,402
if we don't settle,
your cooperation has been invaluable.

287
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,201
I want you to know that.

288
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:53,201
This is what I want to do,
I want to double our arrangement.

289
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,711
0kay?

290
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,711
Yeah.

291
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:01,712
You may need to do a
few more things for me.

292
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,011
Like what?

293
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:06,680
She pleaded with us for
time to find a witness.

294
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:09,182
We gave her a shot,
and she blew it.

295
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:10,392
The witness lied.

296
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,512
It's not her fault.

297
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:12,600
Regardless.

298
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,680
That hundred million, gone.

299
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,600
We got nothing.

300
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:18,811
Patty Hewes is useless to us.

301
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,480
So what are you saying?

302
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,821
Fire her.

303
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,480
Cut out the cancer.

304
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,403
Could we please not smoke

305
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:28,991
We're not smoking.

306
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,493
I'm smoking.

307
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:33,292
If you're smoking, I'm smoking.

308
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:35,082
Anybody else got
a problem here?

309
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:36,412
Larry, don't do this.

310
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,082
Okay, I'll join you for
one outside in ten minutes.

311
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,293
Can't even find my
goddamn lighter.

312
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,503
We picked Ms.
Hewes for a reason.

313
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,881
She's the best.

314
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,510
She said there'd
be some setbacks.

315
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,511
We knew there were going
to be some ups and downs.

316
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:50,181
Where the hell are
the ups, Karen?

317
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:51,302
You're a gambler.

318
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,603
You don't change your horse mid-race,
do you?

319
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,602
If it's pulling up lame,
I do, then I shoot him.

320
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:56,681
Oh, Jesus.

321
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,893
Two right in the head real quick,
problem solved.

322
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,481
All right, look,
we need a consensus.

323
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:03,902
And for that,
we may need to compromise.

324
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,782
You got any bright ideas, kid?

325
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:09,201
Yeah, actually. I do.

326
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,781
What if I gave you a plant?

327
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,582
Would Ms. Hewes have a problem
with that in the office?

328
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,292
I mean,
how can you say no to a plant?

329
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:17,290
How's your pad Thai?

330
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,713
Oh, it's delicious.

331
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,383
Now, does that name refer to
the noodles or the sauce?

332
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,211
Um, I think it's
the whole dish.

333
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,882
So, how's it all been going?

334
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:29,882
What?

335
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,181
"What? " she asks me.

336
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,682
The wedding planning?

337
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:35,601
Oh, great.

338
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,312
We had our first fight.

339
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,100
Did he leave angry?

340
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,602
You can't let that happen, El.

341
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,483
You and David need to
take some time together.

342
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:44,983
You're both so busy.

343
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:46,693
Mom, there is no time.

344
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,192
This is your future husband.

345
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,490
You need to make time.

346
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:52,112
Talk to Ms. Hewes.
I'm sure she'll understand.

347
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,203
Yeah, I'll talk to Patty.

348
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:56,412
So, shall we try on the dress?

349
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,003
Great.

350
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:00,212
I did the resizing.

351
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:02,880
Did I tell you
about the scandal?

352
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:03,712
What scandal?

353
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:04,711
At the church.

354
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:06,590
Try the dress and
I'll tell you.

355
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:11,681
you know about the second
service they'radding on Sundays?

356
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:12,892
Dad told me.

357
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:16,013
Well, apparently the idea is
to attract younger members.

358
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,180
So instead of having
a traditional choir,

359
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,680
they're going to play
rock and roll music.

360
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,402
The pastor asked your sister
to help put together a band.

361
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:26,790
She's finally going
to be a rock star.

362
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,112
Can you believe that?

363
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:31,991
Ellen?

364
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,781
Ellie.

365
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:40,501
What's the matter?

366
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:47,713
You don't want to
wear my dress?

367
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,183
I'm really glad you're here.

368
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:56,682
Oh, me, too, baby.

369
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:59,310
Me, too.

370
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:11,112
We've come to you as a united
front because we think it's time.

371
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,690
For what?

372
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,113
A month ago, you fired Tom.

373
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,410
Don't tell me a story.

374
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,780
Tell me what you want.

375
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:20,912
Appoint a new second chair.

376
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:24,412
Since Tom's left,
there's been a leadership vacuum.

377
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:26,881
Felicia and I have
discussed it at length.

378
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:32,212
And we'd like to know if you're
amenable to us sharing the position.

379
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:33,512
I'm not.

380
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,301
My second chair is
indispensable to me.

381
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:38,512
That person is my
eyes and ears.

382
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,313
The job is all consuming.

383
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,810
I'll appoint one when
someone's earned it.

384
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:43,602
But...

385
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:44,690
Yes?

386
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,602
I'm sorry, Ms. Hewes.

387
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:49,691
Karen, what happened?

388
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:50,163
What's wrong?

389
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:52,112
I voted against it.

390
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,493
Voted against what?

391
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:55,901
Firing you.

392
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:59,780
The group hired another
attorney to represent us.

393
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,000
Who?

394
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:08,212
>>e want you to know, this isn't
a decision we take lightly, b...

395
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,710
We lost confidence
in Pty Hewes.

396
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,211
All she's done is make
promises she can't keep.

397
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:15,591
She never even consulted
us when she fired you.

398
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,390
And you know the case
better than anyone.

399
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:20,303
We called because we trust you.

400
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:21,810
Well, thank you.

401
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:23,682
Thank you, I , uh...

402
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,103
I appreciate that.

403
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,482
But you should know,
at this point,

404
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:31,982
um, any change in
representation is a risk.

405
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,990
It could signal weakness
to the other side.

406
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:36,113
We're already weak.

407
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,702
Yeah, the settlement's gone.

408
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,111
Our key witness was a bust.

409
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:41,283
You want the job or not?

410
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,910
Yes, I do.

411
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,201
A hundred percent.

412
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,411
And, uh, to be honest, I, uh...

413
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,371
well, it couldn't come
at a better time.

414
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:51,711
You at a new firm now, or what?

415
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah, I'm currently
weighing an offer,

416
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,013
but with this opportunity,
I need to reevaluate.

417
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,302
I think it might
be best for you

418
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,800
all if I go out on my own.

419
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:03,890
I don't think your case should be
compromised by anyone else's agenda.

420
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,681
What's the name
of this new guy?

421
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:06,892
Thomas Shayes.

422
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,102
This trial's going to
be like a cakewalk.

423
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,902
This ain't his
first rodeo, Art.

424
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:13,482
He graduated Yale Law

425
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,110
and went straight to
Rehnquist's office.

426
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:18,702
Patty handpicked
and groomed him.

427
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:20,911
She wouldn't be where
she is today without him.

428
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:23,990
Why are you bringing me down like this?
We're having a nice lunch.

429
00:19:24,086 --> 00:19:27,002
Don't get me wrong,
we have an opportunity here.

430
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:30,422
But whoever is on the other
side in that courtroom,

431
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:32,711
it's the jury you've
got to worry about.

432
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,592
What opportunity?

433
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,592
Tom's going to want a quick
score to cement his reputation.

434
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:43,683
Now, I think we can get him to
bite on a settlement figure.

435
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:44,980
Why the hell would
I want to do that?

436
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:47,391
I just pulled a hundred
million off the table.

437
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:51,100
What if I could get
Tom to agree to 75?

438
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:55,901
Why would he do that?

439
00:19:56,785 --> 00:20:01,110
PattHewes couldn't wi so
there's no shame in settling.

440
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,912
Shayes gets credit for
cleaning up Patty's mess

441
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:05,782
and you get off dirt cheap.

442
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,713
Man, I've eaten too much.

443
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,002
Think about it, Art.

444
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:25,600
Thomas Shayes.

445
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:29,682
Quite certainly a welcome break
in the weather to see you.

446
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:32,603
How's the view from
the first chair?

447
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,193
I could get used to it.

448
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:36,323
Well, it suits you fine.

449
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:40,693
It's going to be a challenge to tackle
this all by your lonesome, don't
you think?

450
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,173
Word on the street says

451
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,622
Martin Cutler's made
you a generous offer.

452
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,670
Well, right now my
priority's with the clients.

453
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:50,082
I'm not sure if Cutler's
the right fit for them.

454
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:51,911
I see.

455
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:55,883
Can I have Kitty rustle
up a beverage for you?

456
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:59,380
A sparkling water or...
do you prefer something more potent?

457
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,883
Not during billable hours, Ray.

458
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,882
Oh, a regular Atticus Finch.

459
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,801
Suit yourself.

460
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:08,393
Well, as I'm sure you know,

461
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:11,391
Mr. Frobisher's withdrawn
his generous offer.

462
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:12,813
So I gather.

463
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,901
And not to tell
tales out of school,

464
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:18,691
but my client's a stubborn man--
mule stubborn.

465
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,983
Once he gets a notion,
it's got.

466
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,400
Well, I appreciate that.

467
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:25,701
I'm not an
unreasonable man, Tom.

468
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:29,202
I assume you wouldn't be here
unless you had something to offer.

469
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:34,081
Maybe now that your illustrious
predecessor's out of the picture,

470
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:38,002
reasonable minds can prevail.

471
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,502
I don't see why not.

472
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:42,012
Well, good.

473
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,392
So throw me out a number, Tom.

474
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:49,602
Let's see if I can get
that old mule to back up.

475
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,310
Well, I'm no Patty Hewes, Ray.

476
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:54,183
Well, thank Jesus for that.

477
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:57,810
But I did spend ten years with her,
and there's no number that I'llccept.

478
00:21:57,907 --> 00:21:59,111
want to go to trial.

479
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:01,482
I want to put

480
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:05,782
your multibillion dollar posr
boy for corporate corruption

481
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:07,410
in front of a jury

482
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:14,581
and watch you try to explain
to them that he's not a crook.

483
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:56,081
Hey, Tomahawk.

484
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:00,500
She couldn't be more than 23.

485
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,060
Well, that's four years
older than the last one.

486
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:04,090
Hey, brother. H-H-H-Hey.

487
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:05,711
The witch is dead.

488
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,592
Ha, ha, ding-dong.

489
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:09,800
Welcome to your new life.

490
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,681
Ah, Deb, gorgeous as ever.

491
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:12,892
Oh, you're sweet.

492
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:14,013
This is Keira.

493
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:14,891
Hey, what'd you do?

494
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:15,890
Did you change something?

495
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,981
Haircut, lose some weight, or--

496
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:18,983
oh, I know what it is.

497
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:20,480
The size of these things.

498
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,613
Whoa!

499
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:22,903
You should feel these.

500
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:25,281
He's a regular Earl Anthony over here.
That's okay.

501
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,250
Trust me.
All right, we're ready.

502
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:27,193
Thanks, baby.

503
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:29,990
Grand Siecle?

504
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:30,703
Whoa.

505
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,123
Plenty more where
that came from.

506
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:32,913
Here you go.

507
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:34,700
Thank you, thank you.

508
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,583
An indentured servant no more.

509
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:35,301
Anyone ever tell you you
look like Tom Cruise?

510
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:39,181
No.

511
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:40,812
No, they haven't.

512
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:46,622
What's the matter?

513
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,283
Nothing, just, uh, tough week.

514
00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:58,992
Well, maybe that's
what I'm here for

515
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:04,500
Tell me about it?

516
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:13,891
What are you drinking?

517
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,603
I keep thinking maybe someday

518
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,981
I'll just... I'll wake up

519
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,423
and I'll realize something's missing,
but right now, shit,

520
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,193
you know, I turn to this one

521
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,690
and I say, "Baby,
pinch my dick. "

522
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:37,572
Is it po--
is it possible for life to be perfect?

523
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:38,492
No.

524
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:39,993
What's that?

525
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,002
Nothi.

526
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:57,093
So she didn't fight for you, Tommy.
So what?

527
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,300
You know? Yeah.

528
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:01,391
Cutler's still wet in
the panties for you

529
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:06,903
and, more importantly.
regardless you are your own man

530
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,111
You can take this Cutler offer
and parlay it into five more.

531
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:14,992
Shayes, the world is
your oyster, man.

532
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:17,491
I'm gonna, um...

533
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,363
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

534
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:24,003
> You good? Okay?

535
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:26,713
Yeah, yeah, I'm just...

536
00:26:58,115 --> 00:26:59,701
Tom, Tom, Tom.

537
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:06,390
What the hell are you
doing to yourself?

538
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,581
Oh, I'm, I'm drunk.
Yeah, well...

539
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:11,760
... I can see that.

540
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah.

541
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,303
What are you--
what, what are you doing here?

542
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:20,090
You are in the opportunity
of a lifetime and

543
00:27:20,186 --> 00:27:22,302
you act like you're grieving.

544
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:24,781
Getting out from
under my shadow

545
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:26,770
was the best thing that
could ever happen to you.

546
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,311
You didn't,
you didn't even fight to keep me.

547
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:34,690
You have more talent,

548
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,991
more raw potential than any
attorney I have ever worked with.

549
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,083
Well, you,
you never to me that before.

550
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,502
Letting you leave is the only
way to get you to realize it.

551
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:50,002
You're your own man, Tom.

552
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,713
It's time you stand on your
own two feet and walk away.

553
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:56,880
You can be better than me.

554
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:11,312
Tom!

555
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:13,551
Sweetie, sweetie, are you okay?

556
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,113
Hey, hey, hey.

557
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:16,901
Sweetie, talk to me.

558
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:18,401
I feel bad.

559
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:19,280
Yeah?

560
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:21,653
My apartment's right up here.

561
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:23,883
How convenient.

562
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:30,000
Move, move, move.

563
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,721
Easy, easy, fellas.
It's okay, it's okay.

564
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:33,850
They just,
they just want some money.

565
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:36,000
Hey, h-hold on.

566
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:37,212
Shit.

567
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:42,181
You guys are going to have
to find somebody else.

568
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,113
Enough.

569
00:28:57,985 --> 00:28:58,483
Enough.

570
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,412
Why are you so stupid?

571
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:12,540
What the hell do you want?

572
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:15,710
I did everything
you told me to do.

573
00:29:16,716 --> 00:29:18,500
We didn't tell you to
call Katie Connor.

574
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,891
I burned her as a witness.
It's done.

575
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:26,512
You hear me? I'm done.

576
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:31,180
You should be so lucky.

577
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,391
If atie Connor decides to talk,

578
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:37,191
you' be the center
of this whole case.

579
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,981
Patty Hewes will be
lookinto depose you

580
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:43,200
Now, we need to know:

581
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:46,702
can we count on
your cooperation?

582
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:18,690
How was your flight?

583
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:20,483
Fine.

584
00:30:23,116 --> 00:30:24,153
Dad driving you crazy yet?

585
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:26,990
They're both
tiptoeing around me.

586
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,242
What have you told them?

587
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:30,913
The short version.

588
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,203
Mom said not to worry about
losing the restaurant,

589
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,581
Dad told me the story about not
making varsity the first time around.

590
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:41,530
I haven't heard that
one in a while.

591
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:46,880
How's my lawyer friend?

592
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,093
She wanted to come.

593
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:51,312
But she's stuck up Patty's
ass and couldn't make it.

594
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:53,181
She's my fianc\e.

595
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:55,480
You guys found a new
caterer for the wedding yet?

596
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,923
> Katie, how long are you guys
going to be mad at each other?

597
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:02,690
Is that why you're here?
To referee?

598
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,990
She feels bad about
what happened.

599
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:06,990
Does she? Of course.

600
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:12,911
How's the case going anyway?

601
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:16,520
As far as I can tell,
it's not good.

602
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:18,393
All hell's breaking loose,
but you know what?

603
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:21,293
Honestly, I don't really
care about that right now.

604
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:23,553
Good, 'cause they're not
going to win that thing.

605
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,380
Why not?

606
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:28,383
Because of Frobisher.
Because he controls everyone.

607
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:31,093
For all I know,
you're on his freaking payroll.

608
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:39,983
You have no idea what I'm talking about,
do you?

609
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:40,902
No.

610
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:42,693
Tell me.

611
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,130
The truth doesn't
even matter anymore.

612
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:50,700
Katie.

613
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:56,203
You can't accuse Mom and Dad of
tiptoeing and then shut me out

614
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:57,531
when I'm trying to talk to you.

615
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,000
You'll have to hear details about
your sister's sordid sex life.

616
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:07,553
I think I can handle that.

617
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,601
So... congratulations.

618
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,811
You know that the clients
came to me, right?

619
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:17,571
I know.
I didn't, I didn't poach them.

620
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:18,810
I know, but... Okay.

621
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,220
I still don't think Patty
would condone us doing this.

622
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:24,111
Oh, us talking?

623
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:28,612
Andrew told me that you might be
joining Martin Cutler's firm.

624
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:30,361
Yeah, well, the truth is...

625
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,250
... since the clients
have come to me,

626
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:33,840
I'm thinking about
going out on my own,

627
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:35,701
which is why I wanted
to talk to you.

628
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,171
You're getting to know
the case really well.

629
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:43,002
I'm sure you heard that Katie
didn't pan out as a witness.

630
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:45,090
Yeah, yeah, I'm,
I'm sorry about that.

631
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,572
It turns out what you said at
the stables was right, though.

632
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:52,090
Patty's kept me around even though
she lost Katie as a witness.

633
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,573
I'm sure you're there because
you're doing excellent work,

634
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:57,100
which is why I'd love
for you to join me.

635
00:32:58,606 --> 00:33:02,193
I need somebody I can trust and you'd
make a valuable addition to the team.

636
00:33:04,408 --> 00:33:08,111
I'm flattered...
but you don't need me, Tom.

637
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,601
You think maybe you're just
trying to get back at Patty?

638
00:33:12,995 --> 00:33:13,991
Take what's hers?

639
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:18,581
The Frobisher case is an
excellent opportunity.

640
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,003
Patty took a chance on me.
I owe it to her to stick around.

641
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:24,293
All right, I get it.
I understand.

642
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:25,583
You're still new.

643
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:27,883
You want Patty's approval.

644
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,302
Just don'tet it stay
that way forever.

645
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,801
Hey, there she is!

646
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,511
How was visiting day?

647
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:15,680
There are three other girls
who play the saxophone.

648
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:16,181
Really?

649
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,180
And the music teacher said she used
to play with Bruce Springsteen.

650
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,313
Bruce Springsteen?

651
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:23,180
She loved it, huh?
Yeah, they all do.

652
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:23,893
Martin.

653
00:34:23,985 --> 00:34:25,660
Place was voted Best
School Spirit in New York

654
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:27,100
Magazinethree years
running, hmm?

655
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:30,821
Well, listen,
thanks for your help in getting her in.

656
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,113
Yeah, look, I... I didn't do this
from the kindness of my heart, Tom.

657
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:35,491
I know.

658
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:38,702
So, I, uh...
I hear you picked up Patty's

659
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,990
clients in the Frobisher case.

660
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,053
I've been meaning to
talk to you, yeah.

661
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:44,003
Look, look, uh,
I'm not going to pretend

662
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:47,211
that this doesn't give you more
leverage, and I'm willing
to renegotiate,

663
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,970
but I hope to shit you're not
thinking about going out on your own.

664
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,900
The thought's crossed
my mind, Martin.

665
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:57,380
Well, you could fight that case for
another two years, and get nothing, Tom.

666
00:34:59,018 --> 00:34:59,391
Hey...

667
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:01,392
Got to go.

668
00:35:03,398 --> 00:35:04,020
Tom?

669
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:07,390
I'm putting a
clock on my offer.

670
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:08,950
You got till the
end of the day.

671
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:10,261
I want an answer
in the morning.

672
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:11,901
Hey!

673
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:17,701
Yes, I'm Alice.
You be everyone else.

674
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,112
All right, okay.

675
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:23,082
Uh, How do you like thqueen?

676
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,501
Not at all.
She's so eremely likely to win

677
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:29,291
that it's hardly worth
finishing the game.

678
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:32,003
How impertinent!

679
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:35,212
Oh, I'm going to chop
your head right off!

680
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,221
I am, I'm chopping it.
That's it.

681
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,383
I've got a hatchet.

682
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:43,013
She's outside. tty.
She wants to talk to you.

683
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:50,811
If I had to lose the clients,
I'm glad I lost them to you.

684
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,112
Patty. I mean it, Tom.

685
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:56,992
So...

686
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:00,913
you must have a
lot of options now.

687
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:02,992
It's an exciting time.

688
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:07,083
Deciding whether to go with
Cutler or strike out on your own?

689
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:09,001
Yeah, I'm weighing things.

690
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,260
Well, if you ever want
to talk strategy,

691
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:14,290
bounce around some ideas,
I'm all yours.

692
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:16,802
No strings attached.

693
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:17,802
Very generous.

694
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:22,093
The case is all about
Gregory Malina now.

695
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:25,011
He's linked to
Frobisher somehow.

696
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,811
Find out who's
giving him orders.

697
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,103
I will. I will.

698
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,693
Why did you become
a lawyer, Tom?

699
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,201
I've told you before.
There are a lot of reasons.

700
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:45,612
Look, Patty, look, whatever you're
trying to do here... I know exactly why
I did.

701
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,121
Because of your father.

702
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,421
I don't give a shit
about changing the world.

703
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,003
But I hate bullies.

704
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:58,091
Look, I'm sorry that you
had to go through that.

705
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:01,802
Made me who I am.

706
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:07,600
You're a great number two, Tom.

707
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:09,981
You always were.

708
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:15,402
You always told me the truth.
It's going to be difficult without you.

709
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:17,481
Well, Andrew's capable,
and, uh, Felicia.

710
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,980
Give her a couple months.

711
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:23,280
It's a huge difference between being
number one and being number two.

712
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:24,112
Yes.

713
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,993
There is.

714
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:26,993
You're a number two, Tom.

715
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,083
That's your talent.
That's your limit.

716
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,500
This is what you came
here to tell me? No.

717
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:37,381
I came because I care about the clients.
I only want what's best for them.

718
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:38,593
Take them to Cutler.

719
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:40,213
Oh, Jesus.

720
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,220
You'll drown out there
on your own, Tom.

721
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:44,181
I don't want the clients
drowning with you.

722
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,513
You can't do it.

723
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,302
Patty!

724
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:48,181
You're not ready.

725
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,781
You're in the optimal
negotiating position.

726
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,950
All right?
You're in the goddamn catbird seat.

727
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:10,081
You got options, champ.
You got... Cutler.

728
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:12,702
You got Hewes.
You could go out on your own.

729
00:38:13,506 --> 00:38:14,211
Thank you, baby.

730
00:38:14,216 --> 00:38:15,292
Here, this is for you.

731
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,292
Do not divvy it up
amongst the others, okay?

732
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,801
Just keep it in your pocket.

733
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,941
Look, you just got
to pull the trigger.

734
00:38:29,688 --> 00:38:31,890
You know what I have chiseled
on a slab in my office?

735
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:35,602
Audentes fortuna iuvat.

736
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,982
Fortune favors the bold.

737
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:39,902
That's right. That's right.

738
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:42,483
And why are all these clients
falling into your lap?

739
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:43,991
Because that is fortune, baby,

740
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:46,703
and right now,
she is favoring you.

741
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,212
Tom...

742
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,801
the world's made up of
all kinds of people,

743
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:05,302
and that is a good thing,

744
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:08,482
but if you're ally sitting
on the fence with this,

745
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:11,013
if you need advice,
maybe you're not the guy.

746
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:12,603
The guy for what?

747
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:14,603
I'm incredibly selfish.

748
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,601
I do things the way I want.

749
00:39:16,986 --> 00:39:17,601
Okay?

750
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:21,901
And I'm greedy, and it's a blessing,
and it's also a curse.

751
00:39:22,198 --> 00:39:23,912
There's no law that
says you have to be me.

752
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:26,273
So, what-what are you saying?

753
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,913
I'm saying what we
both know, man.

754
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:30,700
You want to work
for Patty Hewes.

755
00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:13,582
Patty Hewes damn well better
make you a named partner.

756
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:17,580
Next time I see you,
Hewes & Shayes better be on that door.

757
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:22,502
It's early.

758
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:24,500
Yes, it is.

759
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,071
So, you have your
negotiating points?

760
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,311
There's no room to
negotiate here.

761
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:04,791
Yes.

762
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,511
Yes.

763
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:25,400
Partner.

764
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,230
I just spoke to the clients.

765
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:29,900
Really?

766
00:41:30,116 --> 00:41:30,491
Mm-hmm.

767
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:32,200
What did you say?

768
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:34,700
I told them...

769
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,081
that no one will fight
for them like you.

770
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:42,211
And if they left you, it would be
the biggest mistake of their lives.

771
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:45,290
And?

772
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,881
And they're willing
to come back.

773
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:52,010
Thank you, Tom.

774
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:57,510
Yes.

775
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:01,682
No.

776
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:03,100
No name on the door.

777
00:42:04,317 --> 00:42:06,190
It's still Hewes & Associates.

778
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,002
See you at 9:00.

779
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:00,703
Hey! Hey!

780
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,202
You're back.

781
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,611
Is that your mom on the couch?

782
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:09,212
Yeah. Wedding planning
went a little long.

783
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:10,383
How did it go?

784
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:14,011
Good. She's pushing
for my cousin's band.

785
00:43:14,598 --> 00:43:15,880
We need to gang up on her.

786
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:17,511
I'll be glad to.

787
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,102
How was your trip? How's Katie?

788
00:43:27,695 --> 00:43:28,613
She's hanging in there.

789
00:43:30,618 --> 00:43:32,401
Babe, I'm so sorry.

790
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,612
I was wrong.
I should have come with you.

791
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:36,493
It's okay.

792
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:38,113
No, it isn't.

793
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,381
I've been taking
you for granted,

794
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,493
and the last thing

795
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,290
I want is for my job
to come between us.

796
00:43:47,217 --> 00:43:49,001
Well, I ould be
apologizing to you.

797
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:51,213
What for?

798
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,512
I think this case is even more
complicated than you think.

799
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:01,601
Katie told me a few things.

800
00:44:05,026 --> 00:44:08,482
Turns out, Katie lied in her
deposition because of this asshole.

801
00:44:08,697 --> 00:44:09,980
Her one-night stand in Florida?

802
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:11,982
He set Katie up to
perjure herself.

803
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:14,982
But Katie told me she never saw him
again after that night in Florida.

804
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:17,490
She lied. She started seeing
him again a few weeks ago.

805
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:20,993
His name's Gregory Malina.

806
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:22,910
I suggest we subpoena him.

807
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:25,072
Well, put it together ASAP.

808
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:27,700
Good work, Ellen.

809
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:28,912
Tom!

810
00:44:29,715 --> 00:44:30,712
Glad to have you back.

811
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:37,753
Someone tried to kill her?

812
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:39,820
That's right.

813
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,390
And, uh, where is this body?

814
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:47,472
Patty Hewes' apartment.

815
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:58,611

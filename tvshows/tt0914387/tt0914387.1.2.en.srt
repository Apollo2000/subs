1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,128
Previously on Damages...

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,297
Hewes & Associates
called me yesterday.

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,519
Once Patty meets you,
there's no turning back.

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,885
She'll see what I see,
and she'll own you.

5
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,845
Ms. Hewes.
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,555
Kiddo, you're the first person

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,516
stupid enough to turn me down.

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,732
Is there any way i
could still interview?

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,644
You're hired.

10
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:21,810
We are engaging in a
battle with a man who will

11
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,060
stop at nothing to
preserve his fortune.

12
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:27,984
Arthur Frobisher told his
employees to invest in the company

13
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,782
and then sold his own stock.

14
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,082
She's on a mission here,
and she won't stop until

15
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:34,152
you're strung up in
the public square.

16
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,281
Make the call.
I want some leverage.

17
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:39,451
My boss wanted me to check
up on his investments.

18
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,342
You're my sister.

19
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,842
How do you know
arthur Frobisher?

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:44,222
I catered a function for
him and some businessmen.

21
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:46,392
Katie, this whole case
turns on one weekend,

22
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:47,370
and you were there.

23
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:49,682
You want me to be a
witness against Frobisher?

24
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,603
The new assosiate has been
talking to Katie Connor.

25
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,760
Whatever it takes... fix this.

26
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:57,302
I think we have a strong case.

27
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:59,971
I'd like to take it to a
jury and let them decide

28
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:03,140
what Mr.
Arthur Frobisher owes you.

29
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,893
I say we end this here and now.

30
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,522
I vote to accept
the settlement.

31
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:11,532
How could you have possibly made
such a catasrophic screwup.

32
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:12,613
You're fired.

33
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:13,730
Get out of the car!

34
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,861
My future sister-in-law
is a potential

35
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,870
witness in the biggest
case in Patty's career.

36
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:21,211
You think Patty hired
you just to get to Katie?

37
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:23,542
Did she only hire me to
deliver her witness?

38
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,553
There's no way she knew
about your friend.

39
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:27,832
Saffron?

40
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:33,801
Call Patty.

41
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:35,260
You know what this means?

42
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:37,050
If Katie can help
the case, then...

43
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:38,480
we're doing the right thing.

44
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,980
If Frobisher thought
this would shut her up,

45
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,473
it's done the opposite.

46
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:42,603
What's this?

47
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,473
A souvenir for Patty.

48
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:48,350
Maybe one of these days,
I'll stop being impressed.

49
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,860
Ellen figures out
why you hired her

50
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:53,322
and you still get her
to deliver the witness.

51
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,611
I like Ellen.

52
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:00,300
Jesus.

53
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

54
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,253
Ortiz! You better get in here.

55
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,270
Hey, boss, it's Williams.

56
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:05,641
We got a body.

57
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,602
And a murder weapon.

58
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,953
All right,
nobody sing because we all know...

59
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,780
Ellen hates singing!

60
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,493
Whatever, whatever.

61
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:27,542
But I love fudgie the whale.

62
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:29,911
Whoo!

63
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,632
This next one is from your
favorite aunt and uncle.

64
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,543
Didn't anybody read
the invitation?

65
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,603
Yeah, yeah,
you and your "no gift" bullshit.

66
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:37,470
Does anybody want anything?

67
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:37,810
Ellen...

68
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:38,512
I'm okay.

69
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:39,551
...David, we know

70
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,923
you two are real busy.

71
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,092
A young lawyer with
a fantastic new job

72
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,683
and a dreamy doctor fianc?

73
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:47,063
Oh, the dreamiest.

74
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:50,933
You both work so much,
you don't even have time to eat,

75
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,981
plus you're saving your
money to move into manhattan.

76
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:55,611
You got us an apartment?

77
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,573
So until Katie's
restaurant opens...

78
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,111
Aw, dinner for two
at the olive garden.

79
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:04,241
When you're there,
you're family.

80
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,281
Thank you, uncle Fran.
Thank you.

81
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,243
Thank you.

82
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:10,002
Thanks, aunt Barb, so much.

83
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,263
Frobisher's lawyer
calls three times a day.

84
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,980
He's just trying
to intimidate you.

85
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:24,652
They just want you to sign
the confidentiality agreement.

86
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,300
I hate these people.

87
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,483
When you see Patty tomorrow,

88
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,470
she'll tell you
how to handle them.

89
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,351
Every time I close my eyes,

90
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:35,270
I see Saffron dead
on my kitchen floor.

91
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,651
Patty thinks Frobisher's
an asshole, too.

92
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:40,652
The guy bankrupted 5,
000 of his employees.

93
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,873
I don't even care if I never step
foot in my restaurant again.

94
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,530
Katie, we'll get through this.

95
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:46,282
Okay?

96
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,911
The worst is over.

97
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,962
El, your mom wants you
to open up her present.

98
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,252
Okay.

99
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:52,700
You guys okay?

100
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,292
Wait.

101
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,041
While I got you both here.

102
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:59,552
Happy birthday, Ellen.

103
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,101
It's a little kitsch to add to

104
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:03,340
your collection for
your new apartment.

105
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,342
Thanks, honey, you're sweet.

106
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,180
Hmm?

107
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:10,181
Oh, aha.

108
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:11,562
Hey...

109
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:17,732
- You like? They're beautiful.
- Beautiful!

113
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:26,763
Patty?

114
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:29,092
Oh, my gosh, unreal.

115
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,553
Okay, Patty,
I get it, I get it.

116
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,610
I don't need to know what
I don't need to know.

117
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,932
Tom, Tom, Tom.

118
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,693
Your advance for
the next two weeks.

119
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,902
So consider me on call.

120
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:44,071
I'll just wait around
to hear from you.

121
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,452
Good luck with the
Frobisher clients.

122
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,533
Has Ellen tried to
contact you again?

123
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,990
No.

124
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:54,743
I like that she trusts you.

125
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,002
Run into her again.

126
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,460
Talk to her.

127
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,873
Where?

128
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:02,841
The office.

129
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,713
I thought you want everyone
to think I was fired.

130
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:08,053
All the more reason to stop by.

131
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,393
Clear out your stuff,
work the relationship.

132
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:24,233
Page six.

133
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:26,283
This morning's paper.

134
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,820
I went shopping
yesterday, Arthur.

135
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:32,163
It's in there today.

136
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,580
No, thanks.

137
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,042
They're saying I
spent $20,000 on shoes

138
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:43,853
while your former employees
are lined up for food stamps.

139
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:48,421
Yeah, well, you know, you can't
pay attention to this crap, Holly.

140
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:51,262
I spent $2,000 and
it was for the kids.

141
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:53,881
All right, all right,
I'll have Ray Fmake a call,

142
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,021
see if we can get them
to print a retraction.

143
00:07:56,057 --> 00:08:00,270
Then some shithead photographer
chased us and hit my car,

144
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:04,190
but I can't go to the police because
that would just bring more press.

145
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,150
Bethie's friends
won't come over.

146
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:08,294
Their parents won't let them.

147
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,122
Reporters are following
her to school.

148
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,153
I know, I know, she told me.

149
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,780
This is not a
childhood, Arthur.

150
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,093
You promised me
that all of this

151
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:20,911
would be over after
the government trial.

152
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,090
Look, there are things that
are beyond my control.

153
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,121
You know that.

154
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:26,751
I am trying to
settle this case.

155
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:29,340
Try harder.

156
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:36,511
I offered them $100 million
for something I didn't do.

157
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,221
Offer them more.

158
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,780
Give them whatever they want.

159
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,102
Okay.

160
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,481
How much?

161
00:08:42,685 --> 00:08:43,283
One billion?

162
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,813
Two billion?

163
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:45,571
I'll tell you what.

164
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,252
Why don't I give you the
pen and you write the check?

165
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,442
You promised me, Arthur.

166
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:53,651
Don't look at me like that.

167
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:56,163
Uh...

168
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,870
thank you, Ricky,
it looks fantastic.

169
00:08:58,915 --> 00:08:59,512
I'll tell you what.

170
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:01,831
Why don't you eat it,
though, all right?

171
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:05,051
No, actually, come here,
come here, come here.

172
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,173
You know what?

173
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,290
Just pick the peppers out of

174
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:10,101
this thing and give
it to the dogs.

175
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,093
They'll love it.

176
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,353
We have the Met gala on sunday

177
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,230
and I don't want to be late,

178
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,822
so be sure you're
home from golf.

179
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,221
I'm doing everything I
can to make this go away.

180
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:23,363
Tuesday night is the
helping hands auction.

181
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,782
I'm fine to go to that alone.

182
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,243
Holly, come on, don't do that.

183
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:28,241
And we have to make a decision
about the aspen house.

184
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,032
Are we going to
keep building or

185
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:29,740
are we going to sell it?

186
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:30,481
Holly, please.

187
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:31,202
What, Arthur?

188
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,443
I heard you.

189
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,070
You're doing all that you can.

190
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,991
What do you want me to say?

191
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,120
Nothing.

192
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:46,840
These are for ms.

193
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,333
Hewes' meeting with
Kathryn Connor.

194
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:51,461
Well, good morning.

195
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:52,251
Morning.

196
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,483
Your ears must have been
ringing last night.

197
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:55,220
Why is that?

198
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,801
I was talking about you.

199
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,393
Really.

200
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,180
Aren't you going to
ask what I was saying?

201
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:03,531
Well, I figured you'd tell me

202
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:04,813
if you wanted me to know.

203
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:05,731
All good things,

204
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,022
Ellen, all good things.

205
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:07,773
Thank you.

206
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:09,701
There's a client
meeting in ten minutes.

207
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,441
Come sit in.

208
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:14,901
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

209
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:15,821
Another week?

210
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,783
What the hell are
we talking about?

211
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,740
Frobisher offered us
$100 million to settle

212
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,411
and we voted to accept it.

213
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:25,543
Nothing has been signed yet,
Mr. Poplar.

214
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,123
But it was a done deal.

215
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:30,962
Larry, Ms. Hewes thinks this
witness can prove Frobisher's guilt.

216
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:32,640
I don't want to
lose that money.

217
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:34,521
Frobisher is praying
that you settle.

218
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,052
The money's going nowhere.

219
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,132
So what would you like from us?

220
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:39,721
Time, Karen.

221
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:44,180
This new witness was in Florida the
same weekend as Arthur Frobisher.

222
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:47,573
If you give us another week,
wecan find out what this witness knows,

223
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,811
and I believe it will
give us leverage.

224
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:54,020
Ms. Hewes, you really think
this could be the smoking gun?

225
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:58,742
I'd like the
opportunity to find out.

226
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,173
Sorry to be a stickler
for the rules, Art,

227
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:21,093
but uncle Sam has designated
this environment smoke-free.

228
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:32,103
I... called you because
our young friend

229
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:37,031
Katie Connor hasn't been to
the restaurant in a week

230
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,743
nor has she signed
the new paperwork,

231
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,660
which could spell disaster.

232
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:52,880
Okay, Art,
what do you want to talk about?

233
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,340
What happens if she leaves me?

234
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,301
I beg your pardon?

235
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,513
Holly.

236
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,221
Bottom line it for me,
will you?

237
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,022
Well, this is new
york state, Art.

238
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:10,520
You'll write her a check
for half of everything.

239
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,643
And the kids?

240
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,941
Well... she's the
sympathetic mother

241
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:17,912
who runs three
children's charities...

242
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,820
Which I founded...

243
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:21,790
...And you're a
controversial father

244
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,671
involved in a very
public litigation

245
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,030
to defend your reputation.

246
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:30,040
You need her, Art,
now more than ever.

247
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:33,421
She's the one person who's
remained loyal to you.

248
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:38,962
If she leaves now,
we'll take a beating in the press.

249
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:41,260
All right, all right,
let me ask...

250
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:47,801
and if we lose this,
this Katie Connor, what happens?

251
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,310
If she doesn't sign
the paperwork,

252
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:56,363
it becomes a hell of a lot harder
to destroy her credibility.

253
00:12:57,407 --> 00:13:00,152
Look, Art...

254
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,453
the law is on our side.

255
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:09,031
The evidence is on our side.

256
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,582
On paper, this case is tighter

257
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:15,620
than a bull's ass
on fight night.

258
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:21,090
But if Patty hewes gets that
girl in front of a jury...

259
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:25,093
all bets are off.

260
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:29,303
Hey.

261
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:32,271
I'm here to see Patty Hewes.

262
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:35,232
Welcome to Hewes & Associates.

263
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:36,561
Hey!

264
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:37,733
How you feeling?

265
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:38,440
Nervous.

266
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:39,122
Come on back.

267
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:40,452
Patty's running a
few minutes late.

268
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,682
I'll show you my office.

269
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,071
This place is incredible.

270
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,820
I know.

271
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:47,613
So, how many people are
going to be in there?

272
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:48,933
Just you, me and Patty.

273
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,970
We'll go through your
florida timeline

274
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:53,882
and make sure you're hitting all
the details about that weekend.

275
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,791
I saw him two or three
times that weekend.

276
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:57,583
That's fine.

277
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,672
Patty just wants
to see if anything

278
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,561
you can remember will contradict
Frobisher's testimony.

279
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:04,060
So, I can read it off my notes?

280
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:04,723
Of course.

281
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,131
It's not a test.

282
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:07,052
I'm in here.

283
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:07,922
Another thing?

284
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:08,390
Yeah?

285
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:09,432
You look great.

286
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:12,482
Thanks. I totally forgot to call
you to ask you what to wear.

287
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:14,151
Ellen, Felicia wants
to see the two of us.

288
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,313
Okay.

289
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,391
Now.

290
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:17,950
Hang in there.

291
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:18,690
I'll be back.

292
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:20,190
Sure.

293
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,111
We've bought
ourselves more time.

294
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:25,781
The clients have agreed
to give us another week.

295
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,382
Patty wants us to start
prepping their testimonies,

296
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:29,753
getting them to
tell their stories.

297
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,241
Why go poking at wounds now?

298
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,581
It'll make them want
to settle even sooner.

299
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,290
Really?

300
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,793
Anyone else want to weigh in?

301
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,842
Ellen?

302
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,000
Um... I'm not sure.

303
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,761
Not sure what?

304
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:47,833
I grew up with

305
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:49,052
people like this.

306
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,863
A $100 million settlement sounds
like a gold mine to them,

307
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:53,763
and it's softening
their resolve.

308
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:54,903
If you want them
to turn it down,

309
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,113
I think you're right to remind
them what they've been through,

310
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,732
stir up their emotion.

311
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,530
I could see the value in that.

312
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:06,442
Good.

313
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:07,251
Divide them up.

314
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:09,151
Each of you take a department.

315
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:10,370
Ellen, shadow Andrew.

316
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,322
See how we do it.

317
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,451
Now?

318
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:17,371
The car's waiting downstairs
to take you to Newark.

319
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:18,960
Is Patty leaving?

320
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,471
No, no, no,
she's still meeting with you.

321
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:21,681
But I thought you were
going to be there.

322
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:22,600
Patty'll take care of you.

323
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:23,432
Debra, could you look after ms.

324
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:24,380
Connor, please?

325
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,380
You'll be great.

326
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:27,461
I'll call you when we're done.

327
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,722
You're a smart girl, Ellen,

328
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,721
but you better watch your ass.

329
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:35,683
What?

330
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,640
Tom Shayes is gone.

331
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,112
When it came time to recruit,

332
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:40,493
we each backed our own horse.

333
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,440
Your boy tom bet on you.

334
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,411
He was the only one who stood
to gain when you got the job.

335
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,322
What are you trying to tell me?

336
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:48,940
I'm trying to tell you,

337
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,582
you should think twice before
you shoot your mouth off.

338
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,240
Andrew, Patty called on me.

339
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,370
Yeah?

340
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,201
You think Craig and
Felicia care about that?

341
00:15:57,377 --> 00:16:00,661
You don't show up your
fellow associates, Ellen.

342
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,391
The only way you're going to make
it here is with our support.

343
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:06,421
I was just answering
a question.

344
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:07,672
I have no agenda.

345
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,172
Well, maybe you
better get one quick.

346
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,403
You're in Patty's
good graces now

347
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,032
because your
friend's a witness,

348
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:16,970
but that can change on a dime.

349
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,110
Olio Santo from California?

350
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,991
Unfiltered from Tuscany?

351
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,530
I mean,
it's damn near impossible to decide.

352
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,050
The raging olive oil debate

353
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:37,243
between Giada de Laurentiis
and the barefoot Contessa.

354
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:38,700
Exactly.

355
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:40,871
Last night's food network.

356
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:43,922
So, what is better--
virgin or extra virgin,

357
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,971
or is it all just
marketing bullshit?

358
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,342
It's about acidity.

359
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,382
An amerin or italian?

360
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:52,013
I love a little family-owned
vineyard in greece.

361
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:52,470
Ah.

362
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,230
I'll write down their
website for you.

363
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:54,763
Oh, good.

364
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:55,953
I mean, it's expensive,

365
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,560
but nothing like
Manhattan, though.

366
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:00,782
Ellen was checking out this
apartment on 91st and Riverside,

367
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,990
and I asked her to get
some stuff for a salad.

368
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,850
Eight bucks for an
organic tomato.

369
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,860
Can you believe that?

370
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:08,401
Great, Katie.

371
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,900
Thanks.

372
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:11,741
Thanks for coming by.

373
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,493
It was nice to meet you.

374
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:14,741
We're finished?

375
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:16,280
Why?

376
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,753
Something else you
want to tell me?

377
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:18,132
No, no.

378
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,173
I... I just thought that

379
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,132
we were going to look
over the timeline.

380
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,550
Oh, I really don't
see the point.

381
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:26,500
Although, I did
have one question.

382
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,710
How old were you?

383
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,171
I'm sorry?

384
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,340
I had just turned six.

385
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:34,722
When what?

386
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:38,050
When I realized I
was a good liar.

387
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,350
How old were you?

388
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,310
I'm sorry.

389
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:43,563
I don't know what
you're talking about.

390
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:45,392
Your timeline?

391
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,350
I don't buy it.

392
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,243
So, right now
you're going to do

393
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,152
one of two things-- turn around

394
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:52,873
and get the hell
out of my office,

395
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:53,950
or tell me the truth.

396
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:54,651
The truth?

397
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:55,541
Mr. Hewes, I'm not lying...

398
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:56,571
Katie, don't, don't.

399
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:57,741
It's me and you now.

400
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,160
Ellen isn't here.

401
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:00,333
I don't understand.

402
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,801
I want the straight story,
and until you tell me,

403
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:03,842
you're worthless to me.

404
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:05,373
I don't give a shit about you.

405
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:06,892
Wait. Ms. Hewes, please. I...

406
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:08,500
What aren't you telling me?

407
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:09,041
Nothing!

408
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,751
I put everything
I know down here.

409
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:12,932
Ms. Hewes, they want me to sign

410
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,312
a new
confidentiality agreement.

411
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:14,812
Yeah, I read it.

412
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:15,602
It's very thorough.

413
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:16,651
Well, what should I do?

414
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,393
Do whatever you want to.

415
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,472
Sign it.

416
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:22,401
These people are going
to come after me again!

417
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,403
I thought that you were
going to protect me.

418
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,852
Until you stop lying,

419
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:26,993
you're not my witness,

420
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:30,111
and you're not my problem.

421
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:34,322
Wait. Ms. Hewes, please, I...

422
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,351
Hewes & Associates.

423
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,242
Can I help you?

424
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,713
We were told the girl

425
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,662
lives here with her fianc?

426
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:45,840
Have you questioned her?

427
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:47,083
Not yet.

428
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,050
The front door was chained,
but not locked.

429
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,672
At approximately 9:15 A.M.,

430
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,052
We force entry,
and we find this.

431
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,343
The stereo's still there, TV.

432
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,342
So is the computer.

433
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,841
And most telling of all...

434
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:00,391
you come to loot a place,

435
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:03,680
you don't leave something
like that behind.

436
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,351
So, it wasn't a robbery.

437
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,140
Watch yourself, Lieu.

438
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:16,112
He was a good-looking kid.

439
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,163
So, what do you think?

440
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,661
She caught him screwing around?

441
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,132
I don't know what
you're talking about.

442
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,292
You got to slow down.

443
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,751
She's crazy!

444
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:30,582
Who?

445
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,000
Patty!

446
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,041
She-she kicked me
out of her office!

447
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:36,713
She told me to sign the
confidentiality agreement.

448
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:37,921
I don't understand.

449
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:38,601
I don't, either!

450
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,053
Ellen?

451
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,971
She's accusing me
of lying, Ellen.

452
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:41,802
About what?

453
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:42,801
Everything!

454
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:43,860
You read what I wrote.

455
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,221
I'm not lying.

456
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:46,742
Of course you're not lying.

457
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:48,490
Well, then tell
that to your boss.

458
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,731
You're the one who
made me go in there.

459
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,483
Look, what the hell am
I supposed to do now?

460
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:55,113
Katie, just calm down.

461
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,330
Go back to the apartment.

462
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:57,870
I'll be there as soon as I can.

463
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,361
Okay?

464
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:23,432
Mr. Frobisher,
the girl just met with Patty Hewes.

465
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,613
Ray Fiske wouldn't want
me talking with you,

466
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:30,231
but I can't believe our
hands are just tied here.

467
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,942
You gave her a restaurant,
Mr. Frobisher.

468
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:37,360
What can we do to
keep her quiet?

469
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,742
Offer more money.

470
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:40,913
No, you can't do that.

471
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:45,491
The judge finds out, I could get
nailed for witness tampering.

472
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,740
Well, there's
always a solution.

473
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,502
What kind of solution?

474
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,672
A permanent one.

475
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:56,541
Frobisher what?

476
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:58,382
Oh, god, no.

477
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,023
What, you think
that I would...?

478
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:02,051
It wouldn't get back to you.

479
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:07,852
Oh, we're-we're talking
about a human life here.

480
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,520
Sh-she's an innocent girl.

481
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:11,350
She didn't do anything.

482
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,730
She was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

483
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:17,233
Sometimes that's enough.

484
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,711
You're serious, aren't you?

485
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:23,921
You're actually suggesting...

486
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,493
Look, Mr. Frobisher,

487
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,032
you're insulated,

488
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,453
you have resources.

489
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,003
This kind of thing is
simpler than you think.

490
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:41,003
So, how's that work?

491
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,101
You... know a guy?

492
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:42,972
You make a call?

493
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,432
It's simpler than you think.

494
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,061
Yeah, of course it is.

495
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,100
You become powerful enough,

496
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:58,441
eventually, every option gets
presented to you, doesn't it?

497
00:21:58,566 --> 00:21:59,521
Yes, sir.

498
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:01,303
One day,
you're living your life.

499
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:02,253
The next thing you know,

500
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,492
some man shows up
on your doorstep

501
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,323
and offers you the
ultimate decision.

502
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,622
That's all it is,
Mr. Frobisher--

503
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:12,832
just another decision.

504
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:18,712
No. No.

505
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,001
You go down that road,
and then,

506
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,303
you know, who are you?

507
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,551
I mean, there's no going back.

508
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:32,013
No, no, no.

509
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,823
Think about your family,
Mr. Frobisher.

510
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:34,701
Don't tell me what...

511
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:38,442
This case is going to end with
someone's life being destroyed.

512
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:41,651
Why should it be yours?

513
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:01,712
You get what you needed?

514
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:03,090
Yup.

515
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:06,262
From the palm beach county P.D.

516
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:09,181
Issued the morning of
the Frobisher event.

517
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,842
Katie's hiding details.

518
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,972
She left it off her timeline.

519
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:15,642
A traffic ticket seems
pretty insignificant.

520
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:19,481
Her supervisor's kitchen report
says she was right on time.

521
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:21,742
So, she managed to show
up for work ten minutes

522
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,943
before she was pulled over
for running a red light?

523
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:26,610
Find out more.

524
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:28,112
Fiske is making his move,

525
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:29,750
trying to ruin her credibility.

526
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,502
There's something in
this girl's past.

527
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,823
All right, I'm on it.

528
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,330
Get me everything you can.

529
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,910
Boyfriends, jobs, vices.

530
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:37,541
Yeah.

531
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:38,843
I want to know why she was late

532
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,422
for the biggest
day of her career.

533
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:44,291
You think Ellen
knows the truth?

534
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,461
Uh, it's too soon to tell.

535
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,633
Anything else?

536
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:51,392
Yeah, here's the Ellen
information we talked about.

537
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:53,853
Are you sure you really
want to do this?

538
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:56,723
Make it happen.

539
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:06,781
Oh...

540
00:24:24,136 --> 00:24:25,880
Go long, go long.

541
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:53,281
Katie.

542
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:54,750
I'm just grabbing my shit.

543
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:55,952
Where have you been?

544
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:56,453
Thinking.

545
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,662
Why didn't you call me back?

546
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:00,750
Katie, slow down.

547
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:02,870
Tell me exactly what happened.

548
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:04,171
Ask her.

549
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:04,642
I tried.

550
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:05,870
She didn't call me back.

551
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:08,503
Ellen, I already told you,
she's crazy.

552
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:09,720
She thinks I'm lying.

553
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:10,881
About what?

554
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:11,881
I don't know.

555
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:13,652
I don't--
I don't know what she'd doing.

556
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:14,862
It doesn't make any sense.

557
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:17,101
I don't think she
wants you to know.

558
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:18,263
Why not?

559
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,242
Because ten minutes before
my meeting with her,

560
00:25:20,277 --> 00:25:21,733
she sent you away.

561
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:23,731
You think that's a coincidence?

562
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,661
Come with me tomorrow.

563
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:25,323
We'll go in there together.

564
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,501
We'll both talk to her.

565
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:27,902
I'm not going back there.

566
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:28,902
Where are you going?

567
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,703
Look, I have been living
with you for a week.

568
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:33,401
This has gone on
for long enough.

569
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:34,152
Katie.

570
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,163
Ellen, I've got to get home.

571
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,201
I have got a life to live.

572
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:41,832
And I don't know anything
about Frobisher anyway.

573
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,313
Take it easy.

574
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:13,111
Get off.

575
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:14,242
What?

576
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,030
Get off.

577
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:46,523
Hello?

578
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,233
Do it.

579
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,310
Yes, sir.

580
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:58,110
Oh, shit.

581
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:02,660
That was intense.

582
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:16,471
Patty appreciates
your involvement.

583
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,012
What's the girl's name?

584
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:20,180
Ellen Parsons.

585
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,851
Do you have what we need?

586
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,010
Yeah.

587
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:28,190
Here's everything.

588
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:29,940
The fiancי?

589
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,901
He's in there, too.

590
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:39,493
My associates will
look into it.

591
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,412
Thank you.

592
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:44,332
Nothing too excessive.

593
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,540
Patty's come to me before.

594
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,003
Trust me.

595
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,670
I know how she wants it done.

596
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,972
Don't hover in the door.

597
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,143
I hate that.

598
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:09,561
What happened with Katie?

599
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:21,070
I spoke to her, Ms. Hewes.

600
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,993
I don't believe she's lying.

601
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:23,740
Really?

602
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,532
Why is that?

603
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:28,752
Because she has no reason to.

604
00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:31,750
Don't be stupid, Ellen.

605
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,923
Everyone's hiding something.

606
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,503
Really?

607
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:37,711
So what are you hiding?

608
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:41,512
I beg your pardon?

609
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:45,591
You didn't need me to meet
with the clients yesterday.

610
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:47,651
You just wanted me out of the office,
didn't you?

611
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:48,520
Yes.

612
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:52,480
So you lied to me?

613
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:54,881
What's your point?

614
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:58,691
Why would you do that?

615
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,460
You already answered
your own question.

616
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:02,281
I wanted to meet
with Katie alone.

617
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,283
So you...?

618
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,910
I manipulated you, yes.

619
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:08,933
Well, I don't like
being manipulated.

620
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:11,082
Duly noted.

621
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,213
Anything else?

622
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:15,293
Yeah.

623
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:17,711
You promised to protect Katie.

624
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,063
Now she's totally confused.

625
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:20,983
She has no idea what to do.

626
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:21,983
I have a temper, too, Ellen,

627
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:24,511
but I've learned
when to use it.

628
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:43,782
You were right.

629
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:45,491
She's using me.

630
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:47,143
Of course she's
using you, Ellen.

631
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:50,081
Patty Hewes needs
people who are driven.

632
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:51,760
She's tapping your energy and

633
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:53,790
youth to further
her own agenda.

634
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:55,870
Which is?

635
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:59,563
You know what? It's highly unusual
for us to be speaking like this.

636
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,790
You're no longer a summer
associate of mine.

637
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,091
I know.

638
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:06,162
I offered you a job
and you turned me down.

639
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:08,892
I didn't know who else talk to,
Mr. Nye.

640
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:10,181
My advice to you, Ellen,

641
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:12,390
is stop trying to
figure Patty out.

642
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,690
You'll never change her,
but she'll change you.

643
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:17,602
How?

644
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,550
By giving you access
to how she thinks.

645
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,161
You signed up for this,

646
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:23,611
now keep your head
down and do the work.

647
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:26,481
That's why you're there,
isn't it?

648
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,413
- Yes.
- Then don't be shortsighted.

649
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:30,410
Start using her.

650
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,203
Learn everything you can,

651
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,710
then get the hell out
before it's too late.

652
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:37,083
How exactly will I
know when that is?

653
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:37,881
Ah!

654
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:40,211
That's for another walk.

655
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,193
Patty?

656
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:41,663
Phil, there's another
credit card charge.

657
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:44,163
You're going to have to be a little
more specific than that, sweetheart.

658
00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:47,280
$1, 200 for a place
called frolic.

659
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:48,370
That's a gentlemen's club.

660
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,403
I told you about it.

661
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:51,411
The singapore clients
come to the city,

662
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:52,413
they love that crap.

663
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,612
I can't drag them out
of the champagne room.

664
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,000
Fine, but this was
last week and...

665
00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:58,411
And I was in London.

666
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,290
I'll have a talk with Michael.

667
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:03,500
What's an outcall?

668
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,530
Patty, I'll have
a talk with him.

669
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:07,382
What is it?

670
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:11,093
He must've hired strippers.

671
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:13,602
Hired them out?

672
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:17,042
You mean our son had
them in our apartment?

673
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:18,893
Maybe, maybe.

674
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,812
Michael's too smart
for this bullshit

675
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:22,260
and it's getting out of hand.

676
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,413
Jesus Christ!

677
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,701
Patty, I'll handle this.

678
00:32:33,706 --> 00:32:34,672
You know, your plate is full.

679
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,650
Just-- I'll take care of it,
all right?

680
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:40,082
Patty?

681
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:42,292
Yes.

682
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:44,291
I'll take care of this.

683
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:46,301
Okay.

684
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:56,513
Tom.

685
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:00,481
Told you.

686
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:01,693
Ten years.

687
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:02,690
One box.

688
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:03,480
One trip.

689
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:04,980
You didn't deserve this.

690
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:06,483
Thanks.

691
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:07,691
I'll be okay.

692
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:10,443
I know I'm only here
because of your support.

693
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,611
Don't believe that
for a second.

694
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:14,910
How're you doing?

695
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:16,281
You okay?

696
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:17,990
I am.

697
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:19,790
Really.

698
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:20,702
Good.

699
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm glad.

700
00:33:22,415 --> 00:33:25,210
You know that friend you told
me about in the stables?

701
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,292
Did you ever, uh...

702
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,503
you ever tell Patty about her?

703
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:33,883
I guess we probably
shouldn't discuss business.

704
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:36,893
Sorry.

705
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:37,480
You're right.

706
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,712
You're absolutely right.

707
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,100
I got a cab waiting for
me downstairs anyway.

708
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,133
You take care of
yourself, Ellen.

709
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:45,900
Thanks, Tom.

710
00:33:46,197 --> 00:33:46,983
All right.

711
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:47,980
I'll see you around.

712
00:34:57,688 --> 00:34:59,011
Hey, are you following me?

713
00:34:59,015 --> 00:34:59,981
I don't know what
you're talking about?

714
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,103
You killed my dog.

715
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:02,810
You killed my dog!

716
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:04,100
I don't you or your dog.

717
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:04,862
Get away from me!

718
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:05,680
Lady, back off!

719
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,310
Stay away from me!

720
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:08,980
I am going to call the police.

721
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:10,312
Screw you!

722
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:11,110
Are you okay?

723
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:13,983
Screw you, asshole!

724
00:35:25,798 --> 00:35:27,500
You can't going there.

725
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:28,080
Excuse me.

726
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,003
Jesus, Mary, and Joe Cocker,

727
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:31,383
what a fine surprise!

728
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:34,090
Gentlemen, we do rise to
our feet when a lady enters.

729
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,713
It's signed goddamn it!

730
00:35:37,098 --> 00:35:38,680
That's wonderful news.

731
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:42,182
It's "all systems go"
for your restaurant.

732
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:42,983
You got what you want.

733
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,311
Just leave me alone!

734
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:51,940
And to think,
for a reasonable fee,

735
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:55,281
she's available to
cater any occasion.

736
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,280
Come on, goddamn it.

737
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:06,052
Yeah, where,
where the hell have you been?

738
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:08,003
Look, I just heard
from ray fiske.

739
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:09,412
She signed the papers.

740
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,500
Call it off?

741
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:11,790
We could do that right?

742
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:13,000
We can call it off?

743
00:36:14,596 --> 00:36:16,062
No, yeah,
but can we call it off?

744
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:17,301
Answer my... god!

745
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:19,090
Shit.

746
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:20,093
God...

747
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,010
hello... goddamn it!

748
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:54,881
Oh, my god.

749
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,800
Hi there, I'm arthur.

750
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,013
I just came by to say hello.

751
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:04,891
Uh... oh, wow!

752
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:08,392
I hear it's full steam
ahead for the opening.

753
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:09,311
Oh, hey!

754
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:10,982
My god, I love this.

755
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:12,481
Mm-hmm.

756
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:16,980
Mr. Fiske told me that you, uh,

757
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,690
you signed our agreement.

758
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:22,111
You have no idea
how grateful I am.

759
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:25,782
Lawyers, right?

760
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:31,210
They make such a big deal over a little,
a little red tape.

761
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,793
You and I, uh...

762
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:38,093
if I recall...

763
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:39,593
god those are beautiful.

764
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:41,980
We never really spoke

765
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,012
when we were down in Florida,
did we?

766
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:45,183
No, no, that's right.

767
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:45,802
Yeah.

768
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:47,770
I don't mean to be rude,

769
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:49,991
but I didn't even really
remember who you were.

770
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:50,942
Look, I'm not sure what...

771
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,180
But your meals!

772
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,690
Oh, my god.

773
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,103
Who could forget that?

774
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:58,192
Well, it was kobe
beef, fingerling...

775
00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,271
Mr. Frobisher, I...

776
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,693
...And just a sprinkle of...

777
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:03,703
Saffron.

778
00:38:03,706 --> 00:38:04,493
Right.

779
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,083
god that was great.

780
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:09,463
Are you gonna have
that on the menu?

781
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,262
Look, Mr. Frobisher,

782
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:11,172
I'm, I'm gonna go now,

783
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,672
but please you
stay as long as...

784
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:14,803
No, no, I'm sorry.
No, please, forgive me.

785
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,353
I just wanted to
come by and say,

786
00:38:16,386 --> 00:38:17,210
say thank you.

787
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:23,220
Isn't life great... sometimes?

788
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:24,800
I mean you, you and I,

789
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,011
we meet as total strangers

790
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:29,393
at some boring luncheon
down in Florida,

791
00:38:29,395 --> 00:38:31,092
and the next thing
you know we're,

792
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:33,980
we're partners,
making something absolutely beautiful.

793
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,783
Our fates are
intertwined, Katie.

794
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,293
Isn't that remarkable?

795
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:49,461
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

796
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:50,700
Thank you, Katie.

797
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,883
Frobisher showed up
at my restaurant.

798
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,082
Why did you call me?

799
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:02,882
Because you're right.

800
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:04,800
I lied.

801
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,802
The day I cooked for Frobisher.

802
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:13,683
So this was, um,
about june 2002?

803
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:16,101
Yeah. Saturday
morning the 19th,

804
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:18,603
I was rushing to work
and got pulled over.

805
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,141
Why didn't you put
it in your timeline?

806
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:25,993
It's all so humiliating.

807
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:29,492
I met a guy down in Florida,

808
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:32,780
had a stupid one night stand.

809
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:35,793
It was a low point for me.

810
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:38,503
I was kind of a mess back then.

811
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:40,711
A guy.

812
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:41,881
Whose name is...?

813
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:42,793
Greg.

814
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:45,513
I never got a last name.

815
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,380
We met friday night.

816
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:52,303
Partied pretty hard and
went back to his place.

817
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:55,393
He seemed like a
genuinely nice guy.

818
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:57,310
Sure.

819
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,692
Then saturday
morning I overslept.

820
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:02,691
Which is why I was late,
rushing to work,

821
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:04,403
and why I got pulled over.

822
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,111
Did you see him again?

823
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:07,992
No.

824
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:08,903
But...

825
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,503
Kate...

826
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:22,501
I got pregnant.

827
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,880
And it was the one night and,

828
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:27,780
uh, I never even got
his phone number.

829
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,683
And I just did
what I had to do.

830
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,302
I'm sorry.

831
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:38,363
Ms. Hewes, I swear this is
the only thing I left out.

832
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,813
Everything else is in there.

833
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:43,811
When did Frobisher's
people approach you?

834
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:48,190
Fiske called me, uh,
about a week later,

835
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,202
and said that arthur
Frobisher liked my cooking

836
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:53,202
and wanted to help me
open a restaurant.

837
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:54,792
And what happened to Greg?

838
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:56,292
No idea.

839
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,762
Ever since Frobisher's
been in the news,

840
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:01,053
there's never been
a connection.

841
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:03,081
I've never heard his name,

842
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,591
neverseen him,

843
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:05,881
nothing.

844
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,662
You do understand why
I lied to you, right?

845
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:13,013
Yeah.

846
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:18,180
Then will you still be able
to use me as a witness?

847
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:22,482
Well, you and I will go over
your tine step by step.

848
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:25,980
Hopefully, they'll be something that
will impeach Frobisher's story.

849
00:41:27,616 --> 00:41:28,481
But Kate...

850
00:41:29,618 --> 00:41:31,782
you're stepping into
the spotlight now.

851
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:34,850
Details of your life
are going to come out.

852
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:39,203
This kind of scrutiny is
never easy for anyone.

853
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:41,411
I understand.

854
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,083
It's just...

855
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:48,303
my brother and Ellen

856
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,713
don't know anything
about this stuff.

857
00:41:51,306 --> 00:41:53,102
You don't have to tell them,
do you?

858
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:56,600
Well, at some point the truth
is gonna have to come out.

859
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:01,601
I'll let you decide when.

860
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,903
I spoke to Katie last night.

861
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:12,662
You're working,
if it's a bad time I can...

862
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,992
No, no, uh...

863
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:15,612
what did she say?

864
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:17,280
Well...

865
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:22,291
...you were right.

866
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:24,210
She's not hiding anything.

867
00:42:24,718 --> 00:42:25,580
I trust her.

868
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,501
But I want you to know

869
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,591
that I had reasons
for doing what I did.

870
00:42:32,387 --> 00:42:34,352
When I read her
confidentiality agreement,

871
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,681
there was a section
I found curious.

872
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,010
Yeah?

873
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,310
Ray Fiske had snuck in a
medical release waiver.

874
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,890
Katie signed away access
to her medical records?

875
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,982
Well, Fiske must
think that, um...

876
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:48,872
there's something
in Katie's past

877
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:52,111
that would destroy her
credibility as a witness.

878
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:53,691
Well, there isn't.

879
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,202
Well, let's hope not.

880
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:00,742
Meanwhile, she's given them
everything they want, so...

881
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,993
She's protected.

882
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:03,500
Yes.

883
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,880
And you've had a very
good first week.

884
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:17,300
What are these for?

885
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,892
A quiet,
little place on the upper west side.

886
00:43:20,606 --> 00:43:22,510
Nice light, safe street.

887
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,391
I think you'll like it.

888
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:27,103
How did you...

889
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,071
Katie mentioned you were
looking for an apartment.

890
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,693
Oh, I can't possibly accept, Ms.
Hewes, I...

891
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:33,481
Please, please.

892
00:43:33,616 --> 00:43:34,900
You got a great bargain.

893
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,200
I did?

894
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:37,951
I know the head of
the co-op board.

895
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:41,913
Ellen, next time
you need something,

896
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:43,792
come to me.

897
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:57,221
Hey.

898
00:43:57,598 --> 00:43:58,382
Hey.

899
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,091
Been a long time.

900
00:44:01,897 --> 00:44:02,800
Yeah.

901
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:07,100
I was, uh,
a little surprised you called.

902
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:08,573
I didn't think I'd
ever see you again.

903
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:11,482
Greg, we need to talk.

904
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:13,111
About what?

905
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:15,191
Florida.

906
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,501
Owen, medium rare, rare?

907
00:44:26,506 --> 00:44:27,411
Medium rare.

908
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,213
Here we go.

909
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:30,791
Oh, yeah.

910
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,293
Here you are.

911
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,381
That one right there.

912
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:36,001
Yeah.

913
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:37,302
Thanks, dad.

914
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:38,801
Here you go, mom.

915
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:39,380
Thank you.

916
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:40,982
Looks pretty good.

917
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:43,012
All right, uh,
who knows a joke?

918
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,300
Anyone got a joke?

919
00:44:44,305 --> 00:44:45,101
I do.

920
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:46,181
Knock, knock.

921
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:47,491
Who's there?

922
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,182
Interrupting lawyer.

923
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:49,952
Interrupting lawyer...

924
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:50,811
I object!

925
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:53,610
Not too bad.

926
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:57,253
Not too bad,
where'd you hear that one?

927
00:44:57,286 --> 00:44:58,781
- Who wants chips?
- I do.

928
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:00,112
We have salad.

929
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:06,031
I think Katie's lying about
the guy she met in Florida.

930
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,301
I think she's lying
about a lot of things.

931
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:16,302
Katie Connor to see Ms. Hewes.

932
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:18,301
I thought you
might use a friend.

933
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:21,010
For me?

934
00:45:21,016 --> 00:45:21,590
Mm-hmm.

935
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:24,512
Oh, my god, he's adorable.

936
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:25,600
He's a rescue.

937
00:45:26,817 --> 00:45:29,022
Oh, thank you so much.

938
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,181
It's my pleasure.

939
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:32,102
Katie...

940
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:34,900
no more secrets between us.

941
00:45:35,487 --> 00:45:36,981
No more secrets.

942
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:51,710
Oh, my god.

943
00:45:55,507 --> 00:45:56,211
Wow.

944
00:45:56,218 --> 00:45:57,292
Oh, my god.

945
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:00,800
This place is ridiculous!

946
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:05,591
Oh God!

947
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:06,802
It's too big.

948
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,013
We'll get lost!

949
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:08,812
This is amazing.

950
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:09,862
What's in here?

951
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:11,810
This is off the hook.
Look at this.

952
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:12,390
God!

953
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:13,893
This is huge!

954
00:46:25,787 --> 00:46:28,493
Oh my God!
Patty even sent the welcoming committee.

955
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,412
This place is perfect.

956
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:53,581
I want to help you, Ellen,
'cause I know you didn't do it.

957
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:09,991

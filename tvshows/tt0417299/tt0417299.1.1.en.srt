<i>A time of peace.</i>

7

00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:00,145
It's not getting away from me this time.

25
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,554
Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.

26
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,222
Sokka, look!

27
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:18,801
Shhh..... Katara, you're gonna scare it away.

28
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:21,445
Mmmm, I can already smell it cookin'!

29
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,276
But Sokka! I caught one!

30
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:27,434
Hey!

31
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,500
Ugh!

32
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,976
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?

33
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:38,224
Ah~ It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's...

34
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:42,489
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...

35
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:46,316
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, 
I'd keep my weirdness to myself.

36
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,272
You're calling me weird?

37
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:49,879
I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself...

38
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:53,957
...everytime I see my reflection in the water.

39
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:10,592
Watch out!

40
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,516
Go left! Go left!

41
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,049
You call that left?

42
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:28,177
You don't like my steering.

43
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,900
Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.

44
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:32,945
So it's my fault?

45
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,706
I knew I should have left you home.

46
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:37,098
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.

47
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:43,585
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...

48
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,531
...ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!

49
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:51,996
Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp...

50
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,355
...while you've been off playing soldier!

51
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:55,551
Uh... Katara?

52
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:57,534
I even wash all the clothes!

53
00:03:57,559 --> 00:04:03,189
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?
 Let me tell you, not pleasant!!

54
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,294
Katara! Settle down!

55
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,174
No, that's it. I'm done helping you.

56
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,672
From now on, you're on your own!

57
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:27,280
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.

58
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:29,132
You mean I did that?

59
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,974
Yup. Congratulations.

60
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:06,827
He's alive! We have to help.

61
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:11,835
Katara! Get back here!
 We don't know what that thing is!

62
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,571
Finally. 
Uncle, do you realize what this means?

63
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,882
I won't get to finish my game?

64
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:53,890
It means my search.
 It's about to come to an end.

65
00:05:56,377 --> 00:06:01,077
That light came from an incredibly powerful source.
 It has to be him!

66
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:07,343
Or it's just the celestial lights.
 We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.

67
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:10,935
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.

68
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:18,172
Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?

69
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:22,257
I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar.

70
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,100
Helmsman, head a course for the light!

71
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,550
Stop!

72
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,804
Stop it!

73
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:10,915
I need to ask you something.

74
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,821
What?

75
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,290
Please... come closer.

76
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:15,854
What is it?

77
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,383
Will you go penguin sledding with me?

78
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:22,312
Uh... sure. I guess.

79
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:25,604
What's going on here?

80
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:26,805
You tell us!

81
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:30,047
How'd you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen?

82
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,905
I'm not sure.

83
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:44,460
Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.

84
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:55,697
Haha! You're okay!

85
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:03,012
What is that thing?

86
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:04,714
This is Appa, my flying bison.

87
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:08,797
Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.

88
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,252
Don't worry. It'll wash out.

89
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:26,124
So, do you guys live around here?

90
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,426
Don't answer that!

91
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:31,118
Did you see that crazy bolt of light?
 He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.

92
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,856
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.

93
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:38,061
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.

94
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:42,390
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.

95
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,401
I'm A...

96
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:59,007
I'm Aang.

97
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:03,574
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.

98
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,361
Really? It felt higher that that.

99
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,667
Ah, you're an airbender!

100
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:08,654
Sure am.

101
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,524
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...

102
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:13,721
I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.

103
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:16,913
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.

104
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,106
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.

105
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,358
We'd love a ride! Thanks!

106
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:31,892
Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.

107
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:36,287
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?

108
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:40,692
You know... before you freeze to death?

109
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,110
Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight!

110
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:49,540
Appa, yip yip!

111
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:00,494
Come on, Appa. Yip yip.

112
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:03,568
Wow. That was truly amazing.

113
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:09,552
Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.

114
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,789
Why are you smiling at me like that?

115
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,788
Oh... I was smiling?

116
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:34,058
I'm going to bed now.

117
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:40,423
Yep. A man needs his rest.

118
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:45,109
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.

119
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:51,109
Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.

120
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:57,827
Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.

121
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:02,617
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does.

122
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,076
This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.

123
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:18,313
Hey.

124
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:20,814
Hey. Whatcha thinkin' about?

125
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,484
I guess I was wondering...

126
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:28,058
...your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.

127
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:35,188
Uhh... no. I didn't know him... I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry.

128
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:38,019
Okay. Just curious. Goodnight.

129
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,642
Sleep tight.

130
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:27,894
Aang! Aang, wake up!

131
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,794
It's okay. We're in the village now.
Come on,

132
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:33,969
get ready. Everyone's
waiting to meet you.

133
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:54,816
Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.

134
00:12:56,549 --> 00:13:00,392
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that?

135
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,910
Did Appa sneeze on me?

136
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:05,389
Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.

137
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,410
We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.

138
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:11,436
Extinct'?

139
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,541
Aang, this is my grandmother.

140
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,336
Call me Gran Gran.

141
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,832
What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this.

142
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:23,081
It's not for stabbing. It's for airbending.

143
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,701
Magic trick! Do it again!

144
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:32,422
Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.

145
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:36,256
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.

146
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:38,446
Check again!

147
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,369
Whoa... it's flying...

148
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,621
...it's amazing!

149
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:03,521
Oh, my watchtower!

150
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,881
That was amazing.

151
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,591
Great. You're an airbender,...

152
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:18,835
...Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.

153
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:20,411
You're a waterbender!

154
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,705
Well... sort of. Not yet.

155
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:27,555
All right. No more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.

156
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:32,437
I told you! He's the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me.

157
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,008
Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.

158
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,943
But he's special. I can tell.

159
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,030
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.

160
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:46,878
Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.

161
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:53,993
Again.

162
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:06,167
No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles.

163
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:09,677
The breath becomes energy in the body.

164
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:15,064
The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.

165
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,560
Get it right this time.

166
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:19,631
Enough. I've been drilling this sequence all day.

167
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,236
Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready.

168
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:27,164
No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics.

169
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:28,622
Drill it again!

170
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:36,372
The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.

171
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:39,095
He must be over a hundred years old by now.

172
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:41,477
He's had a century to master the four elements.

173
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:44,829
I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.

174
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,141
You will teach me the advanced set!

175
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:54,787
Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck.

176
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:02,618
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.

177
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:05,977
In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.

178
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:10,938
For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?

179
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:13,995
I gotta pee!

180
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:16,584
Listen! Until your fathers return from the war,...

181
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:19,027
...they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.

182
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,574
And that means no potty breaks.

183
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:23,182
But I really gotta go.

184
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:28,209
Ugh... okay... who else has to go?

185
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:35,749
Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.

186
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:38,423
Wow! Everything freezes in there!

187
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,026
Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.

188
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:52,796
Stop! Stop it right now!

189
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:56,896
What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.

190
00:16:56,921 --> 00:17:00,031
What war? What are you talking about?

191
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:02,139
You're kidding, right?

192
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,531
Penguin!

193
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,642
He's kidding, right?

194
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:19,464
Aang?

195
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,887
Hey, come on little guy.

196
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:25,697
Wanna go sledding?

197
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:29,506
Heh heh, I have a way with animals.

198
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:39,100
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.

199
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:44,835
You got a deal! Just one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.

200
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,629
Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?

201
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:52,301
No. You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.

202
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:56,307
This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water.

203
00:17:56,954 --> 00:18:00,926
What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right?

204
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:02,969
Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.

205
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,812
Maybe. But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.

206
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:12,697
It's not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.

207
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:15,204
But you forget, I have a flying bison.

208
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:18,698
Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.

209
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,881
Katara, we're gonna find you a master!

210
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:24,460
That's... I mean, I don't know.

211
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:26,142
I've never left home before.

212
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,001
Well, you think about it.

213
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:32,033
But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?

214
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:35,273
Okay, listen closely my young pupil.

215
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:41,763
Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe.

216
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,109
I haven't done this since I was a kid!

217
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:12,239
You still are a kid!

218
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:37,202
Whoa... what is that?

219
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:43,119
A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.

220
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:49,868
Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.

221
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:54,068
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.

222
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:43,187
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.

223
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:46,617
It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.

224
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,517
Okay, back up.

225
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:53,295
I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.

226
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,607
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?

227
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,066
I don't know... a few days, maybe?

228
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,578
I think it was more like a hundred years!

229
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:07,107
What? That's impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?

230
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:11,992
Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because...

231
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:17,918
...somehow, you were in there that whole time. It's the only explanation.

232
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:23,107
A hundred years! I can't believe it.

233
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.

234
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:31,414
I did get to meet you.

235
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:35,107
Come on. Let's get out of here.

236
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:43,161
Aang? Let's head back. This place is creepy.

237
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:49,730
What's that you said about booby traps?

238
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:05,365
Hold on tight!

239
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:21,096
The last airbender. Quite agile for his old age.

240
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:28,032
Wake my uncle. Tell him, I found the Avatar.

241
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:34,065
As well as,  his hiding place.

242
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:43,230
To Be Continued.

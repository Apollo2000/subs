<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7

<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11

12
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:38,957
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

Aang?

16
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:42,880
Do you wanna talk about it?

17
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:44,680
Naah.. just a nightmare

18
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:47,741
I was in the Avatar State

19
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,160
But I was outside my body
watching myself

20
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,150
It was scary

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,362
I was scary

22
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:02,311
Kitara, I want you to have this

23
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:05,924
This amulet contains water from
the Spirit Oasis

24
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,278
The water has unique properties

25
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:09,548
Don't lose it

26
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:11,851
Thank you Master Pakku

27
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:15,612
Aang, these scrolls will help you
master waterbending

28
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:16,435
But remember,

29
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,517
there are no substitutes
for a real master.

30
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,503
Sokka

31
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:28,378
Take care son.

32
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:33,712
Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom
based to the east of here

33
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:37,318
General Fong will provide you with
an escort to Omashu

34
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,762
There you'll be safe

35
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:42,412
to begin your earthbending
training with King Bumi

36
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,595
Appa, yip yip!

37
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,495
Say hi to Gran Gran for me!

38
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,230
Aahh..

39
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,555
This is what I've been missing

40
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:04,744
Who knew floating on a piece of a driftwood
for 3 weeks with no food or water..

41
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:10,831
and sea vultures waiting to pluck out
your liver could make one so tense?

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,937
I see

43
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,974
It's the anniversary isn't it?

44
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,728
3 years ago today I was banished

45
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:21,354
I lost it all

46
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:22,839
I want it back!

47
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:26,828
I want the Avatar,
I want my honor, my throne!

48
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:30,316
I want my father not to think I'm worthless.

49
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:31,715
I'm sure he doesn't.

50
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:35,134
Why would he banish you
if he didn't care?

51
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:40,329
Urgh.. that came out wrong didn't it?

52
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:07,745
My brother and my uncle has
disgraced the Fire Lord

53
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,895
and brought shame on all of us.

54
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:13,482
You may have mixed feeling about
attacking members of the royal family

55
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,495
I understand. But I assure you..

56
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:20,223
if u hesitate, I will not hesitate
to bring you down.

57
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,824
Dismissed.

58
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:28,436
Princess, I'm afraid the tide will not allow us
to bring the ship into port before nightfall.

59
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:31,785
I'm sorry Captain, but I do not know
much about the tides

60
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:34,038
Can you explain something to me?

61
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,444
Of course, your Highness

62
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,767
Do the tides command this ship?

63
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,709
I'm afraid I don't understand.

64
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:44,567
You said the tides would not allow us
to bring this ship in.

65
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:46,568
Do the tides command this ship?

66
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,222
No, Princess.

67
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,809
And if I would have you thrown overboard

68
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:54,487
Would the tides think twice about
smashing you against the rocky shore?

69
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:57,319
No, Princess

70
00:04:57,325 --> 00:05:00,845
Well then, maybe you should worry less
about the tides if they're already made up

71
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:02,409
their mind about killing you,

72
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:05,801
and worry more about me,
who's still mulling it over.

73
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:07,099
I'll pull us in.

74
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,430
There it is!

75
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:23,271
Welcome, Avatar Aang.

76
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,719
I am General Fong.

77
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:29,349
And welcome to all of u, great heroes.

78
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:34,455
Appa, Momo, brave Sokka,
the mighty Katara.

79
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:36,995
"Mighty Katara"?
I liked that.

80
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,758
Not bad, not bad.

81
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:50,995
Avatar Aang, we were all amazed at the
stories of how you single handedly

82
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:54,395
wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet
at the North Pole.

83
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:58,354
I can't imagine what it feels like
to wield such devastating power.

84
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,972
It's an awesome responsibility.

85
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,834
I tried not to think
about it too much.

86
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:07,819
Avatar, you're ready
to face the Fire Lord now.

87
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:10,050
What? No I'm not!

88
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,757
Aang still needs to master all
four elements.

89
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,120
Why? With the kind of power he possesses,

90
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,395
power enough to destroy hundreds
of battleships in a matter of minutes,

91
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,237
he could defeat the Fire Lord now!

92
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:25,493
But, sir, the thing is, Aang can only
do those things when he's in Avatar State.

93
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:27,695
See, it's a special state where..

94
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:28,750
I'm well aware

95
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,575
Your eyes and tattoos glow,
and you're able to summon

96
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:33,115
unbelievable power

97
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,804
Without you we'd be slaughtered
before we even reach their shores.

98
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:38,745
But with you leading the way,

99
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:40,387
as the ultimate weapon,

100
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:43,595
we could cut us warf right through
to the heart of the Fire Nation.

101
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:48,495
Right, but, I don't know how to
get in or out of the Avatar State.

102
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,327
Much less what to do
once I'm there.

103
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,589
So it's decided then

104
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:55,106
I'll help you figure out how to
get into the Avatar State

105
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:57,082
and then you'll face your destiny.

106
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,241
No, nothing's decided.

107
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,395
We already have a plan.
Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.

108
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:08,457
Well, while you take your time
learning the elements,

109
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,426
the war goes on.

110
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,995
May I show you something?

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,406
That's the infirmary,

112
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:15,740
and those soldiers
are the lucky ones...

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,388
they came back.

114
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:22,470
Everyday the Fire Nation takes lives,
people are dying Aang!

115
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,773
You could end it, now.

116
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:25,865
Think about it.

117
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:47,128
Almost perfect.

118
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:49,961
One hair out of place.

119
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,494
Almost isn't good enough.

120
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:06,681
General Fong?

121
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:07,648
Come in, Aang.

122
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:09,648
Have you thought about our discussion?

123
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:12,620
l'm in.

124
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,588
l'll fight the Fire Lord.

125
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,770
l told the General l'd help him

126
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:29,319
by going into the Avatar State.

127
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:30,588
Aang, no.

128
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:31,892
This is not the right way.

129
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,507
Why not? Remember when
he took out the Fire Navy?

130
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:35,521
He was incredible.

131
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:37,364
There's a right
way to do this--

132
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:39,345
practice, study and discipline.

133
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:42,146
Or just glow it up and
stop that Fire Lord.

134
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,545
lf you two meatheads want to throw away

135
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,546
everything we've worked for,

136
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,548
Fine. Go ahead and glow it up.

137
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:50,450
Katara, l'm just being realistic.

138
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,796
l don't have time to
do this the right way.

139
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:01,789
This rare chi-enhancing
tea is a natural stimulant.

140
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:03,696
ln an ordinary warrior,

141
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:06,516
it improves strength and energy tenfold.

142
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:10,449
ln you, it may induce the Avatar State.

143
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:12,566
Tenfold energy, huh?

144
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:17,478
l can't tell! Somebody tell me

145
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:19,047
if l'm in the Avatar State

146
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:20,481
'cause l don't have
a good view of myself.

147
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:21,709
Am l talking too loud?

148
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:24,585
l guess he could talk
the Fire Lord to death.

149
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:25,954
Ooh!

150
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,620
Maybe l can shock yo
u into the Avatar State.

151
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,492
l love surprises.

152
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:36,129
(shrieking)

153
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:37,221
(yells)

154
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:40,667
Still not glowing.

155
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,602
Uh... Uh... Ahh!

156
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:50,238
You are wearing a
ceremonial piece of clothing

157
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:52,612
from each of the bending nations.

158
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,736
Now, l will join the
four elements into one!

159
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:57,980
Water...

160
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,088
Earth...

161
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,496
Fire...

162
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:01,771
Air...

163
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:05,587
Four elements together as one!

164
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:08,705
This is just mud.

165
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:11,018
So, do you feel anything?

166
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,092
(sneezes)

167
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:19,419
We have to find a way.

168
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:26,045
Look at these magnificent shells.

169
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:29,512
l'll enjoy these keepsakes
for years to come.

170
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,233
We don't need any more useless things.

171
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,161
You forget, we have to carry
everything ourselves now.

172
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,360
Hello, brother.

173
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:38,009
Uncle.

174
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,926
What are you doing here?

175
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:41,990
ln my country, we
exchange a pleasant ''hello''

176
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,778
before asking questions.

177
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:44,827
Have you become

178
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,301
uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?

179
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,869
Don't call me that!

180
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:51,305
To what do we owe this honor?

181
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:53,874
Hmm. Must be a family trait.

182
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:56,276
Both of you so quick
to get to the point.

183
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:57,477
l've come

184
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:58,979
with a message from home.

185
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:00,314
Father's changed his mind.

186
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:03,283
Family is suddenly
very important to him.

187
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:05,619
He's heard rumors of
plans to overthrow him,

188
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:08,088
treacherous plots.

189
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:12,226
Family are the only ones
you can really trust.

190
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,895
Father regrets your banishment.

191
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:16,863
He wants you home.

192
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:19,896
Did you hear me?

193
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:21,368
You should be happy.

194
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,370
Excited. Grateful.

195
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,305
l just gave you great news.

196
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:28,297
l'm sure your brother
simply needs a moment to...

197
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:29,643
Don't interrupt, Uncle!

198
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:32,045
l still haven't heard my thank you.

199
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,480
l'm not a messenger.

200
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,048
l didn't have to come all this way.

201
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,483
Father regrets?

202
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:39,486
He... wants me back?

203
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:42,489
l can see you need time to take this in.

204
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:44,491
l'll come to call on you tomorrow.

205
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:45,458
Good evening.

206
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:50,063
Can we talk about something?

207
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,429
Sure.

208
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:53,967
Do you remember when we
were at the Air Templee

209
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:55,836
and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton?

210
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:59,506
lt must have been so
horrible and traumatic for you.

211
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:03,043
l saw you get so upset that
you weren't even you anymore.

212
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:05,412
l'm not saying the
Avatar State doesn't have

213
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,380
incredible-- and
helpful-- power,

214
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:10,217
but you have to understand,

215
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:12,219
for the people who love you,

216
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,221
watching you be in
that much rage and pain

217
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:16,223
is really scary.

218
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,793
l'm really glad you told me that.

219
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:21,795
But l still need to do this.

220
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:23,096
l don't understand.

221
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,931
No, you don't.

222
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:27,126
Every day more and more people die.

223
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:29,603
l'm already a hundred years late.

224
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:30,604
Defeating the Fire Lord

225
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:32,606
is the only way to stop this war.

226
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:34,130
l have to try it.

227
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,610
l can't watch you do this to yourself.

228
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,612
l'm not coming tomorrow.

229
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,614
Good night.

230
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,949
Good night.

231
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:44,951
We're going home.

232
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,353
After three long years.

233
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,355
lt's unbelievable.

234
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:50,924
lt is unbelievable.

235
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:54,328
l have never known my
brother to regret anything.

236
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:56,830
Did you listen to Azula?

237
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,798
Father's realized how
important family is to him.

238
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:00,067
He cares about me.

239
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,269
l care about you.

240
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:04,237
And if Ozai wants you back,

241
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:07,140
well, l think it  may not
be for the reasons

242
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,342
you imagine.

243
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:10,344
You don't know how my
father feels about me.

244
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:11,311
You don't know anything.

245
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:14,848
Zuko, l only meant that, in our family,

246
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:17,851
things are not always what they seem.

247
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,854
l think you are
exactly what you seem--

248
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:23,523
a lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man

249
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:25,388
who's always been
jealous of his brother.

250
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,206
(yells)

251
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:46,513
(gasps)

252
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:49,383
Sokka, Sokka, wake up.

253
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:50,350
Huh?

254
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,352
l don't think we should be trying

255
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:53,854
to bring on the Avatar State.

256
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:55,555
You sure? Yes.

257
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:56,957
Okay.

258
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:59,426
Do you think the General will be mad?

259
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,527
What can he say?

260
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:01,495
You're the Avatar.

261
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:04,362
Who knows better than you?

262
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:14,174
Wait. Don't leave without me.

263
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:17,110
Uncle, you've changed your mind.

264
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,442
Family sticks together, right?

265
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:26,248
We're finally going home.

266
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:33,160
The thing is--

267
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,830
l don't think we'll ever be
able to trigger it on purpose.

268
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,432
So l guess that's it.

269
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:40,367
Sure l can't change your mind?

270
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,935
l'm sure.

271
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,970
l can only reach the Avatar State

272
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,272
when l'm in genuine danger.

273
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:47,107
l see.

274
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:49,075
l was afraid you'd say that.

275
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:53,914
Aang!

276
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,007
(yelling)

277
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:04,052
Men, attack the Avatar!

278
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:19,906
What are you doing?

279
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:22,500
l believe we are about to get results.

280
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,080
l'm not your enemy.

281
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:33,688
l won't fight you.

282
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:11,558
You can't run forever.

283
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,287
You can't fight forever.

284
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,480
Brother, Uncle...

285
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,849
Welcome.

286
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:38,018
l'm so glad you decided to come.

287
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:41,888
Are we ready to depart, Your Highness?

288
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,491
Set our course for home, Captain.

289
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,326
Home.

290
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,793
You heard the Princess.

291
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,228
Raise the anchors.

292
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,797
We're taking the prisoners home.

293
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,292
Your Highness, l...

294
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,811
You lied to me.

295
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:07,075
Like l've never done that before.

296
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,811
(yelling)

297
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:16,790
l wonder what crazy
thing they're trying now.

298
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,953
(rumbling)

299
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:22,827
Maybe we should just
make sure Aang's okay.

300
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:26,566
What's going on?

301
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,168
The General's gone crazy.

302
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,536
He's trying to force Aang

303
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,800
into the Avatar State.

304
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:41,981
Good bird-horse thingie.

305
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:48,455
(roaring)

306
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:53,006
Maybe you can avoid me, but she can't.

307
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:03,233
(yells)

308
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,234
(grunts)

309
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:05,772
l can't move.

310
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,467
Don't hurt her.

311
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:13,113
) (yells

312
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:15,206
Katara, no!

313
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,488
Stop this.

314
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:22,921
You have to let her go.

315
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,759
You could save her if you
were in the Avatar State.

316
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,361
l'm trying. l'm trying!

317
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:30,363
Aang, l'm sinking.

318
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:32,456
l don't see glowing.

319
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:34,796
(screaming)

320
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:38,304
You don't need to do this!

321
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:39,272
Apparently...

322
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:40,534
l do.

323
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,581
lt worked.

324
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:51,106
lt worked!

325
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:58,453
(yells)

326
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,202
Zuko, let's go!

327
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:24,117
You know, Father blames Uncle
for the loss at the North Pole.

328
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:26,553
And he considers you
a miserable failure

329
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:28,388
for not finding the Avatar.

330
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,190
Why would he want you back home

331
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,953
except to lock you up

332
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,827
where you can no longer embarrass him?

333
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:35,988
(grunting)

334
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,397
(yells)

335
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,601
Avatar Aang,

336
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:16,970
can you hear me?

337
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,972
Your friend is safe.

338
00:20:18,972 --> 00:20:22,275
lt was just a trick
to trigger the Avatar State.

339
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,436
And it worked!

340
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:49,057
lt's time you learned.

341
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:57,977
The Avatar State is
a defense mechanism

342
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:00,146
designed to empower you
with the skills and knowledge

343
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:01,581
of all the first Avatars.

344
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:07,187
The glow is the combination
of all your past lives

345
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:12,425
focusing their energy
through your body.

346
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,225
ln the Avatar State,

347
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,554
you're at your most powerful...

348
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,870
but you're also at
your most vulnerable.

349
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,071
What do you mean?

350
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:28,341
lf you are killed in the Avatar State,

351
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:31,945
the reincarnation cycle will be broken

352
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:35,312
and the Avatar will cease to exist.

353
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,467
l'm sorry, Katara.

354
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:57,437
l hope you never have to
see me like that again.

355
00:21:57,437 --> 00:21:58,938
Ha. Are you joking?

356
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:00,273
That was almost perfect.

357
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:01,875
We just have to find out a way

358
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,309
to control you when you're like that.

359
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:04,833
You're out of your mind.

360
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,544
l guess we'll figure it out
on the way to the Fire Nation.

361
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:10,577
Anybody got a problem with that?

362
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:14,513
Do you still want an escort to Omashu?

363
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:18,152
l think we're all set.

364
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,430
Anyone who harbors these traitors

365
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,000
will face the wrath of the Fire Lord.

366
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,126
(gasps)

367
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:31,201
There will be no place left to hide.

368
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:35,373
(panting)

369
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,878
l think we 're safe here.

370
00:22:39,305 --> 00:23:39,218

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,750
- Who is she?

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,050
What did you tell me?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,883
- A business associate

5
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:19,980
might stop by later tonight

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,786
and chat about

7
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:21,980
our meeting tomorrow.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,980
- Mm.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,240
- Her name is Miranda.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,980
Just in case.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,980
- Just in case what?

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,980
- If a lady shows up,

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,148
it's not a weird threesome plot

14
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:30,980
or anything.

15
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,542
- Okay, well, if my business

16
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:34,142
associate shows up, it is.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,980
Miranda.

18
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,980
Miranda.

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,980
- Ms. Bowden, you with us?

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,645
- I'm sorry, these flights

21
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:44,980
make me really tired.

22
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,020
I think I should

23
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,980
get some sleep.

24
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,073
- Of course.

25
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:49,980
You go get some rest.

26
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,798
We're waiting

27
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:51,980
on some information

28
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,880
from the Bangkok Police anyway.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,640
You know, surveillance videos

30
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:54,980
from the hotel.

31
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,980
That sort of thing.

32
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,989
- If you show up

33
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,980
on those videos,

34
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,103
we'll need to speak

35
00:00:59,143 --> 00:00:59,980
with you again,

36
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,641
'cause that would be strange,

37
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:01,980
right?

38
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,572
- Okay, so when you guys

39
00:01:04,612 --> 00:01:04,980
were in the room,

40
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,980
what did they say?

41
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,400
Did they talk...

42
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:07,980
- No, no, no, no, no.

43
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,513
We are not supposed

44
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:08,980
to talk about it.

45
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,640
That's what they requested.

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,716
- Clearly we have to talk

47
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:11,980
about it.

48
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,980
- The FBI is frightening, okay?

49
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,980
And they are very serious.

50
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,054
Just can't stop thinking

51
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:18,980
about how awful it is

52
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,980
that that guy in 3C died.

53
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,980
- Cassie, weigh in.

54
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,980
- Oh, I mean, come on, guys.

55
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,624
It is shocking, but people get

56
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:27,980
murdered every day, so...

57
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,980
Sorry, I don't... that's awful.

58
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,557
I don't know why

59
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:34,980
I said that.

60
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,985
I'm really tired.

61
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:36,980
I'm overly tired.

62
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,893
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,000
- It's okay.

64
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,908
- Okay, well, you two are a

65
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:41,980
very special episode right now.

66
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,735
So I'm gonna go

67
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,980
to the little boy's room.

68
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,547
Cassie, whatever you have

69
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,000
going on, shake it off.

70
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,629
See you tomorrow night

71
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:48,980
for oysters?

72
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,980
- Oh, I love oysters.

73
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,420
- Aw, it's good thing

74
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,980
you live in Oyster Bay.

75
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,980
See you two later.

76
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,980
- Hey, hey, wait.

77
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,071
Just so you know,

78
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,980
I didn't tell the FBI anything

79
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,818
about the thing

80
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:00,980
that we talked about.

81
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,980
That you went out with 3C.

82
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,209
- Okay, well, I never told you

83
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,980
I went out with 3C,

84
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,195
so I'm glad you didn't.

85
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:06,980
- Yes, you did.

86
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,054
- No, I didn't.

87
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:08,980
- You didn't?

88
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,980
Oh.

89
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,980
Anyway, um, don't be mad,

90
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,980
but I might've implied

91
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,980
just a tiny bit

92
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,980
that you were flirting some,

93
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,038
and that I might have seen him

94
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:19,980
slip you his business card,

95
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,036
but that's it.

96
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:22,980
- Wha... are you kidding me?

97
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,843
Now your gossip

98
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:24,980
isn't gonna match up

99
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,980
with the story I told them.

100
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,826
- Story?

101
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:27,980
What story?

102
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,510
- Whatever!

103
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,980
The truth!

104
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,743
- That were you flirting?

105
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:29,980
So what?

106
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,156
That's not gonna get you

107
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:31,980
into any trouble.

108
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,561
- I'm flying to Rome

109
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:34,980
in two days, okay?

110
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,280
We... can we just agree

111
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,849
to leave this terrible,

112
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:38,980
crazy thing in Bangkok behind?

113
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,980
Can we do that, please?

114
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,980
- Yeah, sure.

115
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,980
- Great.

116
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,980
- Ugh, new route, new me.

117
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,980
d

118
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,980
f

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fuck.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,980
Who are you?

121
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,980
Who the fuck are you?

122
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:19,324
Aah!

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,980
Oh, my... fuck!

124
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:22,980
Ugh!

125
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,044
- Yeah, right now!

126
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:27,980
You can do this!

127
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,386
Push it to the limit!

128
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:29,980
Let's go!

129
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,980
Winners never quit!

130
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,980
20 seconds!

131
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,389
- How is spinning in place

132
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:34,980
gonna help?

133
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:36,980
My God.

134
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,881
Damn it, whatever

135
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:38,980
Megan said to the FBI

136
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,296
is way more

137
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:39,980
than she admitted to me,

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,340
and she likes to talk.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,565
Plus, you know, I basically

140
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:42,980
lied to them, so...

141
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,980
- I like Megan.

142
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,370
- Why is our night together

143
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:45,980
such a blur?

144
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,980
- Alcohol?

145
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,332
- Gotta remember

146
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:48,980
something useful about Miranda

147
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,980
so I can actually find her.

148
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,297
Alex, she was with us

149
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:51,980
that night!

150
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,880
She's gotta get me some answers

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,619
before the FBI slaps me

152
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,439
in handcuffs.

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,300
- Sidebar,

154
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,600
what are you wearing?

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,661
- This is for a spin cla...

156
00:05:59,701 --> 00:05:59,980
What?

157
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,038
If you're gonna be here, could

158
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:02,698
you try being more helpful?

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,980
- Wait, am I gonna be here?

160
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,253
What am I even doing here?

161
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:06,980
Why this place?

162
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,980
These questions feel important.

163
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,006
- No, just finding Miranda

164
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:10,980
and getting some answers,

165
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,906
that's what feels

166
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:12,980
important right now.

167
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,272
God, why didn't you tell me

168
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:14,980
more about her?

169
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,414
- Like what?

170
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:15,980
Bizarre hobbies?

171
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,861
Her ring size?

172
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:17,980
A post office box?

173
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,980
What do you mean?

174
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,328
I didn't know

175
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:19,980
you had to track her down

176
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,980
after my brutal murder.

177
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
- Okay, that's fair.

178
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,700
- Look, at least acknowledge

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,863
that having dead me

180
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:26,980
in your head is strange.

181
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,000
Why am I here?

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,850
- Look, I woke up

183
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,980
next to your dead body

184
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,209
and totally freaked out, okay?

185
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:33,980
That's your answer.

186
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,660
Can we get back

187
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,980
to the mystery woman, please?

188
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,160
- Fine, what did I actually

189
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,980
tell you about her?

190
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,980
- Nothing, really.

191
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,823
Just that you guys

192
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:40,980
were business associates.

193
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,312
- And you still have my

194
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:43,980
business card in your wallet?

195
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,259
- Wait.

196
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:45,980
Yes.

197
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,559
I could go to your office.

198
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:47,980
- Yeah.

199
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,023
- If she worked with you,

200
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:49,980
they'll know her there.

201
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,820
Maybe she can help me

202
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,980
fill in some of these blanks.

203
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,980
- Yes.

204
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,539
- The rest of your life

205
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,000
starts today!

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,504
- Oh.

207
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:13,980
It's a rabbit.

208
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,980
- The artist is a client.

209
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,562
The piece is called "Heroism in

210
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:18,980
the Face of the Modern World

211
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,786
and All of Its

212
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,086
Very Many Hardships."

213
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,680
- Wow, that's a...

214
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,980
That's a lot.

215
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,980
- Don't tell anyone,

216
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,487
but I think that is such

217
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:31,980
a pompous name for that.

218
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,321
- Yeah, I agree.

219
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,098
- Miss Ricci, you're here

220
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:35,980
to see Alex Sokolov?

221
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,623
- Yes.

222
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:38,980
Um...

223
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,980
You can call me Alessandra.

224
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,386
- What a lovely name.

225
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:42,980
- Thanks.

226
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,049
- And you are a client

227
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:45,980
of Alex's?

228
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,987
- Yes, I met Ale...

229
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:48,980
Well, um,

230
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,319
I was recommended to him

231
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:50,980
by a friend.

232
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,980
That same friend knows Miranda.

233
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,933
Does she work here

234
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,173
by any chance, or...

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,980
d

236
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,980
Sorry, do you know Miranda?

237
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,980
- Sabrina.

238
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,980
- No... yeah, no.

239
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,708
- Miss Ricci.

240
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:06,980
- Mm?

241
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,324
- I'm Jean Miller

242
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:09,980
with human resources.

243
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,361
Could we speak

244
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:10,980
in the conference room?

245
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,980
- Yeah.

246
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,980
He's dead?

247
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,980
Oh, that's so awful.

248
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,000
Poor Alex.

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,939
You know, we... we bonded

250
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,980
over Russian literature.

251
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,980
- That surprises me.

252
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,599
He always struck me

253
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,980
as more of an outdoor sports

254
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,980
or sailing type of man.

255
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,980
- He can't read on a boat?

256
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,320
- Well, he can't

257
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,980
do anything anymore,

258
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,980
so I suppose it's a moot point.

259
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,980
Now, you mentioned a Miranda.

260
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,511
- Yeah, Alex had talked about a

261
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:47,980
business associate in Bangkok.

262
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,195
I mean, we... we had some

263
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:50,135
mutual friends.

264
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,932
I thought maybe she worked

265
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:53,980
for Unisphere.

266
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,980
- Hmm, I don't know of anyone.

267
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,980
Do you have a last name?

268
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,438
Do you need her

269
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:00,980
for some reason?

270
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,275
- No, I mean, he just

271
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:03,980
talked about her in passing.

272
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,210
I really don't want

273
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:05,980
to overstep.

274
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,980
- May I ask, Alessandra,

275
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,008
what exactly is your investment

276
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:10,980
with Unisphere?

277
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,790
- This woman is onto you,

278
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:13,980
right?

279
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,218
- Her face barely moves.

280
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:15,980
Who could tell?

281
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,494
- But it doesn't feel right,

282
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:17,960
and your hands are shaking.

283
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,455
- This is obviously

284
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:18,980
part of a much bigger

285
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,075
nervous breakdown.

286
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:20,980
Please help me.

287
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,980
Okay, I have to ask you

288
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,980
a really embarrassing question.

289
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,000
- Hmm?

290
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,954
- What is a hedge fund?

291
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,207
- Yeah, well, that's the thing.

292
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:32,980
Nobody really knows.

293
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:34,159
Oh, really?

294
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,690
- Yeah, that's how I get away

295
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:35,980
with things.

296
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,554
- That makes me feel

297
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:37,494
so much better.

298
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,724
- No, seriously,

299
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:39,980
people just invest with me,

300
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,980
and then I invest their money.

301
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,026
- So you just take people's

302
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:43,980
money and move it around?

303
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,980
- Yeah.

304
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,980
Most of my clients are invested

305
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,980
in one of our funds.

306
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,980
The Stalwarts account.

307
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,292
- I'm invested in

308
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,000
the Stalwarts account.

309
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,008
- Can you wait here

310
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,128
for just a moment?

311
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll get a manager.

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
- Okay.

313
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,980
Okay.

314
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,980
- Miss Ricci!

315
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,980
Miss Ricci, these men

316
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,565
would like to have

317
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:49,980
a quick word!

318
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,037
- Yeah, sorry, I have

319
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,980
another appointment.

320
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,980
- Miss Ricci!

321
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,046
- Miss Ricci, did you get

322
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:56,980
everything you needed?

323
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,920
- Uh, yeah, no,

324
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,980
I'm totally fine.

325
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,980
Thank you so... oh, shit!

326
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,980
Oh, my God.

327
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,980
I am so sorry.

328
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,049
You can bill me, okay?

329
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:05,980
I'm sorry.

330
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,220
- Would you please...

331
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, no.

332
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,000
- Fuck.

333
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,980
Excuse me.

334
00:11:37,374 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, my God.

335
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,980
What was that?

336
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,298
Hello?

337
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:53,980
- Ms. Bowden.

338
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,171
Special Agent White

339
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:55,980
with the FBI.

340
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,985
Could you come in

341
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:57,980
for another chat?

342
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,980
Coffee's on us.

343
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,558
- No.

344
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:01,980
Yes, yeah, of course.

345
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,792
Is everything okay?

346
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:03,980
How's 10:00 a.m. tomorrow?

347
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,117
Oh, if you've retained counsel,

348
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:05,980
feel free to bring them.

349
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,929
- Was I supposed

350
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:07,980
to retain counsel?

351
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,292
- Perfect answer.

352
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,000
Looking forward to it.

353
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,980
- Getting an early start today.

354
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,980
I'm all for it.

355
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,980
What can I get for you?

356
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,446
- Ooh.

357
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't tempt me.

358
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,003
Um, actually, could I...

359
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:37,980
Can I ask you a favor?

360
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,980
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,002
- So I was in here two nights

362
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:41,980
ago with my coworker Cassie,

363
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,143
and she just got fired,

364
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:44,980
and um...

365
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,980
You know, I was, like,

366
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,562
I thought we'd just

367
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:47,980
get her drunk,

368
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,251
you know,

369
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:48,980
commiserate and all that,

370
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,931
and you know what

371
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:50,980
she ended up doing?

372
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,980
She insisted on buying.

373
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,370
- Oh?

374
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,000
- Right?

375
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,980
I mean, she just lost her job.

376
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,980
What was she thinking?

377
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,980
So do you think there's any way

378
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,942
that you could, you know,

379
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,980
refund her and let me pay?

380
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,023
You know, I just wanna do

381
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:05,980
something nice for her.

382
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,338
- We're not supposed to do that

383
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:07,980
after the fact.

384
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,000
- Well, you know what?

385
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,551
If you could bend the rules

386
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:17,980
just this once.

387
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,000
- Uh...

388
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay.

389
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No Cassie.

390
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,953
Oh, but we do have

391
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:37,980
a Cassandra Bowden.

392
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,980
- There she is.

393
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,451
That's her.

394
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:42,000
Yep.

395
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,519
Thank you.

396
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,980
You are my hero.

397
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,980
- So...

398
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,980
that is everything.

399
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,404
- No, no, I... yeah, no.

400
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:00,980
I got it.

401
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,054
I got it, yeah.

402
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:02,980
I got it all.

403
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,980
Um, are you okay?

404
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,980
- Um, yeah.

405
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,980
I mean, physically I'm good,

406
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,980
but mentally, I...

407
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:16,000
I keep seeing his body up here.

408
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,347
- I get it.

409
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:17,980
- So it's really...

410
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,320
- No, of course.

411
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,980
I'm sorry, I just...

412
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,543
You know,

413
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,980
I asked if you're okay,

414
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,248
and you just experienced

415
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:24,980
severe trauma,

416
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,611
so of cour...

417
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:26,980
Of course you're not okay.

418
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,929
- No, I'm mostly...

419
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,980
I'm mostly, like...

420
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,367
Right now, I'm pretty good.

421
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:33,980
- Okay.

422
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,168
Are you sure?

423
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,000
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
- Okay, uh...

425
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,887
Then, Cas,

426
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,980
I have to ask you this.

427
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,986
Why the fuck did you

428
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:44,980
clean everything up?

429
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,980
- I... I don't know.

430
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,801
I was talking to you

431
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:50,980
on the phone,

432
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,170
and Amanda Knox

433
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,980
just came into my head.

434
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,980
- I'm sorry,

435
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,487
that fucked up phone call

436
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:56,980
was from the crime scene?

437
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,627
- I know.

438
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,980
Oh, God, I keep having my...

439
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,195
- Okay, okay, Jesus.

440
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:03,980
- Oh, my God.

441
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,588
- Cassie, it's okay.

442
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:04,980
- Oh, my God.

443
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,013
- Okay, Cas, you're okay.

444
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:07,980
You're okay.

445
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,750
- Oh, my God.

446
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,980
- Take a deep breath.

447
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,402
And then... you're okay.

448
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,960
- No, I'm gonna have a panic...

449
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,586
- No, you're not having

450
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:12,980
a panic attack.

451
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,462
- I'm having a panic attack.

452
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:14,980
- Jessica!

453
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,523
- Who are you?

454
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:15,980
Who is that?

455
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,289
You're calling your assistant?

456
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:17,980
That's Jennifer.

457
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,609
- How would you know that?

458
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:20,149
- Yep.

459
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,629
- Jessica, grab Cassie

460
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:21,980
a Topo Chico

461
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,700
from the back of the fridge.

462
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,947
- It's Jennifer.

463
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:25,980
Wait, Topo Chico?

464
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,980
You have those on hand for me?

465
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,980
- I love you.

466
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,896
They're for me, 'cause

467
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:30,980
why would they be for you?

468
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,832
'Cause, you know,

469
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:32,980
you've never been here.

470
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,980
- Are you okay now?

471
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,920
Should I cancel

472
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,980
your drink order?

473
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,980
- I'm okay.

474
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,980
- Okay, so you mentioned

475
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,980
that there was another woman.

476
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,572
- Miranda.

477
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:44,980
- Yeah.

478
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,980
- And she could help us if we...

479
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,827
Alex had mentioned she

480
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:48,980
was a business associate, so...

481
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,488
But it was weird, because when

482
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:51,980
I went to office this morning,

483
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,980
well, everyone had this very...

484
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,390
- You went to his offi...

485
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,980
Cas, oh, my God.

486
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,980
Cassie, that looks so bad.

487
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,758
Why the fuck

488
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:00,980
would you go there?

489
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,448
No, don't...

490
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:01,980
Don't tell me.

491
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,345
Don't tell me

492
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:03,765
why you would go there.

493
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,480
I can think of, like,

494
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:04,980
700 well intentioned,

495
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,958
but unwise reasons why

496
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:06,980
you would've done that.

497
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,632
- Okay, well, the fucking FBI

498
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:09,980
asked if I had a lawyer,

499
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,980
and I didn't know what to do.

500
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,980
- I am your lawyer, obviously!

501
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,407
- I was hoping

502
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:14,587
you would say that.

503
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,980
Thank you.

504
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,304
I know you never do pro-bono,

505
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:17,980
so what can I...

506
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,980
How can I...

507
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,980
- Cassie, I'm your best friend.

508
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm not gonna take your money.

509
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,000
- Thank you.

510
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,030
- Okay, I'm gonna see

511
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,980
what I can find out

512
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,980
about this Miranda person,

513
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,980
and I'm gonna look into

514
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,980
Thai extradition laws.

515
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,536
- Annie.

516
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,980
- It's gonna be fine.

517
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,299
And this meeting tomorrow

518
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:37,980
with the FBI,

519
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,711
we are going

520
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,980
to go there together,

521
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,449
and we're gonna see

522
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:41,809
what they have on you.

523
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,373
- I was supposed

524
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:42,980
to start this Rome route,

525
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,171
but I'm definitely not going.

526
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:44,980
I don't think that...

527
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,546
- You are definitely going.

528
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:47,980
You have to keep working.

529
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,919
The last thing you need

530
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,980
right now is to get fired.

531
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,980
It's gonna be fine.

532
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,703
You just need

533
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:52,980
to get some rest, okay?

534
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,980
- I'm gonna get some rest.

535
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,549
- You're gonna meet me

536
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:55,609
tomorrow morning.

537
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,518
- I'm gonna meet you

538
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:56,980
tomorrow morning.

539
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,980
- And you're not gonna be late.

540
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,980
- And I'm not gonna be late.

541
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,980
- So, like, actually not late.

542
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,072
- And I'm not gonna

543
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:02,980
be fucking late.

544
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
- Get some rest.

545
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,980
Like, for real.

546
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,980
D

547
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,985
Seriously?

548
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:15,980
Fuck.

549
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,841
- Cassie.

550
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:18,980
- Megan, hi.

551
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,057
Listen, that is not me

552
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:20,980
in the photo, okay?

553
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,370
Didn't we agree to leave

554
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,980
this whole thing in Bangkok?

555
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,311
That was you

556
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:24,980
I was speaking to, right?

557
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,594
- Of course it was me.

558
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:27,980
What is that noise?

559
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,122
- I'm at a bar right now.

560
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:29,980
I'm getting drinks.

561
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,464
I know I probably shouldn't be,

562
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:31,980
but I'm not

563
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,587
open to your feedback

564
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:32,980
at the moment.

565
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,257
- The FBI reached out

566
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:34,980
to me again.

567
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,980
I missed their call,

568
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,299
and I haven't

569
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:37,980
called them back yet, but...

570
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,297
- So they reached out

571
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:39,980
to you too.

572
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,839
Oh, that's good, that's good.

573
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:40,980
- No.

574
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,197
They wanted more information

575
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:43,980
about you.

576
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,244
- What?

577
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:44,980
- They probably want

578
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,887
information on

579
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:46,980
all of us, right?

580
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,980
I mean...

581
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,386
did they say anything

582
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:50,980
about me?

583
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,980
- No, wait, hold on,

584
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,841
they specifically said

585
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:53,980
they have questions about me?

586
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,768
- Oh, wait.

587
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:55,980
Hold on, hold on.

588
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,980
I think Bill just came home.

589
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,038
Hey, hon, hi.

590
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,980
- Hey.

591
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,387
- I'm just on the phone here

592
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:01,980
with Cassie.

593
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,958
I'll be a minute.

594
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,980
- Cassie's the one

595
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,552
that slept with that dead

596
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:04,980
Russian guy, right?

597
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,195
- Hey, no, I didn't.

598
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:06,980
No, I didn't.

599
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,133
- Christ, Bill, please,

600
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:08,980
just go upstairs.

601
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,469
I'll be up in a minute.

602
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:10,980
- Megan.

603
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,662
- Cassie, that was Bill

604
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:11,980
being Bill.

605
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,670
You know him.

606
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,980
- Why would you say that?

607
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,570
Is that what you said

608
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:14,980
to the FBI too?

609
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,980
- No. Come on.

610
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,980
Cassie,

611
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,980
that photo on the internet...

612
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,980
I mean, seriously,

613
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,980
it looks just like you.

614
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,433
Can we just...

615
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:24,980
- You know what?

616
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,909
Honestly, if that was me

617
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:26,980
in the photo, you know what?

618
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,486
Then I guess my life

619
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,980
would be freefalling

620
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,985
down an insane pit

621
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:31,980
of traumatic shit.

622
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,825
So I guess I go out

623
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:33,980
to a very, very loud place

624
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,758
to drown out

625
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:35,980
all the crazy stuff

626
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,980
that's going on in my head,

627
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,426
and you can bet that it

628
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,980
would feel fucking crazy.

629
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,415
But...

630
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,980
It's not me in the picture!

631
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,980
- Cassie, I just...

632
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,378
If there's anything

633
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:51,980
that I can do to help.

634
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,690
- Megan, please stop helping,

635
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:53,980
okay?

636
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,980
Thank you.

637
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,423
- I'm...

638
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,980
d

639
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
- What?

640
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,174
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

641
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:08,980
whoa, whoa, whoa.

642
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,351
Whoa.

643
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:10,980
- Cassie, you're here.

644
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,484
- I am.

645
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:12,980
Sorry, I needed that.

646
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,980
- That was mine, but it's okay.

647
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,980
I thought you were too tired

648
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,018
for oyster night.

649
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:16,980
- Well, I'm not.

650
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,632
- Shane said you were too tired

651
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:17,980
for oyster night.

652
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,219
- Yeah, what happened

653
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:19,980
to your hand?

654
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,543
- Nothing, it's no big deal.

655
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:21,980
Nothing.

656
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,980
You invited Jada.

657
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,172
Yay.

658
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,232
- Oh, that's fun.

659
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,383
'Cause in a second,

660
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:25,980
Jada's gonna pull me outside

661
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,690
and say, "You invited Cassie.

662
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:27,980
Yay."

663
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,538
- You invited Cassie?

664
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:28,980
- Just like that.

665
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,980
You implied you weren't coming.

666
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,497
- I just have a little

667
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:31,980
thing in the morning.

668
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,980
It's no big deal.

669
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,437
Ugh, I need to shut my brain

670
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,980
off for a few hours, you know?

671
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,062
- Why don't you just let me

672
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:40,980
look at that for a sec?

673
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,695
Oh, my God.

674
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:42,980
Were you in a fight?

675
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,546
- Okay, no.

676
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:44,980
- Did you take someone down?

677
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,980
- No, I cut it on some glass.

678
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,703
It was, like,

679
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:47,980
the dumbest thing ever.

680
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,549
- Ah, I don't remember

681
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:48,980
getting the flyer

682
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,963
that Cassie drinks free

683
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:50,980
all night at this place.

684
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,980
- Hey, next round's on me.

685
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,611
How 'bout that?

686
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:53,980
Pitchers.

687
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,512
Let's go to that place

688
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:55,752
we went to last week

689
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,665
where we met those two boys.

690
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:56,980
- No, no, no.

691
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,149
- Yes.

692
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:57,980
- No, he blocked me on Grindr.

693
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,523
- What?

694
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:58,980
- Yes.

695
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,000
- What's Grindr?

696
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,620
- Do they not have Grindr

697
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:01,980
in New Jersey?

698
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,256
- They have everything New York

699
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:04,980
has in New Jersey.

700
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,000
- Where is Shane?

701
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,670
He always invites me

702
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,250
to things

703
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,504
and then disappears,

704
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:10,980
like, literally...

705
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,672
- He's having so much fun.

706
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:11,980
Look at him.

707
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,980
- Ah!

708
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,980
Cassie, get us more drinks.

709
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,980
- You get us more drinks.

710
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,980
- No, girl, you still owe me.

711
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,386
- Why?

712
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:18,980
- Munich.

713
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,980
- What happened in Munich?

714
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,232
- Hello, you threw your shoe

715
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:21,980
at the bartender,

716
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,074
and then you got us kicked out.

717
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:23,980
You said it was instincts.

718
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,151
- Fine.

719
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,980
- Two, two!

720
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,000
- Thank you!

721
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,980
Sorry, 'scuse me, but...

722
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,235
- Mm.

723
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:33,980
Hi.

724
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,980
- Hi.

725
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:36,980
Two drinks.

726
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,980
That's ambitious.

727
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,980
- This is for my friend,

728
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,685
but to be honest with you,

729
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:43,980
she is not a friend,

730
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,000
so do you wanna be my friend?

731
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,039
- Oh, this is how

732
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,980
you pick up guys isn't it, huh?

733
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,020
With this, like,

734
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,980
elaborate ruse?

735
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,170
- It's really not

736
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,980
that elaborate, so cheers.

737
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,980
- Cheers.

738
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,460
- All right, I have

739
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:00,980
a confession to make.

740
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,980
- What?

741
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,015
- I noticed you earlier

742
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:04,980
in the bar.

743
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,980
Not in a creepy way.

744
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,980
Wow, that sounded creepy.

745
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,980
- Are you stalking me?

746
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,980
Don't take any pictures.

747
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,423
It's very hot in here.

748
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm a little bit sweaty.

749
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,306
- I think...

750
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:15,726
I think you look great.

751
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,980
I'm Buckley, by the way.

752
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,535
- Buckley?

753
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:19,980
What kind of name is that?

754
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,007
- It's actually

755
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,980
my grandfather's name, but...

756
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,171
- Okay, Buckley.

757
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:24,980
I'm Cassie.

758
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,640
- Cassie, nice to meet you.

759
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,980
Two giant vodka shots!

760
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,622
Please.

761
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:30,980
Two.

762
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,000
Two.

763
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,980
What?

764
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,908
Do you have to work

765
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:35,980
or something tomorrow?

766
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,980
- Uh, I'm an unemployed actor,

767
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,860
so no, my schedule's

768
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,980
pretty open.

769
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,630
- Oh, that's good.

770
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,460
Okay, wait, sorry, I have...

771
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,980
Wait, wait, it's my brother!

772
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,680
It's my brother.

773
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:47,980
- Okay.

774
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,379
- Just hold one second.

775
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:49,980
Hi, Davey!

776
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,980
- Oh, hey.

777
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,761
Hey, I was just checking

778
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:51,980
to see,

779
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,910
do you think we need

780
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,980
reservations for dinner

781
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,980
at that sushi restaurant?

782
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,168
- Okay, I cannot hear you!

783
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,288
I cannot hear him.

784
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,810
- Sounds like she's at a bar.

785
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:58,980
- Shh.

786
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,299
- I know, it's very loud.

787
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:00,980
I'm in a bar!

788
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,305
- Tell him

789
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:01,980
you'll call him back.

790
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,961
- Yeah, I should probably

791
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:03,980
hang up and call him back.

792
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,980
- Well, I can...

793
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,535
- Okay, I'm gonna

794
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:05,980
call him back.

795
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,986
Okay, bye.

796
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,750
- Oh, my God.

797
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,290
I...

798
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,980
d

799
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,980
Oh, my God...

800
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,980
- Hey, are you okay?

801
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,980
- Yeah.

802
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,957
Um, I've just been

803
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:19,980
having these, like,

804
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,010
these weird thoughts

805
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,980
keep coming to my...

806
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,336
I don't... You wanna dance?

807
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:23,980
Let's dance.

808
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,716
Let's go that way.

809
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:25,980
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,000
- Sorry.

811
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,500
- Hey.

812
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,985
- What's going on?

813
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:46,980
- Uh, you're late.

814
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,364
And you promised

815
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:47,980
you weren't gonna be late.

816
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,350
- Okay.

817
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,980
- Oh, and you smell like booze.

818
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,706
I guess you didn't get the rest

819
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:52,980
that I told you to get.

820
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,711
- Okay, listen,

821
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:54,980
my apartment was so quiet.

822
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,260
I'm sorry,

823
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,860
I had to get out of there.

824
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,393
I really... I showered,

825
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:57,980
and I drank so much mouthwash.

826
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,572
I promise.

827
00:24:58,612 --> 00:24:58,980
- Okay.

828
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,087
So I have this niece at NYU,

829
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:01,980
and she goes

830
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,444
to fraternity parties,

831
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:03,960
and she has it just, like,

832
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,629
a little more together

833
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:04,980
than you do.

834
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,283
- Okay, I've met Stacey.

835
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:06,980
Give it time.

836
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,980
Seriously.

837
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,980
I'm sorry.

838
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,586
I'm sorry,

839
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:10,980
I shouldn't have drank.

840
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,635
You're right.

841
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:12,980
That was so fucking stupid,

842
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,864
and I really should not

843
00:25:13,904 --> 00:25:14,980
have gone home with that guy.

844
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,980
- Okay, focus.

845
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,129
This lead agent,

846
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:17,980
Kim Hammond.

847
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,292
- Yeah, yeah.

848
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:18,980
- She seems like a nice lady.

849
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,486
She's not a nice lady.

850
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:21,980
She's not your friend.

851
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,665
The FBI knife goes in

852
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:22,980
very slow.

853
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,520
They want you to fuck up.

854
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,818
So we wanna know

855
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:26,980
what they know, right?

856
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,644
Just don't fucking lie.

857
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:28,404
- Of course.

858
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,441
- If you get tripped up,

859
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:29,980
you can just take the Fifth.

860
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,980
You've heard of that, right?

861
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,759
- Take the Fifth?

862
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,299
What?

863
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,980
I'm not a fucking mob wife.

864
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,107
- No, 'cause that would

865
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:35,980
be so much easier.

866
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,038
Do you have any idea

867
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:37,980
how many mob wives

868
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,660
are just, like,

869
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,440
roaming free on Staten Island

870
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,226
rocking knock-off Fendi

871
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:42,980
because of me?

872
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,980
- Wives, plural?

873
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,980
- Okay, so the only problem

874
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,095
is that the FBI might be doing

875
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:47,980
what I'm doing, fishing,

876
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,027
in which case, you know,

877
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:49,980
if you take the Fifth,

878
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,617
that's, like,

879
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:51,980
a pretty big red flag, so...

880
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,399
- Take the Fifth or not?

881
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:53,980
Which one?

882
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,980
- Okay, stop spinning,

883
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,669
and look at me

884
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:57,980
before you answer anything.

885
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,867
And if I smile,

886
00:25:58,907 --> 00:25:59,980
you tell the truth,

887
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,798
and if I nod,

888
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:01,980
you take the Fifth.

889
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,876
- We got the hotel camera

890
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,776
footage from the Makara Prince.

891
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,627
- Great.

892
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,000
Show me the flight attendant.

893
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,980
What the...

894
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,980
What is this?

895
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,980
- That's the footage.

896
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,266
- That's not the footage.

897
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:18,146
What the fuck?

898
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,942
- Six hours before Alex's

899
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:21,602
death, everything goes out.

900
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,336
It's a solid 12 hours of

901
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,980
nothing but worthless static.

902
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,122
Apparently their system's

903
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:26,980
less than reliable.

904
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,720
- Yeah, or someone killed

905
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:27,980
the feed.

906
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,700
- Or the Thai police thought

907
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,730
that whatever those cameras

908
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:30,980
picked up

909
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,600
didn't reflect well

910
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:31,980
on Thailand.

911
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,980
- Fuck.

912
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,980
- Overconfidence.

913
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,980
So unlike you, Van.

914
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,980
- No, I, uh...

915
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,980
I brought Bowden in again

916
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,342
'cause I thought there'd

917
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:45,980
be something on those videos.

918
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,000
She's here with her lawyer.

919
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,358
She knows more

920
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:49,980
than she's saying, Kim.

921
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,980
It's obvious.

922
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,038
What else can we throw at her?

923
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:53,980
There's gotta be something.

924
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,980
Did any of the details

925
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,620
of the physical evidence

926
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:55,980
come back yet?

927
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,958
- No, I told you,

928
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:57,980
it's all slowed up

929
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,572
because it has to go

930
00:26:58,612 --> 00:26:58,980
through State.

931
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,980
D

932
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,341
Look, you brought her

933
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:03,980
down here.

934
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,280
We've got the photos.

935
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,290
Let's take a run at her,

936
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,980
see if she tries to flee again.

937
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,695
It's nice to see you again,

938
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:10,980
Ms. Bowden.

939
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,604
I'm glad you could make it in.

940
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:12,980
- Yeah.

941
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,980
Yeah, my dad always said,

942
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,195
"You should be the fix,

943
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:15,980
not the hitch."

944
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,210
- See, I appreciate

945
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:17,980
that wisdom.

946
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,585
- He also hated the police,

947
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:18,980
so it's probably...

948
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,105
- Yes, I guess that's enough

949
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:22,980
with the pleasantries.

950
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,980
- I concur.

951
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,980
- Ms. Mouradian, is it?

952
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,700
- Yeah, that's close enough.

953
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,598
- Well, we appreciate

954
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:29,980
you coming in

955
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,283
and your client deciding

956
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:31,980
to cooperate.

957
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,019
We find it helps these meetings

958
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,000
go a little bit more smoothly.

959
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,980
What happened to your hand?

960
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,621
- Oh, I cut it on some glass.

961
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,980
Super careless.

962
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,111
- Ms. Bowden, when you were

963
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:45,980
spending so much time

964
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,535
with Alex Sokolov

965
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:46,980
on the flight,

966
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,013
did he ever mention

967
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:48,980
to you anything...

968
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,920
- I mean, what?

969
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,980
What do you mean?

970
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,980
What's so much time?

971
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,987
- She told you he was in

972
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:53,980
her section, that's all.

973
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,980
- Did Alex Sokolov ever mention

974
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,296
any concern

975
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:57,980
for his personal safety?

976
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,980
- No, not at all.

977
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,471
I mean, if he did,

978
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:00,980
I would've told you

979
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,334
in our first interview

980
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:03,980
in that creepy room at JFK.

981
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,951
- When you did speak, did he

982
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:05,980
tell you where he was staying?

983
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,205
- Everyone knows that.

984
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:07,980
It was online.

985
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,328
- But what I'm asking

986
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:10,980
is if he told your client.

987
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,980
Got it?

988
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,611
- I'm sorry,

989
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,980
I have to plead the Fifth.

990
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,980
- Are you serious?

991
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,390
- Ms. Bowden,

992
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,570
you and your lawyer

993
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,706
said that you wanted to help.

994
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:22,980
- Oh, well,

995
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,248
she said she was willing

996
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:24,980
to help, yeah.

997
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,980
I'm just here.

998
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,469
- Do you honestly think

999
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:28,980
that we,

1000
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,122
or the Bangkok Police

1001
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:30,980
for that matter,

1002
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,980
really think that you did this?

1003
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,248
- I assume that question

1004
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:34,980
is rhetorical.

1005
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,980
- No, it's a real question.

1006
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,980
Because I'm very much hoping

1007
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,986
to keep someone else

1008
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:40,226
from ending up dead.

1009
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,125
- Like this.

1010
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,980
d

1011
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,810
- It's okay.

1012
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,000
Here we go again.

1013
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,208
It's just dead me.

1014
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:51,980
The FBI not believing you.

1015
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,980
Déjà vu.

1016
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,111
- Special Agent White,

1017
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:54,980
I sincerely doubt

1018
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,792
that you're allowed

1019
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:56,980
to be exposing these images,

1020
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,349
and even if you are,

1021
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,000
are you fucking serious?

1022
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,123
- This easier to look at?

1023
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:06,000
- Oh, God.

1024
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,147
- It's a bad picture,

1025
00:29:11,187 --> 00:29:11,980
but that's you.

1026
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,349
- Or this?

1027
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:15,000
Is that you?

1028
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,980
- Oh, shit!

1029
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh, my God.

1030
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,980
- Ah, it's a new one.

1031
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,307
- It's different hair,

1032
00:29:22,347 --> 00:29:23,980
but this one taken yesterday

1033
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,980
at Alex Sokolov's workplace,

1034
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,000
it looks a lot like you too.

1035
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,356
- It's okay.

1036
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:32,980
Maybe they can help.

1037
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,980
Who knows?

1038
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,854
If you don't try,

1039
00:29:34,894 --> 00:29:35,980
you'll never find out.

1040
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,535
- I just...

1041
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,980
I went to his workplace...

1042
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,968
- 'Cause I wanted to pay

1043
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:41,980
my respects or something.

1044
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,144
I wasn't thinking.

1045
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:43,980
I don't know.

1046
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,980
D

1047
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,244
I...

1048
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,000
- It's okay, Cassie.

1049
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,324
- Okay, fine, fine, fine.

1050
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,004
I met Alex on the plane, we had

1051
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:54,844
dinner in Bangkok, and then we

1052
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,806
went back to his hotel room.

1053
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:55,980
- Cas.

1054
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,212
- We had sex in his bedroom

1055
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:57,980
and the bathroom.

1056
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,967
We had sex a lot of places,

1057
00:29:59,007 --> 00:29:59,980
and there were little towels

1058
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
that were shaped

1059
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,980
like elephants,

1060
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,452
and a giant infinity pool,

1061
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:03,960
and this hotel waiter came in.

1062
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,112
He gave us very strong liquor.

1063
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:05,980
We got extremely drunk.

1064
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,452
But when I left

1065
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:06,980
the next morning,

1066
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,980
he was very, very alive.

1067
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,135
- I would like to take a moment

1068
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:10,980
with my client, please.

1069
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,980
- What about Miranda?

1070
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,957
- Sorry, there was

1071
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:13,980
someone else there.

1072
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,259
A woman.

1073
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:14,980
Her name was Miranda.

1074
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,980
She was friends with Alex.

1075
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,894
She left early,

1076
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:18,014
but she was there.

1077
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,591
- What else can you tell us

1078
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,651
about this woman?

1079
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,864
- I don't know, because

1080
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:22,980
I can't fucking remember her,

1081
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,011
but she was there,

1082
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:24,980
I am telling you.

1083
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,980
- Cas, stop talking.

1084
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,520
- You have to believe me.

1085
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,980
- Cas!

1086
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,980
Why did you do that?

1087
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,980
- Be where you are.

1088
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,980
Know that it's enough.

1089
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,695
Any anger or frustration

1090
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:36,980
will pass.

1091
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,382
- Why the fuck

1092
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:37,980
did you just do that?

1093
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,887
If you weren't

1094
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:39,980
a suspect before,

1095
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,641
you sure as hell are now.

1096
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:40,980
- Oh, please.

1097
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,218
Please, you know it's me

1098
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:42,980
in the picture.

1099
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,517
They know it's me

1100
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:43,980
in the picture.

1101
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,841
Fuck, people in space

1102
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:45,980
know it's me in the picture.

1103
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,980
- No, they do not!

1104
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,382
We do not know

1105
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:47,980
what they know, babe!

1106
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,980
That's why we were in there.

1107
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,711
- Listen to me.

1108
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:50,980
They probably already have

1109
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,367
my fingerprints

1110
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:51,980
and my fucking lip gloss

1111
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,980
that I left at the crime scene

1112
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,758
when I tried

1113
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:54,980
to clean things up.

1114
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,980
- Know that it's enough.

1115
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,980
Everything passes.

1116
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,945
- Now they just think I'm a

1117
00:30:58,985 --> 00:30:59,980
crazy drunk flight attendant,

1118
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,394
you know?

1119
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:00,980
Not a killer.

1120
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,143
- Okay, well, to them,

1121
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:02,980
you can be both,

1122
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,051
and we're lucky that they even

1123
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:04,980
let you walk out of there.

1124
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,915
Cas, I am watching you make

1125
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:07,815
some really not good decisions.

1126
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,980
What were you thinking?

1127
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,980
- You know what I was thinking?

1128
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,711
I was thinking,

1129
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:11,980
"I hope Alex wasn't awake,

1130
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,858
"and I really hope

1131
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:14,278
he didn't feel anything

1132
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,379
when they came

1133
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:15,980
and slit his throat."

1134
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,347
- Motherfucker.

1135
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:21,000
Cassie!

1136
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,980
- There is only this moment

1137
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,605
as you find the calm

1138
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,000
to appreciate it.

1139
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,980
- Look at her.

1140
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,000
She does not give one shit.

1141
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,611
I mean, you haven't been able

1142
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:37,980
to smoke in a bar

1143
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,980
in, like, 20 years.

1144
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,980
She has seen some things.

1145
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,980
I wanna know what she's seen.

1146
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,980
- No, you don't.

1147
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,441
You got me day drinking.

1148
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:46,980
- I know.

1149
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,633
- All right, when you

1150
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,980
psychotically embraced honesty

1151
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,980
just now with the FBI,

1152
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,457
you didn't mention that

1153
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:54,980
you left the hotel room.

1154
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,980
D

1155
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,382
- I don't even

1156
00:31:57,422 --> 00:31:57,980
really know if I did.

1157
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,980
- Okay, yes, but if you did,

1158
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,441
that could theoretically

1159
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:01,980
have been

1160
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,042
when someone else might've

1161
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:03,980
come in and killed him.

1162
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,980
- Okay, but I...

1163
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,980
d

1164
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,980
If you're right about that,

1165
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,434
about the time

1166
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:12,494
that Alex died...

1167
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,980
That means I was so fucked up

1168
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,980
that I got back into bed

1169
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,000
with a dead man.

1170
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,980
- It's kind of the only thing

1171
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,687
that explains

1172
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:25,980
why you're not dead too.

1173
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,329
- Oh, my God.

1174
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:28,980
That's just sad.

1175
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,980
Like, that's bad, right?

1176
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,064
On a personal level,

1177
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:31,980
that is just bad.

1178
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,980
- You were blackout drunk,

1179
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,980
and that could've... you know,

1180
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,980
it could happen to anyone.

1181
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,393
- No, it couldn't

1182
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:38,980
have happened to anybody.

1183
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,039
This doesn't happen

1184
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:40,980
to anybody, okay?

1185
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,880
I don't want to be this person.

1186
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,040
- If you got in bed with him

1187
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,980
after he was, you know...

1188
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,353
- Dead?

1189
00:32:46,393 --> 00:32:46,980
- Yes, okay.

1190
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,107
If that is in fact

1191
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:48,980
what happened,

1192
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,486
it's a thing that happened,

1193
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:50,980
you know?

1194
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,980
And it doesn't define you.

1195
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,980
- Thank you.

1196
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,980
- You're welcome.

1197
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,218
- I just... why didn't you

1198
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:05,980
take the Fifth?

1199
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,611
I don't get it.

1200
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:06,980
I nodded.

1201
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,019
I know that you saw him, but we

1202
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:08,980
have, like, that whole thing.

1203
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,022
I was like, "I'm gonna nod."

1204
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:10,980
And you were like, "Okay."

1205
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,984
- Okay, listen.

1206
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:12,980
Can I fix this?

1207
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,350
Just... if I had information

1208
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,980
that I could trade with them,

1209
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,003
or I mean, I'm starting

1210
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:19,980
to get these memories,

1211
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,487
so we could back in there,

1212
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:20,980
have another conversation,

1213
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,720
we could figure...

1214
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,980
You need to go back in there.

1215
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,500
- Okay, you need

1216
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:23,980
to simmer down.

1217
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,963
You're doing that thing

1218
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:25,980
where you get obsessive,

1219
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,980
and you spin out.

1220
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,008
- Annie, I have to get

1221
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:28,980
obsessive about this.

1222
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,980
- I am your lawyer.

1223
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,980
I will be obsessive about this.

1224
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,980
I will figure out a strategy.

1225
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,980
You go be a flight attendant,

1226
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,695
go home, pack in your little,

1227
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:39,055
like, Marie Kondo way,

1228
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,980
take your flight to...

1229
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,980
- Rome.

1230
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,907
- There is nothing

1231
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:46,980
that you can do here.

1232
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,000
Do you understand me?

1233
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,284
- Lunch by yourself

1234
00:33:57,324 --> 00:33:58,980
on the street?

1235
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,980
Okay, so you're upset with me.

1236
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,205
- No, Van, I just like

1237
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:02,980
these hot dogs,

1238
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,057
and everything doesn't

1239
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:04,980
revolve around you.

1240
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,360
- Ouch.

1241
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,980
- But since you brought it up,

1242
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,092
I am disappointed

1243
00:34:08,132 --> 00:34:09,980
with your aggressive attitude

1244
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,184
during that interview

1245
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:11,980
and generally.

1246
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,980
- Wait, generally?

1247
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,019
- Slapping down those photos of

1248
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:15,980
Alex Sokolov's bloody corpse?

1249
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,980
Oh, come on.

1250
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,980
- Well, someone seems to like

1251
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,277
my aggressive attitude

1252
00:34:21,317 --> 00:34:21,980
and tactics,

1253
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,512
because I've been here

1254
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:22,980
half as long as you,

1255
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,520
and we have the same job.

1256
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,980
- Is that right?

1257
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,936
- Not to put too fine

1258
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:28,980
a point on it, but yes,

1259
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,980
I think that's right,

1260
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,352
and those pictures rattled

1261
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:34,252
Bowden into changing her story.

1262
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,314
- Okay, real talk?

1263
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:36,980
- Always.

1264
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,980
- I like you, Van,

1265
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,233
but you have to know

1266
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:40,980
that you fit

1267
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,328
the FBI's male, pale,

1268
00:34:42,368 --> 00:34:43,980
and Yale culture to a tee.

1269
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,460
I mean, hell, you probably

1270
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,980
had a lacrosse scholarship.

1271
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:47,980
I mean...

1272
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,000
- And that's all fine for you,

1273
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,980
but I am a Black woman in a job

1274
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,839
that can still feel very much

1275
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,980
like a boys' club.

1276
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,298
So even though I served

1277
00:34:57,338 --> 00:34:57,980
in the Navy,

1278
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,907
even though I have

1279
00:34:58,947 --> 00:34:59,980
an outstanding tenure

1280
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,980
as a federal agent,

1281
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,227
I could never get away

1282
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,980
with the kind of brash bullshit

1283
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,013
that you don't even

1284
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:06,980
think twice about,

1285
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,423
because you don't have

1286
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:09,980
to think twice about it.

1287
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,980
So tell me one more time

1288
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,491
how your attitude

1289
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:16,000
is why we have the same job.

1290
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,980
- I hear you.

1291
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,980
- Good.

1292
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,792
- But I still think

1293
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:25,980
we should've arrested Bowden

1294
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,425
for lying to us

1295
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:26,980
in the first place.

1296
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,422
- Eh, then her attorney

1297
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:28,980
gets into

1298
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,936
getting her statement thrown

1299
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:30,980
out due to diminished capacity.

1300
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,335
No.

1301
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:32,980
- Fair enough.

1302
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,047
I mean, you could definitely

1303
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:34,980
smell the alcohol on her.

1304
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,980
- Why deal with that?

1305
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,143
We have more resources

1306
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:37,980
at our disposal.

1307
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,980
- What are you thinking?

1308
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,980
- Come on.

1309
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,902
You really think

1310
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:15,980
that flying to Rome

1311
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,232
is just gonna magically make

1312
00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:17,980
all this go away?

1313
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,880
- Just stop, okay?

1314
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,980
I have to trust Annie.

1315
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,298
Plus, I've hit

1316
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:23,000
a dead end anyway.

1317
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,831
- Annie doesn't have

1318
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:26,980
all the information you do.

1319
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,299
She wasn't there with you

1320
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:28,980
at Unisphere.

1321
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,574
- Oh, yeah,

1322
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:30,980
because that went so well.

1323
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,987
Will you please just let me

1324
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:32,980
get back to my normal life?

1325
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,538
- Oh, you mean normal

1326
00:36:33,578 --> 00:36:34,598
like the rabbits?

1327
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,006
'Cause I really wanna talk

1328
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:36,980
about the rabbits you saw

1329
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,986
when you were running

1330
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:39,286
out of that building.

1331
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,000
- You saw that?

1332
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,980
Why the fuck can you see that?

1333
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,000
- I mean, I don't know.

1334
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,980
Trauma?

1335
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,652
- No.

1336
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:55,980
It's not...

1337
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,803
No.

1338
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:58,980
I, um...

1339
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,980
I broke a rabbit.

1340
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:01,980
It was a statue.

1341
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,050
This very large,

1342
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,980
expensive statue of a rabbit.

1343
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,929
That's why I was

1344
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:06,980
thinking about it,

1345
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,980
and I probably ruined

1346
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,986
that poor, very nice

1347
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,980
receptionist's week.

1348
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,887
- I'm not sure

1349
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:11,980
how nice she was.

1350
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,980
- No, she was fine.

1351
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,836
She just made, like,

1352
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:15,980
a face when I brought up...

1353
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,980
Miranda.

1354
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,103
Oh, my God, wait, she made

1355
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:24,980
this "kill me now" face

1356
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,642
when I mentioned her.

1357
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:25,980
Oh, my God.

1358
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,980
What was her name?

1359
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,679
What was her name?

1360
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:28,980
Sabrina!

1361
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,341
Sabrina, yes, maybe she

1362
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,061
can help me get out of this.

1363
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,408
- Right.

1364
00:37:33,448 --> 00:37:34,980
Wait, what about your flight?

1365
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,636
- I can do both I think.

1366
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:36,456
I don't know.

1367
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,565
I actually don't know

1368
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:37,980
what I'm doing.

1369
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,980
I think I can do both.

1370
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,980
- Just for the record,

1371
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,985
I still wanna talk

1372
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:41,980
about the rabbits.

1373
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,000
- Fuck off.

1374
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,421
Okay, we have to find

1375
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:45,980
a better way to communicate

1376
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,559
'cause this is not working

1377
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,099
for me.

1378
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,980
D

1379
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,906
- "As ever, I'm loneliness

1380
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:02,980
and ready maybe for weeping,

1381
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,443
or whether perhaps

1382
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:05,980
there's a witness."

1383
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,965
- Okay, trying to concentrate.

1384
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:07,980
I have a flight in three hours,

1385
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,597
and you're quoting poetry

1386
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:09,980
to me?

1387
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,485
Can you try to be

1388
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:10,980
a little helpful?

1389
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,277
- Okay, I also brought these,

1390
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:13,980
you know?

1391
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,935
But I've never been

1392
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:15,980
on a stakeout before,

1393
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,745
so might be a bit overkill.

1394
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:18,980
- Oh, great, great.

1395
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,240
So I'm losing my mind.

1396
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,980
That's great.

1397
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,573
Okay, listen,

1398
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:22,980
that receptionist at Unisphere,

1399
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,857
she knows way more about

1400
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:24,980
Miranda than she's acting like.

1401
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,980
I've gotta talk to her,

1402
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,180
although she probably thinks

1403
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,980
I'm fucking insane,

1404
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,980
because obviously I am.

1405
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,684
- Hey, Davey.

1406
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:39,980
I know I owe you a call.

1407
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,652
I'm sorry.

1408
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:41,980
It's just been nuts.

1409
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,039
- Yeah, sounds like

1410
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,980
your pretty busy.

1411
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,815
- Yep, that's me.

1412
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:45,980
But look, I'm answering.

1413
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:46,980
What's going on?

1414
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,980
- Okay, not to be dramatic,

1415
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,980
but I just had this feeling

1416
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,980
that maybe that this trip

1417
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,980
is a bad idea.

1418
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,234
- Davey, oh, my God,

1419
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:58,980
I'm sorry I missed your call

1420
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,980
or your many, many calls,

1421
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,591
but I've been a little bit

1422
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,651
crazy, all right?

1423
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,480
- It's not about

1424
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,980
the phone calls.

1425
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,980
I mean, I'm OCD,

1426
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,149
and I'm a jerk sometimes,

1427
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:05,980
but I'm not petty.

1428
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,891
- Okay, then what the hell

1429
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:08,980
is the problem?

1430
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,012
- It's just,

1431
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,980
we're not kids anymore.

1432
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,980
It just seems like you...

1433
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,980
Not you, but your lifestyle,

1434
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,980
just might be

1435
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,462
a little too intense for us.

1436
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,980
D

1437
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,296
- You know,

1438
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:23,980
maybe you're being nice,

1439
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,678
which is making things

1440
00:40:25,718 --> 00:40:26,980
a little unclear.

1441
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,931
- How many drinks

1442
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:28,980
have you had today?

1443
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,980
- Oh, that's more direct.

1444
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,516
- Bet it's more than three.

1445
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:32,980
- I...

1446
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,980
- More than four?

1447
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,980
Am I wrong?

1448
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm not?

1449
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,980
Are you okay?

1450
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,980
Because I need to know

1451
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,980
before you are around my girls.

1452
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,980
- Yes.

1453
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes, of course I'm okay.

1454
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,980
Just come to New York.

1455
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,980
Bring your beautiful family,

1456
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,980
and I will be present

1457
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,980
and alert,

1458
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,980
and it is gonna be fine.

1459
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,062
It's gonna more than fine.

1460
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,980
It's gonna be fantastic.

1461
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,980
- Okay.

1462
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,000
- Okay, good.

1463
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,980
I love you.

1464
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,000
- Love you too.

1465
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,599
- Listen, I'm gonna see you

1466
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,980
in a couple days, okay?

1467
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,786
I promise you,

1468
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:25,980
it's gonna be amazing

1469
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,980
for all of us.

1470
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,259
- Okay.

1471
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:30,000
Bye.

1472
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,960
- Vodka on the rocks, please?

1473
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,980
Thank you.

1474
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,651
Hi.

1475
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:48,980
- Hey.

1476
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,980
- Sabrina, right?

1477
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,588
I came in the office

1478
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:51,980
the other day

1479
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,176
and like, broke everything.

1480
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:54,980
That's me.

1481
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,164
- Oh, yeah.

1482
00:41:56,204 --> 00:41:57,980
- I just wanted...

1483
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,987
- Yeah, I'm sorry, we can't

1484
00:41:59,027 --> 00:41:59,980
answer questions about work

1485
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,980
if that's what you're here for.

1486
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,340
- Oh, okay.

1487
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:02,980
No, no, that's okay.

1488
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,422
Well, can you just wait

1489
00:42:04,462 --> 00:42:04,980
a second?

1490
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,554
Can I explain myself

1491
00:42:05,594 --> 00:42:05,980
for one second?

1492
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,652
- I can't say anything

1493
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:06,980
about work.

1494
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,030
- I totally understand.

1495
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,980
I saw you walking in.

1496
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,135
I wanted to come in

1497
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:10,980
and apologize.

1498
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,980
Please, just one second?

1499
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,605
- Sure, yeah.

1500
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,786
- Okay, I left

1501
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:16,980
in an emotional huff.

1502
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,485
I'm so embarrassed,

1503
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:18,665
but they mentioned,

1504
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,881
you know, they said that

1505
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:20,980
Alex had died out of nowhere,

1506
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,000
and it was a horrible moment,

1507
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,667
and I'm sorry

1508
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:25,980
if it got you in trouble,

1509
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,596
or I wanted

1510
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:27,980
to maybe buy you a drink.

1511
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,849
- Alex was so great.

1512
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:31,980
His death was a real blow.

1513
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,446
- Yes.

1514
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:33,980
- I understand that.

1515
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,562
- Look, could we... how 'bout we,

1516
00:42:35,602 --> 00:42:37,282
like, cheers to Alex, maybe?

1517
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:38,980
Sure.

1518
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,801
- Cheers.

1519
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:40,980
- Okay, good.

1520
00:42:43,692 --> 00:42:43,980
Oh, your...

1521
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,980
Do you need to get that?

1522
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,980
- Nope.

1523
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,740
Hey, it's Cassie.

1524
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,980
I'll probably call you back.

1525
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:00,980
You're 15 minutes late, Mason.

1526
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,063
- Shit, Mrs. Briscoe.

1527
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:02,980
We had a customer.

1528
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,980
What can I do?

1529
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,887
- Don't swear.

1530
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:05,980
Do you have them?

1531
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,092
- Yeah.

1532
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:08,980
Don't worry.

1533
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,967
None of these flash drives

1534
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:10,980
got scanned into inventory.

1535
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,219
Guess they "got lost"

1536
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:12,980
or something.

1537
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,484
- Nice.

1538
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,000
What are these again?

1539
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,046
- They're drugs.

1540
00:43:20,086 --> 00:43:21,980
I don't know, just take them.

1541
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,487
Find out.

1542
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:22,980
Have fun.

1543
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,107
Oh, but don't take them

1544
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:24,980
all at once, okay?

1545
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,792
Because if you die,

1546
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:27,512
your mother's gonna kill me,

1547
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,869
and I don't want a double

1548
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:29,980
funeral with a boy named Mason.

1549
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,840
- That's really dark,

1550
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,980
Mrs. Briscoe.

1551
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Fucking kid.

1552
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,540
- Cheers.

1553
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:43,980
Cheers.

1554
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,282
- Oh, sorry,

1555
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:44,980
I just spilled all over you.

1556
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,183
- Oh, that was me.

1557
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:46,980
That was me.

1558
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,980
- No, it's me.

1559
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,045
- What was I talking about?

1560
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:49,980
- We are talking about...

1561
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,245
- Oh, yeah.

1562
00:43:50,285 --> 00:43:50,980
I was talking about the rabbit.

1563
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,430
- Oh, my God.

1564
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:52,980
Yeah.

1565
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,263
- They keep

1566
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:53,980
that rabbit sculpture there,

1567
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,959
but no one will admit

1568
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:55,980
it's a goddamn rabbit.

1569
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,948
- Oh, my God, I broke it.

1570
00:43:56,988 --> 00:43:57,980
- I'm so glad you broke it.

1571
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,301
- That was so embarrassing.

1572
00:43:59,341 --> 00:43:59,980
- Oh, my gosh.

1573
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,980
They're the worst there,

1574
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,980
oh, but Alex is really nice.

1575
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,980
- Hey, you know,

1576
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,980
about Alex actually.

1577
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,572
Never mind, I don't want

1578
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:09,980
to upset you more

1579
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,697
than you are about that, so...

1580
00:44:11,737 --> 00:44:11,980
- Oh.

1581
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,980
Oh, no, Alessandra.

1582
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,605
You're great.

1583
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,307
You can ask me anything.

1584
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:17,980
Ask me.

1585
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,980
- Okay, okay.

1586
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,007
Do you remember

1587
00:44:21,047 --> 00:44:22,980
I mentioned a Miranda to you,

1588
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,210
and your face went,

1589
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:24,980
like, crazy?

1590
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,980
- Ugh, Miranda Croft?

1591
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,428
- Who?

1592
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:27,980
- Ugh, Miranda Croft.

1593
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,391
Oh, my God.

1594
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:28,980
She's the worst.

1595
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:29,980
I hate her.

1596
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,280
Sorry if she's, like,

1597
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,980
your best friend or anything.

1598
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,685
- What?

1599
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:33,980
No.

1600
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,565
No, no, no, I actually

1601
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:34,980
barely know her,

1602
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,013
but do you know her

1603
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:36,980
really well, or...

1604
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,980
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1605
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,233
I used to cover

1606
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:40,980
Alex's desk sometimes

1607
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,880
and then Miranda would call in.

1608
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,921
I cannot believe

1609
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:45,041
he was dating her.

1610
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,453
- Were you dating

1611
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:46,980
this Miranda person

1612
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,770
while we were in Bangkok?

1613
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,980
- Sounds like it.

1614
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:50,980
Oh, jeez.

1615
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,261
I really don't want you

1616
00:44:52,301 --> 00:44:52,980
to be a liar.

1617
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,105
Wow, you know, I didn't know

1618
00:44:56,145 --> 00:44:56,980
he was seeing someone.

1619
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,072
- Mm-hmm, I pick up

1620
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:58,980
on those things.

1621
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,167
- Oh.

1622
00:44:59,207 --> 00:44:59,980
- I'm smart like that.

1623
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,000
- Oh.

1624
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,467
- And I eavesdrop

1625
00:45:02,507 --> 00:45:02,980
on a lot of calls.

1626
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,980
- Oh.

1627
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,900
- But anyway, I think

1628
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,980
he broke it off recently.

1629
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,980
- There it is.

1630
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,483
See?

1631
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:11,980
That's good.

1632
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,920
- Oh, yeah, no,

1633
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,980
that makes sense.

1634
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,634
Right, that definitely

1635
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:14,980
makes sense.

1636
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,957
- Oh, oh, but when

1637
00:45:15,997 --> 00:45:16,980
they were together,

1638
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,550
she would call in, like,

1639
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,980
screaming, volatile...

1640
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,897
- What?

1641
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:22,980
- She's violent.

1642
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:23,730
- You must be exaggerating

1643
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:23,980
a little.

1644
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,774
She must have

1645
00:45:24,814 --> 00:45:25,980
some good qualities.

1646
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,635
Tell me more.

1647
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:27,175
- Okay.

1648
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,298
I'm not saying stalker,

1649
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:29,980
but stalker.

1650
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,980
- Oh, my God.

1651
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,394
- Sounds like Miranda's

1652
00:45:35,434 --> 00:45:36,980
not gonna be very helpful.

1653
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,980
I mean, it sounds like...

1654
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,980
- She killed you.

1654
00:45:45,305 --> 00:46:45,360

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,205
- Okay,

3
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:17,980
what was her name again?

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,980
- Miranda Croft.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,841
Ugh, I Googled it,

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:21,980
but that name has, like,

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,980
23 million hits alone.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,533
I have Google alerts set up for

9
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:26,980
Alexander Sokolov, Unisphere.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,291
- That's not gonna be, like,

11
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:28,980
a huge red flag

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,011
if anyone ever checks

13
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:30,980
your search history.

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,483
Okay, look,

15
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:31,980
all we need

16
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,832
is for this receptionist

17
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:34,980
at Unisphere...

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,980
- Sabrina.

19
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,472
- To tell the FBI

20
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:36,980
what she told you.

21
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,980
- Okay, well, what can I do?

22
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,632
- Please, please, just let me

23
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:40,980
be the lawyer now, okay?

24
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,980
I will talk to Sabrina,

25
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,985
and then we will go

26
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:43,980
to the FBI together

27
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,017
with this Miranda information.

28
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:45,980
- Move, move out of the way.

29
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,703
- By the time

30
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:47,980
you get back from Rome,

31
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,432
things might look

32
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:48,980
very different, okay?

33
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,336
- All right, thank you.

34
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:50,980
I love you.

35
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,627
- So I begged the pilot

36
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,980
to climb to 40,000,

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,609
because that is what

38
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:17,980
she's doing.

39
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,985
Like...

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,980
- Wow, that was a fun reaction.

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,980
So are you planning on doing

42
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,210
the initial descent

43
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,980
announcement

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,980
sometime before we land?

45
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,771
- Okay, you know what?

46
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:53,980
This...

47
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,671
I'm the one

48
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,980
who's annoyed at you.

49
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,399
Let's not forget that, Megan.

50
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,980
- Oh, right.

51
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,283
You mean when I called you

52
00:02:59,323 --> 00:02:59,980
out of concern

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,008
and you lamented about

54
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:01,980
your theoretical life

55
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,566
spiraling into some crazy shit

56
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:04,980
and then you hung up on me?

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, I forgot all about that.

58
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
- Why'd you turn

59
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,980
the lights off?

60
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,201
I just got an alert

61
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,980
about your memorial service.

62
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,304
- It's at your family's house

63
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:48,980
in Westchester.

64
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,980
It just feels so sad.

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,980
- Well, people gotta grieve.

66
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,366
You can turn the lamp off again

67
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:56,980
if that helps.

68
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,980
I don't mind.

69
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:03,980
- Cassie!

70
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,980
- Yeah?

71
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,188
- What time are we going

72
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:06,980
to la discoteca?

73
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,027
'Cause we are definitely

74
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,387
going to la discoteca.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,645
- Ooh, yes.

76
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:11,980
- Guys, you know what?

77
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,980
I'm not gonna go out tonight.

78
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,469
I'm a little bit tired.

79
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,980
I just...

80
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,572
- Wait, what are you

81
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:15,980
talking about?

82
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,512
This is Rome. We are in Rome!

83
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,003
- This new trend of you

84
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:19,980
not going out is poor.

85
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,399
You are trending poorly,

86
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:21,980
my friend.

87
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,980
- I don't blame you.

88
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,401
I'm just gonna drop

89
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:23,980
something off with a friend

90
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,980
and then grab some dinner.

91
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,523
- Sorry, do you have

92
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:26,980
a friend in Rome?

93
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,880
- That's none of your business.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,530
So, Cassie, since you're

95
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:29,980
not going with Shane

96
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,152
to that noisy, sweaty

97
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:31,980
la discoteca...

98
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,980
- Oh, my God, it's amazing

99
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,011
how lame it sounds

100
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:34,980
when she says it.

101
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,461
- All right, guys,

102
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:35,980
seriously, have fun.

103
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,344
I just really wanna

104
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:39,000
be alone tonight, okay?

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,711
[soft music playing

106
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,980
- Cassie.

107
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,980
Mamma mia.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,460
- The usual, yes?

109
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,980
- Yes.

110
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,000
- Of course.

111
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,314
I didn't think

112
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:37,980
you'd be in Rome this month.

113
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,980
I usually get at least a text.

114
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,203
- I know; I was... I should have,

115
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,980
but I've been really busy

116
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,000
and very distracted and...

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,980
But I'm here now.

118
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,172
I was thinking maybe you could

119
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:52,980
walk me back to my hotel.

120
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,452
You know, like,

121
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:53,980
the "friend" part

122
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
of "friends with benefits."

123
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,326
- You know,

124
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:56,980
adults can be friends

125
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,880
and sleep together

126
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,980
without the cute name.

127
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,980
- Cassie?

128
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,089
Cassie, you said

129
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:02,980
that you were

130
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,527
staying in tonight,

131
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:05,980
you big, fat liar.

132
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,980
- Hi.

133
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,159
- Who's your friend?

134
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,980
- Best friend.

135
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,980
Megan Briscoe,

136
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,757
and this is my second glass

137
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:11,980
of wine.

138
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,980
Actually, it's my third.

139
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,522
- That is quite a large glass.

140
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,980
- Pleasure to meet you, Megan.

141
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,980
- Yes, thank you, it's...

142
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,980
Oh, okay.

143
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,723
Oh, this...

144
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:21,980
I'm interrupting.

145
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,378
- No, it's fine.

146
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:28,980
- Okay.

147
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,431
It's kind of good, 'cause I

148
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,980
wanted to talk to you anyway.

149
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,000
Cassie.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,874
Cassie, I know you would be

151
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,980
surprised to hear this, but...

152
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,810
I don't have

153
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,000
a lot of friends.

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,439
- Wow, I'm surprised

155
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:44,980
to hear you say that.

156
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,916
- Yeah, so I don't want you

157
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:47,980
to be mad at me

158
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,980
over this FBI thing, you know?

159
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,698
- Yeah, you know, that...

160
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:53,980
That wasn't great.

161
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,378
- And I'm so sorry.

162
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:56,980
It won't happen again.

163
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,980
I promise you.

164
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,843
And the calls...

165
00:06:59,883 --> 00:07:01,083
I know I call a lot.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,870
- It's okay.

167
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,980
- No, it's not.

168
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,980
I just... I want you to know

169
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,404
that I'm here for you,

170
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:08,000
you know?

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,836
You're so glamorous,

172
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,980
and I'm just...

173
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,538
Just want more than Oyster Bay,

174
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:19,118
you know?

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,355
- Okay, first of all,

176
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:23,980
I am not glamorous, okay?

177
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,985
Yeah.

178
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:25,980
Anyway, I'm sorry.

179
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,895
It's just, I've been keeping

180
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:28,980
so many secrets.

181
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,980
It's good to talk to somebody

182
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,980
about other things, you know?

183
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,980
- What do you mean, secrets?

184
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,980
- You are so bellissima.

185
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,980
- Sabrina Oznowich?

186
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,460
Hi, I'm Annie Mouradian.

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,332
I'm a lawyer

188
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:50,980
with Davis & Carlisle.

189
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,980
- Oh, good for you.

190
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,127
Sorry, I really need

191
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:53,980
to get to home.

192
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,980
- No, yeah... no, of course.

193
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,502
Look, I just have

194
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:55,980
a quick question

195
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,609
about a conversation

196
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:56,980
that you had

197
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,899
with Alessandra Ricci

198
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:59,980
over drinks.

199
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,980
- I don't know her.

200
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,980
She looks fun, though,

201
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,233
in, like, a sorority

202
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:03,980
kind of way.

203
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,233
- It's an oddly keen

204
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,000
observation.

205
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,614
Look, when you guys

206
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:07,980
had drinks,

207
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,056
did you discuss a woman

208
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:09,980
named Miranda Croft?

209
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,365
- But I just said

210
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:12,980
a couple seconds ago

211
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,980
that we didn't get drinks.

212
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,980
- Right, yeah, you said that.

213
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,951
Look, Sabrina,

214
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:19,980
you seem sweet.

215
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,980
Um...

216
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,801
it's a very bad idea

217
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,000
to lie to me.

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,244
- Wait, I mean...

219
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:30,980
I mean, I do know her.

220
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,233
I mean, she had

221
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:33,980
an emotional meltdown

222
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,561
and broke

223
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,980
an extremely important

224
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,980
piece of art in the office.

225
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,340
But I never

226
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,980
had drinks with her,

227
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,988
and I don't know this...

228
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:44,000
Miranda.

229
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Is there anything else?

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Cool, okay.

231
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:02,980
I don't know.

232
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,677
- Ooh!

233
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,338
- Thank you

234
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:08,980
for walking us back.

235
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,980
- Hey, it's the hotel.

236
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,103
Oh, this is so much better

237
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:14,980
than the opera, Cassie.

238
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,955
- I think you're

239
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:16,980
a little drunk-y.

240
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,980
- I can be drunk.

241
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,585
You have no idea

242
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,980
what I can be.

243
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:22,980
- No.

244
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,986
Lovely, behaved woman,

245
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:27,000
take your butt to bed.

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,980
Bye.

247
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,401
Ciao.

248
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:29,980
- Ciao.

249
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,000
- Ciao!

250
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,593
Ciao. Okay.

251
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:32,980
- Ciao.

252
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,980
Be careful.

253
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,940
- I got it.

254
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
Buona notte!

255
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,457
- I guess Megan kind of

256
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,980
hijacked our night, huh?

257
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,000
- Oh, yes.

258
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,953
- Although I think

259
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:46,133
it might be better.

260
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,980
- Better for your best friend?

261
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,049
- Okay, she's not

262
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,000
my best friend.

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Never mind.

264
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,980
Hey.

265
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,980
You know...

266
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,938
I thought I was in a place

267
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,000
where we would

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,570
do what we normally do,

269
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,000
but...

270
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know.

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,980
I guess I met someone.

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,980
- You are a fun, kind,

273
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,980
and... beautiful woman.

274
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,905
It had to happen one day.

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Cassie, I'm...

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,980
Ciao.

277
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,699
- Any siblings?

278
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:05,980
- Yes.

279
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,319
Older brother.

280
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:07,980
- Nice.

281
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,502
- Lives in Denver

282
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,502
with his family.

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,383
- Denver, huh.

284
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:11,980
- You?

285
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,980
- Only child.

286
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,980
Don't say you can tell.

287
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,159
Everyone always says

288
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:16,980
they can tell.

289
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,305
I hate it.

290
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:17,980
- No, no, no, no, no.

291
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,515
I just think you act the way

292
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,980
you do because you're rich.

293
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,980
- What?

294
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,283
- I would never say that

295
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:23,980
to your face.

296
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,980
That would be so rude.

297
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,980
- I wish that I had siblings,

298
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,579
someone else for my mother

299
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:29,980
to focus her energy on.

300
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,413
Would've been great.

301
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,890
- Yeah, she's...

302
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,980
She's controlling.

303
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,902
- God, she hated

304
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:37,980
my last girlfriend.

305
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,735
- I'm sorry,

306
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,980
is that a challenge,

307
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,745
or you just dropping a hint

308
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,000
that you're single?

309
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,400
- What is it about you?

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,761
- I was thinking

311
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,980
the same thing about you.

312
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,980
Also, I'd own your mom.

313
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,601
Annie, hi.

314
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,980
I know you're working.

315
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,243
I'm home. Rome was so weird

316
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:15,980
and frustrating.

317
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,704
Can you please

318
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:17,980
call me back immediately?

319
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,699
I've gotta know

320
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,980
what's going on with the...

321
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,000
Miranda thing, okay?

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,980
Love you. Bye.

323
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,000
Hello?

324
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,980
Who are you?

325
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,548
What are you doing

326
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:23,980
in the shower?

327
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,980
Where's Annie?

328
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,980
- She's getting fresh bagels.

329
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,052
I'm Max.

330
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:27,980
- Okay.

331
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,980
- I'm Annie's boyfriend, Max.

332
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,980
I'm not usually this naked.

333
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,152
You're Cassie, right?

334
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:34,980
- Yeah, but no,

335
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,985
Annie doesn't have

336
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:36,980
a boyfriend, so...

337
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,470
- Right,

338
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,980
because of her weird rule

339
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,920
about no labels

340
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,980
in relationships?

341
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,111
- No, she just doesn't

342
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:42,980
have a boyfriend.

343
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,375
- She does;

344
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:43,980
she helped me out

345
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,900
with some, like, legal issues,

346
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,980
and we got close.

347
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,980
- I'm so... legal issues, what?

348
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,930
- I'm good with technology,

349
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,980
and rich people are kind of...

350
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,980
not.

351
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,849
Generally extortion.

352
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:54,980
You staying for breakfast?

353
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,373
'Cause she's only getting

354
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:56,980
two bagels.

355
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,655
- Okay, I am so confused

356
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:57,980
by what is...

357
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,842
- Okay, they didn't have chive,

358
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:00,980
but I got scallion,

359
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,000
which is, like, basically...

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,980
What happened?

361
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,617
- Well, I just met

362
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:08,980
your naked boyfriend, Max.

363
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,596
- Yeah, no,

364
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:10,980
I don't have a boyfriend.

365
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,980
- Oh, okay, yeah, sure.

366
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,984
- Label thing.

367
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:14,000
What can I do?

368
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,301
- Okay, listen, I'm in

369
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:18,980
major crisis mode right now,

370
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,665
but I do need to circle back

371
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:19,980
and ask about

372
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,098
this mysterious boyfriend

373
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:21,980
I've never heard of.

374
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,446
- Yeah, that's Max.

375
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:23,980
- Yeah.

376
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,462
- He... he's not my boyfriend,

377
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:25,980
and that...

378
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,480
I feel like that kind of

379
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:26,980
wraps up that discussion.

380
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,081
Now, can you just

381
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:28,980
tell me, like,

382
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,416
what is going on

383
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:29,980
and why are you here?

384
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,046
- Listen, when I got back

385
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:31,980
to my apartment today,

386
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,980
my door was open.

387
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,289
- Cas, I told you not to leave

388
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:34,980
that fucking key

389
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,825
above your doorway.

390
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:36,980
- No, this is not related.

391
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,480
That's just my hide-a-key.

392
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:37,980
No one knows where that is.

393
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,336
- It is 0% a hidden key

394
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:39,980
when, like,

395
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,474
half of Lower Manhattan

396
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:40,980
knows where it is, so...

397
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,967
- Okay, I am fucking serious.

398
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:43,980
This was scary.

399
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,955
Someone rummaged

400
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:45,980
through my stuff.

401
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,609
Okay, things were moved

402
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:47,489
just a little,

403
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,980
but I could tell that it was...

404
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,961
- Wait, so someone, like,

405
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:50,980
broke into your apartment?

406
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,335
- Yes.

407
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,980
Listen, could it be Miranda?

408
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,980
I know that sounds insane,

409
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,367
but could she have

410
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:55,980
followed me here from Bangkok

411
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,045
and she's trying to send me

412
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:57,980
some terrifying message?

413
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,852
- Who's Miranda?

414
00:14:58,892 --> 00:14:59,980
Is that your stalker?

415
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,510
- Yeah, shutting it down

416
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,980
back there. Thank you.

417
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,699
- Okay, listen.

418
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:02,980
Have you spoken to Sabrina?

419
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,452
I need to know,

420
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:03,980
because her story

421
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,299
is gonna start getting me

422
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:05,980
off the hook.

423
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,961
- So Sabrina claims

424
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:07,980
that she's literally

425
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,587
never heard of anyone

426
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:08,980
named Miranda.

427
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,151
- What?

428
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,980
Oh, my God.

429
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,353
No way.

430
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:12,980
She's lying!

431
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,980
Look, you gotta call the FBI.

432
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,678
They need to question her

433
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:15,980
about this.

434
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,064
She has to tell them

435
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:17,980
the truth, right?

436
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,980
- Van White.

437
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,042
- This is Annie Mouradian,

438
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:25,980
Cassie Bowden's lawyer.

439
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,369
- Yeah?

440
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,980
- We believe Sabrina Oznowich

441
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,033
from Unisphere Capital

442
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:29,980
has some information

443
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,980
about this Miranda woman

444
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,097
and her relationship

445
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:32,980
to Alex Sokolov.

446
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,310
- Oh, we spoke to Ms. Oznowich.

447
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:34,980
Nothing of note.

448
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,748
Certainly nothing about

449
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:38,980
this supposed Miranda person.

450
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,362
But if I was

451
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:39,980
Ms. Bowden's lawyer,

452
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,247
I'd be scrambling for

453
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,027
alternative theories now too.

454
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,513
- Can you hold on

455
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:44,980
for just a sec?

456
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,936
- Are you kidding me?

457
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,356
That's not really how...

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,473
- What... what are they saying?

459
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:49,980
- Nothing.

460
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,875
- Annie.

461
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:51,980
- Shut up.

462
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,897
- Kendrick.

463
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:00,000
- It's Annie.

464
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,903
What's the latest on the

465
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:02,980
Sokolov Bangkok murder case?

466
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,044
- Annie, you can't

467
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:06,980
just call me up.

468
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,573
- Does your cousin's tenuous

469
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:09,980
drug-related legal charge

470
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,703
still require

471
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:11,980
a lawyer, though, or...

472
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,634
- Bangkok PD

473
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,980
found a shattered bottle.

474
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,285
They think

475
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:17,980
it's the murder weapon.

476
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,980
They're gonna reconstruct it,

477
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,541
see if they can

478
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:19,980
pull prints.

479
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,980
- We'll get back to you.

480
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,623
- Hey.

481
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:34,000
What?

482
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,980
- Um...

483
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,131
so they think they found

484
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:38,980
the murder weapon.

485
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,980
- Oh, my God.

486
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,980
The bottle, of course.

487
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,389
Of course they found the...

488
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:43,980
Oh, my God.

489
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,174
Shit.

490
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:44,980
I've seen "Dateline."

491
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,187
They zero in on one person.

492
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:46,980
That person is me.

493
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,785
I'm going to jail.

494
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:48,980
- You're not going to jail.

495
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,276
- Yes, I am.

496
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:49,980
I'm definitely going to jail.

497
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,224
- You're not gonna

498
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:51,980
go to jail.

499
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,483
Um...

500
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:55,000
stop watching "Dateline."

501
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,839
Look, I'm gonna

502
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,980
report the break-in,

503
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,798
and we'll see

504
00:16:58,838 --> 00:16:59,980
where that gets us.

505
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,980
And, um...

506
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,452
you're gonna stay here

507
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:03,980
for a little bit, okay?

508
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,395
Just to be safe.

509
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:06,980
- Okay, thank you.

510
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,135
- Look, I'm gonna...

511
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:08,980
I'm just gon...

512
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,908
I'm gonna look into

513
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:10,980
Miranda and Unisphere,

514
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,565
and I'm just gonna

515
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:11,980
keep digging.

516
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,000
And, um, it's...

517
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,980
It's gonna be fine.

518
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,706
- Annie's trying,

519
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:26,980
but no one's gonna believe me.

520
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,324
I am so fucked.

521
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:28,960
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

522
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,980
Stop this. Stop this.

523
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,380
You can still

524
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:30,980
find Miranda, right?

525
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,910
But it's just gotten

526
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,980
a bit more complicated.

527
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,193
- Okay, but why is Sabrina

528
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:34,980
acting like this?

529
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,772
If you dated her,

530
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:36,980
then someone has to know...

531
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,980
Okay, check this out.

532
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,980
- I wish that I had siblings,

533
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,579
someone else for my mother

534
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:46,980
to focus her energy on.

535
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,699
Would've been great.

536
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,821
- Yeah, she's controlling.

537
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,354
- God, she hated

538
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,980
my last girlfriend.

539
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,535
So my dating life

540
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:53,980
was difficult.

541
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,079
Thanks for the reminder.

542
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:55,980
How is this helping?

543
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,430
- Okay, if your last girlfriend

544
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:57,980
was Miranda,

545
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,886
that means your mom

546
00:17:58,926 --> 00:17:59,980
can confirm she's real.

547
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,135
- How are you gonna

548
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:01,980
get to my mom?

549
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,076
- Hey.

550
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:05,980
- Hi.

551
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,549
- Thank you for coming

552
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:06,980
such last-minute.

553
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,980
You look fantastic.

554
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,212
- I think emotional support

555
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:09,980
looks good on me.

556
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,318
- It does.

557
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:11,980
Here.

558
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,618
- Should we talk about the hat?

559
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:13,980
- What?

560
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,980
- It's a net.

561
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,378
- Just trying to be respectful

562
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:16,980
or something.

563
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,980
- How did your friend die?

564
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,980
- Um, I...

565
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,486
he...

566
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,980
I'm not supposed to ask that.

567
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,429
- It's okay.

568
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:29,369
- I'm so sorry.

569
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,582
I've actually never been

570
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:31,582
to one of these,

571
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,980
so that's new territory for me.

572
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,873
- It's okay.

573
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:35,980
You're perfect.

574
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,980
Thank you for coming with me.

575
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,539
- Of course.

576
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:38,980
- That's all that matters. Th...

577
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,980
Sorry, one second.

578
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,980
- Buckley?

579
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,444
Hey.

580
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:49,980
- Hey, how's it going?

581
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,502
- Yeah, you know,

582
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:50,980
I don't remember

583
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,828
putting your number

584
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:53,980
in my phone.

585
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,980
- I did it.

586
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,980
I mean, you asked me to

587
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,980
at the bar the other night.

588
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,586
- Okay, yeah,

589
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,980
that sounds like me, actually.

590
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:00,980
- Cool.

591
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,135
Look, so I just was wondering

592
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,980
if you maybe wanted to...

593
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,916
meet up at some point today

594
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:07,980
if you're free.

595
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,980
- You know, I'd love to,

596
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,795
but I have

597
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,980
a training session at work.

598
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,420
Like, water landings and stuff.

599
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,980
It's a whole ordeal.

600
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,739
Can we rain check on that idea?

601
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:18,980
- Yeah, yeah, totally.

602
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,870
Just don't drown

603
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,980
or anything, okay?

604
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,980
- Ha-ha.

605
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:25,980
Bye.

606
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,602
- Well, I'd love to know more

607
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:28,980
about the water landings.

608
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,980
Look, he's super sweet.

609
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,441
I just don't wanna get...

610
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:32,980
Whatever.

611
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,434
Don't judge me today.

612
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,000
I can't.

613
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,531
- Well, should we

614
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:36,980
catch a train?

615
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,206
- Let's go.

616
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:38,980
- Okay.

617
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,980
Are there boys on the train?

618
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,226
[soft pop music playing

619
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,980
- Julian?

620
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,980
- Excuse me.

621
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,980
Excuse me.

622
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,770
Hi, a lot of these people

623
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,980
came in after me.

624
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,933
Is my drink ready?

625
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:54,980
- What was the name?

626
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,980
- Megan.

627
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,341
- Are you sure

628
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:59,000
it's not Mel Ann?

629
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,980
- Thank you.

630
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,860
- Always a pleasure to see you.

631
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,980
- Same here.

632
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,985
I'm sorry.

633
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,980
This is so exciting.

634
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,980
Corporate espionage.

635
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:24,980
- I know. Shh.

636
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,498
- Now, did you get

637
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,558
the flash drives?

638
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,949
- I did indeed.

639
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:28,980
All untraceable.

640
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,201
Well, untraceable

641
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:31,980
for Long Island, that is.

642
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,980
- Wonderful.

643
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,944
So you'll just download

644
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:34,980
the files we've requested

645
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,980
off your husband's computer

646
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,156
and pass the flash drive

647
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,216
along to Mr. Hak.

648
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,986
Well, why can't I just

649
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,980
hand them over to you?

650
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,861
- Well, that's

651
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:52,980
a beautiful idiom,

652
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,980
but it's not an answer.

653
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,980
- Are you having reservations?

654
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,906
It is a shame the way that

655
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:00,980
company treats your husband.

656
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,753
They just don't

657
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,980
appreciate him, do they?

658
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,288
- Mr. Ro, I don't have

659
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:08,980
any issues with...

660
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,083
borrowing files

661
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:11,980
from my husband's company.

662
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,519
I mean, it's just a facial

663
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,980
recognition thing, right?

664
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,063
I mean, it's not like

665
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:16,980
it's a big secret.

666
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,985
I just don't think

667
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:18,980
I can do it today.

668
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,825
- No, don't do that

669
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:20,980
to yourself, Mrs. Briscoe.

670
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,980
You are more than capable.

671
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,754
- Are you sure that no one

672
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:29,980
is going to find out?

673
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,000
- Absolutely.

674
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,921
What's the worst

675
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:33,980
that could happen?

676
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,049
If somehow things

677
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:35,980
did get sticky,

678
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,320
my company in Seoul will

679
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,980
step in and help your husband,

680
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,980
your entire family.

681
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,749
Because you are

682
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:43,980
very special to us.

683
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,000
- Thank you.

684
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,620
You know what I'm gonna do?

685
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,980
I am going to text my husband

686
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,770
and ask him to bring home

687
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,980
his work computer

688
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,008
so I can bid on a jadeite piece

689
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:57,980
for my kitchen.

690
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,980
That will definitely work.

691
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,980
- Fuck!

692
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,815
- Uh-oh, what did

693
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,295
the bad computer do now?

694
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,279
- Looking into Alex Sokolov

695
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,980
and Unisphere and...

696
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,820
I mean, the place is fucking...

697
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,980
It's squeaky-clean.

698
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,574
It's, like,

699
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:13,980
"save the dolphins" clean.

700
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,957
The scrubbed image

701
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:15,980
is fucking suspect.

702
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,893
I mean, there's only

703
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:17,980
so much that I can find.

704
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,203
You know, legally speaking,

705
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:22,980
so...

706
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,980
Yeah.

707
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,980
That sounds hard for you.

708
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,446
That's really hard.

709
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:29,980
- Yeah.

710
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,980
- Maybe you need a massage.

711
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,716
- I'm not flirting with you

712
00:22:32,756 --> 00:22:33,356
right now.

713
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,529
- But if you were flirting,

714
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:34,980
we'd both be flirting.

715
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,980
- I'm talking about hacking.

716
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,824
I'm talking about hacking,

717
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:37,364
okay?

718
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,288
- Which I obviously

719
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:42,980
cannot condone

720
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,113
or even, you know,

721
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:45,980
know anything about because...

722
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,170
Hypothetically,

723
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,980
if I were to, you know,

724
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,880
just accidentally drop this

725
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,980
piece of paper on the floor...

726
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,095
- Then you'd be

727
00:22:55,135 --> 00:22:56,000
a litterbug.

728
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,980
It's not okay.

729
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,226
- So if you,

730
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:00,980
obviously without

731
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,686
my knowledge

732
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:02,980
or express permission,

733
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,501
hypothetically were to then,

734
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:04,980
you know,

735
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,516
pick it up and look into

736
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:07,980
what was written on it,

737
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,000
how long would that take?

738
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,980
- Probably 20 minutes.

739
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:16,980
Okay, okay, yeah, sure.

740
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,000
Cool, cool, cool.

741
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,679
- What?

742
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,980
- It's weird.

743
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,038
That guy was just on the train

744
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:41,698
with us, and now he's here.

745
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,415
- Well, we were just on

746
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:42,980
the train, and now we're here,

747
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,237
so how is that weird?

748
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,092
- Also, he wants me,

749
00:23:50,132 --> 00:23:50,980
so there's that.

750
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,980
- Are you fucking kidding me?

751
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,156
Who goes to the memorial

752
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:54,980
service for a guy

753
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,582
they slept with one time

754
00:23:56,622 --> 00:23:57,980
in a foreign country?

755
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,980
Kim, when you hear galloping,

756
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,000
you think horses, not zebras.

757
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,929
- Why would you think that's

758
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:05,980
a thing to say to me right now?

759
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,573
- 'Cause sometimes the right

760
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,980
answer is the obvious one

761
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,344
that's walking

762
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:09,980
into that house right now

763
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,980
in a stupid little hat.

764
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,980
- We're doing the legwork.

765
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,825
This is under

766
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:14,980
Thai jurisdiction.

767
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,893
And we're gonna need

768
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:16,980
more than your galloping

769
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,980
to extradite a U.S. citizen.

770
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,980
- Okay.

771
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,085
How about the housekeeper's

772
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:22,980
statement from Bangkok

773
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,820
that Bowden was still

774
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,980
in the room the next morning?

775
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,841
- And another employee

776
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,980
saw her passed out on a bench

777
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,439
on another floor

778
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,980
at the same time.

779
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,224
Is she magic?

780
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:31,980
- Maybe.

781
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,980
- I'm sorry, what was that?

782
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,624
- When we find out

783
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:35,980
she killed him,

784
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm gonna do a little dance.

785
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,611
- Oh, good for you.

786
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:41,980
That sounds fun.

787
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,980
- Honey,

788
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,989
did you bring me

789
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,980
to 3C's funeral?

790
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,612
- Actually,

791
00:24:54,652 --> 00:24:55,980
it's a... it's a memorial.

792
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,960
I think they do that

793
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,980
when there's no body.

794
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,944
- That is not relevant.

795
00:24:58,984 --> 00:24:59,980
Let me explain something.

796
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,487
How could you not tell me

797
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:02,980
that we were coming here?

798
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,351
- Okay, I... I...

799
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:06,980
I thought you would say no,

800
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,097
and I needed someone

801
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:08,980
to come with me.

802
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,980
- You thought right.

803
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,090
Cassie, I will not be

804
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,980
rubbing shoulders

805
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,455
with actual grieving pe...

806
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:14,980
These people are grieving.

807
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,980
- I'm sorry.

808
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,460
- I will not rub shoulders

809
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,980
with actual grieving people

810
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,980
like a sad tourist.

811
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,143
What I will do is leave you

812
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:23,980
standing here with him.

813
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,000
Think about your life choices.

814
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,344
I need a drink.

815
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,171
Do they have drinks

816
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:31,000
at memorials?

817
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
- Oh, my God.

818
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,516
Excuse me, have you seen

819
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:49,980
Janet Sokolov anywhere?

820
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,602
Is she...

821
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:50,980
- No.

822
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,812
- Bet everyone here

823
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:54,980
is telling stories about me

824
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,424
if you're curious.

825
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:56,980
- Nope.

826
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,980
- Well, I am curious.

827
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,980
- Alex, please.

828
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,382
Focus.

829
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:02,980
I need to find your mom.

830
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,152
- If I dated Miranda,

831
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:04,980
there should be

832
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,603
dozens of people here

833
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:06,423
who know her.

834
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,112
So why would you bother my mom

835
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:08,980
at my memorial service?

836
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,980
- There are 500 people here.

837
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,524
I'm supposed to walk up

838
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:11,980
to each one and say,

839
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,640
"Hey, do you know Miranda?"

840
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,821
- Good point.

841
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:15,980
It is a big house.

842
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,980
- Am I crazy?

843
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,980
I mean, who invites somebody

844
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,789
to a memorial service

845
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:27,980
as a plus-one?

846
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:29,980
It's just...

847
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,697
- Bitches, am I right?

848
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,980
What did you say?

849
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,980
Tell you something.

850
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,530
We don't call women bitches,

851
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:37,980
okay?

852
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,958
That is a phrased used

853
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:39,980
for delinquent fuckbois

854
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,980
and sometimes male politicians.

855
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,980
She is my friend.

856
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,980
She's confused.

857
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,875
What's your name?

858
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:49,980
- Michael.

859
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,185
- Michael?

860
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:52,980
With an M or...

861
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,980
- Michael.

862
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,448
- Yeah.

863
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,980
- It's nice to see you.

864
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,000
- Bill?

865
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,903
Bill, honey,

866
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:02,000
are you there?

867
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Honey?

868
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,000
Stupid fucking dog.

869
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,181
- Dearest friends,

870
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:47,980
family, and colleagues,

871
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,862
your presence here means

872
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,000
the world to Janet and me.

873
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Um...

874
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,045
The first time Alex

875
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:03,980
beat me in a game of chess,

876
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,980
he was so surprised,

877
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,980
he assumed we'd made a mistake.

878
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,241
- Oh, my God.

879
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:13,980
I'm... I'm so sorry.

880
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,330
I... sorry.

881
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,745
- Sorry.

882
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:16,980
Sorry, sorry.

883
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,090
As I was saying,

884
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,980
I told him on that day

885
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,980
that it was his turn to start...

886
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,980
To start teaching me.

887
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:30,980
- Excuse me. I know.

888
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,571
I apo... I apologize.

889
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,980
I'm so, so sorry.

890
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,205
Why are you calling me

891
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:37,980
over and over?

892
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,685
- You need to come over

893
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:38,980
right now.

894
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,527
- I can't. I'm at a...

895
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:41,980
I'm at a spin class.

896
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,304
- What the fuck are you doing

897
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:46,980
in Westchester?

898
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,068
- Oh, my God.

899
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:48,980
Okay, I'm...

900
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,369
I'm at Alex Sokolov's memorial.

901
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:51,980
- Jesus.

902
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,144
Okay, Cass,

903
00:28:53,184 --> 00:28:55,980
the Sokolovs own Unisphere.

904
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,697
Like, the whole fucking thing,

905
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:57,980
okay?

906
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,275
Max did some digging,

907
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:00,980
and he had to dig very deep.

908
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,505
- Okay, well, did he find

909
00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:01,980
anything about Miranda?

910
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,000
- No.

911
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,401
Look, I need you

912
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:04,980
to listen to me, okay?

913
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,735
The Sokolovs

914
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:06,980
are laundering money

915
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,980
for some very scary people.

916
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,452
I shouldn't say this,

917
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:09,980
but some of these people

918
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,791
are my clients,

919
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:11,980
and when they need to,

920
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,195
they get very, very,

921
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:13,980
very violent.

922
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,980
Do you understand me?

923
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,054
I need you need to leave

924
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:16,980
that house right now.

925
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,251
- Okay, I hear you.

926
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:18,980
I hear you.

927
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,407
You're worried

928
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:19,980
about scary people.

929
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,980
But if I don't find Miranda,

930
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,957
I will never sleep

931
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:22,980
in my place again...

932
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,980
If I'm not arrested.

933
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,980
- Cass, please,

934
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,686
just get out

935
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:27,046
of that fucking house.

936
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,514
- Okay, whatever. I'm sorry.

937
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:29,960
I love you. I have to go.

938
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,980
- Cass...

939
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,980
Motherfucker.

940
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,399
She fucking dies,

941
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,980
I'm gonna kill her.

942
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,201
- Hey, it's Cassie.

943
00:29:57,241 --> 00:29:58,980
I'll probably call you back.

944
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,121
- Hey, Cassie.

945
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:02,980
It's me, Megan Briscoe.

946
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,980
I don't know why I said that.

947
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,980
Of course you know who it is.

948
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,484
Listen, are we still

949
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:08,980
bid buddies?

950
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,902
Because I really

951
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:10,980
need to get on that

952
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,980
Tokyo-Seoul route next month.

953
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,918
So if you don't wanna

954
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:14,980
go to Asia, let me know.

955
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,980
I can always ask Jada.

956
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,279
Call me back.

957
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:20,980
Bye.

958
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,627
- Is this

959
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,000
your father's wake?

960
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,578
- What are you doing here?

961
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:48,980
You can't be here.

962
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,440
- It is, isn't it?

963
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:51,980
Wh...

964
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,414
Look at you.

965
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:52,980
You're so young.

966
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,075
- What... that's not

967
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:54,980
how this works.

968
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,957
You... get out of my

969
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:56,980
childhood memories!

970
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,980
- Whoa, whoa!

971
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,122
- Yeah, I don't think

972
00:30:59,162 --> 00:30:59,980
of those things,

973
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,515
so you can't think

974
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:00,980
of those things!

975
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,900
- Whoa, whoa, Cassie,

976
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,980
I didn't ask to be there.

977
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,791
It wasn't volitional.

978
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:04,980
- So what were you doing there?

979
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,980
- I don't know.

980
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,173
Why don't you tell me.

981
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:07,980
How about that?

982
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,980
Oh, Jesus Christ.

983
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,906
- What are you looking for?

984
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,494
- A beer?

985
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:32,980
But aren't you, like, ten?

986
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,423
- Oh, my God, lay off.

987
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:35,980
It's a light beer, okay?

988
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,786
It's practically

989
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:37,980
flavored sparkling water

990
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,160
by adult standards.

991
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,421
- Your brother

992
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:53,980
has the right idea.

993
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,366
- Yeah, well,

994
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:54,980
you've never met him.

995
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,000
Excuse me.

996
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,609
I'm so sorry!

997
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:24,980
Oh, my God.

998
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Fuck off, Alex.

999
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,812
My... my dad

1000
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:20,000
only used to give me beer.

1001
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,691
That was my first sip

1002
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:30,000
of hard alcohol.

1003
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,980
I...

1004
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,874
My God, I'm so sor...

1005
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:38,980
I didn't mean to intrude.

1006
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,000
- Then don't.

1007
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,980
We can stand here quietly.

1008
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,000
At least I know I can.

1009
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,029
- You know,

1010
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:54,980
I only met Alex briefly, but...

1011
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,989
I've never known

1012
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:56,980
anyone like him.

1013
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,980
- He was generous.

1014
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,016
More generous than I ever am.

1015
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:02,980
Who knows where he got that?

1016
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,111
I used to think he was born

1017
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:04,980
into the wrong family

1018
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,098
or some nurse

1019
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:07,980
switched him at birth.

1020
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,980
You know that can happen.

1021
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,542
- I used to think that of me

1022
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,980
and my brother growing up.

1023
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,080
We should not have been

1024
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,980
in the same family.

1025
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,547
But I guess you can't

1026
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,000
choose those things.

1027
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,186
- Janet, you have a call.

1028
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,000
Upstairs.

1029
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,782
- I'm so sorry

1030
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:26,980
to do this right now,

1031
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,297
but I have to ask you

1032
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:28,980
a question.

1033
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,018
It's about Alex's

1034
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,018
last girlfriend.

1035
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,980
- What about Fiona?

1036
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,862
- Sorry, Fiona?

1037
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:35,980
I don't...

1038
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,619
No, no,

1039
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm talking about Miranda.

1040
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,980
Miranda Croft?

1041
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,980
- What an absurd...

1042
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,107
My son never dated

1043
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:45,980
Miranda Croft.

1044
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,000
Where did you get that...

1045
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,298
Never mention that name

1046
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:50,980
to me again.

1047
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,135
- So you were never

1048
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:56,980
even together?

1049
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,910
- Or my mom's lying.

1050
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,980
- Did you see her face?

1051
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,980
She's telling the truth.

1052
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,535
If you never even

1053
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:01,980
dated Miranda,

1054
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,980
then what the fuck is going on?

1055
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,073
- I can't speak to those

1056
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:46,980
particular concerns,

1057
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,669
but I was just accosted

1058
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:49,980
by a strange woman

1059
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,000
asking questions about Miranda.

1060
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,345
Whatever else is going on,

1061
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,980
I will not let Victor, Miranda,

1062
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,267
or anyone else at Lionfish

1063
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:01,000
use my dead son as a scapegoat.

1064
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,157
Where are the Lionfish files

1065
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:05,980
that Alex left here?

1066
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,946
- I shredded the documents

1067
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:08,666
in your office this morning.

1068
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,366
- All right,

1069
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:11,546
let's go back down.

1070
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,201
- Hey, it's Cassie.

1071
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,980
I'll probably call you back.

1072
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,817
- Straight to voice mail.

1073
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:22,357
Fuck.

1074
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,623
- You're acting like

1075
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:23,980
she's about

1076
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,980
to be killed or something.

1077
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,219
- That's not helping.

1078
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:26,980
That's, um...

1079
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,826
Look, I told her

1080
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:28,980
to call me in an hour,

1081
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,317
and it has been way longer

1082
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:30,980
than an hour.

1083
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,669
And, you know,

1084
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:32,980
if she says the wrong thing

1085
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,980
to the wrong person there,

1086
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,297
then that, you know...

1087
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:35,980
That... fuck.

1088
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,980
Yeah, you know what?

1089
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm gonna...

1090
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,771
Yeah, I can... I can just call

1091
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:41,980
one of our clients,

1092
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,841
and I can ask them to just

1093
00:36:43,881 --> 00:36:45,980
put in a call to the Sokolovs,

1094
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,304
you know, just in case, like,

1095
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:47,980
"Cassie Bowden,

1096
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,980
"harmless flight attendant,

1097
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,955
fixated on Alex,

1098
00:36:49,995 --> 00:36:50,980
isn't that cute?"

1099
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,340
And my boss

1100
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,580
is gonna be furious,

1101
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,980
but, like, I can help, so...

1102
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,980
- She might be totally fine.

1103
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,818
- You really wanna

1104
00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:58,980
go out on a limb for her?

1105
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,430
- I mean, she's my best friend,

1106
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,980
Max, so yes.

1107
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,980
- Best friend? Cassie?

1108
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,639
We basically live together,

1109
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,980
and I just met Cassie,

1110
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,111
so she can't really be

1111
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:08,980
your best friend.

1112
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,650
- I'm, uh... I'm s... I'm sorry,

1113
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,980
you live here?

1114
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,423
- All my stuff's here, so...

1115
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:14,980
- Oh, okay.

1116
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,276
So the totality of the things

1117
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:16,980
that you own are

1118
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,916
a toothbrush, two T-shirts,

1119
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:19,980
and a computer?

1120
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,717
- You know I'm ready to unpack

1121
00:37:21,757 --> 00:37:22,980
your commitment issues

1122
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,580
whenever you feel like

1123
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:23,980
it's that time.

1124
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,038
- Look, if you wanna

1125
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:25,980
talk about Cassie,

1126
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,980
we can talk about Cassie.

1127
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,834
It's, like, people have

1128
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:29,980
different types of friendships.

1129
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,980
I don't care how it looks.

1130
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm making the call.

1131
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,980
- Give it to us.

1132
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,039
- Bowden's behavior

1133
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,980
has been erratic.

1134
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,942
- Erratic how?

1135
00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:46,980
- She's been drinking heavily,

1136
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,745
she's made herself

1137
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:48,980
a recurring public spectacle,

1138
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,547
and she destroyed a tower

1139
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:52,000
of cucumber sandwiches.

1140
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,194
Oh, I did see her go upstairs

1141
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:55,980
with Janet Sokolov.

1142
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,392
- Maybe she did

1143
00:37:57,432 --> 00:37:58,980
know Alex before.

1144
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,452
- Can someone kindly explain

1145
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:08,980
to me why a federal battalion

1146
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,141
is camped outside my house

1147
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:10,980
taking photographs?

1148
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,020
- We didn't mean

1149
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,980
any disrespect.

1150
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,081
We're just trying

1151
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:14,980
to do our job.

1152
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,065
- And I'm trying to find out

1153
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:16,980
why your pre-owned sedan

1154
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,121
is leaking oil

1155
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,980
on my immaculate drive.

1156
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,980
Oh, do you think I should wait

1157
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,090
and ask at your son's

1158
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,980
memorial service?

1159
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,609
That's how we communicate,

1160
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:25,149
right?

1161
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,162
Now, I'll invite you all

1162
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:29,000
to leave.

1163
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,794
- Do you know

1164
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:31,980
a Cassandra Bowden?

1165
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,485
- Yeah, if I were

1166
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,980
a paper shredder,

1167
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,980
first thing I'd do

1168
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,215
is, I'd probably

1169
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,980
stop talking to myself.

1170
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,000
Alex.

1171
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,731
- Whoa.

1172
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,770
Most people get pictures.

1173
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,000
I have paintings.

1174
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,980
- Yeah. A lot of them.

1175
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,317
Okay, focus.

1176
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:31,980
Come on, paper shredder.

1177
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,980
Fuck.

1178
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,098
Oh, Mr. Sokolov,

1179
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:25,980
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1180
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,948
I got a little bit turned

1181
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:27,980
around when I walked upst...

1182
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,000
- You're a friend of Alex's?

1183
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,504
- I'm actually not...

1184
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:32,624
I'm not really a...

1185
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,436
I'm not really a friend,

1186
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:35,016
just a...

1187
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,098
I actually only knew him

1188
00:40:39,138 --> 00:40:39,980
for a day.

1189
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,980
Well, 12 hours, really.

1190
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,920
It was actually

1191
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,980
just one evening.

1192
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,870
But that evening was spent

1193
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,980
having se... making love twice.

1194
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,404
Well, there's

1195
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:47,980
the infinity pool,

1196
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,980
so actually three times.

1197
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,011
- I'm sure you can

1198
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:51,980
see yourself out.

1199
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,677
- Yup.

1200
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,980
- Here we are again.

1201
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,547
Would you care to explain

1202
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,980
why you're in my house?

1203
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,980
- Don't mind her, dear.

1204
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,188
She's just one of Alex's

1205
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:01,980
good-time girls.

1206
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,980
- Don't be stupid, Edward.

1207
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,226
This girl was inquiring

1208
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:05,980
about Miranda.

1209
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,044
Now she's upstairs

1210
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:07,980
snooping around.

1211
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,472
- I actually have

1212
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:08,980
legitimate reasons

1213
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,597
for both of those things.

1214
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:10,980
- Yes.

1215
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,452
You're one of Victor's

1216
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:13,980
incompetent field mice.

1217
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,093
- Victor? Who?

1218
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,980
- Oh, cut the theatrics.

1219
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,345
- No, I'm a...

1220
00:41:17,385 --> 00:41:17,980
I'm a flight attendant.

1221
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,133
Really, I'm... I'm... yeah,

1222
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:20,193
in the... you know.

1223
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,448
I have a badge.

1224
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:21,980
I could show you.

1225
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,072
It's got a little plastic

1226
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:23,980
thing, but it... sorry.

1227
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,980
Let me just grab it out of my...

1228
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,022
- You really don't know what

1229
00:41:28,062 --> 00:41:29,980
you've walked into, do you?

1230
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,000
- Um...

1231
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,980
- Wait.

1232
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,980
- So your family's terrifying.

1233
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,812
- Maybe they're better

1234
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:43,980
when their son didn't just die.

1235
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,573
- Okay, they're not hanging out

1236
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:44,980
in libraries with guns

1237
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,387
because their son just died,

1238
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:47,147
sorry, Alex.

1239
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,963
Those are your parents.

1240
00:41:49,003 --> 00:41:49,980
You worked at Unisphere.

1241
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,985
Are you associated

1242
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:51,980
with these people?

1243
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,844
- It seems as if

1244
00:42:02,884 --> 00:42:04,144
you're free to leave.

1245
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,980
Unless you prefer to stay.

1246
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:07,980
I don't...

1247
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,958
I don't even know

1248
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:09,980
how this happened.

1249
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,385
I am so sorry for your loss,

1250
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:12,980
really.

1251
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:23,980
- Come on, let's go.

1252
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,000
Just... quiet.

1253
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,495
- Gonna pull my arm

1254
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:27,980
out of the socket.

1255
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,000
What is wrong with you?

1256
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,140
Where are we going?

1257
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,792
I didn't even wanna come here

1258
00:42:35,832 --> 00:42:36,980
in the first place.

1259
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,380
- Oh, please,

1260
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,980
I saw you liaisoning

1261
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,033
with the cater-waiter;

1262
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:39,980
I think you're okay.

1263
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,927
- Liaisoning... liaisoning?

1264
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:41,980
That's a word, "liaisoning"?

1265
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,623
That's a lot of judgment

1266
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:44,980
coming from a person

1267
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,902
who just crashed

1268
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:46,980
a memorial service.

1269
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,579
What are you doing?

1270
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:47,980
What is this?

1271
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,056
This is a bag of trash.

1272
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:49,980
You're a trash lady?

1273
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,410
- Shut up. Quiet.

1274
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,830
- You... you're hoarding?

1275
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,980
What are you doing?

1276
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,980
Yes, yes, I liaised

1277
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,005
with a man named Michael,

1278
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:55,980
a beautiful cater-waiter

1279
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,987
who's taking me to tacos

1280
00:42:57,027 --> 00:42:57,980
in Bushwick on Saturday.

1281
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,280
I don't know where Bushwick is,

1282
00:42:59,320 --> 00:42:59,980
but it's gonna be

1283
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,441
fucking magical,

1284
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:00,980
I'll tell you that.

1285
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,157
- A magical taco

1286
00:43:02,197 --> 00:43:03,980
Bushwick connection, wow!

1287
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,291
- Maybe that's what happened

1288
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:05,980
with you and 3C

1289
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,360
and your magical night

1290
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:07,980
in Bangkok

1291
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,572
that you keep saying

1292
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:08,980
didn't happen.

1293
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,224
Is there some other reason

1294
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:10,980
that we are here

1295
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,350
fully fucking interloping

1296
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,980
on his actual grieving family?

1297
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,193
- Shane.

1298
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:15,960
- You wanted to go, I'm going.

1299
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,343
- Shane.

1300
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:16,980
- Get into it.

1301
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,980
- I'm sorry.

1302
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,980
Okay, you're right.

1303
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,081
You're absolutely

1304
00:43:21,121 --> 00:43:21,980
fucking right.

1305
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,980
I should not have come here.

1306
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,468
I shouldn't have

1307
00:43:23,508 --> 00:43:23,980
brought you here.

1308
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,909
I just... I thought it was

1309
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:25,980
the right thing to do, okay?

1310
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,980
I thought it was important.

1311
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,577
I did; I thought it was

1312
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:28,980
important, okay?

1313
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,392
I wanted to clear my...

1314
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:31,980
I wanted to clear my head

1315
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,985
of this horrible,

1316
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:33,980
horrible tragedy,

1317
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,980
but I didn't do that.

1318
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,980
I just made a fucking fool

1319
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,985
of myself in there

1320
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:37,980
'cause I'm a mess.

1321
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,643
I'm a fucking mess.

1322
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,283
I'm sorry.

1323
00:43:43,843 --> 00:43:45,980
Look, it doesn't matter.

1324
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:46,769
No one in there

1325
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:47,980
even knows who you are,

1326
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,980
so let's just go.

1327
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,734
It's fine,

1328
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:52,980
It's not the end of the world.

1329
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,802
- Listen, you cannot tell

1330
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:56,980
anyone that I came here, okay?

1331
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,159
It's fucking crazy.

1332
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,000
I know that now.

1333
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,980
I'm sorry.

1334
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,980
- I can keep a secret, Cassie.

1335
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,574
Let's go.

1336
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,980
Come on.

1337
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,559
- Okay, okay, she's alive.

1338
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:28,980
- What?

1339
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:29,946
- Okay, okay.

1340
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:30,980
- Okay, great.

1341
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,910
- I'm gonna just murder her

1342
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,980
myself when I get the chance.

1343
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,680
It's just like,

1344
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,980
she stops answering my calls

1345
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,184
and my text messages,

1346
00:44:38,224 --> 00:44:38,980
and she scares

1347
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,573
the fucking shit out of me.

1348
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:40,980
- Okay.

1349
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,930
So was that... well, the favor

1350
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,980
you called in even necessary?

1351
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,980
- Uh, yeah.

1352
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,985
I mean, she got out

1353
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:51,980
in one piece, so...

1354
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:52,579
Fuck, I don't know.

1355
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:52,980
Maybe, but...

1356
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,520
- It's great. It's great.

1357
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,429
You pulled some strings

1358
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:55,980
and you bailed out a friend.

1359
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,754
Good job.

1360
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,980
Your reward is some ramen.

1361
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,980
- Right.

1362
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,484
- Yeah?

1363
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:00,980
- Yeah.

1364
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,980
Max, that call that I made,

1365
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,655
my... my boss is literally gonna

1366
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:05,980
have my head on a stick.

1367
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,770
- I would be more worried

1368
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,980
about my payment.

1369
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,054
- Your payment?

1370
00:45:10,094 --> 00:45:10,980
- My payment.

1371
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,980
- For what?

1372
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,582
- I believe I... I believe

1373
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:15,980
I sent you an invoice

1374
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,470
for investigative services

1375
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,980
rendered.

1376
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,820
- Oh, yeah?

1377
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,980
- Yeah.

1378
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,000
And I would like to be paid.

1379
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,980
- Okay.

1380
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,907
How would you like

1381
00:45:28,947 --> 00:45:29,980
to take your payment?

1382
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,406
- Well, I worked for, like,

1383
00:45:31,446 --> 00:45:31,980
20 minutes.

1384
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:32,980
- I'm trying to think

1385
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,111
what you could do for,

1386
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:34,980
like, 20 minutes.

1387
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,719
- What I could do for 20...

1388
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:37,980
- 20 whole minutes.

1389
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,171
- 20 whole minutes.

1390
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:39,980
I don't know.

1391
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,980
What could it be?

1392
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,710
- I'm gonna figure it out.

1393
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,517
- Let's get some ramen.

1394
00:45:44,557 --> 00:45:44,980
- Okay.

1395
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,295
- Sir, where is the bar car

1396
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:11,980
on this train?

1397
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,931
- Sorry, it's not

1398
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,111
that kind of train.

1399
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,980
- It's not that kind of train.

1400
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,271
- Hi, I'm Miranda.

1401
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:25,980
- Miranda.

1402
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,980
- Fuck.

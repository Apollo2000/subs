00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,394
- Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:03,980
this is Broadway Junction,

5
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,427
Transfer is available

6
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,980
to the I, N, H trains.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,385
Ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,980
because of construction,

9
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,273
two trains between...

10
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:19,980
- Oh, shit.

11
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,980
- You gotta brush your teeth

12
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,849
'cause we're running

13
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:31,980
a little late today, okay?

14
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,986
- Davey, hi, listen,

15
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:35,980
I really can't talk.

16
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,980
I'm gonna miss my flight.

17
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,515
- Oh, yeah, I just

18
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:38,980
want to check in

19
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,379
about the New York trip

20
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:40,980
real quick

21
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,832
'cause, you know,

22
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:42,980
Rick's getting nervous.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,525
- Nervous,

24
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:44,980
what are you talking about?

25
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,818
And it's, like,

26
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:46,980
weeks away, isn't it?

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,111
- Yeah, yes,

28
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,980
it's four days away.

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,812
- Oh, shit, really?

30
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:51,980
Four days, are you serious?

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,956
- Yeah, and the girls

32
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:54,980
are excited

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,520
to see their Aunt Cassie,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,566
They're too young to realize

35
00:01:58,606 --> 00:01:59,980
she's a terrible planner.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,680
- Okay, you put

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,400
those knives away right now.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,980
That is not fair.

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,571
You admit,

40
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:05,980
you're probably standing

41
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,609
in your kitchen right now

42
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:06,980
just so jealous

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,280
of my super fun life.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,344
- Maybe, but not when you

45
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:11,980
throw it in my face like that.

46
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,517
- I know that was

47
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:12,980
very, very hard

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,677
for you to admit, so I love you

49
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,980
so much for saying that.

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,985
Listen, we're gonna

51
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:17,980
have the best trip.

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,689
- Hey.

53
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:19,980
- Oh, fuck!

54
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,317
- Whoa!

55
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:20,980
- Who are you?

56
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,247
- I'm Ethan.

57
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:22,980
- What?

58
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,653
- From last night.

59
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:23,980
- Cassie?

60
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,117
- How did you get in here?

61
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:25,980
- We met at the bar.

62
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,651
- Cassie?

63
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:27,980
- Yes, your words.

64
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,038
How'd you get in my apartment?

65
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:29,980
- You texted me right here.

66
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,980
- Hello?

67
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,543
- You told me to use the key

68
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:32,980
above the door thing...

69
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,666
The door frame.

70
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:33,980
- Okay.

71
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,008
- And we were supposed

72
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:35,980
to meet here at 2:00.

73
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,519
- Ethan, oh, my God, okay,

74
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,980
I'm starting to remember.

75
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,980
- Cassie?

76
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,920
- I think I was

77
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,980
very, very drunk.

78
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,883
That's on me.

79
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:43,980
Okay, I'm sorry.

80
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,296
I remember you now.

81
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:45,980
Davey, hi.

82
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,409
- Hey.

83
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:47,980
- Sorry, hi, I'm okay.

84
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,206
Yeah, that was very loud.

85
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:49,980
I'm fine though.

86
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,899
- You okay?

87
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:51,980
- I gotta go.

88
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,127
I'll call you later.

89
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,067
- Okay, but I...

90
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,344
I gotta shower.

91
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,980
- Okay.

92
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,980
- No, no, no, not in a fun way.

93
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,671
Sorry, I think you gotta go

94
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,980
'cause I gotta leave,

95
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,512
but thank you for the effort.

96
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:02,980
Good job.

97
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,788
- Good morning.

98
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:18,980
- Good morning, Megan.

99
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,437
- We were taking bets to see

100
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:21,980
how late you were going to be.

101
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,980
- Oh, I want in.

102
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,539
Is perfectly on time

103
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:23,980
still available?

104
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,559
Wow, I win.

105
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,000
- Ah, yay.

106
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,544
- The captain has illuminated

107
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,980
the "fasten seatbelt" sign.

108
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,000
Please take your seats.

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,725
- Hi, it's Erika, right?

110
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:07,980
I'm Cassie.

111
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,980
Are you okay?

112
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,770
- I'm worried that if the plane

113
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,980
falls out of the sky,

114
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,980
everybody will die.

115
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,980
- That was dark.

116
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,502
That is not going

117
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:15,980
to happen, okay?

118
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,980
You are very, very safe.

119
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,722
But, you know,

120
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:19,980
if something goes wrong,

121
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,326
between me,

122
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:20,980
my flight attendants,

123
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,000
and the captain,

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,818
we're gonna take

125
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:24,980
such good care of you.

126
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,650
- How?

127
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,980
Can you fly?

128
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,740
- Okay, I'm not supposed

129
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,980
to tell you this,

130
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,980
but yes I can.

131
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,980
Don't tell anyone.

132
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,708
- Oh, hey, I was

133
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:40,980
just looking for you.

134
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,398
- Oh, is there something

135
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:43,980
I can get you, Mr. Sokolov?

136
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,980
- It's Alex, and you're Cassie.

137
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,072
- Yeah, someone was

138
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:49,980
paying attention

139
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,803
when the captain

140
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:51,980
made his announcements.

141
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,980
Good job.

142
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,205
- I was just wondering

143
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:54,980
if I could get

144
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,980
a scotch on the rocks.

145
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,980
- Yes, of course.

146
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,906
You know, we have

147
00:04:58,946 --> 00:04:59,980
little buttons there

148
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,745
that you can push,

149
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:01,980
and we'll just come bring you

150
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,880
anything you want.

151
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,980
- Oh, you got buttons?

152
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,883
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:05,980
- Ah, yeah.

154
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,405
- You don't have

155
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:06,980
to come chase us down.

156
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,459
- I knew that.

157
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:08,980
- Mm.

158
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,201
- Just wanted

159
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,980
to stretch my legs.

160
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,980
- Mm.

161
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,511
- You know, these long flights.

162
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:15,980
They can get a little tedious.

163
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,685
- Mm, you know, that might

164
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:18,980
have something to do

165
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,174
with your very depressing

166
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:20,980
reading material.

167
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,980
I mean, "Crime and Punishment"?

168
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,980
- This book's amazing.

169
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,469
- Okay, tell me

170
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,469
how it works out

171
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,584
for any of the women

172
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:27,980
in that book.

173
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,958
I just am more of

174
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:29,980
a "Doctor Zhivago"

175
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,168
kind of girl.

176
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:31,980
- Really?

177
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,980
- Yeah.

178
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,825
- Yeah, well,

179
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:35,980
that book's messy.

180
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,000
- What's wrong with messy?

181
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,980
Ooh, sorry.

182
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,986
- You're laying it on

183
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,286
pretty thick with 3C.

184
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,465
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:00,980
- Uh, hi, my name is Cassie.

186
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,095
You must be one of those nosy,

187
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:02,980
overly-interested people

188
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,980
I've been hearing all about.

189
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,415
- And don't you

190
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:05,980
have the full cabin,

191
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,003
not just that one seat?

192
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:08,363
- Okay, it's harmless.

193
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,116
He is harmless, plus I am

194
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:10,980
seeing someone now.

195
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,577
- Oh, really?

196
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:11,980
- Uh-huh.

197
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,980
- Really, who?

198
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,318
No.

199
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:15,980
- Yes.

200
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,209
- No.

201
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:17,269
- Oh, he's hairy.

202
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,980
- No, absolutely not.

203
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,476
- I would take them

204
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:19,980
all home if I could.

205
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,758
My apartment

206
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,980
doesn't allow pets,

207
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,054
and you have a backyard.

208
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:23,980
He would be so happy.

209
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,260
- No, I am not adopting

210
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,980
a rabbit from that shelter, no.

211
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,828
- His name's Elvis.

212
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:29,980
- Elvis, oh.

213
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,636
- What is your obsession

214
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:30,980
with rescuing

215
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,545
every single animal

216
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:31,980
on this planet?

217
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,980
- No one knows.

218
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,137
- Really, Shane, you cannot

219
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:35,980
live off those nuts.

220
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,980
- Let me be me.

221
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,430
- So what is your deal with 3C?

222
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,930
- Shane, can I get a scotch

223
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,770
on the rocks and vodka please?

224
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,451
- Oh, just because you

225
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:43,980
didn't answer my question

226
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,157
doesn't mean it isn't happening

227
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:45,980
in front of all of us.

228
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,487
- Shane, can you make Jada

229
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:48,980
stop harassing me, please.

230
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,097
- I'm sure they have

231
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:50,980
a lot in common.

232
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,127
I mean, they're both

233
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:52,980
on this flight.

234
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,915
- Aren't you supposed to be

235
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,980
in economy plus on this flight?

236
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,000
- Bye.

237
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,980
- Bye.

238
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,980
- Bye.

239
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,980
- You could be nicer.

240
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,621
- What?

241
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:02,980
She started it.

242
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,985
I am totally nice.

243
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:04,980
I am professional.

244
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,784
I am kind.

245
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,000
- Don't drink...

246
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Cassie, Cassie, Cassie.

247
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,182
You poured that for her.

248
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:14,980
- I am so sorry.

249
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,980
She asked.

250
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,980
- Here you go, sir.

251
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,485
- I don't know how

252
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,980
to follow up the...

253
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,980
- Will you have dinner with me?

254
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,772
- Okay, that was,

255
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:29,372
like, a super cute moment,

256
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,844
but we're really not

257
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:31,980
supposed to do that, so...

258
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,453
- Okay, well, Bangkok

259
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:34,980
can be really magical.

260
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,000
Will you think about it?

261
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,597
- Thank you.

262
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:40,980

263
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,980
Bye-bye, thank you.

decide to break the rules.

266
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,980
Thank you.

You think I'm gonna call him?

- Bye-bye.

the magic of Bangkok.

I was trying to remember...

Who's the girl...

The Italian girl... actually,

she was an American girl.

310

She was in Italy,

00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,980
and the murder thing,

312
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,980
but she was... she was innocent.

313
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,958

314
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:15,980
about Amanda Knox?

315
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,156
- Yeah, did she call

316
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,980
the police... the Italian police?

317
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,980
Did they come?

about Amanda Knox?

324

We were on the plane.

325
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,486

how funny it would be

327

to be arrested

328

in a foreign country.

329
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,980
It was funny.

330
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,416
We were laughing

331
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:36,980
really hard about it.

Where are you?

339
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,487
- Uh, I don't... this place

340
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,980
is so pretty, where I am.

341

do not get arrested there.

351
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,086
Yeah, how did you know

352
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,980
that I'm in Bangkok?

353
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,896
- Oh, when we all took

354
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,496
that girl's trip to Tulum,

355
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,399
we turned on our Find Friend

356
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:14,980
thing 'cause, like, kidnapping,

357
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,771
and, yeah, you just

358
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:16,980
never turned yours off, so...

359
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,257
Listen, you're not, like,

360
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:20,980
actually in trouble

361
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,980
or something, are you?

362
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,980
- No, I'm...

363
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,980
Hungover in Thailand.

364
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,446
You know me, just...

365
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:29,980
- Yeah.

366
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,557
Listen, babe, I have to go,

367
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:35,980
but I love you.

368
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
Call me when you

369
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,980
get back, okay?

370
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,000
Safe travels.

371
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
D

372
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
- Ow!

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,980
Fuck.

374
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,980
D

375
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,000
- Housekeeping.

376
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,903
- No, no, no, no, no, hi.

377
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:24,980
- Mr. Sokolov?

378
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,860
- No, no, sorry, sorry, sorry,

379
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,980
he's still asleep.

380
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,980
You can come back later.

381
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,000
- Thank you.

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,395
- No, no, no, no,

383
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:38,980
no, no, no, no, no.

384
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,980
Fuck, fuck.

385
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,980
Okay, okay.

386
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,980
Oh, fuck.

387
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,485
Davey.

388
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:50,980
- Hey.

389
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,609
- This is not really

390
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:51,980
a good time.

391
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,968
- Hey, I was thinking of

392
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:54,508
ordering all of us passes

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,980
to the Natural History Museum.

394
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,980
- Yeah, okay, fine, go ahead.

395
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,720
I mean, no, wait,

396
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,980
what are you... I'm doing that.

397
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,562
I'm taking the kids

398
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:00,980
to the museum.

399
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,980
What are you talking about?

400
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,867
- Right, I just

401
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:04,980
would feel better...

402
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,338
I think everything would be fun

403
00:16:06,378 --> 00:16:07,278
if we all went.

404
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,814
We have to make

405
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:11,114
a big deal out of it?

406
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,980
- No, you're right.

407
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,135
You should probably

408
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:17,980
just get them.

409
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm pretty busy.

410
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,504
Okay.

411
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,000
- Okay, great.

412
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,980
D

413
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,334
Hi, I need a... I need a scarf.

414
00:16:58,374 --> 00:16:59,000
Like a...

415
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
D

416
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,980
You ready?

417
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,867
Why do you look

418
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:39,980
like Norma Desmond?

419
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,077
F

420
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:41,980
Okay, you know what?

421
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,980
I adore you and your charades,

422
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,716
but I'm not missing

423
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,000
the van again.

424
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,980
Oh, my God, oh, God.

425
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,980
Wait, wait.

426
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,980
d

427
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,980
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

428
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,000
D

429
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,763
Where are you gonna

430
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:26,980
take me next?

431
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,036
Cheers to not playing

432
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:28,980
hard to get at all.

433
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,980
- Why would we?

434
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
- Hey, hey.

435
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,244
- You all right?

436
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:46,980
- Yes, yes, thank you.

437
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,980
- Look who decided to show up.

438
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,980
- Looking good, Bowden.

439
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,980
- We have this guy again.

440
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,525
Maybe you should have

441
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:15,980
missed the flight.

442
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,469
- Should we go?

443
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:16,980
- Yes, let's go.

444
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,259
- Great.

445
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:17,980
- Let's go, let's go.

446
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,980
- Mm-hmm.

447
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,980
- The tower has us on a delay.

448
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,075
Hopefully we'll be

449
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:25,015
moving shortly.

450
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,663
- Why is there a delay?

451
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:28,980
That's odd, right?

452
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,414
- There's always a delay.

453
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:30,980
Who knows?

454
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,349
- Yeah, but I...

455
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:33,980
Yeah, that's true.

456
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,049
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

457
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:35,980
yeah, there is.

458
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,980
D f

459
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,980
Here we go.

460
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,000
D

461
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,980
Oh, God, you have got

462
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,980
to fucking calm down.

463
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,980
Okay.

464
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,958
You made it on the plane.

465
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,980
Get to Seoul.

466
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,579
Back to New York, and then

467
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:11,980
you're free, all right?

468
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,980
Because you did nothing wrong.

469
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,460
- You honestly can't think

470
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,980
of one thing you did wrong?

471
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,107
- Okay, what the...

472
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:25,980
What the fuck?

473
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,398
Where am I?

474
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:28,980
Why am I back in this room?

475
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,980
Where is the plane?

476
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,891
- How do you think you're

477
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,731
getting away with any of this?

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,980
- What?

479
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,332
I'm not trying

480
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:36,980
to get away with anything.

481
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,980
I didn't do anything.

482
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,600
- Huh, well,

483
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,980
even if you didn't kill me,

484
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,980
you at least broke a few laws...

485
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,670
- Wait, wait,

486
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,980
I did not kill you, okay?

487
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,980
I am not that kind of drunk.

488
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,935
I am public nudity,

489
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,980
yelling in the subway

490
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,053
kind of drunk, okay?

491
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,980
- I'm not violent.

492
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,027
- No, you can't remember

493
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:54,980
what happened, though,

494
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,434
so you're also

495
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:55,980
a blackout drunk.

496
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,012
- Excuse me?

497
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,980
You don't even know me.

498
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,103
- I know you didn't

499
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:01,043
call the police

500
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,631
to tell them

501
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:03,980
something happened to me.

502
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,647
- I woke up

503
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:05,980
covered in your blood.

504
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,054
No one was gonna believe

505
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:07,980
anything that I said.

506
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,980
- It is a lot of blood.

507
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,103
- Why would someone

508
00:21:14,143 --> 00:21:14,980
wanna kill you?

509
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,407
- You did read

510
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:15,980
that article online

511
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,785
about that guy who

512
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:17,980
got sentenced to five years

513
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,980
in Thailand for littering.

514
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,004
- I did read about that.

515
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:21,980
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

516
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,143
- Also, you cleaned up

517
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:23,980
the crime scene,

518
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,655
so that's another strike

519
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:24,980
against you.

520
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,684
- What?

521
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:26,980
No, I didn't.

522
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,349
Okay, I did

523
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:27,980
just a little bit...

524
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,052
Just a tiny bit,

525
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:29,980
just my parts.

526
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,980
I didn't mean to.

527
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,958
I just... I probably did

528
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:32,980
a terrible fucking job.

529
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,980
Oh, fuck.

530
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,980
D

531
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,260
- You wanna get that?

532
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,980
- Hi, don't you work here?

533
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,980
- Yes, yes, I do.

534
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,013
Tell me you weren't

535
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:52,980
drinking in there.

536
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,836
- Okay, I don't know

537
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:54,980
what was going on in there,

538
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,588
but I was definitely

539
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:55,980
not drinking.

540
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,298
- Okay, that's

541
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:58,980
hardly reassuring.

542
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,980
Can you just get it together?

543
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,792
- Yeah, it's just...

544
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:02,980
Have you seen that bald guy?

545
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,285
Who is he?

546
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:04,705
He keeps staring at me.

547
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,980
He's really creeping me out.

548
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,380
- That's just

549
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,980
the new air marshal.

550
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,143
It's his job

551
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:10,980
to stare at things.

552
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,640
Okay, you are so out of it.

553
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,962
What the hell did you do

554
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:14,980
with that guy last night?

555
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,033
- I didn't do...

556
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,980
I stayed in the hotel, okay?

557
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,740
If you don't believe me,

558
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,980
call and ask 'em.

559
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,307
- Hi, yes, I am trying

560
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,980
to reach one of your guests,

561
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,980
Alex Sokolov.

562
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,980
- Just a moment, ma'am.

563
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,926
I'm sorry, ma'am.

564
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:39,980
There is no answer.

565
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,193
- No, well, I was supposed

566
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:41,980
to have a meeting

567
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,980
with him this morning.

568
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,791
Could you please have

569
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:45,980
housekeeping check on his room?

570
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,980
- Of course.

571
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,980
- Housekeeping.

572
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,980
Mr. Sokolov?

573
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,980
- Thank you.

574
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,484
- Sorry.

575
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:25,980
- Why are you screaming?

576
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,263
- I'm...

577
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:27,383
- What's going on?

578
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,480
- Hi, hello.

579
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:28,980
- I'm sorry.

580
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,062
I didn't mean to scare you.

581
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:31,482
- Nope. Can I help you?

582
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,784
- I asked for a soda.

583
00:23:33,824 --> 00:23:34,980
This is vodka.

584
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,652
- Oh.

585
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Sorry, I misunderstood you.

586
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,980
I thought you wanted both.

587
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,803
- Can I just get a soda please?

588
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:44,980
- Absolutely.

589
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,650
- We'll bring it right to you.

590
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:46,980
- Yes.

591
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,980
What is his fucking problem?

592
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,980
- Okay, are you seriously

593
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,355
trying to get

594
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:51,980
the air marshal drunk?

595
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,719
'Cause that would be crazy

596
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,980
and highly illegal.

597
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,472
- I am not, okay?

598
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:55,980
I heard him wrong.

599
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,980
He needs to just chill out.

600
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,987
- Okay, that's literally

601
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:01,980
the opposite of his job.

602
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,980
What is up with you?

603
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,753
- Okay, listen,

604
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:04,980
I did go out last night.

605
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,980
I'm a little bit hungover.

606
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,980
I don't wanna get into it.

607
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,980
It's not a big deal.

608
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,485
- That you went out

609
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:08,980
with the guy in 3C?

610
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,486
- What?

611
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:11,980
No, no.

612
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,841
- Well, Shane said

613
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:13,980
that he said he and Jada

614
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,513
both think that you

615
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:14,980
went out with 3C.

616
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,744
- I... oh, my God,

617
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:16,980
you're talking about this?

618
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,074
Why are you talking about this?

619
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:18,980
- Don't be stupid, Cassie.

620
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,662
Of course we're talking

621
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:19,980
about this.

622
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,468
What else are we

623
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:20,980
gonna talk about?

624
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,010
- Here's the thing...

625
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,980
I'm never gonna say

626
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,424
I went out with 3C

627
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:24,844
because I didn't, okay?

628
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,566
For the last time, I didn't.

629
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:27,980
I didn't go out with him.

630
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,571
What?

631
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:29,980
- Calm down.

632
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,722
- Okay.

633
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:31,980
- All right.

634
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,306
- Like it's

635
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,726
the end of the world...

636
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,126
- No.

637
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:35,980
- That you went out with him.

638
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,364
Doesn't even matter.

639
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:37,980
- I know.

640
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,933
I didn't.

641
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,000
- I'm staying at this hotel.

642
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,980
D

643
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,980
- Sokolov residence.

644
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,900
- Yes, hello, this is

645
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,980
Special Agent Kim Hammond

646
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,980
with the FBI.

647
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,511
May I please speak

648
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:17,980
with Edward or Janet Sokolov?

649
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,980
- This is Janet Sokolov.

650
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,171
May I ask what this

651
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,000
is regarding?

652
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,377
- Yes, ma'am,

653
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:22,980
I know this is hard,

654
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,586
but I have

655
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:24,980
a few questions for you

656
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,980
about your son.

657
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,980
- I'm sorry, what about Alex?

658
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,000
- I am so sorry.

659
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,980
I thought...

660
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,251
I thought

661
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:34,980
that the State Department

662
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,980
had informed you.

663
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,390
- What happened to Alex?

664
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,000
Is he all right?

665
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,141
Is he hurt?

666
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:43,980
Tell me.

667
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,980
- Ladies and gentlemen,

668
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,556
welcome to

669
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:53,980
Incheon National Airport.

670
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,957
We will be taxiing

671
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:55,980
on an active runway

672
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,072
for the next few moments,

673
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:57,980
so please stay seated

674
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,527
with your seatbelts

675
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:00,980
securely fastened.

676
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,980
But feel free to use

677
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,582
your approved electronic

678
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:04,980
devices at this time.

679
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,135
We'll give you more information

680
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:07,555
when we reach the gate.

681
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,453
Thank you so much

682
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:08,980
for flying with us.

683
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,158
On behalf of your friendly crew

684
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:12,980
here at Imperial Atlantic,

685
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,980
welcome to Seoul.

686
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
- It said, "Alex Sokolov."

687
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,863
3C was Mr. Sokolov.

688
00:26:21,903 --> 00:26:22,980
It ain't rocket science.

689
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,915
- I'd like for it to not be

690
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:24,980
someone that was on our flight.

691
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,980
Thank you.

692
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,132
- Well, people aren't immune

693
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:28,980
to unfortunate things

694
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,063
just because they fly

695
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:30,980
Imperial Atlantic.

696
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,219
- You will never work

697
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:32,980
in marketing.

698
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,801
- Cassie, you talked

699
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,980
to him a lot.

700
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,152
Give us some details.

701
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:37,980
- No, I didn't.

702
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,980
I mean, I served him.

703
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,963
He wanted scotch on the rocks...

704
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:43,000
A bunch of them.

705
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,980
- Oh, my God.

706
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,603
I thought he was winking

707
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:48,980
at you earlier,

708
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,919
but now I see it's just

709
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:50,980
a series of small strokes.

710
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,770
- Yeah, I was nice to him

711
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,000
exactly one time.

712
00:26:59,408 --> 00:26:59,980
- You okay?

713
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,569
- What?

714
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:00,980
Yeah.

715
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,079
Just, like, need to take

716
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:02,980
a bath or something.

717
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,703
- No, no, no,

718
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:04,980
come to dinner with us.

719
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,026
I'm gonna make Jada buy you

720
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:06,980
the drinks that you like.

721
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:09,000
Will I, though?

722
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,980
- I'm a little bit tired.

723
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,843
I really should

724
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:13,980
just get some sleep.

725
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,000
- Good night.

726
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,672
- You know, I could stay in

727
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:19,980
if you like.

728
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,980
- No, no, no, you go.

729
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,880
Just bring me back

730
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,980
some yummy food, okay?

731
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,349
- You sure?

732
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,529
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

733
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,782
- That's mine.

734
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:29,082
Thank you, thank you.

735
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
D

736
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,980
D f

737
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,253
- Being a flight attendant

738
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:00,980
seems like fun.

739
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,987
- It is.

740
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:02,980
- Right?

741
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,514
- Mm-hmm.

742
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:04,980
- Good, I feel validated.

743
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,841
- Do you?

744
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,000
- It is fun.

745
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,355
You know, I get to see

746
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:11,980
all these beautiful places

747
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,985
and I don't know...

748
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:13,980
Look at passengers

749
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,769
right in the eye

750
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:15,980
and say the word "trash."

751
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,980
It's great.

752
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,980
- But all the new,

753
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,980
it must get lonely sometimes.

754
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,685
- What?

755
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:27,980
No.

756
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,980
No.

757
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,000
No.

758
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,249
- Was that an awkward question?

759
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:36,980
Okay, that's okay.

760
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,959
Let me get a sweater.

761
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:38,980
- No, wait, no, don't.

762
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,652
- Don't go anywhere.

763
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:39,980
- I'm not.

764
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,980
I don't want... no, I don't know.

765
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,565
Maybe you're right

766
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:44,385
a little bit.

767
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,300
I guess it does

768
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,980
kind of get lonely.

769
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,980
Just I'm so used to it,

770
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,988
and I just don't get too close

771
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:53,980
to people and keep a distance.

772
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,095
And, you know what?

773
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,980
It's a lot of first dates.

774
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,980
- I'm jealous, really.

775
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,560
I never date, and when I do,

776
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,980
I make bad choices.

777
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,820
- Well, your streak continues.

778
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,980
- I don't think so.

779
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,980
If you are bad at first dates,

780
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,520
then the fact that this

781
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,980
is going so great is...

782
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,409
- Did you just say

783
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:16,980
it's going so great?

784
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,980
- Shut up.

785
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I need ice for that.

786
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,611
You do not need ice

787
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:42,980
for this, mm-mm.

788
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,980
You do not need ice for this.

789
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,561
You just don't wanna

790
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,980
be alone right now

791
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,000
so you are trying... you are...

792
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,000
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

793
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,980
So sorry...

794
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:17,980
But I do need... I do need ice.

795
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,980
D f

796
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,925
This is not gonna be good.

797
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:25,980
This is gonna be bad for you.

798
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,354
This is not...

799
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:27,980
- Hey.

800
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,689
- Ugh.

801
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:29,980
- Ice, huh?

802
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,980
I was just at the gym.

803
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,980
Gotta keep it tight in case...

804
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,980
- In case what?

805
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,968
- In case that fun thing

806
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:38,508
that happened last summer

807
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,980
in Seoul happens again.

808
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,397
- Yeah, I was very drunk, so...

809
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:41,980
- Sure, sure.

810
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,640
But, I mean, when

811
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,000
aren't you drunk, right?

812
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,912
Got it, sorry.

813
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:51,000
Sleeping alone.

814
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,980
- Okay, get in... get in there.

815
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,692
Let's go.

816
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:57,980
- What are you... what's wrong?

817
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,561
- Been thinking a lot

818
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,980
about my dad today.

819
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,000
He's dead, so...

820
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,520
I think my ice is melting.

821
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,000
- Almost there.

822
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,980
Can you just...

823
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,662
I'm gonna straighten up

824
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:15,980
real quick.

825
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,000
Just give me one minute.

826
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,980
- You saw a man you slept with

827
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,067
bleeding from the throat,

828
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,000
dead today.

829
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Very, very dead.

830
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,980
D

831
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:53,980
Oh, God.

832
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,980
- Are you okay?

833
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,980
- Yeah, I'm fine, but, God,

834
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,820
everyone keeps asking me that.

835
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,680
It's, like, hysterical.

836
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:58,980
Am I okay?

837
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,980
Yes, I'm fine.

838
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,908
I just dropped my...

839
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:01,980
I just dropped my ice.

840
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,457
But, you know, I think

841
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:02,980
I should probably, like...

842
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,008
I should probably just chill

843
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:04,980
for tonight, so I'm gonna...

844
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,980
- Wait, wait, we're gonna...

845
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,562
- That thing just looked at me,

846
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:09,980
and you still wanna hook up?

847
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,955
I... I really...

848
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:14,980
I really don't think

849
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,368
that we should do that,

850
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:17,980
so, yeah, I'm just gonna...

851
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,980
d

852
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh.

853
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh.

854
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,580
Mm.

855
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,980
d

856
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,980
d

857
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,980
You can't do this anymore.

858
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,110
You are going to go home,

859
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,980
gonna be a new person.

860
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,000
It never happened to you, so...

861
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,980
D f

862
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,980
Where's my ID?

863
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,619
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

864
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,980
Where's my ID?

865
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,655
Where's my fucking ID?

866
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:17,980
No, no, no.

867
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,980
- Are you gonna read it again?

868
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,268
No.

869
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,980
Oh, my God.

870
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,513
Why am I back

871
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:34,980
in this fucking room?

872
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,184
- Maybe you're

873
00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:37,980
not done with it yet.

874
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,980
- I am 100% done with it, yeah.

875
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:41,980
So are you doing this to me?

876
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,980
Did you do this?

877
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,486
- Well, I don't know.

878
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:45,980
I'm just laying here.

879
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,195
- Are you even Alex?

880
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:47,980
Because I'm...

881
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,257
- I mean, you think I am,

882
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,980
so, yeah, I'm Alex.

883
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,185
- You are being way too casual

884
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:53,980
about this mindfuck!

885
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,026
Where's my ID, and why am I

886
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:55,980
holding your stupid book?

887
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,980
- You don't remember?

888
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,647
- You drank

889
00:34:58,687 --> 00:34:59,980
just as much as I did.

890
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,000
Stop judging me!

891
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,214
Okay, if I left my ID

892
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:03,980
in this room,

893
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,980
I am so screwed.

894
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,120
Oh, my God, I cannot remember

895
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,980
anything after dinner.

896
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,980
Like, what the fuck did we do?

897
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,684
It's just these little flashes

898
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:09,980
in my memory.

899
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,980
- That's good.

900
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,525
That means you didn't

901
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:12,980
totally black out.

902
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,980
That's a positive, right?

903
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,008
- You were there that night.

904
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:16,980
Can't you tell me anything?

905
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,766
- Cassie, I think we both get

906
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:19,980
that I'm not exactly

907
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,316
the Alex you were with

908
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:21,980
that night.

909
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,980
- But... wait a minute.

910
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,662
Where's the...

911
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:30,000
Where's the blood?

912
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,404
Where's all the blood?

913
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:32,980
- Cassie.

914
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:34,980
Cassie, it's me.

915
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,000
Yummy food.

916
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,017
Okay, missed you tonight.

917
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:50,980
If you want it, call me.

918
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,260
Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie.

919
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,000
Please pick up, Annie, please.

920
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,980
- Hey, fancy lawyer,

921
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,980
We're ready for you.

922
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,980
- Come on, Annie.

923
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,794
- It's Annie.

924
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:09,980
That's all you get.

925
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,016
- All right, so Alex Sokolov,

926
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:29,980
vice president of operations

927
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,980
at this Unisphere Asset place.

928
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,980
Wall Street, huh?

929
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,000
- Van, please, space.

930
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,480
So lots of travel

931
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,980
to China, Cyprus.

932
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,390
Foreign agent, foreign assets?

933
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,980
- Or maybe he just...

934
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,149
- Yeah, go ahead and draw

935
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:44,980
that straight line

936
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,455
connecting China

937
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:45,980
and Cyprus for me.

938
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,980
I'll wait.

939
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,460
Bangkok police are checking

940
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,980
17 million security cameras.

941
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,724
All has to go

942
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:52,980
through state, though.

943
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,987
- Mm, so we get the fun job

944
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:54,980
of quizzing the flight crew

945
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,000
when they land.

946
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,844
- I got a pal at CIA

947
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:58,980
who says flight attendants

948
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,961
are the most likely

949
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:00,980
to be foreign assets

950
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,295
because of

951
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:02,655
the unfettered travel.

952
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,323
- One of these

953
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:03,980
Imperial Atlantic employees

954
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,324
is secretly a spy

955
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:06,980
with all the answers.

956
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,980
Come on, Kimmy.

957
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,307
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

958
00:37:10,347 --> 00:37:11,980
Do you have a desk?

959
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,980
D

960
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,980
- Yes, I'll tell them.

961
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,271
- Watch your step.

962
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:22,980
Thank you.

963
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,980
- Thanks.

964
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,040
- Oh, my God,

965
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,980
I'm so happy to be home.

966
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,719
- So they would like

967
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:31,000
the first class cabin crew

968
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,522
to wait at Gate B31

969
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:34,980
after we're clear.

970
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,906
Apparently the authorities

971
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:38,980
would like to speak with us.

972
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,689
Um...

973
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:42,980
The police?

974
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,390
- That's usually what

975
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,980
"the authorities" means.

976
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,395
- Why would they

977
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:48,980
wanna speak to us?

978
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,207
I mean, we're just...

979
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:51,980
We're just flight attendants.

980
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,980
- Ladies and gentlemen,

981
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,065
welcome to John F. Kennedy

982
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,000
International Airport.

983
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
- Paging Cassandra Bowden.

984
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
- Cassandra Bowden?

985
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,229
Cassandra Bowden, may I ask

986
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:28,000
where you're heading?

987
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,666
- Cassandra Bowden,

988
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:33,000
please report to gate B31.

989
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,980
- Did you, like, try and flee?

990
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:43,000
Fuck off.

991
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,540
- Should we get more?

992
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:55,980
- Yes.

993
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,502
- I think so too.

994
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:56,980
Can we get more?

995
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
- Megan Briscoe.

996
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
D

997
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,980
- Honestly, I don't think

998
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,666
I even spoke

999
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:14,980
with Mr. Sokolov, so...

1000
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,666
- So, wait, was he some kind

1001
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:17,980
of weird sleeper agent

1002
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,980
for the Russian government?

1003
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,786
- This is... I'm tired.

1004
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:28,980
Can I go?

1005
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,980
- I studied Russian.

1006
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,389
- Are you allowed

1007
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:35,929
to say how he was killed?

1008
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,980
Because I'm so curious.

1009
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,842
- If I had

1010
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,980
any pertinent information

1011
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,980
pertaining to this case,

1012
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,573
of course I would tell you,

1013
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:42,980
but no.

1014
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,555
- Well, he's the type

1015
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:43,980
that would order

1016
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,521
an extra olive,

1017
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,980
if you know what I mean.

1018
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,980
Pure downtown fluff.

1019
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,758
- Oh, Cassie?

1020
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:52,000
- Cassie.

1021
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,771
Yes, he spoke

1022
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:54,980
a lot to Cassie, 3C.

1023
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,980
- Cassie?

1024
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,196
Yes, I believe that Cassie

1025
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:00,980
did take care of him.

1026
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,172
I mean... not took care of him.

1027
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:04,980
She dealt with him more.

1028
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,927
Yes, yes,

1029
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:08,980
she spoke with him more, yes.

1030
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,934
- He was really hot,

1031
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:12,980
so I don't blame her.

1032
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,980
- They were flirting...

1033
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,980
heavy... a lot.

1034
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,980
- Yes, she's my best friend.

1035
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,111
- You should

1036
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:22,980
take that... flirting.

1037
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,980
- No, I don't know

1038
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,980
where she went after we landed,

1039
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,980
so, no, that's...

1040
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,545
Basically, that's none

1041
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:37,980
of my business, so...

1042
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,980
but, um...

1043
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,000
All right, listen.

1044
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,755
- So what is

1045
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:50,000
this room used for?

1046
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,651
- I think it's some kind

1047
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,000
of security office.

1048
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,839
Yeah, dolphin's

1049
00:40:58,879 --> 00:40:59,980
kind of creepy, huh?

1050
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,517
Ms. Bowden,

1051
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:01,980
I'm Special Agent Kim Hammond.

1052
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,000
This Special Agent Van White.

1053
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,332
Let me start

1054
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:05,980
by gently pointing out

1055
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,980
that fleeing an interview

1056
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,666
is not the best way

1057
00:41:08,706 --> 00:41:09,980
for us to meet.

1058
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,367
- Oh, no, I wasn't fleeing.

1059
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:12,980
- Yeah.

1060
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,850
The rest of the first class

1061
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,980
cabin crew waited as requested.

1062
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,980
- Yeah, I know.

1063
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,980
These international flights,

1064
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,729
they just turn my brain

1065
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:20,980
to mush.

1066
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,098
I was on autopilot,

1067
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:24,980
but I'm here now.

1068
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,000
- We appreciate your time.

1069
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,895
- Do you think I need

1070
00:41:28,935 --> 00:41:29,980
my union rep or anything?

1071
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,368
- Do you think you need

1072
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:32,980
your union rep or anything?

1073
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,669
- This is just

1074
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:34,980
a simple, cursory interview

1075
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,647
to get some

1076
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:36,980
background information

1077
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,085
on Alexander Sokolov's

1078
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:38,980
travel to Bangkok,

1079
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,460
and, frankly, we could just

1080
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,980
really use your cooperation.

1081
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,980
- Oh, of course.

1082
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,500
I don't know why

1083
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,440
I'm so nervous.

1084
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,980
I wanna help, so...

1085
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,980
- Good.

1086
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,980
So you spoke to Mr. Sokolov.

1087
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,647
- You know,

1088
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,980
we spoke a few times...

1089
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,303
Like, drink orders

1090
00:41:57,343 --> 00:41:58,980
and that kind of thing.

1091
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,084
- Did you see Mr. Sokolov after

1092
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:02,980
the flight landed in Bangkok

1093
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,980
outside of the airport?

1094
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,000
- Why would I...

1095
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,579
- I think they know

1096
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:13,980
you're lying.

1097
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:15,980
Know you're lying.

1098
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,980
- Damn it, not now.

1099
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,980
- So tricky.

1100
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,562
What would your lawyer friend...

1101
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:21,982
What's her name, Annie?

1102
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,980
What would Annie say?

1103
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,453
- Okay, what do you mean?

1104
00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:24,960
How do you know about Annie?

1105
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,593
-Oh, there's all kinds

1106
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:25,980
of information

1107
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,980
tucked away in here.

1108
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,980
- Okay, listen, I blacked out.

1109
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,980
I blacked out.

1110
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,885
If I don't remember it,

1111
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:31,980
then it didn't happen, okay?

1112
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,424
That's the answer.

1113
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:32,980
That's just what it is.

1114
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,248
Hey, whoa, whoa,

1115
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:35,980
whoa, whoa, whoa, um...

1116
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,980
- What?

1117
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,894
- I didn't know

1118
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:39,980
you could do that.

1119
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:40,980
I'm dead.

1120
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,980
I'm not missing my legs.

1121
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,565
- Okay, seriously,

1122
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:43,980
what is this?

1123
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,986
Am I going fucking insane?

1124
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:46,980
Where are we?

1125
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I... oh, no.

1126
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,883
- I think you remember

1127
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:05,980
more than you think you do.

1128
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,985
- Mmm.

1129
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:12,980
- See?

1130
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,554
You do like squid ink pasta,

1131
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:14,854
or you're pretending.

1132
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,887
Thank you.

1133
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,980
- Very good, thank you.

1134
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,000
Squid ink.

1135
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,443
- My business associate

1136
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:20,980
might stop by later tonight

1137
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,750
to chat about

1138
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:22,980
our meeting tomorrow.

1139
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,980
- Oh, my God.

1140
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,980
There was someone else there.

1141
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,980
Who was that woman?

1141
00:43:48,305 --> 00:44:48,464

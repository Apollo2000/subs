3
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:21,654
Max, come on! Max!

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,614
You couldn't just invent
a narrative about me.

5
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,033
You're doing it to yourself as well.

6
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,714
Annie.
Annie, is Max okay?

7
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:44,010
I know you're probably mad.
But seriously, is he okay?

8
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,138
-We were only trying to...
-We? Okay.

9
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,056
Uh, where are your injuries?

10
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:51,976
Oh, you don't have any.
Great. I told you you could leave.

11
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:55,271
You gotta listen to me.
Alex stole a ton of money from Lionfish

12
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,191
and from his own clients.
Miranda's picture was on their computer,

13
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:59,734
but it said that her name was Elena...

14
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,737
Then maybe it wasn't her. Can you hear
yourself right now, Cassie?

15
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:04,989
You've totally lost it.

16
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:10,036
No, listen to me. Max literally saved my
life. He pushed me out of the way of...

17
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,497
So I just got a call
from a friend at the local precinct,

18
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:14,749
and he told me
that they're holding a 17-year-old girl

19
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,168
who just learned a pretty
fucked-up lesson in driving while high.

20
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:19,670
So no one was chasing you,
and there's no conspiracy.

21
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,297
No, that's impossible...

22
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,591
Really? Because
that's the part that sounds insane!

23
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:27,053
Annie, please. This is way bigger
than any of us even thought.

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,264
So, in the entire history
of our friendship...

25
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,309
-Are we calling it a friendship?
-What?

26
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,561
Anyway, in all that time,
you've never seen me mad.

27
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,481
So I'd back the fuck off if I were you.

28
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:45,196
Did they find a flash drive?
It's a "Hello Kitty" flash drive.

29
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:47,198
Max had it in his pocket.
It was really small.

30
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:51,202
But it has all the information you need.
There is proof on there, I swear.

31
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:54,122
As long as you swear, Cassie.

32
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,207
Annie.

33
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,793
Annie!

34
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,837
Wait. Where is Max?

35
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:03,923
Surgery. Do you understand
the severity of this situation?

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,051
Yes. I'm sorry.
I didn't seem them wheel him out, okay?

37
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:11,764
But where are his clothes? He put
the flash drive in his back pocket.

38
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,142
I watched him do it,
so can you check...

39
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:16,686
Yeah, okay.

40
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,273
-There's nothing. See?
-He did. He put it in...

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,318
No, you don't have any proof, Cassie.
All you have are impossible stories

42
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:28,364
about stalkers and women on trains
and rich parents with guns.

43
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,575
You're the one that told me
about the Sokolovs, okay?

44
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,118
And the proof you need is on that...

45
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,954
Don't you dare say fucking
"Hello Kitty" to me one more time,

46
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,748
I swear to God.
There is no drive, Cassie.

47
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:39,667
We were trying to help you, okay?

48
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:42,962
We were trying to get information
that didn't come from you...

49
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,006
-Oh, you were concerned about me!
-Yes!

50
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:47,967
Oh, my God. Okay. That's great.
Ask me about my day.

51
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,053
So I can tell you about the fucking hell
that I went through for you

52
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,015
-before I even found out about Max.
-What?

53
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:55,558
-Ask me.
-What are you talking about?

54
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:59,812
-Just shut up! Shut up!
-You just told me to ask you!

55
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:07,195
Okay...
So Max is very injured.

56
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:10,531
-And all you can talk about is you.
-That's not true.

57
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:12,575
-I did CPR. I called 911.
-Oh, my God.

58
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:15,787
Congratulations, Cassie, for being
a human and doing the right thing.

59
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:18,206
-That's amazing.
-What else was I supposed to do?

60
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,875
I am sorry.
I did not mean for him to get hurt.

61
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,418
I'm done.

62
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,046
Annie.

63
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,423
Get your shit out of my house.
I'm done.

64
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,983
Cassie? It's pretty late.

65
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,820
Oh, God. Sorry.
I didn't even realize how late it was.

66
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:17,784
So I just thought we should,
like, connect more.

67
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,661
I'm sorry. Are you asking me
to, like, hang out with you?

68
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,997
We should do something, you know?

69
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:25,249
Yeah, I'll see you on the Rome flight.

70
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,834
Wait. The Rome flight? What?

71
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:29,670
In two days?
Girl, you are such a mess.

72
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,424
God.

73
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:40,807
You got Shane.
Leave a message.

74
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:54,028
-Hi, Cassie.
-Hey, Megan. Whatcha doing?

75
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,864
Are you gonna call
every person you know?

76
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:59,408
Are you pathologically incapable
of being alone?

77
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,953
Are you?
I do not wanna be in this room, okay?

78
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,330
I wanna be in the real world
with my real friends.

79
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,375
Good luck with that.
You've alienated everyone in your life.

80
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:10,086
Yeah, you're crazy.
My friends love me.

81
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,172
Do you wanna go get oysters?

82
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:17,343
Just me and you,
like a little girl's oyster night.

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,512
-You okay?
-Yes. I'm totally fine.

84
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,682
In fact, I'm really good. I'm sorry.
This is, like, super last minute.

85
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,767
But you always say we
don't hang out enough.

86
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,270
So I thought,
let's hang out, right?

87
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:29,814
Okay, Cassie. We're both adults.

88
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:33,276
And I can tell the difference
between real excited and fake excited.

89
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,570
-So what do you need?
-Why do you always think

90
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:38,156
-something is wrong?
-Maybe it's because it feels like you

91
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,949
only call me when you need something.

92
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,576
Does it really? That's interesting.

93
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:44,454
Because I thought you wanted me
to call you more.

94
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,416
You know, the way you call me all the
time, leaving me so many messages.

95
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,668
Cassie, I already apologized
for calling so often.

96
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:52,837
You even left me a message in Korean.

97
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:55,173
Yeah. So you're leaving me messages
in other languages,

98
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,759
but I just wanna simply call
you but I guess I can't do that, so...

99
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,344
Korean message? How?

100
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,514
Yeah. You and some guy. Talking.
I don't...

101
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:06,559
You know what?
It was actually Bill and I. Yes.

102
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:11,814
Yes, we had this weird sex thing.
And it's just totally embarrassing.

103
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,983
So could you just delete that for me?

104
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:20,323
Nah. I think I'm gonna keep it.
I'm gonna keep it for fun.

105
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,950
Gonna translate it later
when I feel like it.

106
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:28,915
No, no. No. You know what? Where
are you? I'll meet you for that drink.

107
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,543
You know what? Nope. I'm over it.
Vibe ruined. You ruined it.

108
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,089
-I should've fucking known.
-Cassie? Cassie!

109
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:47,391
I need. I need you. I need...

110
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,978
Hi.

111
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,856
Well, that was a quick answer.

112
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,734
Are you lonely?
Do you wanna see me?

113
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,320
Yes, and absolutely yes.

114
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,617
-All right. See you at my place.
-Okay.

115
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:41,571
No, no, no, no, no.
I do not wanna be in this room.

116
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:43,197
I am leaving!

117
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,332
That's never happened before.

118
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,836
Cassie, you gotta stop
lying to yourself.

119
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,840
No! No, no, no, no.
You stay in there.

120
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:05,261
-And I'm gonna stay out here.
-So here's what we're gonna do.

121
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:08,723
We're just gonna talk this through
like rational adults.

122
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:16,856
You can't ignore me, Cassie.

123
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:26,824
I'm hungry.

124
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,620
Do you wanna get breakfast?

125
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:34,957
Excuse me. Hi. Can we get
some more bottomless mimosas please?

126
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,210
-Yeah.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

127
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:38,961
Can we keep those?

128
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:43,716
You know what? I can't see the bottom
of this. This is, in fact, bottomless.

129
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,260
-You know what's also bottomless?
-What?

130
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,805
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.

131
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,600
Hi, everyone.

132
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:55,728
Oh, she didn't like what she saw.

133
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,772
-Come here.
-Yes.

134
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:03,361
So, we have this weird policy where
we require people to stay fully clothed.

135
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,906
You need to pay and go.

136
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,162
So Cassie went to Alex's apartment,
then came here.

137
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,666
That's right. I saw the guy she was with
pick the lock to get in.

138
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,293
Why is an empty warehouse so important?

139
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:24,048
Maybe they stole all the stuff.
If they had access to a big truck maybe.

140
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:27,510
If they had a big truck, you would've
seen it when you were following her.

141
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,804
Isn't it time for your next shift?

142
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,909
-What?
-What's with the federal raid

143
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:54,537
-of Lionfish?
-Well, thanks to the blonde woman,

144
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,956
they had to clean everything out
overnight.

145
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,292
Hold on.
How the fuck do you know about that?

146
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,670
-Because I'm watching it happen.
-God damn it.

147
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,466
You told Victor you were back in London.
Why are you in New York?

148
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,718
And why does everyone have to
listen to him except for you?

149
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:13,306
I just need to clean things up before
Victor realizes I'm not in London. Kay?

150
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:14,974
Good luck with that.

151
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,810
Oh, come on.
Outside of this, we're friends.

152
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,563
Jesus, I even let you
take care of my cat.

153
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,232
For two years.
It's not your cat anymore.

154
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,528
It's my cat that I never wanted
just like these fuckin' phone calls.

155
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,071
Yeah, okay. Listen.

156
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,867
If Victor asks, I just need you to tell
him that you've seen me in London.

157
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,410
Okay?

158
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:35,995
Would you do that for me?

159
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:38,372
I'll pay you. Cash.

160
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,919
Fine. A few more days.

161
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,504
But that is it.

162
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,256
Feed my cat.

163
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,305
-Ooh, hey, girl!
-Hi, Mick! Hey, babe.

164
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,724
-Hey, can we get two please?
-You a regular or?

165
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:58,643
Uh, you know, just a little.

166
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:06,067
-You know I love this song.
-I know you do, Cassie.

167
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,777
It's my favorite.

168
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,572
-What song is this?
-Here you come again

169
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,992
You know the words too. Sing it.

170
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,037
To get myself together

171
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,625
You waltz right through the door
Just like you've done before

172
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:27,380
And I wrap my heart
Around your little finger

173
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,025
Cassie...

174
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,610
This is not funny.

175
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,822
What the hell are you doing?

176
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:10,965
Cassie!

177
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:24,312
-Hey. Let's go sit over there.
-Okay.

178
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,609
We never go into the city
on our weekly dates. This is fun, huh?

179
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,278
-Mom, where are we going?
-I gotta make a quick stop.

180
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:36,115
But I thought that we could
go to Big Gay Ice Cream. Sound fun?

181
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:38,409
Yeah, I guess. Stop where though?

182
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,287
Cassie has something of mine
that I need to pick up.

183
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,831
And she's not answering
any of texts, so...

184
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:47,627
Oh, my God. Can't this wait until,
I don't know, I'm not involved?

185
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,630
Sorry. I need this right now
so please get over it.

186
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:54,842
Cassie. Cassie is the absolute worst.
Why do you even like her?

187
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,678
'Cause she's my best friend.
Thank you.

188
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:02,100
It's kind of sad how you think this
party monster girl is your best friend.

189
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,018
You know what?
I like her, okay?

190
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:07,396
She does whatever she wants
and revels in it, and people love her.

191
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,232
And Eli, that is...

192
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,403
I just hope
that you never have to experience

193
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,532
feeling unseen or unwanted
in your life, okay?

194
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,704
'Cause if someone was to make you feel
that way, it's just terrible.

195
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,293
Are you even listening to me?

196
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,671
-I found Cassie.
-What?

197
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:36,384
Here she is. At a bar singing
Dolly Parton songs 28 minutes ago.

198
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,595
That is genius.
How did you do that?

199
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,222
So we're going to a bar. Cool.

200
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,474
No. I'm going to a bar.

201
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:45,476
You are going to wait
in the car, young man.

202
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,019
Oh, come on.

203
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,494
Cassie?

204
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:19,844
Cassie!

205
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,737
Behind you, do you see
that guy over there?

206
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,991
-Yeah. The one with the checkered tie?
-Okay. You can see him too?

207
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,826
-Yeah.
-Okay, good,

208
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,496
'cause he's been following me.

209
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:50,458
-This is not the first time.
-So you've got a stalker?

210
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,002
Brag.

211
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:57,882
Thing is... Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I think he's an assassin.

212
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:02,470
Wait. Is this some sort of fantasy
role play thing or something?

213
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:04,263
Okay.

214
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:07,850
Fuck it. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna
ask him. I can't take this anymore.

215
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,977
Wait, ask to see his passport.

216
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,188
Or his license to kill.

217
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:33,668
Hey, hey. Are you stalking me?
Are you trying to kill me?

218
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,211
Because I know all about Lionfish.

219
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:38,714
And I know you've been following me,
so what's up with that?

220
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,178
Wait a minute. Are you FBI?

221
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,014
Just tell me you're FBI,
and then I'll leave you alone.

222
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:50,101
I would love that because
that would mean I was safe!

223
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,811
Okay. This is good.

224
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,195
Wink.
Just give me a wink and then I'll know.

225
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:05,700
Then I'll know.
It's like a sign.

226
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,746
Okay. That was not a wink
but it was something.

227
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:13,332
-You're FBI.
-Nah, I'm just...

228
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,585
Yeah. I knew it.

229
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,713
You're nuts, lady.

230
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:39,025
-Drinks?
-Fresh drinks!

231
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,068
-Okay. Move it over, buddy.
-Hey. Come on in.

232
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,612
Okay.

233
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,489
-So?
-What?

234
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:48,951
-How'd it go with your stalker?
-Oh, no, no. Everything's totally fine.

235
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,954
It's no big deal. It's the FBI.
They're watching me.

236
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,498
-Okay.
-Yeah.

237
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:56,918
I mean, I didn't know I was dating
someone who was so important.

238
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,170
Are we dating now?
Is that what we're doing?

239
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:04,175
Yeah. Okay, okay. What if I say
we should just run away together?

240
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:08,012
Just run away
from everything right now?

241
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,556
What would you say?

242
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:12,892
Um, that's...

243
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:15,311
It's a good question.

244
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,190
I'm gonna think about that answer.
And I'm gonna come back...

245
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,526
-Okay.
-And I'm gonna tell you.

246
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:24,862
I'll tell you my answer
when you get back.

247
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,550
Oh, my God.
This is such bullshit!

248
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:47,927
You can't run away from me.
I'm in your head.

249
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,848
-It's just me and the mess.
-Fine, that's fine. You can be here.

250
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,391
But I don't wanna be in this room.

251
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:56,102
I thought I made that pretty clear
when I ran out the door.

252
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,647
I don't know, but unlike everyone else,
you can't seem to get rid of me.

253
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:02,650
Well, you said no one would
wanna spend time with me.

254
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,193
-You were wrong.
-Sure.

255
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,946
It's been a great night and day
with dead cat guy.

256
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,906
I was talking
about people who know you.

257
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,451
Oh, great. Please.
Share your wisdom please.

258
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,786
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. You get it?

259
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,039
I'm telling you that even
though your life is in real danger,

260
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:20,835
your only wish is that anybody,
literally anybody,

261
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:24,046
had answered your call
because Annie cut you off.

262
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:27,133
That's just sad.

263
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:34,432
It's not... Annie and I...
We'll make up. We'll be fine.

264
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,101
-We're always fine.
-She's done. I saw it. I was there.

265
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:40,146
No. No. I'll prove you wrong.

266
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,148
Hasn't happened yet.

267
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,576
You're the worst.

268
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,308
Hey, hey. Sorry I had you wait out here,
but I found Cassie, got what I wanted...

269
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:18,851
Cool. Whatever, Mom.

270
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:21,354
Well, thank you for your help.

271
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,947
Hey. I gotta go fix things with
my girlfriend, Annie, like, right now.

272
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:34,534
-Oh, yeah. She's your lawyer friend.
-Yeah. Come on. We're leaving.

273
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,077
-Where's my phone?
-Okay.

274
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:37,620
-Are you sitting on it?
-No.

275
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:39,163
Where is it?

276
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,624
It's on the fucking floor.

277
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,752
-I mean...
-Wait. Where are you taking me?

278
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,504
Do you really care where
I'm taking you?

279
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:48,714
No.
I would go anywhere with you.

280
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,134
Good. That's what I thought.
Let's go.

281
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,875
You didn't mention Bowden brought up
Lionfish when you interviewed.

282
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,918
-Are those my notes?
-It's your field report.

283
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,129
-It didn't really register.
-Is it completely lost on you

284
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:31,883
that the warehouse we were standing
in earlier is leased to Lionfish?

285
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,261
How was I to know that one of the crazy
things she's said could be relevant?

286
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:39,390
Bowden was in that warehouse.
And at Unisphere and at the Sokolov's.

287
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:41,684
And all those things, she's
linking in her statement.

288
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:45,229
Try this. Bowden and Sokolov
knew each other in New York.

289
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:48,316
So they were flirting on the plane
because they were already involved.

290
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:52,111
Something went bad in Bangkok
during their marathon love fest.

291
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,824
She snapped. She killed him. Everything
she's been doing since that moment

292
00:21:56,991 --> 00:22:00,453
has been cleaning up any proof that
they knew each other before the flight.

293
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,372
What about everything she said outside
of Sabrina Oznowich's apartment?

294
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,876
If you wanna look into her crazy
statement, then great!

295
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:11,464
That sounds like a really fun project
for you. I'm staying focused on Bowden.

296
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:15,176
Being your partner is really
infuriating sometimes.

297
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:19,931
Come on.

298
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:29,565
So, do you always hang out
in your friends' apartments

299
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:31,109
when they're not home?

300
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,652
No.

301
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:36,155
They gotta come home sometime, right?

302
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,783
-Here. You take that one.
-Thanks.

303
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,326
You're welcome.

304
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,123
She's home.

305
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,208
-Holy fuck. Are you for real?
-Hi.

306
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,669
We need to talk. I had to come here.

307
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,212
-Who's this?
-Yes.

308
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:54,132
This is Buckley.
He is a guy that I am...

309
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:58,428
-Buckley.
-No, you're right. You gotta go.

310
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:01,139
-But we just got here.
-I know. He's gonna leave.

311
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:02,682
Nice to meet you.

312
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:06,519
-He's leaving.
-I'll be right here.

313
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:09,272
Yeah. You should leave.

314
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:13,693
Annie, I am so truly sorry
about what happened.

315
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,236
You have to know that.

316
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:19,323
Yeah, no. You said that already.
And I got it. And I want you to leave.

317
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,410
Any time you and I get bad,
we always... we fix this.

318
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:26,330
Okay, so the man
that I love... fucking fuck.

319
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,040
Yep, okay.

320
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,919
The man that I love is laying in
a hospital bed and it's your fault so...

321
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:36,090
-You love him?
-No, no. This is not a sharing moment.

322
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,764
I'm really sick of having
to excuse you and forgive you

323
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:48,311
'cause I'm not the answer, Cass,
to whatever crazy thing it is

324
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:53,524
that you're trying to drown out with,
like, partying and booze and Buckleys.

325
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:56,235
And what the fuck kind
of name is Buckley?

326
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,905
-It's a family name.
-Okay. Can you go away?

327
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:03,493
Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

328
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,204
-You're sick of forgiving me?
-Yeah.

329
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:10,458
How about me having to forgive you?

330
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,752
I'm sorry. What?

331
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,464
I have forgiven you for so much shit.
I mean, let's think.

332
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:19,634
Oh, yes! Our trip in Cabo
when I fell asleep in the bar,

333
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:23,012
and you left me there!
Yes? Yeah. That was...

334
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:24,847
How about the trip to Palm Springs?

335
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:27,600
That bed... you broke the bed
and then you blamed it on me?

336
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,603
And I paid for it.
Like, what was that?

337
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,731
Okay, so, Cassie,
you got Max hit by a car.

338
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,400
I know.

339
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:43,407
I know.
I feel horrible about it.

340
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:48,788
I'd never... But friends, we mess up,
and then we forgive each other.

341
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:52,375
-And I am only asking for...
-Cassie, let's just be honest.

342
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,086
Our friendship just doesn't work, so...

343
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:59,382
You want honesty?
So I come to you as a friend, right?

344
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,052
And you want me to tell you things.
And I tell you someone's stalking me.

345
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:04,720
And you didn't believe me.

346
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:08,057
What do I do with that?
What about your honesty, Annie?

347
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,976
I still don't know
what you do for work

348
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:12,770
and why you have a creepy
third cell phone from 2004.

349
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:14,981
And I didn't even know Max existed!

350
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,234
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah.

351
00:25:19,193 --> 00:25:20,570
What?

352
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:26,033
You're right.
Maybe... our friendship only works

353
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,538
because... we don't show each other
the messy bits.

354
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:35,209
You never had to call me a liar
and I never had to call you a drunk

355
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,962
but that's what we are, Cass.

356
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:44,927
-I am not a drunk.
-You can barely stand up straight.

357
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:49,098
If you wanna call me names and not
believe what I tell you, that's fine.

358
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:52,351
But you are not better than me.

359
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,313
I didn't say that I...
I just called myself a liar.

360
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,898
God...

361
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,484
Okay. You know what?

362
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:04,614
So I don't have the emotional bandwidth
to fight with you today,

363
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:08,201
'cause I'm a little tapped out.
So I'm done.

364
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:15,583
And I'm gonna need you to get your
puppy from the hallway and leave please.

365
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,381
Kay.

366
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,594
You know what, Annie?
You know what?

367
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:31,599
I did not think this would go like this.

368
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,935
Did your plan go wrong?
I'm so sorry.

369
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:37,105
My heart breaks for you, Cass.
Grow the fuck up, okay?

370
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:43,986
You know, you're gonna feel
really bad when I wind up dead.

371
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:54,038
-Come on. Let's go do something crazy.
-Yeah! Crazy.

372
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:09,720
What the hell is this?
They think this is funny?

373
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,270
This pony is completely chained up here.
It's fucking animal abuse.

374
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,480
It's not a real pony.

375
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:24,193
Symbolism? Ever heard of it?
I don't like what this represents.

376
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:26,737
The world is a messed up place.

377
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:30,533
Hey. But what if we set him free?

378
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:37,248
And we're back!

379
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,459
Look, I get that you're in denial

380
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:43,004
but do you realize what you are about
to do in broad daylight?

381
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:46,966
Do you know why Buckley is
so much better than you?

382
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:51,429
Because he wants me
to be me, you know?

383
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:59,854
He doesn't, like, judge me or he doesn't
question every fucking move I make!

384
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,399
-What do you mean?
-You wanted to do something crazy.

385
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,610
-Let's set him free!
-What do you mean?

386
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:07,695
Just help me, help me, come on.

387
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:11,073
If we get bogged down in logistics,
we'll never do it. Just do it.

388
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,284
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
Too hard.

389
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:18,247
You're about to steal a ride
that's designed for children!

390
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:20,750
Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna tell you a thing.

391
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,585
-You ready to hear a thing?
-Yes.

392
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:26,714
Here it is. I am not gonna
always think about you. Okay?

393
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:31,928
I feel like I should
but I'm not going to because I can't.

394
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:35,723
Because if I keep thinking about you,
I'm gonna go insane.

395
00:28:36,265 --> 00:28:37,850
Do you want me to go insane?

396
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,439
Let's go.

397
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:45,817
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Wait...

398
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:47,360
-Just go!
-Oh, my God.

399
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:53,491
-Hurry up!
-Wait, wait, hold on.

400
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:55,368
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.

401
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:56,911
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

402
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,210
-What the...
-Look at his dumb face.

403
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:07,505
-I am so sorry. I didn't mean to...
-It was...

404
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:11,134
-Hey. They stole my horse!
-No.

405
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:21,185
Fuck! Fuck.

406
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:24,021
-We are justice!
-Hell yeah!

407
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,246
Annie? How's Max?

408
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,290
Jessica...

409
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,334
He's fine.

410
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:50,214
He's fine. You got my message.
Thanks for coming.

411
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:56,763
I just didn't wanna be gone for too
long in case... in case I don't know.

412
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:03,269
I brought you something you can't kill.
I mean, something that won't die.

413
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,646
Oh, my God. I just didn't think
you'd want flowers...

414
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:09,609
It's fine.
Thank you, Jessica. It's fine.

415
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:13,696
Please take this to give to Diana.

416
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:19,494
It's my letter of resignation
from Davis & Carlisle.

417
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:21,078
Oh, wow. Why?

418
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:25,208
Sorry, I mean,
shouldn't you give it to her yourself?

419
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,668
No. Yeah, no.

420
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:31,631
If I go in there, she'll convince me
to stay because I... want to.

421
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:34,759
But I realize that I can't, so...

422
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,512
I don't understand. Is it the firm?

423
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:39,055
I mean, you're so good.

424
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,227
This is cute.

425
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,897
Your name isn't Jessica, is it?

426
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,983
It's Jennifer, actually.

427
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:53,820
Right. That's...

428
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:56,531
Cassie was right.

429
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:58,616
Wow, I fucking hate that.

430
00:31:00,243 --> 00:31:04,205
Why would you let me call you Jessica?
You know what? Don't answer that.

431
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:07,333
Just, you shouldn't let people
tell you who you are.

432
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:12,296
Like, for instance, my name's actually
pronounced Ah-nie. It's Armenian.

433
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:15,716
But when I was little,
kids just started calling me Annie

434
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:17,885
and so my name just kind of changed.

435
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,596
Do you not like Annie?

436
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,224
Look, what people call you
is important, okay?

437
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:27,520
Like, I don't know.
Say they call you an ace lawyer.

438
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:31,357
And one day, you just fucking
withhold discovery.

439
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:33,776
Or start meeting with clients
in meat lockers.

440
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:35,736
And then suddenly a woman eating
a rare steak

441
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:38,739
is just, like, asking you
to murder a man. And that happens.

442
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:40,491
-Oh, my God.
-What?

443
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:42,952
Wow, sorry. That...

444
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:53,588
Please just don't let people like Diana
or like me tell you who you are. Okay?

445
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:57,633
I don't think
I can just become a Jessica,

446
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:00,303
but I'll miss working for you.

447
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:02,638
And I'll give this to Diana.

448
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,289
Breathing is so important.

449
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:33,628
We can forget to be present and just
experience this moment. This now.

450
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:36,464
-Oh, shit.
-It's happening to you.

451
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:56,984
-It can seem elusive...
-Fuck you.

452
00:32:57,151 --> 00:33:00,029
You have to let go of the worries
that are beyond your control.

453
00:33:00,196 --> 00:33:03,991
Every breath becomes a wave of comfort
washing over you,

454
00:33:04,158 --> 00:33:06,202
washing over
your present circumstances.

455
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:07,995
You have the power to stop...

456
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:49,787
You're doing it right now, you know?
You don't even realize it.

457
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:03,968
You don't even realize it.

458
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,639
-Why is it changing?
-Let's go. He's not coming.

459
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:11,768
-Yes, he is.
-He's probably getting drunk somewhere.

460
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:14,520
-Shut up, Davey.
-If he cared, he'd be here.

461
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:17,690
He just doesn't care about you
because all you do is complain!

462
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:20,943
In fact, he hates you. And so do I.

463
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,946
Stop!

464
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:44,842
Hand cake.

465
00:34:45,176 --> 00:34:46,886
Stop. Don't do that.

466
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,889
-What's going on with your memory?
-No, you're doing this to me.

467
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,516
Whatever this is, you're doing it.

468
00:34:51,682 --> 00:34:54,018
-Double fist!
-Dad, you're gonna ruin it.

469
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:55,561
-Let go of me.
-Dad...

470
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:59,732
-What's wrong with you?
-Come on! We were playing around.

471
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:01,776
It was an accident.
You two are so uptight.

472
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:05,029
And you're too full of beer to know
what you're doing, Hank. Jesus.

473
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:06,572
Get up. You're not hurt.

474
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,536
Get the hell up.

475
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:17,792
-Why did that change?
-This is what really happened.

476
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,253
No. This is not what happened.
We were having fun.

477
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,589
That was my fault. I started that.
I don't wanna see this!

478
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:25,550
What the hell is that noise?

479
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:33,975
No.

480
00:35:34,142 --> 00:35:35,977
This is what really happened.

481
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:39,230
She's just a child.
You act like she's your drinking buddy.

482
00:35:39,397 --> 00:35:42,275
I'd drink with my son
if he wasn't such a little fag.

483
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:46,070
God!

484
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:49,365
No, no, no.

485
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,778
Hello?

486
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:28,404
This is a collect call

487
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:32,033
from the 120th Street Correctional
Facility in New York.

488
00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:34,327
To accept, say "Accept."

489
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,454
I'll accept.

490
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:40,124
Cassie?

491
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:45,171
Uh, hey.
This is my one phone call. So...

492
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:46,964
I'm your phone call?

493
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:48,841
Yeah.

494
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:52,595
Wait, isn't there someone closer
that you could... like Annie?

495
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:58,101
No. I'm just...I just need to talk
to you real quick. Don't worry.

496
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:03,231
Well, I wish I could, like, I wish
I didn't have to... Are you all right?

497
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:05,108
I'm fine.

498
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:07,151
Cassie, you're not fine.

499
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:10,696
This is not a fine phone call.

500
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:15,785
So here's the thing...

501
00:37:19,163 --> 00:37:22,041
All these years,
I thought you were so crazy.

502
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:26,379
Like, I treated you
like you were crazy, you know?

503
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,592
Your version of our childhood
was just so unreal.

504
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,430
Like it was not real to me.

505
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:43,813
And I can't change what Dad did,
you know, and how he acted

506
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,567
but I think I was part of it.

507
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:53,656
And I was so wrong.
I am so, so, so sorry, you know?

508
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:58,619
I'm starting to think
that it was kind of my fault.

509
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:00,663
-No.
-And I'm so sorry.

510
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:06,377
No. I never... I never thought that.

511
00:38:07,545 --> 00:38:10,590
I just remember Dad being so good.

512
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:14,260
I really wanted him to be good.

513
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:20,266
I know. We all do what we can...

514
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:26,647
Listen. Do you wanna
tell me what's going on?

515
00:38:26,814 --> 00:38:29,233
Because I know something is going on.

516
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:32,069
-Maybe I can help.
-No.

517
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:35,740
Just, you know,
ruining my life one person a time.

518
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:39,911
-I can't drag you into that.
-You can. You can, yes.

519
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,165
You can drag me into this 'cause what's
the point of having a big brother if...

520
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:46,501
You know,
gotta be good for something.

521
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,963
I just have to figure some stuff out.
Really.

522
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:52,673
It's gonna be okay.

523
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,134
Right. Cassie...

524
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:00,681
You know I love you.

525
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:07,188
It's not okay how Dad treated you.

526
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:11,859
I know.

527
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:15,154
I know.

528
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:19,534
But it's not okay
how he treated you either.

529
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:27,875
Yeah... Okay. I gotta go now.
I love you. I gotta go now.

530
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:42,849
You know, I didn't realize
when you joined the swim team,

531
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,935
it meant that I would be
waking up with you.

532
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,856
Thank you for that.

533
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:53,860
-Here. I made this for you.
-Thanks.

534
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:58,114
And don't chug it all at once or else
you'll be bouncing off the walls, okay?

535
00:39:58,281 --> 00:40:00,783
Ma, for what it's worth,
I actually had fun playing detective

536
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,662
with you yesterday.
You can be pretty cool.

537
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:06,205
Sometimes.

538
00:40:06,372 --> 00:40:07,915
-Good luck today.
-Thanks.

539
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,335
-No.
-What are you doing up so early?

540
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:16,632
There's some computer issue at work.
They need me now.

541
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:21,596
-Right now?
-Yes, right now.

542
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:25,683
-What comp...
-I don't know.

543
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:27,852
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

544
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,230
-I love you, baby.
-Love you too.

545
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:35,735
Hey, Bowden. Wake up.

546
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,112
You posted bail.

547
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:39,781
I... Really?

548
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,329
Who posted it? Was it Buckley,
that guy I came in with?

549
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:49,665
-I don't even know his last name.
-No. He's still being held.

550
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:53,294
Get up. Let's go.
Whole world's waiting.

551
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:23,658
We need to talk.

552
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:32,354

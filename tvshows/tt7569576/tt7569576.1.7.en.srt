2
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:14,313
Oh, God, oh, God.
Yeah. Sure, that's cool!

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,691
A really creepy alley where
they can find my body. That's good.

4
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:20,194
Can I have maybe one final request?
Like a vodka, or a please don't kill me

5
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:22,822
sort of a request?

6
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,992
I have had a really rough day,
so just get on the ground,

7
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:29,870
palms down,
and tell me where the hell it is.

8
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:31,414
-The money?
-Yeah.

9
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:34,875
I don't know.
I am just a flight attendant. Okay?

10
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:39,797
-I slept with a guy who I met...
-Okay, that is a bottle.

11
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:43,801
This is a gun.

12
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:46,804
-Now tell me, who do you work for?
-Imperial Atlantic.

13
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:50,808
Do not tell me that you're
a fucking flight attendant again!

14
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:57,023
People want me dead,
and all I want is the fucking money.

15
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,942
-So where is it?
-I don't know.

16
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:04,155
All I know is you are a homicidal crazy
person who's gonna kill me right now

17
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:06,157
the same way you killed Alex,
and Sabrina, and who knows...

18
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:07,950
Sabrina?
I didn't kill Sabrina

19
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:11,037
or the FBI agent
who was following you around.

20
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:13,664
-Checkered tie guy is dead?
-Stop acting!

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,753
I didn't kill either of them.
And I sure as hell didn't kill Alex!

22
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:20,379
You did!

23
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,222
No, I didn't, no.
No, I did not kill him, okay,

24
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:32,975
Miranda, or Elena, or whatever
the hell your name is, okay?

25
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,486
Elena?
How do you know that name?

26
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:48,324
My friend, Max, we found pictures
of dead people in the Lionfish servers,

27
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:54,747
and it was Alex, and it was me,
and it was you.

28
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,290
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,295
You really are
just a flight attendant, aren't you?

30
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:05,883
-Yes.
-Wow. We are so fucked.

31
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,386
What?

32
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:11,931
So fucked!

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,074

34
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,545
Okay, I need you to tell me
everything that happened

35
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:27,798
with Alex in that hotel suite.
No detail is too small.

36
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,969
No, you know what? First,
you need to tell me about Alex.

37
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,556
I know you smuggle weapons, and
I know he helped you launder money,

38
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:37,391
and I know about Lionfish.
All that stuff, so...

39
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,268
-Okay, that is quite a lot.
-Yeah.

40
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,229
I thought you said
you were just a flight attendant.

41
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:44,148
Don't underestimate flight attendants.
We do more than serve drinks.

42
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,733
We're here for your safety.

43
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,527
So until you answer my questions,
I'm not answering yours.

44
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,446
Fine.

45
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,159
A few weeks ago, I had drinks with Alex,
probably too many,

46
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:58,955
and I complained about my boss,
and I probably said too much

47
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:01,332
about the smuggling operation.
And then, all of a sudden,

48
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,085
Alex is shocked and very angry.

49
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,795
He's angry?
What does that mean?

50
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,964
What, he didn't know he was working
with criminals? Or what?

51
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:10,841
Well, no.
I mean, Alex is a boy scout.

52
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,179
His parents kept him in the dark
about Unisphere. This is a bar.

53
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:18,099
You can't just whip out
your purse vodka.

54
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:21,269
Please just keep talking
about how Alex was good.

55
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,437
-I also enjoy being good.
-Holy shit!

56
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:29,777
So yeah, I fucked up.
You know, said too much,

57
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:32,780
and he started digging, and then,
he was broken

58
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:34,615
'cause he found out Mommy
and Daddy were dirty.

59
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:36,367
-I...
-Shut up.

60
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:39,453
-What?
-No. This is where you come in, right?

61
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:44,792
Alex decides to be a hero, and he hides
a bunch of his clients' money,

62
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,752
then flies off to Bangkok.

63
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:54,218
-Sorry.
-Okay. Next round's on me, okay?

64
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:57,972
Let's just pray that my credit card does
not get declined. I'll be right back.

65
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,475
Alex, I have hidden it
from Victor for now,

66
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,562
but you didn't just take
from us, right?

67
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:08,190
Your other clients will want
your head on a stick.

68
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:11,444
-And they'll hunt me down like you did?
-Or maybe they already have.

69
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:15,489
This blonde could be anyone
sent to seduce you.

70
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,533
Please, come on.

71
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,579
Plus, if they want their money back,

72
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:23,664
they can't touch me.
It's like insurance.

73
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,167
Are you going to the authorities?

74
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,754
I don't know yet,
but it feels great that I did something.

75
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,925
It feels fantastic
that I didn't just sit back and say,

76
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:36,052
"well, I guess I'm a criminal now."

77
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:38,888
I deserve shots.

78
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:41,474
Just give me the money, right?

79
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,310
I'll just tell Victor that, you know,
it was a mistake.

80
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:47,104
-Or you'll keep it for yourself.
-Please.

81
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:52,151
Guys, guess what? My card wasn't
declined, so I got multiple drinks.

82
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,321
Cheers.
It's so nice to meet you.

83
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,074
And cheers to you.
You're so cute.

84
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:03,037
He was right, by the way. I was
trying to get the money for myself.

85
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:05,414
Okay, well,
I don't remember any of that.

86
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:09,377
-Seriously, how are you not dead yet?
-Well, that's a very good point.

87
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:12,004
Please, if you didn't kill everyone,
then who did?

88
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,882
I think my boss, Victor,
was behind all of this.

89
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,426
And he must've figured out
that I stayed in New York

90
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:21,806
when he told me to leave, and he hired
a goon to murder me in my car,

91
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:26,143
and he probably used his pet psychopath,
Feliks, to kill Alex.

92
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,896
-I was killed by a Feliks?
-Yeah.

93
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,569
Victor said he had
a contingency plan for you.

94
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:39,699
Feliks is now your problem. He's
probably out looking for you right now.

95
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,245
-Sorry.
-Okay... I think I'm understanding

96
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:47,206
this a little bit and I really, really
don't wanna get killed,

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,876
so, um, I think I have an idea.

98
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,878
-Cassie.
-Miranda, listen.

99
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,755
-We can still help each other out.
-Cassie!

100
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:57,174
-Cassie, what the fuck are you doing?
-I know this looks like a bad situation,

101
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:58,885
-but hear me out.
-You really think I'd be out there

102
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,428
if you felt like things were going well?

103
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:02,263
I've been listening to you.
I'm trying to make better choices.

104
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,640
You're day drinking
with a woman who kills people.

105
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,851
Oh, my God,
I'm barely even drinking.

106
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:09,979
We both know you haven't hit
the bottom even if you don't admit it.

107
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:14,317
Alex, I cannot keep living
in fear, okay? Or I will go crazy,

108
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,819
and I know this looks insane, but
this woman has information I need.

109
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,155
-I don't want you to get hurt.
-But she didn't shoot me.

110
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:22,825
I promise to be careful.
But can you please

111
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,620
keep your negative attitude to yourself?
And stay out of my way!

112
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:29,957
I'm waiting for the master plan
that keeps us alive.

113
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:38,507
Another dead end with Lionfish.

114
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,092
You're still digging?

115
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,762
Aren't you the one who said
this would be a good project for me?

116
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,388
Right,

117
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:47,558
but how many dead ends do you have to
hit before you realize it's not a thing?

118
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:50,019
-Especially now?
-What does that mean?

119
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,562
I'm glad you asked.

120
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,357
I requested info on Cassandra Bowden
from all law enforcement agencies,

121
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:57,902
and it turns out she's cracking.
Drunk and disorderly, vandalism.

122
00:07:58,402 --> 00:08:00,446
Trying to steal a mechanical pony.

123
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,574
-You got this from NYPD?
-Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,410
She has a tail agent. Why aren't
we hearing about this from Chavez?

125
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,373
-That guy is such a flake.
-Why don't you track him down?

126
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,792
Remind him what his job is?

127
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,679
Fuck.

128
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,432
Ignore me, please.
I'm sorry. I'm just, um...

129
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,686
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say "fuck".

130
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,657
Motherfucker!

131
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,661
Okay, I think she's coming down.

132
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:51,998
I know I agreed to this, but now
that we are out in the open,

133
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,958
it is feeling less like a good idea.

134
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,128
Listen, this is the best plan. Annie's
amazing. She's gonna help us.

135
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,172
No matter how mad she is at me,
she'll do the right thing.

136
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,384
-And you're sure we can trust her?
-I don't even know if I can trust you.

137
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:04,927
-Fair point.
-So let's...

138
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,222
-I'm sorry. Is that very important?
-It is actually.

139
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,349
It's my friend I got arrested with.
I don't want him to worry.

140
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,893
I just... sorry.

141
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:15,646
-Buckley?
-Oh, my God. Hi, are you okay?

142
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:18,316
-Where are you? I'll come meet you.
-Oh, no, no.

143
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:21,068
I'm home sleeping it off, you know?

144
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,365
Okay, you know
you don't have to lie to me.

145
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:33,497
Look, I feel like we have somethin' kind
of amazing, and, I wanna see you.

146
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:37,585
All right, that's a little intense, and
I mean, you don't really know me.

147
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:42,089
-But the stuff I do know is great.
-Okay, getting drunk and arrested?

148
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:47,386
-Not great.
-We don't have to always do that.

149
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:54,101
What about running away together?
I know I was drunk, but I meant that.

150
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,314
I really like you, like, maybe a lot,
but I'm realizing

151
00:09:58,522 --> 00:10:02,109
I only call you when I'm drunk,
or sad, or lonely; that's not good.

152
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,862
Cassie, that means
I make you feel better.

153
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:11,827
My life is a lot right now, okay?
And I need to make different choices.

154
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,997
And I can be a different choice
for you.

155
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:18,960
Listen, two weeks ago, I would've
thought this was fucking perfect, but...

156
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,839
I think we gotta stop
before this gets really started.

157
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,845
I, um, I don't understand.

158
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,642
I don't really understand either,
to be honest.

159
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:36,644
Thanks for clearing things up.

160
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,187
No, I'm so...

161
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:44,151
-Don't even, please.
-Is that her?

162
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:47,280
-She doesn't look very happy.
-Annie!

163
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,574
Thank you so much
for coming out. Thank you.

164
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,994
-How is Max doing?
-Oh, he got hit by a car.

165
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,788
Didn't you know?
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.

166
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,874
Listen, I said some
really horrible things to you.

167
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,503
I was very drunk, which is
no excuse. I was very drunk,

168
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:06,465
but no matter how much shit you and
I have on the table, I still love you.

169
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,636
I love you so much, and I am sorry

170
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,514
for everything,
but especially for Max.

171
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:17,310
I know how much you love him, and it
was my fault. I made a terrible choice.

172
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:20,229
I put him in danger,
and I regret every second of it.

173
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:23,858
I do, and you have to know
how badly I want him to be okay.

174
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,527
Please know that.

175
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,159
No, yeah.

176
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,078
Yeah, I know that.

177
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,164
-I know that.
-I am so sorry.

178
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,000
Fuck!

179
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:49,383
-I was... very scared about Max.
-I know.

180
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,305
Fuck, Cass. I don't...
even at the end of my rope,

181
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:57,558
I should have tried to help.
I should've fucking listened.

182
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,393
I'm sorry.
I was really fucking angry.

183
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:01,562
No, it's okay.
I know, and I'm so...

184
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:04,565
Sorry to interrupt the Lifetime movie
of the week, but we are...

185
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:07,526
-We don't have much time.
-Uh-huh, okay.

186
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,656
Cool. I'm sorry.
Who is this?

187
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:14,825
This is Miranda.
The Miranda.

188
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,332
I'm so...

189
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,961
-She's, like, a real person?
-I told you she was real.

190
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,546
-But remember, I told you.
-I know. I know you told me that.

191
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,924
Hi.

192
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:34,178
Did you pick
into my friend's apartment?

193
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:37,848
-Definitely, yes. For work.
-For work. She did it for work.

194
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,433
She knows the truth.
Listen to me.

195
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,853
She knows that Alex was killed
over stolen money,

196
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,856
which completely exonerates me,
so in exchange for her help,

197
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:49,110
we need you
to negotiate protection for her.

198
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,778
-She wants immunity?
-Yeah.

199
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:52,488
You can do that, right?
I told her you could do that.

200
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,283
She's got info for the FBI that
she could trade. I'm talking Lionfish,

201
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,785
weapons.
There's a lot of stuff.

202
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,709
-Have you ever committed a crime?
-Yes.

203
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,211
Have you ever knowingly lied
to a law enforcement officer?

204
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:11,173
-Yes.
-Have you ever stolen identities,

205
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,886
traveled under falsified documents,
ever carried an illegal weapon?

206
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:17,847
-Yeah, to all of that.
-Okay, have you ever killed someone?

207
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,308
Definitely, yes.
Yesterday was the most recent.

208
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,185
-Okay, yesterday.
-I know, Annie. She knows the truth.

209
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:26,022
-This could help me.
-I get that, but I can't just walk

210
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:29,317
someone like her into the FBI and, like,
magically make this all go away.

211
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,444
-Are you kidding?
-Well, you said she could help, so...

212
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,363
Okay, listen, you defend
all those mob wives. Why not her?

213
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,450
Because she fucking straight up
legit killed people, Cassie.

214
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,993
Oh, God.

215
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,746
Also, there's a tiny glitch 'cause
I don't exactly have the muscle

216
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:43,414
of the firm behind me
at the moment, so...

217
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:46,167
-What do you mean? What?
-I quit.

218
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:49,045
I quit, I don't know. Fucking crisis
of morality, psychotic break.

219
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,297
-Does it even matter? I quit, so...
-Annie...

220
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,051
-Don't worry about that.
-I was hoping that you could maybe...

221
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,056
Anything. Anything.

222
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,436
No, I mean, yes.
Yes, okay.

223
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:08,397
Okay, yeah... no.
We can figure something out.

224
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,944
It might take a little longer. But I'm
still a motherfucking lawyer, right?

225
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,863
Okay, so, um...here's the plan.

226
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:24,121
You're gonna go to a hotel,
the Mondrian,

227
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:26,624
and you're gonna wait there.

228
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,461
And just let me make some calls, okay?

229
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:33,756
She's gonna help us. She's gonna take
a little time like she said, okay?

230
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,299
So give it a sec here.

231
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:39,845
So if we sit in a hotel, Feliks will
find and kill you and probably me,

232
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,181
just like he did Alex.

233
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,476
And your friend
doesn't seem very confident.

234
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,353
Look...

235
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,566
You tried to help me.
I'm gonna try to help you.

236
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:54,694
I'm gonna run, and you can come too.
If you want.

237
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,488
I'm sorry, what?
You're gonna run away right now?

238
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,700
I can get us out of the country,
off of Feliks' radar,

239
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:04,245
and then, maybe go to Toronto.

240
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,289
-I'm not going to Toronto.
-Or Montreal.

241
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,708
-It really doesn't fucking matter.
-But Annie will...

242
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,751
If Victor finds out that Annie's
trying to help,

243
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:14,422
he will come after her, and you don't
want her to end up like Max.

244
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,177
If we're going, we need to go now,
so go and tell her something, anything,

245
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,389
or I leave you behind and good luck.

246
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,367
We're gonna do the hotel thing
that you said.

247
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:47,413
-Okay, good.
-Mondrian? And...

248
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,667
I'm just gonna check in
under Alessandra Ricci.

249
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,378
Okay, good.
Cass, just please, please promise me

250
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:56,339
that you will just stay safe
and wait there, okay?

251
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:58,132
-Yes, I will.
-Okay, good.

252
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:00,968
Okay, good.

253
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,180
Okay, Jesus.

254
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,141
-I love you.
-I love you too.

255
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:09,477
We'll just figure it out.

256
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,615
Hey.

257
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,158
-Hey.
-Hey, how's it going?

258
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,953
-What do you need?
-I was just checking on you.

259
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:32,792
Is everything okay? You left
this morning in such a rush.

260
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,004
Oh, yeah, yeah, Robbie just needed
some... help with some specs.

261
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,382
Oh, good.

262
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:44,303
Megan, they think there's some sort
of malware on my computer.

263
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:50,142
And they got a whole team of people
here that are trying to decode it.

264
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,853
Sweetheart, it's looking like...

265
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:57,233
like some spyware
from North Korean government.

266
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:01,070
-I mean, how would North Korea even...
-I don't know.

267
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,948
No.
No, no, no.

268
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,534
I mean, you work at a tech company.
Why would they even...

269
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:09,328
Sweetheart,
we do government contracts, all right?

270
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:12,331
They think it's computer espionage
or something.

271
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,751
-Honey, I think they think I did it.
-You?

272
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:20,506
Never, never. I mean, how dare
they even suggest that?

273
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,843
But it's my computer, Meg.
My laptop.

274
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,640
You're the only one that uses it
besides me.

275
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,899
Yeah, but...

276
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,318
I mean,

277
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,278
Bill, it...

278
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,989
Bill?
Honey, are you still there?

279
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,241
-Megan?
-Yes?

280
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,078
When...

281
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,165
when you asked me
to bring my computer home...

282
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,836
No, no, no, no.

283
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,005
Bill, you need to relax, okay?

284
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:05,009
Why don't you just come home early
and we'll just talk all of this out?

285
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,554
Megan, did...
sweetie, did you do this?

286
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,309
Honey, you know I just want
the best for us, right?

287
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,439
You know that, right?
And I know

288
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:23,778
that you would never do anything
to hurt me. Would you?

289
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,660
-Bill?
-Uh, no.

290
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:34,330
Even if I...

291
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:41,712
Please tell me we're not here
to talk to God.

292
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,422
I don't think I could handle that
right now.

293
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,341
I didn't get to pick the place.

294
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,761
I'm having an existential crisis in
a church. What is happening with me?

295
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,347
Okay, my contact agreed to meet.
If we don't worry, we'll be late.

296
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,516
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take this.

297
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,102
-What are you doing? No!
-Just give me it. Just give me it.

298
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,645
-No!
-Give me...

299
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,856
-Hey, it's me.
-Hey, hey, Cassie.

300
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:03,442
Did you get out?
Uh, are you home, or...

301
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:06,779
Yes, yes, I am.
I posted bail.

302
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:09,323
It was a huge misunderstanding.

303
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,158
Okay.

304
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:16,414
-Those sound like church bells.
-Uh, yeah, it is.

305
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,626
Um...it's next door.
It's new.

306
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:24,964
Listen.
I just wanna let you know that I'm okay.

307
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,468
I was talking to Rick.

308
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:35,725
Do you want me to come out there?
I will if you think it's a good idea.

309
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:39,437
No, no, thank you.
Thank you for even offering that.

310
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:41,522
I love you so much.
Listen. I promise I'm gonna call you

311
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:43,274
really, really soon.
What are you...

312
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:47,069
That is my brother, okay?
And you have no idea

313
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:50,156
how fucked up it is that I just had
to lie to him again.

314
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,700
I just turned off location services.
Total amateur hour.

315
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,703
-I am an amateur.
-You are leaving everything behind.

316
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,289
You don't get to say goodbye.
That's not how this works.

317
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,458
Okay, well, you know what?
I'm not quite ready for that yet.

318
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,046
You already live your life
like you're on the run. You'll adjust.

319
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:14,347
Shit, okay.
Come on, let's go. We'll be late.

320
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,188
If everyone can have a seat.
We're gonna get started.

321
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,107
Really, we have to wait until
after Bible study to meet this person?

322
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:26,651
Shut up.

323
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,987
Welcome, everyone.
My name is Sarah, and I'm an alcoholic.

324
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:31,614
No!

325
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,367
We get the help you need to get out
of this right here,

326
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,453
so just sit down
and don't draw attention.

327
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:41,499
-Sarah is my contact, we have to wait.
-Can we go interrupt her real quick?

328
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:46,337
No, we can't fucking interrupt her. Just
sit up and act normal, for fucking hell.

329
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:50,841
... singleness of purpose
and our 3rd tradition, which says...

330
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:52,843
Hey.

331
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,140
Are you sure you don't want to use
this opportunity to speak up?

332
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,851
I think newcomers
are encouraged to participate.

333
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:04,772
Okay, this is a meeting for alcoholics.
We've gone over this.

334
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,483
I'm not an alcoholic. I'm just trying
to not get murdered here...

335
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,695
You're trying to do every reckless thing
on the planet in one day.

336
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,447
Shut up, shut up.
Stop telling me what I'm doing.

337
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,449
-Somebody has to.
-Oh, really, and that's you?

338
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:18,995
You know, you're the reason I'm even
in this mess. I'm doing this for you!

339
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:20,538
You seem tense.

340
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,124
Maybe have another drink
to calm your nerves.

341
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:28,212
One more.

342
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,673
Really?
You pick now to do this to me?

343
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,967
What was all that stuff you said
to Davey last night, huh?

344
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:35,803
Was it all just talk?
'Cause you lied to him again.

345
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,806
I had to. You know, you love to take
everything out of context

346
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,892
and just twist every word I say.

347
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:44,979
I get it, you're just waiting for
someone else to stop drinking for you.

348
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:49,901
I have barely had anything
to drink today. Fuck you!

349
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,278
Of course, I couldn't tell my boss
I didn't remember anything

350
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,780
from the dinner.
It was so embarrassing.

351
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,449
And the story
started to come back to me

352
00:21:56,616 --> 00:22:01,120
from other people. I received an email
from a coworker about my behavior.

353
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,081
What is wrong with you?

354
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,879
So much talk. Blah, blah,
when has talking ever fixed anything?

355
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,493
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna...

356
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,204
I'm not supposed to be in this room.
I'm actually in the wrong place...

357
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,665
It can be hard.
It is hard.

358
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,750
But this is a safe space to share.

359
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:51,212
Uh, yeah, no, I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna share right now.

360
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:55,508
See, you all are ver...
you really change your lives.

361
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:58,678
It's very beautiful and just super
important, but I don't wanna...

362
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,515
I don't need to take that step,
so I'm just gonna head out.

363
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,017
You're new, right?
It's okay.

364
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,521
You're okay.
What's your name?

365
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:11,065
Um, my name?

366
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,985
My name... my name is Alessandra,
and I am not an alcoholic...

367
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,904
so sorry about the rest of you.

368
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,991
My dad might've been. Might have
had a little bit of a problem,

369
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:22,535
but... whoa, don't know
why I just said that.

370
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,745
But you're all staring.
Wow, you're all...

371
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:31,460
well, you're all staring at me,
so I don't know what you want from me.

372
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,004
Fuck.

373
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,464
Oh, God, fuck.

374
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:44,932
Fuck!

375
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,817
Dad...

376
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:39,570
Dad?

377
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,740
Daddy? Daddy!

378
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:58,673
I don't wanna be here.
No!

379
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,277
Alex, don't.

380
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,698
Oh, my God.

381
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,916
I never told anyone
what really happened.

382
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:39,338
Not my mom, not Davey.

383
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:43,843
No one.
Never told anyone that.

384
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:48,890
Everyone found out about the crash
later that day, and...

385
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,561
everyone said what a terrible tragedy
it was,

386
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,564
and what a fuckup my dad was, but...

387
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:02,570
no one knew it was actually my fault.

388
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:04,906
-Cassie, how...
-Alex.

389
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:09,702
-How is this possibly your fault?
-Because I was his drinking buddy.

390
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,664
He only drank like that
when he was with me.

391
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,045
I'm the reason that he's...
that he's dead...

392
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,797
Cause he was spending
that time with me.

393
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:24,842
-No.
-Yes! Yes.

394
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:33,559
And I didn't want anyone to look at me
and to know, so I...

395
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,480
I just ran away.

396
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:42,360
Like it never actually happened to me.

397
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:46,489
Just like I did with you.

398
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:58,501
Like I do with everything, I just...
I... I just run away from everything.

399
00:27:06,217 --> 00:27:10,263
And I...I just don't want to anymore.

400
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:14,725
I don't wanna feel like this anymore.

401
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,146
I can't feel this way anymore.

402
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:36,581
Hey.

403
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,252
"Hey"?

404
00:27:42,587 --> 00:27:45,840
You were hit by a car,
you fucking idiot. I was terrified.

405
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:50,052
You don't just get to say "hey"
when you just...

406
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,471
Fuck it. I love you.

407
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:56,517
-Whoa. Did you just say...
-Yeah, shut up.

408
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:02,899
-Hey.
-Hey!

409
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:08,487
I love you.

410
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,326
-So am I, like, your boyfriend now?
-Okay...

411
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,869
-Officially?
-You know what?

412
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:19,248
It's just I love you, okay?
You need to calm down, you know?

413
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,584
I'm not, like, an entirely
different person now,

414
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:24,211
and you're ruining
a very cute moment, so...

415
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,050
How's Cassie?

416
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,345
I don't know.
That's, um...

417
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:35,473
A very big question.

418
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:40,061
-Is she okay?
-Well, she just showed up with Miranda.

419
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:42,647
-And I agreed to help her...
-With Miranda?

420
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,857
But I called the hotel,
and she hasn't checked in,

421
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:48,236
and she isn't answering her phone,
and she somehow figured out how

422
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:49,820
to turn off her "Find a Friend,"

423
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,572
which means Miranda
must have helped her do that.

424
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:54,700
Oh, boy, that's a lot of information,
and I'm still on morphine.

425
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:57,954
I feel like if she's, you know,
pulling some insane Cassie shit

426
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,665
to try and save her own ass,
I'm just gonna be...

427
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:04,001
Or she's trying to protect you
by keeping you out of it.

428
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,087
Fuck.

429
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,051
I don't know. I feel like there has
to be something that I can do.

430
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,470
I feel like I need to help, and there
has to be something I can do to help,

431
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:17,265
but I just don't know what to do
if she's...

432
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:24,480
Max, I need you to tell me exactly
where you were when you got hit.

433
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:28,693
Fuck.
Fucking hell.

434
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:33,072
What the fuck was that?

435
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:37,827
Listen, I'm sorry for freaking out
back there, but Miranda,

436
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:41,622
I'm not just gonna leave the country
and hide, okay?

437
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,420
I know this sounds crazy,
but what if we didn't run?

438
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,548
Then we'll die.

439
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:53,509
Between the two of us, we've got
to be able to figure something out.

440
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:55,177
Then we'll still die.

441
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:57,388
You have made that option crystal clear.

442
00:29:57,555 --> 00:30:00,850
Isn't there any other way besides us
just disappearing forever?

443
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:04,645
Ten minutes ago, you were running down
the corridor like a crazy person.

444
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,898
Yeah, well, now I'm not.

445
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:11,068
I'm not running anymore.
I've been running my entire life.

446
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:12,862
I'm done.

447
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:18,451
Okay.

448
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:21,370
Okay, look.

449
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,750
I'm gonna be honest with you, okay?

450
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:34,216
I think maybe you're losing your mind,
and I kind of begrudgingly respect

451
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:38,095
everything that you have managed
to pull off so far.

452
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,934
But, you know, eventually Feliks
is gonna catch up to you.

453
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:48,356
He's relentless, and believe it or not,
Cassie, I don't wanna see you dead.

454
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:55,279
You can run off, and hide, and
live to fight another day, or just live.

455
00:30:57,114 --> 00:30:58,824
I mean,
that should be enough for you.

456
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,369
That's... that's enough, isn't it?

457
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:06,999
That's a really beautiful speech,
but I'm just not buying it.

458
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,711
Because deep down, you still think
I'm gonna lead you to that money.

459
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:13,798
That's what you've been after
this whole time.

460
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:20,346
Well, since acting was never my strong
point, so maybe we could just live here

461
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:23,474
in this Sunday school classroom.
Forever.

462
00:31:25,935 --> 00:31:29,438
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, what about this?

463
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:32,608
What if we approached
one of Lionfish's rivals?

464
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:35,611
-They'll kill us.
-Is that your answer to everything?

465
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:38,906
-Why would they kill us?
-Because they are bad people.

466
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,909
-But if you had the money...
-Look, I'm sorry.

467
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:43,452
But even being blackout drunk,

468
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:46,581
I would've noticed piles of cash around
that hotel room. He didn't have it.

469
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:50,710
Hmm, that's adorable.
But it wouldn't be actual money, right?

470
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:54,839
He'd have squirreled it away in some
double encrypted account, or Bitcoin...

471
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:57,008
Okay,
so what would he have with him?

472
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:59,510
Maybe numbers in his phone?

473
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:03,389
But that's not secure,
so maybe something analog

474
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:05,975
like a ledger or a notebook?

475
00:32:13,858 --> 00:32:17,320
So you go on and on about
how great this book is,

476
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:21,073
and then I find out you write
all your own little notes in the margin.

477
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:25,578
It helps me think.
It's how I read books, okay?

478
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:27,163
Uh, no, sorry.

479
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:31,709
No, I must protect this literary classic
from all your scribbling.

480
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:34,003
-Oh, you mean steal it.
-I didn't steal it.

481
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,088
It's right there hidden,
just away from you.

482
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:39,717
It's okay.
Sometimes a little stealing can be good.

483
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,802
Yeah.

484
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:44,722
It might even make you feel great.

485
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,476
Oh, my God.
I know where it is.

486
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:52,355
-What do you mean? The money?
-It. Yeah.

487
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:55,566
-Well, where is it?
-We're gonna go get it together.

488
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:57,151
Well, so what?
You still don't trust me?

489
00:32:57,318 --> 00:32:59,195
No, not even at all.
Let's go.

490
00:32:59,362 --> 00:33:02,156
Okay. It's a bit much.

491
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:11,874
See you later, Mom.

492
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:48,703
Hello, Kitty....

493
00:33:57,461 --> 00:33:58,838
Come on.

494
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:02,425
It's...no...fuck.
Fuck!

495
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,350
Hey. Kids, you guys have,
you have small hands, right?

496
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:13,311
Yeah.

497
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:15,605
Sweet.
Who wants to make 20 bucks?

498
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:19,483
Bangkok Police reconstructed the bottle
they think is the murder weapon

499
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,153
-and they pulled a print.
-Really?

500
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,947
They don't have a match in the Thai
system, so they're sending it to us.

501
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:28,075
Since we both know deep down it's
gonna come back as Bowden's print...

502
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:30,828
-We both know that? Okay.
-Yeah, we do.

503
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:34,457
So I'm just gonna go sit in the print
lab and wait until we have a match.

504
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,170
-Where are we with Agent Chavez?
-We haven't found him yet.

505
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:40,922
He's gonna get an earful.

506
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:44,383
And we put a new tail on Bowden's
apartment until she shows up.

507
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,095
This Chavez thing, that doesn't strike
you as odd that he just went quiet?

508
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:49,972
Why, you wanna put out a BOLO
on our own agent?

509
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,270
Hello?

510
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:58,481
Okay, okay, come in.
Come in.

511
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:01,400
Oh, right, an open shower.
That's a choice.

512
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,695
Well, you know Annie.
She likes to surprise people.

513
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:07,281
-I don't know.
-So if she has the money,

514
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:09,367
why didn't she give it to us earlier?

515
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:12,745
Because I think it's, uh, in a book.

516
00:35:13,955 --> 00:35:16,249
Feliks did not find it in Bangkok
because...

517
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,585
-I took it.
-You took it?

518
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:22,546
Yes. Maybe some drunk excuse
to see Alex again. I don't know,

519
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:24,465
but here.

520
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,552
"Crime and Punishment."

521
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,184
That was missing from Alex's place.

522
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:36,727
Okay.

523
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:45,570
"Would not one tiny crime be wiped out
by a thousand good deeds?"

524
00:35:49,907 --> 00:35:52,076
Accounts and encryption.

525
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:54,870
-Alex was a real piece of work.
-Oh, so is this it?

526
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:56,455
Is this what everyone's
been looking for?

527
00:35:56,622 --> 00:36:00,334
-Yes. Finally, we have options.
-Oh, my God.

528
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,340
-Shit!
-Oh, my God.

529
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:07,884
No, no!

530
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,137
Oh, my God.

531
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,432
Seriously?
That only works in the movies.

532
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,975
How am I supposed to know?

533
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:17,560
All right, there's gotta be
another way out of here.

534
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,562
There's a fire escape.
Just come on, get the book.

535
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,314
Get the book, get the book.

536
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:29,030
Come on, come on.

537
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:30,740
All right. Okay.

538
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:36,871
Oh, my God. Okay, you probably do this
all the time, right?

539
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:39,498
-No, this is completely insane.
-Okay.

540
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,757
-Okay. You didn't jump!
-Nobody said we were jumping yet.

541
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:49,300
Miranda,
you said he's trying to kill us.

542
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,844
Do you really wanna fight him right now?
Jump! Let's go!

543
00:37:00,144 --> 00:37:02,772
Oh, my God. You didn't die.
That's great. Okay, let's go.

544
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,526
Oh, my God.

545
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:14,116
-Oh, no.
-What, what?

546
00:37:14,283 --> 00:37:15,660
-Oh, my God. I dropped the book.
-What?

547
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:17,203
Oh, shut up.

548
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,668
He's got the book, which means
Victor's got the book,

549
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:25,628
which means
we're both dead for nothing.

550
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:28,339
Well, I'm not just gonna give up, okay?
I've come way too far.

551
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:30,591
I have lied to people.
I crashed a memorial service.

552
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:33,636
I snuck on a private jet.
I hacked a fucking...

553
00:37:33,844 --> 00:37:35,930
Yeah, all right, okay, well,
let me tell you about Feliks.

554
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:38,099
-He has killed women, children.
-Oh, my God.

555
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:41,519
Victor told me that when Feliks
was young, everyone at his boys home

556
00:37:41,852 --> 00:37:44,772
was freaked out because
he gutted a bunch of cats

557
00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:46,607
and then hung them from a tree.

558
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,196
Cassie?

559
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:20,433
Holy shit.

560
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:29,483
Okay, I don't think Feliks saw us, but,
he's gonna be on us again.

561
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,278
So where are we gonna go?
Where are we gonna go?

562
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:35,907
-Fuck.
-Okay, what the fuck are you doing?

563
00:38:36,073 --> 00:38:40,328
What? I don't...What am I doing?
I don't fucking know what I'm doing.

564
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,500
Motherfucker psychopath!
Oh, my God.

565
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:50,004
This guy that I am seeing had
a lot of sex with me,

566
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:52,256
and then lied to me, and then just tried
to murder us,

567
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:54,967
so I might need to...

568
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,303
I need to do this for a second.

569
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:03,601
He had many chances to kill you, and
he didn't, so there must be a reason.

570
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:05,895
Oh, my God, he is so sick.
This is so sick!

571
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:07,897
He literally said he wanted
to run away with me.

572
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:09,815
Was anything he said actually real?

573
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,279
Okay. That's fine.
I'm fine.

574
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,407
-Oh, no. You look totally fine.
-Whatever, whatever.

575
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:21,827
I know you've never...
you never actually met Feliks, right?

576
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:24,163
But you know his history? Like, how
he works. Can we use that, or...

577
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,123
Oh, yeah.
I am familiar with his work.

578
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,919
He is fully a creature of habit.
Like some really bloody Pavlov stuff.

579
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:32,088
He actually doesn't know that I know
he's Feliks,

580
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:36,384
so can we use that to maybe, like,
to trap him?

581
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,427
I have to work
my Rome flight tonight.

582
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:40,346
He's gonna fucking know
I'm on the flight, so...

583
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:41,973
He will follow you anywhere.

584
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:45,268
Okay. So if we know where he's
gonna be, can we be ready for him?

585
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:48,396
Okay, just shut up.
Just give me a second. I need to think.

586
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:50,690
Okay, what about, um...

587
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:55,653
No, we'll both be dead. Do you have
any type of close combat training?

588
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,197
What? No.
Why would I have any... what?

589
00:39:58,364 --> 00:39:59,991
All right, forget it.

590
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:01,617
All right.
Here's what I'm thinking,

591
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:05,329
you'll work your flight to Rome.
I will be on that flight too.

592
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:09,959
When you get to Rome, stay in groups
so Feliks can't get you alone.

593
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:13,504
Take your shuttle to the hotel.
I'll be in the cab behind you.

594
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:17,508
You'll check in at the desk.

595
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:21,345
Get an extra key for me
under the name of Katherine O'Brien.

596
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:22,972
Why that name?
What's that from?

597
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:25,433
Well, she was my neighbor
when I was growing up in Glasgow.

598
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,977
-And died in a fire.
-Oh, my God, what?

599
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:30,521
Okay, Cassie, I'm lying.
It's random.

600
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:33,399
So Feliks stalks his marks.

601
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:36,485
He makes his approach
once they've settled into their hotels.

602
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:40,281
Likely uses a garrote or a knife.
Likes to play it very horror movie.

603
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:43,034
So get out of there quickly
with other people.

604
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,953
Then I will slip
into the room ahead of him.

605
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:49,248
And then, when you get back
to the room...

606
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:57,798
Wait, wait, wait.
I didn't know you were gonna kill him.

607
00:40:57,965 --> 00:41:01,385
We have to.
If we aren't gonna run, it's him or us.

608
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,013
Please tell me you don't have
a problem with that.

609
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,556
We need to talk.

610
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:08,267
Look, Alex, I know it's never okay
to kill someone,

611
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:10,686
but I just hate what he did to me
so much.

612
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:12,438
-I do too.
-I'm so angry.

613
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:15,608
I feel so dirty. I just wanna hit him.
Over and over and over again.

614
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:18,277
-I want her to kill him.
-Cassie, I have no problem

615
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:20,196
offing the dead cat guy.

616
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:22,657
Okay, I thought you were gonna
say like, "Killing is bad,"

617
00:41:22,823 --> 00:41:24,367
or something annoyingly
subconscious-y.

618
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:26,619
-Fuck that guy. He murdered me.
-Yeah.

619
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:30,665
But Miranda's plan? Think about
what you're agreeing to here.

620
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:32,959
You're bait.

621
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:39,173
-Okay, so I'm bait?
-Yeah.

622
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:46,097
And if all goes well,
we both live, and no more Feliks.

623
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:52,895
Okay. All right. Wow, all right.
Let's, uh... let's catch a killer.

624
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:59,744

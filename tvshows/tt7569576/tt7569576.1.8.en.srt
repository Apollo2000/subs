00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,623
All right.

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,331
Wow, all right, let's, uh...

4
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,655
let's catch a killer.

5
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:11,364
Right. Catch a killer.

6
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:12,781
- Yeah.
- Who says that?

7
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:13,832
I don't know. I actually...

8
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:15,366
the alternative sounds worse.

9
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:16,797
But, actually, now that sounds bad too.

10
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,031
So maybe I regret saying that.

11
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:19,447
Just drink that. There you go.

12
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:20,947
Okay?

14
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:30,828
Who's this?

15
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,650
Oh, whatever happened
to "This is Cecilia?"

16
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,277
Miranda?

17
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,768
Yeah, I'm calling you on a burner

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,662
because I was attacked
by a hired assassin.

19
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:41,955
Hired assassin?

20
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:43,739
- Oh, my God!
- Spare us both.

21
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,739
You were the only one
who could have told Victor

22
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,316
that I was still in New York.

23
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:49,614
Now, I just want to say that I...

24
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,739
yeah, I understand.

25
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,364
- You do?
- Yeah.

26
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:56,239
'Course I'm still gonna have
to find you and kill you.

27
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:58,949
But it wasn't my fault!

28
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,989
Listen, you know how scary Victor is.

29
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,906
I couldn't just stand there and...

30
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:06,364
Look, I...

31
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,114
I'll give you Victor. Okay?

32
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:10,381
You have nothing to bargain
with and he's never gonna stop

33
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:11,864
sending people after you, right?

34
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,781
So you could stop him.

35
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,315
He's leaving New York tonight,

36
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:16,906
but he's still there now, okay?

37
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:18,350
I can text you the address

38
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:20,572
and time he's meeting his driver.

39
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:21,947
Is that enough?

40
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:25,572
Well, you are very
clever, Cecilia, so...

41
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:29,614
why don't you text me and we'll see?

42
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:31,072
Wow. That sounded healthy.

43
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:33,447
It was.

44
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:36,447
Oh, I... have to run an errand.

45
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:37,548
- What?
- Okay?

46
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,869
And it is an important
and very quick thing.

47
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:41,231
- Right now?
- Okay, so, driver,

48
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,614
can you please pull over? Thank you.

49
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:44,447
Uh, no.

50
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,756
You're just gonna get out?
This is the middle of the road.

51
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,281
What are you do... where
are you going, even?

52
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:50,114
Well, you're just gonna
have to trust me.

53
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:51,822
Well, that's not what we talked about...

54
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,906
that was not the plan!

55
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,197
Shit.

56
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:02,072
I got shut down on a warrant
for Alex Sokolov's apartment.

57
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:03,559
I understand being guarded,

58
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,074
but these people should want to help.

59
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:09,482
Yeah, but you want normal human emotion

60
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:10,739
from Janet Sokolov?

61
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,223
Why are you even here?

62
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:14,557
What happened to sitting on
the lab until you got a match?

63
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:18,989
Look, I know I can be
aggressive at times.

64
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:20,989
And I rub people the wrong way.

65
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,489
And what brought this on?

66
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,131
Okay, the tech in the print lab asked me

67
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:27,781
if I had a lacrosse scholarship at Yale.

68
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,656
And then she told me
to wait somewhere else.

69
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:31,906
Yeah, because we all talk around here.

70
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,322
In fact...

71
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:38,114
this is the lab now.

72
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,572
And... wow.

73
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,572
Bowden is a match for
the bloody fingerprint

74
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,281
- inside the broken bottle.
- Yes!

75
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:45,739
There it is, proof she was
there after Alex Sokolov died.

76
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:48,531
That's the ball game. Okay.

77
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,031
Let's get a warrant and round her up.

78
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,322
What the fuck, Kim?

79
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:54,947
This is what we've been working towards.

80
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,197
- I know, I'm just...
- Oh, my God.

81
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,073
I know it pains you to admit it,

82
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,364
but this is the answer,

83
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:01,781
and the rest of your little intuition

84
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,744
about a bigger conspiracy was wrong.

85
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:06,031
First of all, I need you
to get out of my space.

86
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,124
And the second is to understand
that I've been doing this

87
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:10,963
for a while, and I do not need
you belittling my instincts.

88
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,697
So you go on and arrest Bowden

89
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,339
and leave me here to
go over this case again,

90
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,912
because "Cassie Bowden did it"

91
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,406
does not wrap everything
up to my satisfaction.

92
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,031
What?

93
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,805
They found Chavez dumped in an alley

94
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,947
with his throat slit.

95
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,072
Oh, my God. There you are.

96
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:35,074
You know we're boarding, right?
What's going on with you?

97
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,989
You know the rules. No drinking.

98
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:41,947
Cassie...

99
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:43,631
Please don't make me your mom.

100
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,707
Please, the same rules that says

101
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,858
you're over the baggage allowance.

102
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,906
What, are you moving to Italy?

103
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:51,506
On this plane, I am your supervisor.

104
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,997
I'm not even gonna drink them, probably.

105
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,714
It's just like a security
blanket or whatever.

106
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,915
I don't know why I said that.
Will you back off! Relax!

107
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,322
You just love feeling
superior to me, don't you?

108
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,739
You know what, Cassie?

109
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:05,072
I used to idolize you,

110
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,474
so go ahead and drink all you want

111
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:07,906
if it's that damn important to you.

112
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:09,156
Who the hell even cares?

113
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:10,864
You two need to stop.

114
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:13,281
You're distracted, and you
both have really toxic energy.

115
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:14,431
Just pull it together.

116
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:17,322
Oh, hush up, Jada.

117
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:21,739
What's going on with Megan?
Why is she so tense?

118
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:22,947
Like, strange tense?

119
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,447
Who gives a shit?

120
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,591
This is stressful, but pull
yourself together, okay?

121
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:28,531
I don't want to sound like a
broken record about the liquor,

122
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,627
but if this plan is
actually gonna work...

123
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,294
Okay, you don't think
Miranda's coming, huh?

124
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:33,297
You think I screwed this up?

125
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:34,790
You thinks she's ghosting
me? Go ahead, say it.

126
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:35,983
Honestly, if you think about it,

127
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,752
Miranda might not be ghosting you.

128
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:40,336
She might already be dead.

129
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:14,629
What's the bloody hold up?

130
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:19,586
I hate this light! It makes my eyes...

131
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,086
Oh!

132
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,752
Ah!

133
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:34,711
All of this...

134
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:37,127
for a flight attendant?

135
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,669
I actually quite like her.

136
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:40,103
I mean, I don't know what's
happened to me lately.

137
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:42,586
Maybe you shouldn't be
so emotional, is that it?

138
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:45,252
You gonna tell me to smile more next?

139
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,294
You know, I did so much for you,

140
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:53,182
and you hired some total
fuck-up to kill me in my car?

141
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,060
Let's be fair, I didn't specify
where he should do it.

142
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:57,377
Really, Victor?

143
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:01,336
You had Alex killed
before you got the money?

144
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,752
Funny story.

145
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:08,760
I'd only got a secondhand
report, but apparently...

146
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,252
Hello, Sleeping Beauty.

147
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:16,586
What, the blond?

148
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,711
Yeah, you know, she
stumbled out of here.

149
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:20,928
Just fell asleep on a bench.

150
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,419
But I kept her lip gloss
so I could taste it.

151
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:26,377
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

152
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,002
Here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna move my hand,

153
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:30,544
and you're gonna tell me
where you've written down

154
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:32,711
the accounts and encryptions, yeah?

155
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,544
Mm.

156
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:37,213
All right.

157
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:43,669
The account numbers are in a book.

158
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,762
It's... it's on the couch.

159
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,544
It's underneath one of the pillows.

160
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:49,419
Great.

161
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:53,044
You see, that wasn't
too hard now, was it?

162
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:55,002
All right.

163
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:00,211
Fooled you, didn't I?

164
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,919
No, no!

165
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,544
Feliks should have waited

166
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,086
until he had everything in hand,

167
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:19,044
but you know how hard
it is to find good help.

168
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:21,887
Okay, get on the ground.

169
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,014
Now!

170
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,586
Now, Miranda,

171
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:30,252
I do know about that
hot temper of yours.

172
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:33,407
Between us, I've found a beta blocker

173
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,377
and some nice lavender tea
really do calm the nerves...

174
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,838
Ah!

175
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:42,377
Ah!

176
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,627
Ah...

177
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,252
Fuck it.

178
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,086
A word with you, please?

179
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,377
Uh, are you talking to me?

180
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:18,586
Shane, you're talking to me now?

181
00:09:18,588 --> 00:09:19,794
Cassie,

182
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:21,755
I was never not talking to you.

183
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:24,705
It was just after the funeral
thing, I needed a break.

184
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,961
Listen, I'm sorry, I've been
trying to call you to apologize

185
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,794
and then my life got
insane again and then...

186
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:30,919
Okay, good. Apology accepted.

187
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:32,461
- Really?
- Yes, look...

188
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,961
I told you that no one
close to me has ever died,

189
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:38,461
and clearly 3C meant a
lot to you, so who knows?

190
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:42,336
Maybe I would have done
some crazy shit like you did.

191
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:43,919
We're good.

192
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,377
- Thank you.
- Yes.

193
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,586
Also, Jada and Megan
are driving me insane.

194
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,470
They are the least fun human
beings on this airplane.

195
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,346
I need my friend. That's you.

196
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:52,405
- I love you.
- I love you too.

197
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:53,906
Goodbye.

198
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:55,877
Hey, is everything okay?

199
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,086
Yeah, I'm just looking
at openings for upgrades.

200
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,627
- No 4C yet.
- Oh, don't give it away.

201
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:01,711
She's coming. I mean,
I don't know for sure,

202
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:02,987
but if she is does, I don't want to deal

203
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:04,363
with a disgruntled passenger, you know?

204
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:05,711
Just don't.

205
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:07,502
The white zone is for loading

206
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:09,002
and unloading of passengers.

207
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,586
Hey! You can't park there!

208
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:13,294
Fuck you! Fucking asshole.

209
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:25,711
This is the final boarding
call for Imperial Atlantic

210
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:28,627
flight 502 to Rome.

211
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,002
Oh, no. Ma'am?

212
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,303
- Your leg is bleeding.
- Right, um...

213
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:32,721
We'll just get a medic to check it out.

214
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:34,877
Okay, I have a flight to catch so...

215
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:40,877
Ladies and gentlemen, the
boarding door is now closed.

216
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,919
You may continue to use approved

217
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:46,044
portable electronic devices,
but they must be placed

218
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,303
in airplane mode.

219
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:49,211
Pretty awful about Chavez.

220
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,695
It's terrible.

221
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:52,044
I can't.

222
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:54,211
Van's out there tracking down Bowden,

223
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,586
and I'm just focusing on this

224
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,544
so I don't punch a hole in my desk.

225
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,336
Yeah, here.

226
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:01,461
"And then a hotel waiter came in

227
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:04,502
and he gave us very strong liquor".

228
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:06,169
- I knew it.
- So?

229
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:08,002
The hotel only listed female employees

230
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:10,419
on at Sokolov's floor
the night that he died,

231
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:14,961
so if this guy is out there,
I wanna find him.

232
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,919
Ms. Mouradian, how did you get in here?

233
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:18,586
Look, we're dealing with some serious...

234
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:21,254
Is that the Sokolov file?
I think this'll help.

235
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:25,033
- What is this?
- Financial records,

236
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,336
client lists, forged flight manifests,

237
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,669
receipts for the sale of weapons,

238
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,252
a lot of incriminating evidence

239
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,809
on Unisphere Asset Management

240
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:33,586
and some company called "Lionfish",

241
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:36,298
and an entire subfolder
devoted to photos of people

242
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,752
- that are dead now.
- How did you...

243
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,419
Look, I'm probably gonna
be disbarred for this,

244
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:41,836
which really fucking sucks
because my entire life

245
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,627
is wrapped up in being a lawyer,

246
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,127
but here is a lot of motive

247
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,669
that has nothing to do with Cassie.

248
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,669
Okay, Agent Hammond?

249
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:52,879
It's Kim.

250
00:11:57,421 --> 00:12:00,586
Uh, Kim, I think I know that guy.

251
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,419
- That's from Bangkok.
- No.

252
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,294
He was at my loft with Cassie.

253
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:06,336
I don't know, she met him
in a bar or something.

254
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:10,044
His name's... something
stupid and weird.

255
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,502
I don't know, he was with Cassie.

256
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,502
They were very drunk.

257
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:16,002
Damn it.

258
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:18,169
- This guy? Buckley Ware?
- Yes!

259
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,252
Buckley. Fucking stupid name.

260
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:23,044
Wait, I'm sorry, in Bangkok?

261
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,296
Son of a bitch.

262
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:57,862
Alex!

263
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,252
Alex!

264
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:02,002
Hi.

265
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,836
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

266
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:12,713
No, no, no, no, no!

267
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:22,279
Help! Oh, this man is attacking me!

268
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,252
Anybody! Get him off of me!

269
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:26,211
Somebody, help me!

270
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,336
Yes, this man. I don't know.

271
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:36,252
He just came up behind me and grabbed me

272
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:37,752
and tried to... tried to pull me back...

273
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:38,919
Mi scusi.

274
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:46,436
Okay.

275
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:48,502
Oh, my God. Thank you, Megan.

276
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:49,627
This guy ju...

277
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,379
Oh, my...

278
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:14,627
Long flights are the worst, huh?

279
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,796
But Rome is just so beautiful.

280
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,752
Traveling for business or pleasure?

281
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:26,544
I have to stop a woman
from being killed,

282
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,919
and I'm not sure that I fully understand

283
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:32,377
my feelings about that,
because I've never done anything

284
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,586
purely selfless before.

285
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:38,419
But she grew on me, and
I'm anxious about her safety

286
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,294
and my leg is bleeding,

287
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,961
so now might not be the time

288
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:46,294
for a wee chat.

289
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:32,377
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

290
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,669
Well, in my family, it's not yelling,

291
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,836
but I'm sorry too.

292
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,362
For a lot.

293
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:41,105
And I think I owe you the truth.

294
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:48,544
I did spend the night
with 3C in Bangkok and...

295
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:50,336
woke up next to his dead body,

296
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:54,543
and now my life is a living hell.

297
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:58,004
Okay.

298
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:02,836
I thought I kept things
bottled up, but you...

299
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,400
You can lay your toughest
stuff on me, Megan, okay?

300
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:07,419
Okay, I can handle it. I think I've...

301
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:10,336
set the bar pretty high, so I'm ready.

302
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,044
And that's what friends do.

303
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:15,502
Friends, huh?

304
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:17,711
Yeah, all these years

305
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,419
traveling across the world together?

306
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:21,711
I mean, I didn't realize it, but...

307
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,627
we are absolutely friends.

308
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,488
Well, um...

309
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:36,711
apparently I've been stealing
proprietary technology

310
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:38,311
from my husband's work laptop

311
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:41,252
and selling it to the
North Korean government.

312
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:45,459
And I kept asking about the FBI
because I was worried about me.

313
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,706
Just...

314
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,583
it just seems so small, you know?

315
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:57,252
A nice man with a business card...

316
00:16:57,254 --> 00:17:00,288
approached me at one of
Bill's work conferences

317
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,877
and he asked me to take
a few little pictures,

318
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,752
download a file or two.

319
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:08,002
Exciting.

320
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:11,669
Very cloak-and-dagger. In Oyster Bay.

321
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,669
It was one company or
another and I just thought...

322
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:17,461
what could be the harm?

323
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:20,588
But then it just got so much bigger.

324
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:26,002
Oh, my God, Megan, I know
exactly how that feels.

325
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,338
- Truly.
- I just...

326
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:32,877
Do you ever feel like nobody sees you?

327
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:35,794
Of course you don't, you're you.

328
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,711
But I'm a middle-aged woman

329
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:40,127
who spends her day pretty invisible.

330
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:42,002
It's true, Cassie.

331
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:45,379
The passengers, my coworkers, my...

332
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:49,629
my son.

333
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:55,377
You know, having a secret...

334
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:58,752
a thing that only I could do...

335
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,294
just felt amazing.

336
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:03,801
- Megan, I had no idea that...
- I had everything.

337
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:07,377
But I couldn't see it.

338
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,502
Anyway...

339
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:16,002
It's my mistake, and, um...

340
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:19,211
I put my trust in the wrong people.

341
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,338
But I'm gonna fix this.

342
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:26,963
I'm gonna find the right people
and I am going to fix this.

343
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,027
Megan, it's gonna be okay.

344
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:37,669
Not everyone gets to be okay.

345
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:41,252
But I appreciate the thought,
and I hope you're right.

346
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:45,586
Okay, according to Max,

347
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:47,544
Buckley Ware was on a short-term lease

348
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:49,377
that he signed less than two weeks ago.

349
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,515
Okay, you need to never
tell me who Max is

350
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:54,919
or how he's finding all this stuff out.

351
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:56,627
You've been here all night?

352
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:58,127
Jeez, what time is it?

353
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:59,491
I couldn't find Bowden anywhere,

354
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:00,810
so I checked her apartment

355
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:02,227
and any of the spots Chavez noted,

356
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:04,044
so I reached out to Imperial Atlantic,

357
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:05,127
and she's in Rome.

358
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:07,669
I'm sorry, she went to Rome?

359
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,919
What the fuck was she thinking?

360
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,794
Why are you here? Why is she here?

361
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,627
You're gonna want to sit down.

362
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:30,294
- Hi.
- Cassie, you're here?

363
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,919
I know, I'm sorry to bother you.

364
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,057
- What are you doing? I'm working.
- I know, I know, I know.

365
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,044
Sorry... oh, sorry, sorry.

366
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,669
Listen, listen...

367
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,461
I need to find a gun.

368
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:42,127
Cassie, what do you mean?

369
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:45,919
No, I'm serious, I'm...
Listen, we're friends, right?

370
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:49,419
I know, but this is important.

371
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,709
It's really, really important.

372
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,919
Come on, what happened to the guy

373
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:55,122
- that said he's up for anything at any time?
- Well, he's here.

374
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,009
He just wants to know why
his friend needs a weapon.

375
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:02,002
Yeah, okay, um...

376
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:05,836
remember when I told you I met someone?

377
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,827
- Hello, Feliks.
- Hello, darling.

378
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:42,794
Well, I guess you're gonna
find me harder to kill

379
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:45,461
than a sleeping man and stray cats.

380
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:49,044
Hmm. We'll see about that.

381
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:06,586
Ah!

382
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:45,877
I'll go in. Can you wait out here?

383
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,752
Do I... do I have to?

384
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:50,461
Let me see if I can find what you need.

385
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:52,669
You would be conspicuous
to my grandmother.

386
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:54,502
She would ask questions. Okay?

387
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:59,169
Right, 'cause how would I be
able to explain any of this?

388
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:00,877
Sounds like an American movie.

389
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:03,336
Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,961
Hey.

391
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:06,711
Thank you.

392
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:08,879
Si.

393
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:13,461
Nonna?

394
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:07,627
Fuck.

395
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:18,129
Yes, si, si, but no, um...

396
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,459
I'm Cassie.

397
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:34,046
I don't feel very luminous.

398
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,836
This morning, a man terrified me

399
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:50,127
in a way that makes me realize
that things are very immediate

400
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,877
and very clear.

401
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:57,336
It also, though, makes my head hurt...

402
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:59,419
and, um...

403
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:01,877
it's all just too bright.

404
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:05,336
If that makes any sense.

405
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:09,047
Listen...

406
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:14,639
Okay?

407
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:32,421
I think it would be much worse than sad.

408
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:36,828
You know, we can make choices
and we have to live with them,

409
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,169
but other people's choices, how...

410
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,086
Who of us has the space

411
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:43,671
to carry other people's choices?

412
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:50,127
Yeah, I think you're right.

413
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:27,671
Cheers.

414
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:35,877
Girls?

415
00:25:42,088 --> 00:25:43,961
Ah! Shit!

416
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:37,502
Hi.

417
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:39,754
It's all my fault.

418
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:44,187
No. No, it's n...

419
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:47,669
it's not your fault.

420
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:49,169
No...

421
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:52,502
This is not your fault. Okay?

422
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:54,002
Listen to me.

423
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,776
A lot of things will be your fault.

424
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:59,693
You will make really, really
bad decisions, all right?

425
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:02,752
But this one? This is not your fault.

426
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,502
This will not define who you are.

427
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:06,961
Okay?

428
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:15,421
Come here.

429
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:19,046
Come here.

430
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,544
Cassie?

431
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:48,296
I have it. We can go.

432
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:52,629
Okay. Okay.

433
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:10,671
What in the hell is she doing?

434
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,987
Megan! Hey, hey!

435
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,288
Megan! Megan!

436
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,331
Now what in the hell are you doing?

437
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:29,252
You know, you didn't have
to come and watch that again.

438
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:31,502
Come here.

439
00:28:31,504 --> 00:28:33,838
Sure, I did.

440
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:39,794
Oh, God.

441
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:43,669
I don't wanna... I will not
remember you like this.

442
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:47,461
No.

443
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:54,669
Hi.

444
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:07,252
You shouldn't have to
risk your life like this.

445
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:09,203
Alex, this is insane,

446
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,836
but I feel like I really know you now.

447
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,836
I feel like I know me now too.

448
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,044
And somehow, I'm
totally in love with you.

449
00:29:21,046 --> 00:29:24,752
Or, I don't know, maybe the idea...

450
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:26,836
the idea of maybe the
promise of something

451
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:29,711
that could have been between us, I...

452
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:32,211
It's probably better than
the real deal would ever be.

453
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:35,794
You made me at least two inches taller.

454
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:38,169
Honestly...

455
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:39,961
it wasn't me you were
falling in love with.

456
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:42,752
Alex, I can't handle any
more introspective bullshit.

457
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:44,377
Will you just kiss me?

458
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,252
You okay?

459
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,544
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

460
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:06,711
Should we take from the minibar?

461
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:08,669
- I'm sure they have vodka.
- No.

462
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:10,419
Actually, you know
what? I'd love a coffee.

463
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:12,294
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

464
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:14,711
Um, okay.

465
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,211
I'll run downstairs to the bar?

466
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,836
Okay.

467
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:19,044
- Cassie?
- Yeah?

468
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:21,002
Are you going to be okay?

469
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:23,586
Yeah. Yes, here, here.

470
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,127
- Lock the bolt behind me.
- Okay.

471
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:27,877
Hey, knock three times
when you get back, okay?

472
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:34,627
Kim, there's a Buckley
Ware on the manifest

473
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:36,752
of Imperial Atlantic 2211.

474
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:37,945
That's the flight to Rome

475
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:39,154
Cassie Bowden worked last night.

476
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:40,586
He was on her flight?

477
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,086
He's fucking stalking her.

478
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:43,387
He's following her to Rome

479
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:46,086
the same way he followed
Alex Sokolov to Bangkok.

480
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:49,502
Damn it.

481
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,419
Fuck, no!

482
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:32,794
Ahh!

483
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:37,752
Ah! Oh!

484
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:54,544
Oh, no.

485
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,002
Did you have some little plan?

486
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:00,495
You thought you could fuck with me?

487
00:32:00,497 --> 00:32:04,121
Oh, I'd love to let you
fuck with me, Cassie.

488
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,002
But we broke up, right?

489
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:08,252
Oh, and then Miranda showed up

490
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:10,919
like she was gonna save the day!

491
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:13,377
I bet you wish you hadn't
thrown me away now, don't you?

492
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:15,836
- Feliks, listen...
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!

493
00:32:15,838 --> 00:32:17,377
It's Buckley.

494
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:19,487
It was my grandfather's name, remember?

495
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:24,252
Enrico!

496
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,544
Oh!

497
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:55,377
Ah...

498
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:58,502
You know, I really fell for you.

499
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:03,794
In fact, I used this to track
you around the world.

500
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:05,794
Recognize it?

501
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:10,336
You're just so beautiful and fucked up.

502
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:12,044
It's like catnip.

503
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,419
I can still taste it.

504
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:15,086
Go to hell.

505
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:16,377
Oh, and the sex?

506
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:19,711
Oof, the sex was fucking great.

507
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:20,919
But it's more than that, right?

508
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:22,377
No, it wasn't that great.

509
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,544
I thought about Alex the entire time.

510
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,066
Is that why you need such a big knife?

511
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:34,240
This a bit more intimate?

512
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:36,336
- Ahh!
- Oh!

513
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:40,669
Do you think it's because the
character I've created for you

514
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:42,125
was an alcoholic mess too?

515
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:46,086
You know, I had to
pretend to be drunk a lot.

516
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:47,920
I've been into you since I first saw you

517
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:50,002
on the way to Bangkok.

518
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:54,419
And then everywhere since
then, you never even noticed.

519
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:02,086
Well, that was a quick answer.

520
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,044
Sabrina!

521
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,919
Hi. Come on in.

522
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:23,002
- ... on the first date.
- First date.

523
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:28,377
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

524
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,127
You are such a fucking psychopath!

525
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:31,794
- Don't call me that!
- Ah, oh!

526
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:34,377
A psychopath who offered
to run away with you!

527
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:35,836
Think of where we'd be right now.

528
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:36,845
What we'd be doing.

529
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,961
I wouldn't go anywhere with you.

530
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:40,252
You liked it.

531
00:34:40,254 --> 00:34:41,919
And I've still got butterflies!

532
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:43,377
That's love, right?

533
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:46,669
- Hey!
- Ah!

534
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:57,711
Come on. You're a drunk, not a killer.

535
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:04,211
Ow!

536
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:19,794
Oh...

537
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:26,919
Oh, my... Oh, my...

538
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:53,377
You okay?

539
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:54,877
No.

540
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:56,377
What the fuck?

541
00:35:56,379 --> 00:36:01,752
You just rolled in with
a gun of your own and...

542
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:03,336
I mean...

543
00:36:03,338 --> 00:36:06,877
I had to get a gun from an
Italian woman's dead husband.

544
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:09,398
How did you... why do you
have one? What is going on?

545
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,711
I probably shouldn't tell you this,

546
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,127
but I'm with the CIA.

547
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:16,353
- What?
- I've been working

548
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:19,627
at Imperial Atlantic
to keep tabs on Megan.

549
00:36:19,629 --> 00:36:22,794
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

550
00:36:22,796 --> 00:36:25,919
She committed treason,
and now she's on the run.

551
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,336
Wait, shit, she told...
she told me that.

552
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:32,919
- She told you?
- I mean...

553
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:34,669
Like, in a casual conversation,

554
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:35,887
"Hey, I'm a spy"?

555
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:37,722
Cassie.

556
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:42,419
That son of a bitch is lucky
you only hit him in the leg.

557
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:45,336
I have really bad aim.

558
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:47,169
Fuck, Miranda!

559
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,544
Oh, my God. Where is she?

560
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:50,086
Is she okay? She was in the bathroom

561
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,994
and she came out to
help me with all of this.

562
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,211
Did they take her somewhere?

563
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,419
There was no one else in the room.

564
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,002
Wait, what?

565
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:15,836
Briscoe household.

566
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,294
Eli? Why aren't you at school?

567
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:19,627
Why are you calling a landline?

568
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:21,002
It's for, like, telemarketers.

569
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,836
I know, I know.

570
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:25,586
I just wanted to leave
a message on the answer...

571
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:27,083
No, no, no.

572
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:29,585
You answer me first, young man.

573
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:33,044
Dad's sick or something?

574
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:35,502
I don't know. He's, like, in your room

575
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,586
just kind of crying.

576
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,887
He says it's, like, a stomach flu or...

577
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:42,138
I just thought it would be good

578
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,294
to have somebody here, you know?

579
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:46,127
Plus I didn't study for this math test,

580
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,836
so it would be best to just make it up.

581
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:48,877
Listen, Eli.

582
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:50,836
I want you to tell your dad

583
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,294
to look in the small ceramic rooster.

584
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:55,918
- The rooster?
- I want you to tell him

585
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,671
that it's gonna help him
with his stomach flu, okay?

586
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:01,403
It's gonna help him get out of trouble.

587
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,877
And, um, tell him...

588
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:09,127
Hang on a sec.

589
00:38:13,046 --> 00:38:15,752
Tell him that he was...

590
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:20,044
that everything was so beautiful.

591
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:21,336
Okay?

592
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:23,502
Okay, Mom. You're being really weird.

593
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,169
No, no, no, no, no.

594
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:27,002
I'm just... I'm just
being silly, that's it.

595
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,794
So I love you very much, my love.

596
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:32,461
Okay?

597
00:38:32,463 --> 00:38:36,169
Tell Daddy I love him too.

598
00:38:36,171 --> 00:38:38,211
Okay, goodbye.

599
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:10,898
Dad?

600
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,399
Dad!

601
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:28,669
Oh, my God!

602
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:30,305
I told you I would come.

603
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,752
I can't believe you're here!

604
00:39:31,754 --> 00:39:34,627
I called Annie, so yep. I'm here.

605
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:36,627
Oh, my God, I'm so happy to see you.

606
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:38,336
Well, you only get so many

607
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:39,794
cryptic and emotional phone calls

608
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,836
before I'm gonna hop on a plane.

609
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,919
Worried about you.

610
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:48,461
I know.

611
00:39:48,463 --> 00:39:50,961
Um, I think I'm gonna be okay.

612
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:54,502
Like, for real this time, Davey.

613
00:39:54,504 --> 00:39:56,796
- Okay.
- Come here.

614
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,211
It's gonna be different.

615
00:40:00,213 --> 00:40:02,794
We're gonna make it different.

616
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:04,794
I love you so much.

617
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:06,794
I love you.

618
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:27,586
Okay, whatever. I'm, like...

619
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:29,544
glad you're not dead.

620
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:30,919
I mean, I did almost die.

621
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,794
You didn't even bring me a Topo Chico?

622
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:38,836
Okay.

623
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:45,127
So Max is gonna be okay.

624
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,169
He's gonna have an epic scar

625
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,669
and I know he's gonna tell people

626
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:51,093
stupid, fucking made-up
stories about it,

627
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,711
and I'm definitely...

628
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:55,086
probably gonna have to break
up with him, but, you know.

629
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:56,836
And are you okay?

630
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:00,836
Yeah. It was a little bit of a...

631
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:02,919
dark ride, but...

632
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,461
we're all safe now.

633
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,211
God, Annie. I never
meant to get you in...

634
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,919
Oh, please, stop.

635
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:10,211
We'll get drunk and
laugh about it, maybe.

636
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:13,088
Actually, about that.

637
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:17,711
I am not drinking.

638
00:41:17,713 --> 00:41:19,627
I am trying not to drink.

639
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:21,877
That's closer to the truth, but yeah.

640
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,544
It's like a whole new lease on life.

641
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:25,461
Ew, cannot believe I just said that.

642
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:27,004
Please do not let me
say that ever again.

643
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:29,377
Oh, I'm gonna put
that shit on a T-shirt.

644
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:30,978
No.

645
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,836
Let's not get crazy, I've
been to two meetings, but...

646
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:35,169
you know when people quit stuff

647
00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:36,502
and they say it's, like, no big deal?

648
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:39,044
Well, they are fucking lying.

649
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:42,211
'Cause it is really, really hard.

650
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:44,669
Cass. after everything you've...

651
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,836
You can handle this.

652
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,086
- Thank you.
- And I'm here for you.

653
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:52,002
I mean, emotionally I'm here for you.

654
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:54,877
Not financially 'cause I have no job

655
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,809
and no prospects of a job.

656
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:58,752
But we can collect
unemployment together,

657
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:01,211
- so that'll be fun!
- Ooh, no, sorry.

658
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:04,666
The FBI cleared some stuff
up with Imperial Atlantic,

659
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:06,752
so I'm actually working
a flight tomorrow.

660
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:09,461
Oh! Cool, okay.

661
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:11,789
- Wow, I hate you.
- I know.

662
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,794
I mean, I love you,
like, very, very much,

663
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:15,802
but I also really hate you right now.

664
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:18,245
You know what, why don't I get
this since you don't have a job?

665
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,579
Yeah, that sounds good.

666
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:24,040
On second thought, let's see...

667
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:32,711
- What?
- This isn't mi...

668
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:38,669
Oh, my God.

669
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:41,836
Miranda.

670
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:43,836
What, is she... is she, like, here?

671
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:45,127
I gotta go see...

672
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,794
Cassie? Cassie?

673
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:30,502
Uh... hi?

674
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:33,294
- What are you doing here?
- Working.

675
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:35,412
I'm sorry, what about
the whole CIA thing?

676
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:36,705
Following Megan? All of that?

677
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:37,961
For now, all you need to know

678
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,919
is that I work at Imperial Atlantic,

679
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:41,586
and if I told you anything more,

680
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:43,877
then I was extremely jet-lagged.

681
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:45,725
But my boss kept asking about you

682
00:43:45,727 --> 00:43:48,794
for our "human asset" program.
Ever heard of it?

683
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:52,044
We should talk, because she will call.

684
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,127
Wait, wait, are... are you serious?

685
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:55,586
Look at your face.

686
00:43:55,588 --> 00:43:57,377
They're not gonna give
you a gun or anything.

687
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:06,294
Flight attendants, please
prepare for takeoff.

2
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,202
Hey, Al, can I help
you out in here?

3
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,337
Oh, I'm all set, thanks.

4
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:40,506
Gotcha. Good.
I'd go with the rows.

5
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:41,640
That's a good idea.

6
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,976
Today is diversity day,

7
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,311
and someone's gonna come in
and talk to us about diversity.

8
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,781
It's something
that I've been pushing...

9
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:51,016
that I've been wanting
to push for a long time.

10
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,851
And corporate mandated it.

11
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,754
And I never actually
talked to corporate about it.

12
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,123
Um, they kind of beat me
to the punch.

13
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,391
Uh, little bastards.

14
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,428
Um, but, uh...
but I was going to.

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,530
And I think it's very important
that we have this.

16
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,466
And, uh, I'm very, very excited.

17
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,036
That's the thing.
It's very sturdy paper.

18
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:14,173
And on the back it says
100% post-consumer content.

19
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,908
So... what?

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,244
Hello?
Uh-huh.

21
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,413
Wait, what?

22
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,649
I'm sorry, Mr. Deckerd,
I think I'm los...

23
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,684
I think I'm losing you.

24
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,353
Hello?
Hello?

25
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,388
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,223
Hold on one sec.
I don't know.

27
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,424
Hold on one second.

28
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,159
Do you really have
to do that right now?

29
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,327
Yes, I do.

30
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,862
I should have done this
weeks ago, actually.

31
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,031
Mr. Deckerd...
I'm sorry about that.

32
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,065
What were you...

33
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,967
Can you hold on one second?

34
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,569
Yeah, just one second.

35
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,370
Thanks.

36
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,640
Hello?

37
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,542
Oh, that's it.
Perfect.

38
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:51,610
So what I was saying...

39
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,878
Hello?

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,283
Thanks, Dwight.

41
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,351
Retaliation.

42
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,719
Tit for tit.

43
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,522
That is not the expression.

44
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,023
Well, it should be.

45
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,731
This is my biggest
sale of the year.

46
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,933
They love me over there
for some reason.

47
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,169
I'm not really sure why,
but, uh...

48
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,138
You know, I make one call
over there every year,

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,539
just to renew their account.

50
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:24,143
And that one call ends up
being 25% of my commission.

51
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,410
For the whole year.

52
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,213
So, you know, I buy
a mini bottle of champagne.

53
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,581
Celebrate a little.

54
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,484
And this year, I'm pushing
recycled paper on them

55
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,086
for one percent more.

56
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:39,024
I know,
I'm getting cocky, right?

57
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,231
Solitaire?

58
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,966
Yeah, Freecell.

59
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,335
Six on seven.

60
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,837
I know.
I saw that.

61
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,472
So then why didn't you do it?

62
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,007
I'm saving that,

63
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,875
'cause I like it when
the cards go...

64
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,479
Who doesn't love that?

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,357
Hey, Oscar!

66
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,493
How you doing, man?
All right.

67
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,495
So, did you get a good
weekend going there?

68
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,363
It was fine. Oh, yeah,
I bet it was fun.

69
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,468
Oh, hey, this is Oscar.

70
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,770
Martinez.

71
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:25,871
Right, see?
I don't even know.

72
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,005
First-name basis.

73
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,707
Great, uh, we're all set.

74
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,609
Oh, hey, well,
diversity, everybody.

75
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,877
Let's do it.

76
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,879
Oscar works in... here.

77
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,781
Jim, can you wrap it up, please?

78
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,683
Mr. Deckerd, please?

79
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,718
I... it's diversity day,
Jim.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,453
I wish every day
was diversity day.

81
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,888
You know what?

82
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,057
Um, I'm actually gonna
have to call you back.

83
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,226
Thank you.
Sorry about that.

84
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,663
Thank you. Come on,
people, let's get 'em in.

85
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,432
Thank you, great.
Get in the cards!

86
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,433
Get in the cards!

87
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,168
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

88
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,769
Okay, thanks
for filling these out,

89
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,705
and I promise this'll be quick.

90
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,139
At Diversity Today,

91
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,342
our philosophy is about honesty

92
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,611
and positive expectations.

93
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:06,912
We believe that 99%

94
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,680
of the problems in the workplace

95
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,482
arise simply out of ignorance.

96
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,485
You know what?
This is a color-free zone here.

97
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,021
Stanley, I don't look at you
as another race.

98
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,258
Uh... see, this is what
I'm talking about.

99
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,126
We don't have to pretend
that we're color-blind.

100
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,728
Exactly.
We're not color-blind.

101
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,130
That's fighting ignorance with
more ignorance. And tolerance.

102
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,632
No, with more ignorance.
Ignorance.

103
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,166
Right, exactly.

104
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,402
Uh, instead, we need
to celebrate our diversity.

105
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,704
Let's celebrate.
Right. Okay.

106
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,873
Celebrate good times.
Come on!

107
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,408
Let's celebrate
diversity, right?

108
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,643
Yes, exactly.

109
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,211
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

110
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,313
Uh, I've noticed that, uh, uh...

111
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,148
You know what?
Here's what we're gonna do.

112
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,651
Why don't we go around,
and everybody...

113
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,387
everybody say a race

114
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,256
that you are attracted to
sexually.

115
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,824
I will go last.
Go!

116
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:53,892
I have two.
Nice.

117
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,494
White and Indian.

118
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,729
Actually, I'd prefer
not to start that way.

119
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,898
Michael, I would love
to have your permission

120
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,899
to run this session.

121
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,134
Can I have your permission?

122
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,803
Yes.
Thank you very much.

123
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,505
And it would also
help me if you were seated.

124
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,473
Okay.
Thank you.

125
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,276
Okay, now, at the start
of the session,

126
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,412
I had you write down an incident

127
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,881
that you found offensive
in the workplace.

128
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,316
Now, what I'm going to do
is choose one,

129
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,483
and we're gonna act it out...

130
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,651
A few other ground rules,
just real quick.

131
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,786
Hey, why don't you run it by me,

132
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,887
and I'll run it by him.

133
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,222
Okay, can we steer
away from gay people?

134
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,825
Uh, I'm sorry,
it's an orientation.

135
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,627
It's not a race.

136
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,729
Plus, a lot of other races
are also intolerant of gays.

137
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,964
So... paradox.

138
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:33,999
Well, we only have an hour.

139
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,234
Good.
It'll save time.

140
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,737
Why don't we just defer
to Mr., um...

141
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:39,805
Mr. Brown.

142
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,273
Ah!
Oh, all right.

143
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,875
Okay, first test.
I will not call you that.

144
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,877
Well, it's my name.
It's not a test, okay?

145
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,814
Um, so, looking
through the cards,

146
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,782
I've noticed that many of you
wrote down the same incident,

147
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,518
which is ironic, because
it's the exact incident

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,354
I was brought in here
to respond to.

149
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,588
Now, how many of you
are familiar

150
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,357
with the Chris Rock routine?

151
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,060
Hmm, very good.

152
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,662
Okay.

153
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,598
How come Chris Rock
can do a routine,

154
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,801
and everybody finds it
hilarious and groundbreaking,

155
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,437
then I go and do
the exact same routine...

156
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,638
same comedic timing...

157
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,608
and people file a complaint
to corporate?

158
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,245
Is it because I'm White,
and Chris is Black?

159
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,783
So we're going to reenact this
with a more positive outcome.

160
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,284
I will play the Chris Rock guy.

161
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,221
I would like to see
someone else pull this off.

162
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,889
Well, let's have someone
who wasn't involved

163
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,057
do the reenactment.

164
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,760
Okay, I will play Guy Listening.

165
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,428
Great, Guy Listening.

166
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,963
Okay, anyone else remember?

167
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,464
I remember.
Great.

168
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,700
You're the Chris Rock guy,
and you're Guy Listening.

169
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,235
Okay.

170
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,803
Kevin is a great guy.

171
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,338
He's a great accountant.

172
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,106
He is not much
of an entertainer.

173
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,510
Basically, there are
two types of Black people.

174
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,446
And Black people
are actually more racist

175
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,482
because they hate the other
type of Black people.

176
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,418
See, every time the one type

177
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,186
wants to have a good time,

178
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,288
then the other type comes in

179
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,023
and makes a real mess...

180
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,426
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, he's...

181
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,027
He's ruin...
he's butchering it.

182
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,629
Um, could you just let me...

183
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,897
Every time...

184
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,866
Every time Black people
wanna have a good time,

185
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,002
some ig'nant ass...

186
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,638
Hold on...
I take care of my kids,

187
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,740
always want credit

188
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,742
for somethin'
they supposed to do!

189
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,143
Stop it!

190
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,316
What chu want, a cookie?

191
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,458
Now, this is a simple acronym.

192
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,625
HERO.

193
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,461
Uh, at Diversity Today,
we believe

194
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,463
it's very easy to be a HERO.

195
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,630
All you need are Honesty,

196
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,633
Empathy, Respect,
and Open-mindedness.

197
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,135
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah?

198
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,137
I'm sorry, but that's
not all it takes to be a hero.

199
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,105
Oh, great.
Well, what is a hero to you?

200
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,541
A hero kills people.
People that wish them harm.

201
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,609
Okay.

202
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,412
A hero is part human,
and part supernatural.

203
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:03,448
A hero is born
out of a childhood trauma

204
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,283
or out of a disaster

205
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,386
that must be avenged.

206
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,756
Okay, um, you're thinking
of a superhero.

207
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,426
We all have a hero in our heart.

208
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,163
Now, I need you
to take these forms.

209
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,832
This kind of expresses
the joint experience

210
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,400
we had today.

211
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,969
I want you to look them over
and sign them

212
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,637
as kind of a group pledge.

213
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,241
Ahem!

214
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,977
I don't think I can sign this.

215
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,079
Uh, I can't leave until you do.

216
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,781
Well, okay, it says here
that I learned something.

217
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,384
And... I knew
all this stuff already.

218
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,820
So... I could, you know,
I could sign something

219
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,188
that says that I
taught something.

220
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,023
Um... Or that I helped
you teach something.

221
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,692
So, Pam?
Where is she?

222
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,427
Pam, could we
change something on this?

223
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,964
Uh, Michael,
can I talk to you candidly?

224
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:53,965
Sure.

225
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,600
We both know that I'm here

226
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,802
because of the comments
that you made.

227
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,371
Here's the thing...
this office

228
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:03,308
I think is very advanced
in terms of, uh,

229
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,244
racial awareness.

230
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,713
And, uh, it's probably more
advanced than you're used to.

231
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,782
Um... It's probably
throwing you off a little.

232
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,717
It's not throwing me.
I need your signature.

233
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,853
Okay, well, I know.
You told me that.

234
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,987
Several times.

235
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,422
Yes, but you're not
listening to me.

236
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,025
Yours is the only signature I need.
Oh, okay.

237
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,093
Those are my instructions
from the corporate offices...

238
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,628
to put you through this seminar

239
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,564
for the comments that you made.

240
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,799
And the only reason why
I made copies for everyone

241
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,401
was so that you
wouldn't be embarrassed.

242
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,809
Well, here I am thinking

243
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:42,247
that you actually cared
about diversity training.

244
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,682
And... you don't.

245
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,250
Don't worry about dating it.

246
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,518
I won't.

247
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,790
Okay, thank you.

248
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,391
Yep, yep.

249
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,199
"I regret my actions.
I regret offending my coworkers.

250
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,568
"I pledge to bring
my best spirit of honesty,

251
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,671
"empathy, respect,
and open-mindedness"...

252
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,440
open-mindedness,
that even a word?

253
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,141
"um, into the workplace.

254
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,211
"In this way,
I can truly be a HERO.

255
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,980
"Signed...

256
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,448
Daffy Duck."

257
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,123
He's gonna lose it
when he reads that.

258
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,125
Yeah, hi.
Is Mr. Deckerd around?

259
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,427
Oh, well, could you just
have him call me after lunch?

260
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,595
Thank you.

261
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,767
"I... pledge

262
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,403
"to always keep an open mind

263
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,406
and an open heart!"

264
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:53,051
I do believe
in that part of the pledge

265
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,152
that I just read.

266
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,820
But a pledge?
Come on.

267
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,255
I mean, who are we,
the Girl Scouts?

268
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,024
No.
Look...

269
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,559
The, um, the guy,
Mr. Brown,

270
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,061
uh, he got us halfway there.

271
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,129
He got us talking.

272
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,564
Well, no, I got us talking.

273
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,166
He got us nothing.

274
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,535
He, uh, insulted us,
and he abandoned us.

275
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,003
You call that
diversity training?

276
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,139
I don't.

277
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,574
Were there any connections
between any of us?

278
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,643
Did anyone look each other
in the eye?

279
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,645
Was there any emotion going on?

280
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,480
Were... no!

281
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,915
Where was the heart?

282
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,183
I didn't see any heart.

283
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,686
Where was my Oprah moment?

284
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:31,056
Okay, get as much done
as you can before lunch,

285
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,425
because afterward,

286
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,194
I'm going to have you
all in tears.

287
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,642
All right, everybody pretty?

288
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,377
Come on, here we go.

289
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,445
It's time.

290
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,013
Let's do some good.

291
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,848
Hey, we're not all gonna
sit in a circle,

292
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,049
Indian-style, are we?

293
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,685
Get out.

294
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,786
Sorry.

295
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,055
No.
This is not a joke.

296
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,125
Okay?
That was offensive, and lame.

297
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,127
So double offensive.

298
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,330
This is an environment
of welcoming.

299
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,100
And you should just
get the hell out of here.

300
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,635
Okay, let's go!

301
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,837
Let's do it!

302
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,939
Come on, let's have
some fun, everybody.

303
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,108
Here we go.
Take a seat.

304
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,943
Cop a squat.

305
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,546
And, um, thank you
for coming in.

306
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,681
Um...

307
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,584
Diversity...

308
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,888
is the cornerstone of progress,

309
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,389
as I've always said.

310
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,191
But don't take my word for it.

311
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,760
Let's take a look at the tape.

312
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,234
Hi, I'm Michael Scott.

313
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,436
I'm in charge
of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products

314
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,371
here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

315
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,341
But I'm also the founder
of Diversity Tomorrow.

316
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,910
Because today is almost over.

317
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,782
Abraham Lincoln once said that

318
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,383
"If you're a racist,

319
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,753
I will attack you
with the North."

320
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,489
And those are the principles
that I carry with me

321
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,957
in the workplace.

322
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,830
Okay.
Questions, comments?

323
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,431
Anybody?
Jim?

324
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,000
Uh, is that it?

325
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,402
Uh, yes, I only had
an hour to put it together.

326
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,171
But I'm gonna add onto it
later on.

327
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,872
It was kind of hard to hear.

328
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,141
Uh, yes, that probably
had something to do

329
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,643
with the camera work.

330
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,578
Anybody else?
Um...

331
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,547
I have a customer meeting.

332
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,049
Yeah, well, if you leave,
we'll only have two left...

333
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,250
Yes.

334
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,285
Enjoy!

335
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,353
Absolutely.
Namaste.

336
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,690
Okay, well,
since I am leading this,

337
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,292
let's get down to business.

338
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:51,763
And why don't I just kind of
introduce myself, okay?

339
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,032
Um, I am Michael.

340
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:58,136
And I am part English,
Irish, uh, German,

341
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,038
and Scot'ish!

342
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,608
Sort of a virtual
United Nations.

343
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,210
But what some of you
might not know

344
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:09,214
is that I am also
part Native American Indian.

345
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,515
What part Native American?

346
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,150
Two fifteenths.

347
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,419
Two fif... that fraction
doesn't make any sense.

348
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,254
Well, you know what?

349
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,622
It's kind of hard
for me to talk about.

350
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,957
There's suffering.
So who else?

351
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,058
Let's get this poppin'.

352
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,594
Come on.
Who's going, who's going?

353
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,363
Ah, let's go here.
Oscar, right here.

354
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,931
You're on!

355
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,534
Okay, Michael.
Um...

356
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,603
Well, both my parents
were born in Mexico.

357
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:32,904
Oh, yeah.

358
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,806
And, uh, they moved
to the United States

359
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,207
a year before I was born.

360
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,208
Yeah?

361
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,977
So I grew up
in the United States.

362
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,912
Wow. And my parents are Mexican.

363
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:44,148
Wow, that is...
that is a great story.

364
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,217
That's the American Dream
right there, right?

365
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,485
Thank... yeah.

366
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,788
Um, let me ask you,
is there a term

367
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,292
besides Mexican that you prefer?

368
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,727
Something less offensive?

369
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,896
Mexican isn't offensive.

370
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,231
Well, it has
certain connotations.

371
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,399
Like what?

372
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,501
Like, wa...

373
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,869
I don't...
well, I don't know.

374
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,638
What connotations, Michael?
No, no.

375
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,039
You must have meant something.

376
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,774
No, now, remember...
I'm just curious.

377
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,410
Honesty, empathy,

378
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,745
respect...

379
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,380
Jim? Jim!

380
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,715
Hello?

381
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,617
Hello?

382
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,521
I have something here.
I want you to take a card.

383
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,556
Put it on your fore...
Don't look at the card!

384
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,791
I want you take the card,

385
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,693
and I want you to put it
on your forehead.

386
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,395
And... take a card.

387
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:31,896
Take a card, any card.

388
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,065
Um, and I want you

389
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,034
to treat other people

390
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,305
like the race that is
on their forehead, okay?

391
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,873
So everybody has
a different race.

392
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,208
Nobody knows what their race is.

393
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,344
So...

394
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,279
I want you to really go for it.

395
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,514
'Cause this is real.

396
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:50,748
You know, this isn't
just an exercise.

397
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,050
This is real life.

398
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,320
And I have a dream

399
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,923
that you will really
let the sparks fly.

400
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,291
Get 'er done!

401
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,492
Why?

402
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,695
Because Martin Luther King
is a hero of mine.

403
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,464
There's this great
Chris Rock bit

404
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,133
about how streets
named after Martin Luther King

405
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,601
tend to be more violent.

406
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,539
I'm not gonna do it, but it's...

407
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,040
Oh, this is a good one.

408
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,343
Um, hi.
How are you?

409
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,944
Fine.
How are you?

410
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,113
Push it, push it.
Great... um...

411
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,414
Pump it up.
Let's go.

412
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,717
I admire your culture's
success in America.

413
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,318
Thank you.
Good.

414
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,689
Olympics of suffering,
right here.

415
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,359
Slavery versus the Holocaust.
Come on.

416
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,994
Who am I supposed to be?

417
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,362
No, no, no.
Well, that...

418
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,529
That was inadvertent.

419
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,931
We didn't actually plan that.

420
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,433
Lots of cultures eat rice.

421
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,434
It doesn't help me.

422
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,970
Um...
shalom.

423
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,272
I'd like to apply for a loan.

424
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,440
That's nice, Dwight.

425
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,808
Okay, do me.

426
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,810
Something stereotypical,
so I can get it really quick.

427
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,278
Okay, I like your food.

428
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,048
Uh, Outback Steakhouse.
I'm Australian, mate!

429
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,883
Pam, Pam!
Come on.

430
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,019
"I like your food."
No, come on.

431
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,855
Stir the pot!
Stir the melting pot, Pam!

432
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,056
Let's do it.
Let's get ugly.

433
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,224
Let's get real.

434
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,725
Okay.

435
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,260
If I have to do this,

436
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,296
based on stereotypes
that are totally untrue,

437
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,798
that I do not agree with,

438
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,435
you would maybe not
be a very good driver.

439
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,037
Oh, man, am I a woman?

440
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,706
You'll notice I didn't
have anybody be an Arab.

441
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,574
I thought that would
be too explosive.

442
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,276
Uh, no pun intended.

443
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,647
But I just thought
too soon for Arabs.

444
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,116
Maybe next year.
Um...

445
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,819
You know, the ball's
in their court.

446
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,054
What are you watching?

447
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,288
Chappelle's Show.
Really?

448
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,257
Yeah, I downloaded it
on her computer.

449
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,491
I hope she doesn't mind.

450
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,226
No way, no. She just had
a lot of extra space.

451
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,529
I think she really likes this stuff.
Great.

452
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,531
She's cute, huh?

453
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,633
Yeah. You know,
she's engaged, but...

454
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:52,036
Oh, no, the girl
in the... sketch.

455
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,472
Oh, yeah.
She's hot.

456
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,540
Yeah.

457
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:56,741
Hey.

458
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,509
Hey.

459
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,445
You wanna go to the beach?

460
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,479
Sure.

461
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,082
You wanna get high?

462
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,249
No.

463
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,485
I think you do, "mon."

464
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,387
Stop it.
Okay, all right, no.

465
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,890
That's good, it...
you just... you need to push it.

466
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,959
You know, you need
to go a little bit further.

467
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,329
Uh, all right.
Okay.

468
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,564
Kelly!

469
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,699
How are you? I ha-had
the longest meeting.

470
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,469
Oh, welcome to
my convenience store!

471
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,471
Would you like some
cookie-cookie?!

472
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,639
I have some very delicious
cookie-cookie!

473
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,641
Only 99 cents, plus tax!

474
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,945
Try my cookie-cookie.
Try my cookie-cookie.

475
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,314
Try my cookie-cookie.
Try my...

476
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,793
All right!
All right!

477
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,927
Yes!

478
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,265
That was great!
She gets it!

479
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,368
Now she knows what it's like
to be a minority!

480
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,674
Mr. Deckerd,

481
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,209
we didn't lose
your sale today, did we?

482
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,878
Excellent!
Okay...

483
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,149
Let me just get your...
What's that?

484
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,584
No, we didn't...
We didn't close last time.

485
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,154
I just need your, uh...

486
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,589
Oh!

487
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,225
What... what code
were you given?

488
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,427
Oh, okay.

489
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,497
Yeah, no, that's actually
another salesman here.

490
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,766
Yeah, I can redo it
if you wanna do that.

491
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,134
Oh, he gave you a discount?

492
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,236
No, I don't blame you.

493
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,505
I just hated it
when that guy was in here.

494
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,209
Mr. Brown, if that
was his real name.

495
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,578
I mean, he had never
met any of us before,

496
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,915
and here was telling us
how to do our thing.

497
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,183
I just wanted...

498
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,786
I just wanted to do it
our way, you know?

499
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,821
On our own.

500
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,625
Man, I should have
gotten some food.

501
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,460
Maybe some spaghetti.

502
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,529
Okay, Kevin, you can
take off that thing.

503
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,598
Okay?

504
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,832
That would have really,

505
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,870
really shown him up,
wouldn't it?

506
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:10,074
If I'd brought in some burritos
or some "colored" greens.

507
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,711
Or some Pad Thai.
I love Pad Thai.

508
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,846
It's collard greens.
What?

509
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,515
It's collard greens.

510
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,717
Uh, that doesn't really
make sense.

511
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,419
'Cause you don't call them
"collard people."

512
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,486
That's offensive.

513
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,125
Okay, well,
it's after 5:00.

514
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:32,530
So... thank you very much.

515
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,532
Buena Vista, Oscar.

516
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,167
Thank you.

517
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,237
Good job.
Ah, my man.

518
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,873
Thank you, Brazil.

519
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,142
Nice.

520
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,253
Uh... hey.

521
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,320
Hmm?

522
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,722
Hey.

523
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,457
We can go.

524
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,458
Sorry.

525
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,492
That's fine.

526
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,094
Talk to you later.

527
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,100
Uh...

528
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,503
Not a bad day.

528
00:21:13,305 --> 00:22:13,507

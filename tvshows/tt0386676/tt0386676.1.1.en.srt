2
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,465
All right, Jim,

3
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,235
your quarterlies look very good.

4
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,703
How are things going
at the library?

5
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,005
Oh, I told you.
I couldn't close it, so...

6
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,509
So you've come
to the master for guidance?

7
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,111
Is this what you're saying,
Grasshopper?

8
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,946
Uh, actually,
you called me in here.

9
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,314
But, yeah.

10
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,051
All right, well, let me
show you how it's done.

11
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,720
Yes, I'd like to speak
to your office manager, please.

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,889
Yes, hello.
This is Michael Scott.

13
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,390
I am the Regional Manager

14
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,559
of Dunder Mifflin
paper products.

15
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,662
Just wanted to talk to you
manager a manager.

16
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,000
All right, done deal!

17
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,368
Thank you very much, sir!

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,038
You're gentleman and a scholar.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,208
Okay.
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,210
My mistake.

22
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,513
That was a woman
I was talking to.

23
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,683
So.
She had a very low voice.

24
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,752
Probably a smoker.

25
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,255
So...

26
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,857
So that's the way it's done.

27
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,359
I've, uh, I've been
at Dunder Mifflin

28
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,561
for 12 years.

29
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,996
The last four
as regional manager.

30
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:41,233
Uh, if you wanna
come through here.

31
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,868
Ah, see, we have
the entire floor.

32
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,604
So this is my kingdom,
far as the eye can see.

33
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,073
Ah, this
is our receptionist Pam.

34
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,942
Pam! Pam, Pam!

35
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,176
Pam Beasley.

36
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,913
Uh, Pam has been with us,
um... for... forever.

37
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,014
Right, Pam?

38
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,082
Well, I don't know.

39
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,217
If you think she's cute now,

40
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,751
you should have seen her
a couple of years ago.

41
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,053
Reow, reow.

42
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,054
What?

43
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,589
Uh, any messages?

44
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,458
Um... yeah.
Just a fax.

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,393
Oh.

46
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,728
Pam, this is from corporate.

47
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,029
How many times have I
told you I know...

48
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,331
that there's
a special filing cabinet

49
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,832
for things from corporate?

50
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,867
You haven't told me...

51
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,189
It's called
the wastepaper basket!

52
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,939
Look at that!

53
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,674
Oh, look at that face.

54
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,010
People say I am the best boss.

55
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,378
They go,

56
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,113
"God, we've never worked
in a place like this before.

57
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,015
"You're hilarious.

58
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,184
And you get the best
out of us."

59
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,920
Um...

60
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:38,624
I think that
pretty much sums it up.

61
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,792
I found it at Spencer Gifts.

62
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,882
My job is to speak to clients,
um, on the phone,

63
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:07,319
about...
uh, quantities

64
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:12,558
and, uh, type of...
copier paper.

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,727
You know, whether
we can supply it to them,

66
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,564
whether they can, uh...

67
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,598
pay for it.

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,767
And, um...

69
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,540
I'm... I'm boring myself
just talking about this.

70
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,346
Wassuuuup?

71
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,847
Wassuuuup?

72
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,716
I still love that
after seven years.

73
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,785
Whasuuuup?

74
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,254
Whasuuuup?

75
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,056
Whasuuuuuuuuuup?

76
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,625
Whassup?

77
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:47,859
Oh, wow.

78
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,806
What?

79
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,441
Nothin'.

80
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,009
Okay, all right.

81
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,277
See you later.

82
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,246
All right.

83
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,614
Take care.

84
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,182
Back to work!

85
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,455
Just try to reach him
sometime today.

86
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,724
Um, I don't know,
just before lunch.

87
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,659
That would be great.

88
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,327
Corporate really doesn't
interfere with me at all.

89
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,395
Jan Levenson-Gould...

90
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,097
Jan! Hello!

91
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,599
I call her
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

92
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,868
Right?
Not to her face, because, uh...

93
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,504
Well, not because
I'm scared of her.

94
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,306
Because I'm not.

95
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,276
But, um, yeah.

96
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,378
All right, was there anything
you wanted to add to the agenda?

97
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,782
Mmm... me no get
an agenda.

98
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,417
I'm sor... What?
I'm sorry?

99
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,852
I didn't get any agenda.

100
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,654
Well, I faxed one over
to you this morning.

101
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,889
Really? 'Cause it didn't,
uh, I didn't...

102
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,991
Did we get a fax this morning?

103
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,626
Uh, yeah, the one...

104
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,397
Then why... why isn't
it in my hand?

105
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,732
Because a company runs
on efficiency of communication.

106
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,467
Right? Just...

107
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,169
Um, so what's the problem, Pam?

108
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,005
Why didn't, uh,
why didn't I get it?

109
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,107
You put it in the garbage can

110
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,176
that was a special
filing cabinet.

111
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,381
Yeah!
Uh, that was a joke.

112
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,916
That was a joke that, uh,

113
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,751
was actually my brother's.

114
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:20,852
And it was...

115
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,220
it was supposed
to be with bills,

116
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,588
and it doesn't
work great with faxes.

117
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,990
- Do you wanna look at mine?
- Yeah.

118
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,792
Yeah, I would.
Thank you.

119
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,860
Okay, since the last meeting,

120
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,362
Alan and the board have decided

121
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,164
that we can't justify
a Scranton branch

122
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,365
and a Stanford branch.

123
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,533
Oh, okay.

124
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,600
Michael, don't panic...

125
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,935
No, no, no, no.
This is good.

126
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,537
This is good.
This is fine, excellent.

127
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,571
Michael, listen,
okay, don't panic.

128
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,106
Although alarm bells
are kinda going

129
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,041
- ringy dingy dingy!
- We haven't made any decisions yet.

130
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,242
I've spoken to Josh in Stanford.

131
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,844
I've told him the same as you,

132
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,579
and it's up to either
you or him to convince me

133
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,647
that your branch
can incorporate the other.

134
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,148
Okay, no problem.

135
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,750
This does, however, mean that
there's going to be downsizing.

136
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,852
Me no wanna hear that, Jan.

137
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,088
Because downsizing is a bitch.

138
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,490
It is a real bitch.

139
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,727
And I wouldn't wish that
on Josh's men.

140
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,795
I certainly wouldn't
wish it on my men.

141
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,365
Or women,
present company excluded.

142
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,733
Sorry, uh...

143
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:11,103
Is Josh concerned
about downsizing, himself?

144
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,337
Not downsizing himself,

145
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,779
but is he concerned about
downsizing?

146
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,077
Ha ha ha ha!

147
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,779
Question: How long
do we have to act...

148
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,317
Oh, Todd Packer.
Terrific rep.

149
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,451
Do you mind if I take it?

150
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,619
Go right ahead.

151
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,854
Packman.

152
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,155
Hey, you big queen!

153
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,957
Oh, that's not...
appropriate.

154
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,593
Hey, is old Godzillary
coming in today?

155
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,094
Um, I don't know.
I don't know what you mean.

156
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,197
Look, I've been meaning
to ask her one question.

157
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
Does the carpet
match the drapes?

158
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,667
Oh, my God.

159
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,136
Ohh!

160
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,972
That's... horrifying.

161
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,708
And horrible.

162
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,611
Horrible person.

163
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,847
So do you think we could
keep a lid on this for now?

164
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,682
I don't wanna worry people
unnecessarily.

165
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,884
No, absolutely.

166
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,185
Under this regime,

167
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,853
it will not leave this office.

168
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,455
Just... like that.

169
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,624
So what does downsizing
actually mean?

170
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,058
Well...

171
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,960
You guys gotta update
your resumes,

172
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:09,961
just like I'm doing.

173
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,530
I bet it's gonna be me.

174
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,765
It's probably gonna be me.

175
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,367
Yeah, it'll be you.

176
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,768
I have an important
question for you.

177
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,270
Yes?

178
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,072
Um, are you going to Angela's
cat party on Sunday?

179
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,608
Yeah. Stop.
That is ridiculous.

180
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,444
Am I gonna tell them?
No, I'm not going to tell them.

181
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,611
I don't see the point of that.

182
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,947
As a doctor, you would not
tell a patient

183
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,515
if they had cancer.

184
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:31,616
Hey!

185
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,385
- Hey!
- This is Mr. Scott.

186
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,353
Guilty!
Guilty as charged.

187
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,988
Ryan Howard
from the temp agency.

188
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,989
Uh-huh.

189
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,324
Daniqua sent me down
to start today.

190
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,726
Howard, like Moe Howard,
Three Stooges.

191
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,562
Watch this, this is Moe.

192
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,963
Nyuck! Nyuck! Nyuck!
Nyuck! Nyuck!

193
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,499
Meeeeh!
Ha ha!

194
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,134
Ah, right here.
Three Stooges.

195
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,969
High five!
Oh, Pam.

196
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,471
It's a guy thing, Pam.

197
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,574
I'm sort of a student of comedy.

198
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,576
Watch this...

199
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,218
I'm Hitler!

200
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,686
Adolf Hitler...

201
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,522
I don't think it would be

202
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,458
the worst thing
if they let me go.

203
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,961
Because then I might...

204
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,762
I just, I don't think
it's many little girls' dream

205
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,165
to be a receptionist.

206
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,267
Um, I like to do illustrations.

207
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,971
Um, mostly watercolor.

208
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,473
A few oil pencil.
Um...

209
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,242
Jim thinks they're good.

210
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,110
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

211
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,013
Sure. Uh, Mr. Davis,
let me call you right back.

212
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,615
Yeah, something just came up.
Two minutes.

213
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,783
Thank you very much.

214
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,085
Dwight, what are you doing?

215
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,786
- What?
- What are you doing?

216
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,622
Just clearing my desk.
I can't concentrate.

217
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,656
It's not on your desk.

218
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,857
It's overlapping.

219
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,526
It's all spilling over the edge.

220
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,595
One word, two syllables:
demarcation.

221
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,305
You can't do that.

222
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,140
Why not?

223
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,943
Safety violation.
I could fall and pierce...

224
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,177
an organ.

225
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,680
We'll see.

226
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,286
See, this is why the whole
downsizing thing

227
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,054
- just doesn't bother me.
- Downsizing?

228
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,522
Downsizing?

229
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,024
Yeah, I have
no problem with that.

230
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,159
I have been
recommending downsizing

231
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,094
since I first got here.

232
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,397
I even brought it up
in my interview.

233
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,933
I say bring it on.

234
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,303
You just still have
these messages from yesterday.

235
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,138
Relax, everything's
under control.

236
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,440
Uh, yeah.
There we go, yeah.

237
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,275
Oh, that's important.
Rrrright.

238
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,246
Oh, this is so important
I should run to answer it.

239
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,914
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

240
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,150
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

241
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,452
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

242
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,688
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

243
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,556
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

244
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,159
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

245
00:09:54,161 --> 00:10:00,799
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

246
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,833
What?

247
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,368
Come on!

248
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,970
Six Million Dollar Man!

249
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,171
Steve Austin!

250
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,540
Actually, that would be
a good salary for me,

251
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,674
don't you think?

252
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,775
$6 million?

253
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,445
Memo to Jan:
I deserve a raise.

254
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,913
Don't we all?

255
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,448
I'm sorry?

256
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,950
It's nothing.

257
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,886
If you're unhappy
with your compensation,

258
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,055
maybe you should
take it up with H.R.

259
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,156
Okay?

260
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,725
Not today, okay?

261
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,094
Pam, just...
be professional.

262
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,067
I think I'm a role model here.

263
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,869
I think I garner
people's respect.

264
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,739
Attention all Dunder Mifflin
employees, please.

265
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,374
We have a meeting
in the conference room

266
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,175
A.S.A.P.

267
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,411
People I respect,
heroes of mine, would be...

268
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,613
Bob Hope.

269
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:53,218
Um...
Abraham Lincoln.

270
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,654
Definitely.

271
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:59,758
Bono.

272
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,527
Uh, and probably God...

273
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,897
would be the fourth one.

274
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,899
And I just think
all those people

275
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,269
really helped the world

276
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,072
in so many ways

277
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,841
that it's, um...

278
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,877
it's really beyond words.

279
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,915
It's really incalcalacable.

280
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,583
Now, I know there are
some rumors out there,

281
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,052
and I just kinda wanna
set the record straight...

282
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm Assistant Regional Manger.
I should know first.

283
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,422
Assistant
to the Regional Manager.

284
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,490
Okay, um, can you
just tell me, please?

285
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,325
Just tell me quietly.
Whisper it in my ear.

286
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,727
I'm just about to tell everyone.

287
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,228
- Can't you just tell us...
- Please!

288
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,697
Okay?
Do you want me to tell them?

289
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,365
You don't know what it is.

290
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,034
Okay, you tell them.
With my permission.

291
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,436
- I don't need...
- Permission granted. Go ahead.

292
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,472
Corporate has
deemed it appropriate

293
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,608
to enforce an ultimatum upon me.

294
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,511
And, uh, Jan is thinking
about downsizing

295
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,181
either the Stanford branch
or this branch.

296
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,850
I heard they might be
closing this branch down.

297
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,219
That's just...

298
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,420
That's just the rumor
going around.

299
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,822
This is my first day,
I don't really know.

300
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,790
Yeah, but, Michael,
what if they downsize here?

301
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,925
Not gonna happen.

302
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,159
It could be
out of your hands, Michael.

303
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:11,463
It won't be out of my hands,
Stanley, okay?

304
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,530
I promise you that.

305
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,631
Oh, can you promise that?

306
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,899
On his mother's grave.

307
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,334
Well...

308
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,669
No!

309
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,704
Well, yeah, it is a promise.

310
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,473
And, frankly,
I'm a little bit insulted

311
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,641
that you have to keep
asking about it.

312
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,043
It's just that we need to know.

313
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,712
I-I know.
Hold on a second.

314
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,080
I think Pam wanted
to say something.

315
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,850
Pam, you, uh...

316
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,552
had a look that you
wanted to ask a question

317
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,055
just now.

318
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,857
I was in the meeting with Jan,

319
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,226
and she did say
that it could be this branch

320
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,393
that gets the axe.

321
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,529
Are you sure about that?

322
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,797
Look, Pam...

323
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,132
Uh, maybe you should stick

324
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,268
to the ongoing confidentiality
agreement of meetings.

325
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,337
Pam, information is power.

326
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,505
So...

327
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,773
So you can't say for sure

328
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,241
whether it's gonna
be us or them, can you?

329
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,275
No, no, no, no.

330
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,643
Stanley, no.

331
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,879
You did not see me
in there with her.

332
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,648
I said if, uh, if corporate

333
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,717
wants to come in here
and interfere,

334
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,619
then they're gonna
have to go through me.

335
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,820
Right?

336
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,922
You know, you can go
mess with Josh's people.

337
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,791
But I'm the head of this family,

338
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,628
and you ain't gonna be
messin' with my chillun'.

339
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,270
If I left,
what would I do with...

340
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,740
all this useless
information in my head?

341
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:33,344
You know?
Tonnage price of manila folders?

342
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,847
Um, Pam's favorite
flavor of yogurt,

343
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,115
which is mixed berry.

344
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,887
Jim said mixed berries?

345
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,892
Oh, well, yeah, he's on to me.

346
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,961
Um...

347
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch out for this guy.

348
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,065
Dwight Schrute in the building.

349
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,133
This is Ryan, the new temp.

350
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,267
- What's up?
- Nice to meet you.

351
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,635
Introduce yourself.
Be polite.

352
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,904
Uh, Dwight Schrute,
Assistant Regional Manager.

353
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,006
Assistant
to the Regional Manager.

354
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,676
So, uh, Dwight,
tell him about the Kung Fu

355
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,711
and the car and everything.

356
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,480
Uh, yeah, I got a '78280Z.

357
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,915
I bought it for 1,200,
fixed it up.

358
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:11,916
It's now worth three grand.

359
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:12,951
That is his profit.

360
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,752
Yeah, uh, new engine,
suspension.

361
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,121
I got a respray.
I got some photos.

362
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,390
Oh! Damn it!

363
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,391
Damn it! I...

364
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,460
Hold on, hold on.
Judge is in session.

365
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,995
What is the problem here?

366
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,397
He put my stuff
in Jell-O again!

367
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,034
That's real professional.
Thanks.

368
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,803
This is the third time,
and it wasn't funny

369
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:32,971
the first two times either, Jim!

370
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,405
It's okay here.

371
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,774
Uh, but people sometimes
take advantage

372
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,276
because it's so relaxed.

373
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,247
I'm a volunteer sheriff's
deputy on the weekends.

374
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,816
And you cannot
screw around there.

375
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,885
It's sort of one of the rules.

376
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,886
What is that?

377
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:48,887
That's my stapler.

378
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,822
No, no!
Do not take it out.

379
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,557
You have to eat it out of there,

380
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,225
because there are
starving people in the world,

381
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,293
and, which I hate,

382
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,362
and it it is a waste
of that kind of food.

383
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,663
You know what?
You can be a witness.

384
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,064
Can you reprimand him, please?

385
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,201
How do you know it was me?

386
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,269
It's always you.

387
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,503
Are you gonna
discipline him or not?

388
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,438
Ooh, discipline, kinky!

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,174
All right, here's
the deal, you guys.

390
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,777
Thing about a practical joke
is that you have to know

391
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,013
when to start
as well as when to stop.

392
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,247
And, yeah,

393
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,683
Jim, now is the time

394
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,419
to stop putting
Dwight's personal effects

395
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,922
into Jell-O.

396
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,356
Okay.

397
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,225
Dwight, I'm sorry, because...

398
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,228
I have always been
your biggest flan.

399
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,464
Ho ho ho, nice!

400
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,233
That's the way
it is around here.

401
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,968
It just kind of goes
round and round and round.

402
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,270
You, uh, you should have
put him in "custardy."

403
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,039
Oh, hey!
Yes!

404
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,641
New guy!
And he scores.

405
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,776
Okay, that's great.

406
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,744
I guess what I'm
most concerned with

407
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,380
is damage to company property.

408
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,149
That's all.

409
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,187
Pudding.

410
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,956
Putting.

411
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,426
I'm trying to think
what other dessert to do.

412
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,097
Do you like going out at the
end of the week for a drink?

413
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,265
Yeah.

414
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,300
Well, that's why
we're all going out.

415
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,668
So that we can have
an end-of-the-week drink.

416
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,769
So when are we going out?

417
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,338
I don't know.
Tonight, hopefully.

418
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,539
Okay, yeah.

419
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,176
Hey, man.

420
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,177
Hey!
What's going on?

421
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,178
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

422
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,213
Uh, Roy is my fiancé.

423
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,949
We've been engaged about, um...

424
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,818
about three years.

425
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,654
And, uh, we were supposed
to get married in September,

426
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,424
but I think we're gonna
get married in the spring.

427
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,761
Do you mind if I go out
for a drink with these guys?

428
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,296
Uh, no, no, come on.

429
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,298
Let's get out of here, go home.

430
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,201
Okay, um, I'm gonna be
a few minutes, though.

431
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,370
It's only 20 past 5:00.

432
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,071
I still have to do my faxes.

433
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,945
You know what?
You should come with us.

434
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,313
Because, you know,
we're all going out,

435
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,215
and it could be
a good chance for you to...

436
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,183
see what people are like
outside of the office.

437
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,985
You know, I think
it could be fun.

438
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,253
No, it sounds good.

439
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,388
Oh, no.

440
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,622
Seriously, we gotta get going.

441
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:19,837
Um... what's in the...
what's in the bag?

443
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,339
Just tell her
I'll talk to her later.

444
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,074
No, definitely.
All right, dude, awesome.

445
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,609
Will do.

446
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,680
Do I think

447
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,483
I'll be invited to the wedding?

448
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,860
So, uh, have you
felt a vibe yet?

449
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,562
We work hard, we play hard.

450
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,764
Sometimes we play hard
when we should be working hard.

451
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,032
Right?

452
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:51,436
Um, I guess the atmosphere
that I've created here

453
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,438
is that I'm a friend first

454
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,139
and a boss second.

455
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,741
Probably, uh...

456
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,875
Entertainer third.

457
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,845
Just a second!
Right?

458
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:03,414
Oh, hey, do you, uh,

459
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,383
do you like
The Jamie Kennedy Experiment?

460
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,984
- Yeah.
- Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?

461
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,453
Okay, um...

462
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,687
you are gonna be my accomplice.

463
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,988
Just go along with it, okay?

464
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,523
- All right.
- Just follow my lead.

465
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,525
Don't pimp me, all right?
Come in!

466
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,528
- So, uh, corporate just said that I don't want to...
- You got a fax.

467
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,963
Oh, thank you, Pam.

468
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,365
Pam, can you come in here
for a sec?

469
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,600
Just have a seat.

470
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,868
I was gonna call you in anyway.

471
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,304
Um, you know Ryan.

472
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,573
Um, as you know,

473
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,708
there's going to be downsizing.

474
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,646
And you have made
my life so much easier

475
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:40,218
in that I am going
to have to let you go first.

476
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,120
What? Why?

477
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,222
Why?
Well, theft.

478
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,389
And stealing.

479
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,390
Stealing?

480
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,492
Mm-hmm.

481
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,561
Um, what am I supposed
to have stolen?

482
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,263
Post-it notes.

483
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,798
- Post-it notes?
- Yeah.

484
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,666
What are those worth,
like, 50 cents?

485
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,968
50 cents, yeah.

486
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,170
You steal 1,000 Post-It notes
at 50 cents apiece,

487
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,740
and, you know, you've
made a profit... margin.

488
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,243
You know, gonna run us
out of business, Pam.

489
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,078
Are you serious?

490
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,014
Yeah, I, um...

491
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,850
Oh, my...
I can't believe this.

492
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,753
I mean, I've never even
stolen as much as a paper clip,

493
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,256
and now you're firing me.

494
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,424
And the best thing about it
is that, uh,

495
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:24,128
we're not gonna have
to give you any severance pay.

496
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,266
Because that is
gross misconduct, and, uh...

497
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,435
So just clean out your desk.
I'm sorry.

498
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,155
You've been "Xed," punk!

499
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,823
Surprise!
It's a joke!

500
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,192
We were joking around!

501
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,326
See?

502
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,894
Okay, he was in on it.

503
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,329
He was my accomplice.

504
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,699
And it was just kind of
a morale booster thing.

505
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,369
And we were showing
the new guy around, kind of...

506
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,438
kind of giving him
the feel of the place.

507
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,774
So you sh...

508
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,076
God, you were...
We totally got you...

509
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,212
You're a jerk!

510
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,780
Ah, I don't know about that.

511
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,897
What is the most

512
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,999
important thing for a company?

513
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:39,036
Is it the cash flow?
Is it the inventory?

514
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,072
Nuh-uh.

515
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,174
It's the people.

516
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,676
The people.

517
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,078
My proudest moment here

518
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,514
was not when
I increased profits by 17%.

519
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,017
Or when I cut expenses

520
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,652
without losing
a single employee.

521
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,220
No, no, no, no, no.

522
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:59,457
It was a young Guatemalan guy.

523
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,193
First job in the country,
barely spoke English.

524
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,629
Came to me and said,

525
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,131
"Mr. Scott,

526
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:12,903
would you be the godfather
of my child?"

527
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:16,040
Wow. Wow.

528
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,808
Wow.

529
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,513
Didn't work out in the end.

530
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,215
We had to let him go.
He sucked.

531
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,289
Hey.

532
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,823
Hey.
Hi.

533
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:33,958
How are you?
Good.

534
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,327
I thought you were
going out for a drink with...

535
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,995
Oh, no, no.

536
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,364
Just going to, uh...

537
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,099
How's your headache?

538
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,434
It's better. Thanks. Good.

539
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,169
Good, that's great.

540
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,804
Is, uh...
Yeah?

541
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,440
Um, are you, uh...

542
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,608
Am I walking out?

543
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,842
Yes.

544
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,444
Yes.
Do you wanna?

545
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,246
Yeah.
Great.

546
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,048
Let me just...

547
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,116
- Oh, Roy.
- Yeah.

548
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,551
Listen, have a nice weekend.

549
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,853
Yeah, definitely.
You too.

550
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,622
Enjoy it.

550
00:22:05,305 --> 00:23:05,231

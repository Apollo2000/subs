1
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,874
You sure Mama won't notice
we're gone?

2
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:20,248
Better hope not.

3
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,874
Hello.

4
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,582
Ohh.

5
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:06,206
Oh.

6
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,248
Preaker.

7
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,206
Sure. Bye.

8
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,498
Mm-hmm?

9
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:06,956
- Am I in trouble?
- Always.

10
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,915
But you don't need me
to tell you that.

11
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:12,248
Wind Gap. What's it like?

12
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,206
Uh, OK, well...

13
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,373
it's at the bottom of
Missouri, boot heel.

14
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:21,081
Spittin' distance
from Tennessee.

15
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:23,373
I know where it is.
I asked what it's like.

16
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:26,707
Small. Population's held
at 2,000 for years.

17
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,749
Only real industry
is hog butchering,

18
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:31,457
so you got your old money
and your trash.

19
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,206
Which one are you?

20
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,290
Trash.
From old money.

21
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,582
What the hell's goin' on?

22
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,206
In Wind Gap, or...?

23
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,206
Your mom's still there.
Right, Preaker?

24
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,040
Mom. Yeah.

25
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:46,790
Step-dad.
They had a kid.

26
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,332
Have. I don't
really know her.

27
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:50,540
- But you talk to 'em?
- Not if I can help it.

28
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,290
Well, read the wires then.
Jesus Christ,

29
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:54,081
there was a murder there
last August.

30
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:57,956
- Little girl got strangled.
- I didn't know.

31
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,874
Then you also don't know
that another one's missing now.

32
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,457
Might be a serial.

33
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,332
So get your ass down to
that heel or whatever,

34
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:07,998
and get me a story.
Now. Today.

35
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,874
We have murders here, Curry,

36
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:11,582
so I don't see why
I gotta go to Wind Gap.

37
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,332
Because nobody else
is covering it.

38
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,081
Do you remember that piece
in the Tribune last year?

39
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,373
Guy who wrote about a killing
in his hometown?

40
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:20,415
It made an impact,
because it was personal.

41
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,165
People give a shit
when you give a shit.

42
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:24,290
I'm not gonna win a
Pulitzer off of Wind Gap.

43
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:26,415
You're not winning a Pulitzer 'cause
you're only half-good at writing.

44
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,040
This could change that.

45
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,290
And I'm your boss.

46
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:32,915
So good-bye.

47
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:43,998
All right, look, if you can't,
you can't, but it might be good.

48
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:48,040
You know, flush some things out,

49
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:49,790
get you back on your feet.

50
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:52,874
- And it's a good story.
- Yeah.

51
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,915
Could be a damn good story
if you do it right.

52
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:57,540
No pressure, right?

53
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:00,081
Life is pressure.

54
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:01,373
Grow up.

55
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:05,707
Get the hell out of here.

56
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,123
Come on!

57
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:34,665
Mm.

58
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:51,956
Oh...

59
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,998
<i>Hi, Betty.</i>

60
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,790
That was Natalie's
favorite color.

61
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:21,749
Oh.

62
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:24,665
Well, actually her folks
said it was black,

63
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,081
but that just seemed too grim.

64
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:28,915
So, her second favorite.

65
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:30,874
Well, little girls, first pink,

66
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:32,956
and then it's purple,
purple, purple.

67
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,874
My two looked like
grapes on legs

68
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:37,123
until they were eleven or so.

69
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:38,874
It's a terrible thing.

70
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:40,540
Practically the whole town

71
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,582
is out there
searching the woods.

72
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,582
Chief Vickery, he set it up.

73
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:46,582
You have children?

74
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:48,081
- No.
- Well, I hate to say it,

75
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:49,540
but right now that's a blessing.

76
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,081
I won't even let mine
out of the house

77
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,415
to get the mail, even.

78
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,874
- You can't imagine.
- Hmm.

79
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,665
My girls, every night
gettin' in bed with us.

80
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,956
My husband, usually
he wouldn't allow that,

81
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,665
but now, not one of us is
gettin' a good night's sleep,

82
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:04,415
but at least
we know they're safe.

83
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,206
Chief Vickery?

84
00:16:11,624 --> 00:16:13,582
Well, the thing is,

85
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:16,790
I have no intention of letting
this thing get out, so...

86
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,248
Yeah, I understand.

87
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:22,832
This isn't going to be
a... exploitative piece,

88
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,040
more like a think piece
on how something like this

89
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:27,498
can affect a town.

90
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,040
If it makes you feel better,
I'm from here.

91
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:37,165
Just up off Bluebird Circle.

92
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:38,790
What's your name?

93
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,665
Camille Preaker.

94
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,332
My mom is Adora Crellin.

95
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,040
She married out
of her maiden name

96
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:46,582
about 30 years ago
to, uh, Alan...

97
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,498
Crellin.
Sure, OK.

98
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:49,790
You're the...

99
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:53,582
- You moved away.
- Yeah.

100
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,290
So, Amma,
she's your half-sister.

101
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:00,956
Yeah.

102
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,290
Damn.

103
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,415
Jesus. Hot as hell in here,
isn't it?

104
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:13,332
- My kids give me that.
- Oh. Yeah, sorry.

105
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:16,498
No, it's all right.
Stress relief.

106
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:18,290
Because of this case?

107
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,998
Look, I just can't
have you here, Ms. Preaker.

108
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:25,582
This story gets out
in St. Louis,

109
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,624
suddenly that's all
Wind Gap's known for.

110
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,373
We're already
"the hog killers."

111
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,707
Some publicity could help,
get you some information...

112
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,457
It's worked in other cases.

113
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,457
I have a right to be here,

114
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,457
and I will let you do your job
if you let me do mine.

115
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,790
Fine.

116
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:51,998
I got no comment.

117
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,582
On Natalie Keene, fair enough.

118
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:58,248
But what about the other girl?

119
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,415
Ann Nash.

120
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,915
I can ask around and I can
get the local version,

121
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,206
or you can have a say
in what gets out.

122
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,624
First girl,
Ann, found last August,

123
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:14,290
strangled with a clothes line
and dumped in Falls Creek.

124
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:15,915
Some hunters found her.

125
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:18,248
That's all Vickery said?
No leads?

126
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:21,206
I don't think he has any.
It's just the way he was, um...

127
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,415
He was defensive.

128
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:24,081
Not like he was hiding
something,

129
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:26,248
more like he was pissed off
that he wasn't.

130
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:27,665
Theory.

131
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:29,624
Jesus, Curry, I just got here.

132
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:33,457
Well, you have the police.
Get me some local stuff.

133
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,956
I need facts and color.

134
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,165
Fine. I will write you
a fuckin' rainbow.

135
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:38,832
You know what I mean.

136
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:41,290
If you think this place
has some small town charm...

137
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:44,206
Well, give me
local "bleak" then, kiddo,

138
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,998
paint a goddamn picture.

139
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:50,123
I'm goin' out to join
the search party now.

140
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,998
Hopefully, we'll turn up
a dead little girl.

141
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,332
Go get 'em.

142
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,332
You lookin' for the search?

143
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,040
Yeah.

144
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:31,081
- That way.
- Thanks.

145
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:34,665
Are you, uh...

146
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:37,915
You're that reporter, right?
From St. Louis?

147
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,081
Well, that was fast.

148
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:43,498
Gotta hand it to Wind Gap,

149
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,081
you guys do gossip
like nobody else.

150
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,998
That's 'cause this place
is so totally dead.

151
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:52,582
"Dead."

152
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:55,749
That's awful.

153
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:59,081
Anyway, better get goin'
if you want to catch up.

154
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,123
Thanks.

155
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:23,332
Camille!

156
00:20:30,582 --> 00:20:32,415
Did you see something?

157
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,081
No.

158
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:39,665
You with the search?

159
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:41,707
In a way.

160
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,290
Detective Willis.

161
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:47,040
Ah. You're not from here,
huh?

162
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,248
No. You?

163
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,915
Used to be.

164
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:52,582
I'm up in St. Louis now.

165
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:53,832
I'm with the Chronicle.

166
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:57,206
A reporter.
Great.

167
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,081
Camille Preaker!

168
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:03,123
Jackie O'Neill.

169
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,915
Detective.

170
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,624
Oh, Lord.

171
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,832
I see you met our new detective.

172
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:19,498
I'd like to take him home
and turn him into pound cake.

173
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,582
Cover him in chocolate.
He's single, by the way.

174
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:23,832
Hey, settle down.

175
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,915
Aw... c'mere.

176
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:31,290
Look at you. Your mama didn't
say that you were in town.

177
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,040
'Course, she's not
talkin' to me right now.

178
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,498
I disappointed her again.

179
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:38,206
Probably forgot to send
her a card, or something.

180
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,915
- You know how that goes!
- I haven't seen her yet.

181
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,457
I'm gonna head over there
after this.

182
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,206
Aw, she's gonna be thrilled.

183
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,582
Baby girl, look at you.

184
00:21:48,998 --> 00:21:51,040
What about you, are you well?

185
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:53,998
You know, well as I can be.

186
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,290
Pretty grim around here.

187
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:59,290
I'm in charge of refreshments
for the guys.

188
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:01,498
It's the least I can do.

189
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:03,123
You want a sweet tea?

190
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:05,665
I got sweet tea with
a little bit of a kick in it.

191
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:07,998
No one should face all this
without a little kick.

192
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,123
Nah, I'm fine.
I'm on the job.

193
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,081
You still workin'
for that newspaper?

194
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,790
Yeah, that's why I'm here, actually.
I'm writing a story.

195
00:22:15,874 --> 00:22:17,248
Oh.

196
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:19,123
Yeah, those girls?

197
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:22,457
I see you when you
were the same age.

198
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,040
And it just makes me so sad.

199
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:27,540
I mean, so much has gone wrong.

200
00:22:27,624 --> 00:22:30,081
I just can't make sense
of it at all.

201
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,832
You mind if I quote you on that?

202
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:37,665
Yeah, I suppose so. If you think
anyone would be interested.

203
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:40,081
You are nothing if not
interesting, Jackie.

204
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,457
Oh. I'm glad you're home.

205
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,415
Hmm. We'll see.

206
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:51,665
Beauty, beauty, beauty.

207
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,165
Preacher.

208
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,832
My Lord,
Camille Preaker.

209
00:22:57,915 --> 00:23:00,248
It has been a long time, girl.

210
00:23:00,332 --> 00:23:01,624
Yeah, it has.

211
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,998
Mama said she saw a ghost once.

212
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:34,040
Mama says a lot of things.

213
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,290
You don't believe her?

214
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:39,582
I don't know.

215
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:43,248
I'm not scared of them ghosts.
Are you?

216
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,832
Well, it's stupid

217
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,956
to be scared of stuff
that's not real.

218
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,457
What if after you die,

219
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,832
part of you goes to heaven,
but part of you stays here?

220
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:53,998
Just to look after stuff,
you know?

221
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:56,707
See how things turn out.

222
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,665
For you, for Mom.

223
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,415
Stop that. That kind of
talk is for quitters.

224
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:02,540
Are you a quitter?

225
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:04,998
- No.
- Well, say it.

226
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:06,915
I'm not a quitter.

227
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:08,790
Why are you mad at me?

228
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:13,874
Camille?

229
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,123
Goodness.
Is something the matter?

230
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:25,165
No, Mama, not at all.

231
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,498
I'm just in town on business.

232
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:30,874
Business.
I didn't expect you.

233
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:33,915
My house is not up to par
for visitors,

234
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:35,290
I'm afraid.

235
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:36,582
Looks just fine.

236
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,498
Come on inside.
Goodness.

237
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:45,123
Can I get you
something to drink?

238
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:47,790
Alan and I are having
amaretto sours.

239
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:50,624
- I'll just have what you're having, thanks.
- We're in back.

240
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:53,290
It's nice and cool now
with the breeze.

241
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:56,123
Where are you stayin'?

242
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:58,998
Well, it's funny you should ask.

243
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:00,707
I was hoping that I could...

244
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,956
stay here for a few days.

245
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:13,206
I just wish you'd phoned.

246
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,582
I would have known,
had dinner ready.

247
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,665
Go say hello to Alan.

248
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:19,998
Alan?
Camille's here.

249
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,248
Who?

250
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,332
Camille.

251
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:29,165
- Hi.
- Hello there!

252
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,915
Adora didn't say
you were comin'.

253
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:36,498
She didn't know.
I'm sorry to, uh...

254
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:38,582
just drop in like this.

255
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:42,040
My editor sent me down
last minute, so...

256
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:44,582
Your editor.
Did he?

257
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:47,248
Yeah, I'm here about
Natalie Keene

258
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,749
and that other little girl,
Ann Nash.

259
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:50,998
To write a story?

260
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:54,206
Yes, Mama.
It's a newspaper.

261
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,081
Camille, I just don't understand

262
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,540
why a young woman like you

263
00:26:57,624 --> 00:26:59,749
would want to even dwell
on such things.

264
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:01,665
Well, it could be
an important story,

265
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:02,915
and being from here...

266
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,624
I knew those children.

267
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,874
And I'm having a very hard time,
as you can imagine.

268
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,874
And to... to write about it?

269
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:20,123
"Wind Gap Murders its Children." Is
that what you want people to think?

270
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:23,665
It can be really helpful to get
information out. People come forward...

271
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:26,123
I just can't have that
kind of talk around me.

272
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:27,915
Hurt children. Just...

273
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:30,248
don't tell me what you're
doing, what you know.

274
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:33,874
While you're here I'll just
pretend you're on summer break.

275
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:43,665
How's Amma?

276
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,081
Amma?

277
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:50,040
She's managing.

278
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:53,290
You know, the children
have a curfew now.

279
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:56,749
She's asleep already.
Why do you ask?

280
00:27:56,832 --> 00:27:58,123
Just being polite.

281
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:00,540
We do that in the big city
too, you know.

282
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:11,123
I'll go make sure
your room is in order.

283
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:12,915
Thanks.

284
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:20,998
Well...

285
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:22,582
this is my new toy.

286
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:29,081
Your old room
is the best for visitors.

287
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,498
It has that nice bath.

288
00:28:52,415 --> 00:28:54,332
Good night, Camille.

289
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:55,956
Good night, Mama.

290
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,665
Ohh.

291
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,040
See? It's a heart.

292
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,290
You're high.

293
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:54,790
What?

294
00:29:54,874 --> 00:29:57,665
It's something
kids at school say.

295
00:29:57,749 --> 00:30:00,540
It's like... you're crazy.

296
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:04,040
You're high.

297
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:06,457
No, you are.

298
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,290
It's a chicken.
Clearly a chicken.

299
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,790
Where?

300
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,123
See? There's its eyes, OK,

301
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:14,165
and there's its face, and...

302
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,832
M-Mama! Mama!

303
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:20,332
Mama!

304
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,081
Camille?

305
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,707
I heard you were back in town.

306
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,956
How about we catch up

307
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,457
over your finest
well whiskey, hmm?

308
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,206
Well whiskey? No.
Screw the well.

309
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,123
This...
is a homecoming drink...

310
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,165
and this homecoming drink...

311
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:44,373
is on me.

312
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:45,707
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

313
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,707
So, how about the place, huh?

314
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,040
It's mine now. Yeah, I
bought it from those guys.

315
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:51,582
They moved out to California.

316
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:53,582
We don't really get that type
around here anymore.

317
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:55,582
Whatever they call 'em now.

318
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,373
I mean, I got nothing
against 'em, but...

319
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,332
they would have tried to eat
that one down there alive.

320
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:02,915
Always recruitin'.

321
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:05,582
Still a smart-ass.

322
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,206
Still a dumb-ass.

323
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,707
Dumb-ass with the hottest
karaoke club in seven counties.

324
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,998
Shit, you oughta see this
place on Friday nights.

325
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:13,373
Tell me, what's your song?

326
00:32:15,582 --> 00:32:16,665
"Ring of Fire."

327
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:19,665
Oh, nice! "Bohemian Rhapsody."
I crush it.

328
00:32:21,332 --> 00:32:24,415
Gay bait down there seems a
little young to be drinkin'.

329
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:27,290
Yeah, yeah.
I'm cuttin' him some slack.

330
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:28,956
It's John Keene.

331
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,415
John Keene, Natalie's brother?

332
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:32,415
Yeah, yeah.
Poor son of a bitch.

333
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:35,123
He's takin' it really hard.

334
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:38,081
- Excuse me for a sec, OK?
- Yeah.

335
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,874
Ms. Preaker. At Sensors.

336
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:44,332
Yeah. Why,
is this your spot?

337
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:46,582
- Hmm?
- This what you do?

338
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,832
You come here and you drink

339
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:49,206
and you just, I don't know,

340
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,749
dream about the one
that got away?

341
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:55,956
Sarcasm. Thank you.

342
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,749
Most I get
from your hometown pals

343
00:32:57,832 --> 00:32:59,749
is a sugary passive-aggression.

344
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,956
Well, that is our specialty.

345
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,665
We just nod and smile

346
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,624
until the out-of-town asshole
leaves us alone.

347
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:08,290
Is that what I am?

348
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:10,123
Where are you from?

349
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:11,624
Kansas City,

350
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:14,081
by way of a lot of other places.

351
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:16,332
So, yes on the "out-of-town,"

352
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:18,624
and jury's still out
on "asshole."

353
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,582
How long you worked on the case?

354
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:26,248
Since the Keene girl.
Vickery called for backup.

355
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:27,956
I think he regrets it now.

356
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,123
He doesn't like my style.

357
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:33,040
Which is?

358
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:36,081
- Not his, I guess.
- Hmm.

359
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:38,832
At least I'm investigating.

360
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:40,582
You don't think he is?

361
00:33:42,248 --> 00:33:43,956
- Funny girl.
- Come on.

362
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,915
You know I'm gonna get the
story one way or another.

363
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:48,332
Wouldn't you rather be
in control of the conversation?

364
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:49,332
That's a good line.

365
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:50,373
Maybe, but it's true.

366
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:55,749
Well,
like you were about to go talk

367
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:57,540
to young Keene over there.

368
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:59,081
Oh, is that who that is?

369
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:00,874
Yeah, reporters aren't
supposed to talk to minors

370
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,165
without parental permission.

371
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,165
Jesus, I was just gonna
hit on him.

372
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:07,290
Well, that's different.

373
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,165
So, is he a suspect?

374
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,040
- You know I can't answer that.
- So he is.

375
00:34:13,123 --> 00:34:14,956
Everybody's a suspect right now.

376
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,248
So, that's it. You don't
have any leads? Nothin'?

377
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:19,790
Camille, can we just talk?

378
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:21,915
I'm starved for some
city folk conversation.

379
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:23,540
I'll ask you a question
about your life,

380
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:25,123
you can ask about mine...

381
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:27,790
Yeah. I don't
really do that... chat.

382
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:30,998
Got it. OK.

383
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,206
Well, Camille...

384
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,165
enjoy your evening.

385
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:37,582
Detective.

386
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,123
Shit.

387
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:52,040
<i>Come on.</i>

388
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:31,582
Shit. Fuck.

389
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,790
Camille?

390
00:37:33,874 --> 00:37:34,832
Mornin'.

391
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:42,790
I just, uh, left my bag
in the car, so I was...

392
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:45,624
Camille.

393
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,457
I'm happy you're here...

394
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:55,206
but, please, don't embarrass me.

395
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,415
Not again.

396
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:58,624
What?

397
00:37:58,707 --> 00:38:00,540
When you're here,
everything you do

398
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:03,081
comes back on me.

399
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:04,624
Understand?

400
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:07,832
Uh, honestly, no.

401
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:09,123
'Cause that might have been true

402
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,624
when I was a kid,

403
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,749
but I'm an adult now.

404
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,540
Not in Wind Gap.

405
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:17,498
When you're here,
you're my daughter.

406
00:38:17,582 --> 00:38:20,624
You can move away and forget,
but I can't.

407
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:22,665
You don't know
the people here anymore.

408
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:23,874
Yeah, believe me, I do.

409
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:26,915
I haven't heard
from you in months!

410
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:31,457
And you just show up

411
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,290
askin' such horrible,
morbid questions,

412
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:37,332
stirring everyone up.

413
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,332
Staying out all night.
Ohh!

414
00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:41,790
Look, Mama, please.

415
00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:43,290
Stop, Mama.
Look, stop.

416
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:45,415
- I'm sorry, OK?
- Ugh!

417
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:47,123
I'm sorry.

418
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:49,040
Honestly, it was nothin'.

419
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:50,373
I just... I went for a drive.

420
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:52,415
I was, uh, beat, so I...

421
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:55,040
I pulled over to be safe.

422
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:57,707
S... It was stupid, so...

423
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,749
You spent the night in the car?

424
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,373
Did anyone see you?

425
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,373
No. No one saw me.

426
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:09,415
Look, and about my story...

427
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:11,081
I shouldn't have said anything.

428
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:12,540
You know...

429
00:39:12,624 --> 00:39:13,832
You know I can't have

430
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:15,832
that kind of talk around here.

431
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:22,832
I just want you
to understand that I...

432
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:25,332
I didn't come back
to cause any problems.

433
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:26,790
That wasn't my intention.

434
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:38,582
Are you ready for some eggs?

435
00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:11,582
Thank you.

436
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:30,373
Bobby. Come on.

437
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:50,373
Sorry, Kool-Aid's
all I got left.

438
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:51,749
Oh, no, that's fine.
Thank you.

439
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:54,081
And thank you for
speaking with me.

440
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:56,498
Um, with all the
attention on Natalie,

441
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:57,956
I think it's, uh, important

442
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,998
to remind people that, uh...

443
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:02,415
Ann was first.

444
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:03,998
Yeah.

445
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:08,915
Um...

446
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:10,998
we should talk in the bedroom.

447
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:19,206
Thank you.

448
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:27,457
Uh, you mind if
I just set this...

449
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,123
Yeah.

450
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,540
Just, uh...

451
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,998
Ann, she'd been, uh...

452
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,498
riding her bike all last summer,

453
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:45,165
just ride around,
around the block.

454
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:47,165
My wife wouldn't
let her go no further

455
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:48,749
'cause we're protective parents,

456
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:50,290
like anybody.

457
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:51,707
Sure, you kept tabs on her.

458
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,332
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

459
00:41:53,415 --> 00:41:56,665
So, uh, just 'fore
school starts up,

460
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:59,665
she begs to ride over to
her friend Emily's house.

461
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:01,790
Not far...

462
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:02,832
but we usually wouldn't let her,

463
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:05,665
but, uh, she's whining.

464
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:08,415
So my wife finally gets
fed up and says, "Fine."

465
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:12,915
Ann never got there.

466
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,290
To Emily's.

467
00:42:15,373 --> 00:42:18,707
She left around seven,
must've been...

468
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,624
eight o'clock 'fore we realized.

469
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:21,998
I'm sorry.

470
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:27,540
Somewhere in those
ten blocks, they got her.

471
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:30,373
My wife...

472
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:33,540
could never forgive herself.

473
00:42:33,624 --> 00:42:36,290
I would love a chance
to speak with her?

474
00:42:36,373 --> 00:42:38,457
Uh, your wife.

475
00:42:42,665 --> 00:42:44,832
She's at the store.

476
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:47,540
I'll ask, but she's not...

477
00:42:47,624 --> 00:42:49,582
This thing...

478
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:51,915
She hasn't been the same.

479
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:55,123
Daddy?

480
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,749
I'm still hungry.
Can I make...

481
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:58,915
What do you do when that
door's closed, Amanda?

482
00:43:00,373 --> 00:43:02,332
- I knock?
- You knock.

483
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:08,332
Next time you forget,
it's goin' on your chart.

484
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:12,165
Go.

485
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:19,081
She knows better.

486
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:22,165
Thing about Ann, she was
plain, but she was smart.

487
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:25,415
She... did for herself.

488
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:28,749
Um, so were you here

489
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:30,915
when it happened?

490
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:32,874
When Ann left for Emily's?

491
00:43:32,956 --> 00:43:35,457
Mm-mm. I was driving back
from my office in Hayti.

492
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,206
It's about an hour away, and...

493
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,248
Don't write that down.
Why are you writing that down?

494
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:41,040
I'm sorry?

495
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:43,624
People 'round here don't like
us 'cause we keep to ourselves,

496
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:45,248
but that doesn't mean
I hurt my kid.

497
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:46,998
No, no, no, I wasn't
suggesting that, Mr. Nash.

498
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:50,498
I was just wondering if you had
a chance to see her that day.

499
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,790
In the mornin'.

500
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:58,998
But four kids,
it gets hectic. I...

501
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:03,040
I don't remember what we said.

502
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:07,081
- You know what I think?
- Hmm?

503
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:09,956
A faggot did it.
'Cause he didn't rape her.

504
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,749
And the cops say that's unusual.

505
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:13,206
I'd say it's the only blessin'
we got.

506
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,206
I'd rather him... kill her
than rape her.

507
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:23,332
That's her.

508
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:24,915
See?

509
00:44:29,956 --> 00:44:31,457
She was a willful thing.

510
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,332
Night before
that picture was took,

511
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:35,123
my wife wants to put
her hair in rollers,

512
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:36,415
and Ann wasn't having any of it,

513
00:44:36,498 --> 00:44:39,290
so she chops her hair off
instead.

514
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:49,040
She gave him hell.

515
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:52,457
She gave that guy hell.

516
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,081
So you got
a feeling about him.

517
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:55,540
His wife wasn't around.

518
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:57,165
It looks like she left.

519
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:58,707
He was kind of cagey about it.

520
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,832
Could be embarrassed. Private.

521
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:02,624
Yeah.

522
00:45:02,707 --> 00:45:04,415
He says that, uh...

523
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:06,457
people are pointing
the finger at him.

524
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,332
Do you think he's a suspect?

525
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,457
I don't know.
I mean, he's odd, for sure.

526
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,040
But, uh, I'll do some diggin'.

527
00:45:15,123 --> 00:45:18,040
Good good.
Follow it up.

528
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:21,956
Things at home,
they're all right?

529
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,874
Camille?

530
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:28,206
- At home?
- Yeah, with your family.

531
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,290
Yeah, I mean, they're peachy.
They're great.

532
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,165
OK, well......

533
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:37,165
you call me if you need me.

534
00:45:37,248 --> 00:45:38,373
I will.

535
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:40,248
Tell Eileen I said hello.

536
00:45:40,332 --> 00:45:41,332
Will do.

537
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:42,832
- All right.
- OK.

538
00:45:42,915 --> 00:45:44,998
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

539
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:50,123
She sends her best.

540
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,707
You'd better be right.

541
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,582
Just because you've seen
Dr. Phil

542
00:45:56,665 --> 00:45:58,332
- doesn't make you a real doctor.
- Ha.

543
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,832
Oh!

544
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:13,665
Hey!

545
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:18,540
You can't take that stuff.

546
00:46:18,624 --> 00:46:20,290
We knew
those girls.

547
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:22,457
Natalie was his sister.

548
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:25,332
John, right?

549
00:46:26,665 --> 00:46:29,248
Yeah. No, they didn't
mean anything by it.

550
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:31,956
We just wanted something to
remember them by, that's all.

551
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,665
What's the point of lettin' all
the flowers die and stuff, and...

552
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:39,290
It's not just the families,
ya know.

553
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:42,040
We're all sad.

554
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:54,040
Help! We need help!

555
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,081
"The wicked is thrust
down by his wrongdoing,

556
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:02,665
but the righteous
has a refuge when he dies..."

557
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:48,749
Thanks, man.
I got this.

558
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:28,956
Looks like you got your serial,
Detective. Congratulations.

559
00:48:30,457 --> 00:48:32,290
This fuckin' business.

560
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:36,624
The things you wish for,

561
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:39,707
and then...

562
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,415
and then it happens.

563
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:43,665
Yeah.

564
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:45,832
It's never real until it is.

565
00:48:48,624 --> 00:48:51,123
You should let me drive you home.
You're shaking.

566
00:48:51,206 --> 00:48:53,540
Not for long.

567
00:48:53,624 --> 00:48:56,665
- I'll give you a lift.
- No, no, I'm... I'm fine.

568
00:48:56,749 --> 00:48:59,582
I brought my car, and...

569
00:48:59,665 --> 00:49:00,582
I'm fine.

570
00:49:00,665 --> 00:49:02,332
You can get it in the morning.

571
00:49:02,415 --> 00:49:04,081
It's no trouble at all.

572
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:05,624
Is Bob Nash a suspect?

573
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:07,707
I was gonna ask Vickery before.

574
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,998
He won't tell you, like I won't.

575
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:13,415
And how about John Keene?

576
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:15,206
Jesus.

577
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,665
Why? Did you find something?

578
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,540
I'll show you mine.

579
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:26,707
Um, this isn't... I'm not gonna...

580
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:31,707
Let's table the games.

581
00:49:33,624 --> 00:49:35,498
At least until that little
girl's in the morgue.

582
00:49:56,707 --> 00:49:59,248
Where were you?
I was worried sick.

583
00:49:59,332 --> 00:50:02,081
I had to give the police
a statement.

584
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:04,874
I was there when they found her.

585
00:50:04,956 --> 00:50:07,457
Don't. That's enough.

586
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,123
You asked me where I was.

587
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,874
I suppose it was
foolish to hold out hope.

588
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:16,749
Um, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna lie down.

589
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:18,040
Bob Nash called.

590
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:19,624
He said you spoke to him.

591
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:21,540
That's not right, Camille,
not right at all.

592
00:50:21,624 --> 00:50:23,498
Aren't these families
in enough agony

593
00:50:23,582 --> 00:50:25,998
- without you hashing over it?
- Mama. Mama.

594
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:28,707
I can't... I can't talk
right now. OK? I need to sleep.

595
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,248
I don't think I'll sleep
for a million years.

596
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:33,832
It's just so awful.

597
00:50:33,915 --> 00:50:36,915
Ann and Natalie?
In our nothin' town?

598
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:39,040
It could happen to any of us.

599
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:40,290
Amma.

600
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:43,290
Yeah.

601
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,874
You've been around, though.
Why haven't you said hello?

602
00:50:51,956 --> 00:50:55,290
I can be shy, I guess.
I don't know.

603
00:50:57,206 --> 00:50:59,040
Well, I never
would have recognized you.

604
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:01,415
Adora stopped sending
those Christmas pictures

605
00:51:01,498 --> 00:51:02,956
a while back.

606
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,457
Amma, you are not
to leave this house alone.

607
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,749
Understand?
It's not safe.

608
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,540
I need to know
where you are at all times.

609
00:51:10,624 --> 00:51:12,373
But we already
have to be in by 9:00

610
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:14,206
It's not enough.

611
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,540
Let's not make rules
tonight, Adora.

612
00:51:16,624 --> 00:51:20,332
We'll all be more sensible
in the morning, I think.

613
00:51:20,415 --> 00:51:22,665
Come look at my dollhouse.

614
00:51:35,248 --> 00:51:36,998
Needs reupholstering now.

615
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:40,457
Mama changed her color
scheme from gold to gray.

616
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,582
You promised you'd take me
to the fabric store

617
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:51,540
so I could make
new coverings to match.

618
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:55,582
I know I did, sweet.
I've just been so distracted.

619
00:51:55,665 --> 00:51:58,956
Isn't it beautiful?

620
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,832
This dollhouse is my fancy.

621
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:06,457
Yeah, well, looks like you've
done a really nice job with it.

622
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,415
- I try. Thank you.
- Yeah.

623
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:11,665
I'm gonna
go get some rest.

624
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,749
I put your dinner
in the icebox for later.

625
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,332
- You have to eat.
- OK, thanks.

626
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,624
I'll go up with you.

627
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:23,206
I think I'll rest
a while too, Mama.

628
00:52:26,498 --> 00:52:28,373
Let's go rest.

629
00:52:33,707 --> 00:52:36,290
You knew it was me, didn't you?

630
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:38,290
When you saw me around town.

631
00:52:38,373 --> 00:52:40,415
Not at first.

632
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:42,624
Not for sure.

633
00:52:42,707 --> 00:52:44,956
Then I just, um...

634
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,874
It was interesting
seeing what you were like

635
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,206
before this, you know?

636
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,998
You're not mad, are you?

637
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,790
No. Just surprised,
I guess.

638
00:52:57,415 --> 00:53:00,290
Have you gone in
to Marian's room?

639
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:02,790
No.

640
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,998
It's like a museum.

641
00:53:07,081 --> 00:53:08,956
Mama keeps it that way.

642
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,206
Yeah.

643
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:14,040
I miss her sometimes.

644
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:15,832
Marian.

645
00:53:15,915 --> 00:53:17,915
Even though I didn't know her.

646
00:53:19,415 --> 00:53:22,582
Well, Adora talks about her
all the time.

647
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:24,415
Or at least alludes to her.

648
00:53:25,874 --> 00:53:28,206
Was she perfect?

649
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,373
She was, wasn't she?

650
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,498
No. She was close.

651
00:53:36,624 --> 00:53:38,248
But now we can be sisters.

652
00:53:41,457 --> 00:53:44,707
Everyone always says you were
the prettiest girl in Wind Gap.

653
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,749
- No, Amma.
- You are.

654
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:49,624
You're so pretty.

655
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:52,206
And you won't tell?

656
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,248
Mama would go bananas
if she, you know,

657
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:55,998
saw me in my civvies.

658
00:53:56,081 --> 00:53:58,206
Is that what you call 'em?

659
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,582
You know how she is.

660
00:54:00,665 --> 00:54:04,540
I'm just her little...
doll to dress up.

661
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:06,915
Easier to go along.

662
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:08,874
You never did, though.

663
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:11,832
Mama says you were incorrigible.

664
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,332
I bet she does.

665
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:15,998
I'm incorrigible, too.

666
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:19,540
Only she doesn't know it.

667
00:54:24,707 --> 00:54:26,874
We're alike.

668
00:54:26,956 --> 00:54:28,707
I knew we would be.

669
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:06,206
Camille!

670
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:42,582
I'm here
for the paper, that's all.

671
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:43,956
But I can tell...

672
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,123
You love dead girls.

673
01:01:52,081 --> 01:01:53,457
You were never sweet.

674
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:58,582
How dare you harass good people?
Go report somewhere else.

675
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:02,123
This is a crime about power...

676
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,790
for someone who feels powerless.

677
01:02:07,081 --> 01:02:08,248
What makes you say that?

678
01:02:09,457 --> 01:02:10,832
People are getting nervous.

679
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:13,332
You're hiding something.

680
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:16,956
My demons
are not remotely tackled.

681
01:02:21,582 --> 01:02:22,624
I just survive.

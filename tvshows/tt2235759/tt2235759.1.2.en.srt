00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,540
It's easy. You just lie back.

323
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,342
Expose some flesh,
be suggestive, but not explicit.

324
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,342
‐ Go on.
‐ Touch him casually about his person,

325
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,932
and be loose.

326
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,507
Maybe a breast falls from your blouse.

327
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,523
And then he will be on you.

328
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,272
‐ On me.

329
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,435
Okay.
‐ And then after he has done you,

330
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,477
profess love, union, stars in alignment,

331
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:06,192
fate, philosophy,
shed some tears of unhappiness,

332
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,403
and then talk knives in necks.

333
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,874
And eat an oyster. Helps your mood.

334
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,161
[mutters disgustedly]

335
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,828
[gulps]

336
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,302
[gags]

337
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,590
[gulps]

338
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,891
‐ [knocking at door]
‐ Enter.

339
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,718
Dear Orlo.

340
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,771
[panting]

341
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,475
Thank you for coming.

342
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,185
‐ It is my pleasure.

343
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,685
I have the Voltaire pamphlet.

344
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:48,108
‐ Giving me gifts, alone,
in a secluded cottage.

345
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,532
It is completely inappropriate, you know.

346
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,070
‐ Shit. Sorry.

347
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,333
Um, should, should we go to the, um,
uh, library or the, the garden?

348
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,867
‐ It is thrilling to break the rules,
is it not?

349
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:05,383
‐ [chuckles] I can't wait to confess
and see Archie's face.

350
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,417
‐ He put his fingers inside me.

351
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:13,182
‐ Oh. Okay, um, that's not good, is it?

352
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,097
‐ Sorry. [groans]

353
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,925
Let's not‐‐ I don't‐‐ [sighs]

354
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,681
That's not why we're here.

355
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,983
[groans]

356
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,019
You have caught my eye.
‐ Oh. Thank you. I am flattered.

357
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,320
Shall we read?

358
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,648
‐ Is that what you want to do?

359
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,451
‐ Are you okay? You, you seem...

360
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,079
...something.
‐ Do I?

361
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,735
ORLO:
Yes.

362
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,204
‐ Does it stir you?

363
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,038
‐ Um...
‐ Champagne?

364
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,290
‐ I, I, I don't drink.
I, I don't need anything.

365
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,593
‐ But is there anything you want?

366
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,088
ORLO: I'm fine.
‐ [sighs]

367
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,380
Come and get it.

368
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,425
‐ [gasps] Oh, my God.
You are trying to seduce me.

369
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,021
[gagging]

370
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,477
[groaning]

371
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,727
[vomiting]

372
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,769
‐ Oh.
‐ [groans]

373
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,650
ORLO: You had the oysters.
‐ [Catherine gags]

374
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,491
I'm, I'm always reluctant.
They travel them some distance.

375
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,738
[Catherine spits, moans]

376
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,080
CATHERINE:
I'm a failure.

377
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,745
‐ No. No, you're not.
I, I, I would, of course, have sex.

378
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,458
[Catherine groans]

379
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,166
Um, I'm not‐‐
Yes, uh, should we read first?

380
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,877
I'm not used to, um...

381
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,507
I feel a bit breathless, actually.
Might sit.

382
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,715
‐ I actually feel very unwell.

383
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:37,845
‐ Empress, I am not
well‐versed with women.

384
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,175
Um...

385
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,429
I have in some way ruined things.
I apologize. Sorry.

386
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,188
[door opens, closes]

387
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,444
‐ [panting] Orlo! Don't go!

388
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,976
I will say it plain.

389
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,993
I was hoping you'd be mad
with desire for me,

390
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,945
and then you'd help me
inspire an army to kill Peter.

391
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,315
‐ What?

392
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,451
‐ You wouldn't, would you?
Kill him with me?

393
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,909
A coup?
‐ Don't say anything else.

394
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,247
[whispering] Fuck, fuck, fuck.

395
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,749
‐ [whispering] Oh, Fuck, fuck...
[shrieks] fuck!

396
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,091
[panting]

397
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,594
‐ [inhales] I failed.

398
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,683
[exhales] I was not good at seducing,

399
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,468
and he was not good at understanding
that he was being seduced.

400
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,432
And then when I just asked him
straight out if he would kill Peter,

401
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,854
he said, "fuck" and ran away.

402
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,272
‐ When you what?
‐ I do not wish to apportion blame,

403
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,981
but I believe your seduction plan
was ill‐advised.

404
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,942
‐ You told him of the coup?

405
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:37,452
‐ I did.
That also may have been ill‐advised.

406
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,116
‐ Shit. It is bad.

407
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,655
‐ I'm sure he will not tell him.

408
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,908
He is good at heart.

409
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,080
‐ He has survived at court ten years.

410
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,038
It takes dark skills.

411
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,786
Loyalty is rewarded here.
He could tell Peter.

412
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,050
‐ Then I must win him over before he does.

413
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,006
I will go to him and try again.
‐ [knocking on door]

414
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,587
VLAD: The emperor requests
the empress's presence.

415
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,230
‐ How is the emperor's mood this morning?

416
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,153
‐ Ah. Here you are. [chuckles]

417
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,494
Taste this bacon.
They are fed only on acorns and honey.

418
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,991
It is amazing.

419
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,874
‐ Mm. Yes. Delicious.

420
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,544
‐ We concur. We agree.

421
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,053
We share a love of bacon.
Huzzah. [chuckles]

422
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,301
Sit.

423
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,809
As requested.

424
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,891
[Peter sighs]

425
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,226
You probably don't remember this,

426
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,692
but a week or two ago,
I shot your bear and punched you.

427
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,278
Perhaps it has cast a pall between us.

428
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,570
‐ The fact you shot my bear
and punched me?

429
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:07,454
‐ Yes. I think I was angry
because no one has ever not liked me.

430
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,912
‐ Or at least, they're pretending to.

431
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,752
‐ Hmm. Toosh.

432
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,828
‐ What?
‐ [loudly] Toosh.

433
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,594
‐ Do you mean touché?

434
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:18,256
‐ What, is it not toosh?
‐ No. Touché.

435
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,665
‐ See. That's great. How smart you are.

436
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,344
Point is, it's a new day,
a time to put things behind us.

437
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,603
Teething problems, I believe they call it.

438
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:27,256
‐ Are you apologizing to me?

439
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,734
‐ I'm looking forward, not dwelling.

440
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,475
It is hell to dwell.

441
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,270
It is a saying I just made up.

442
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,322
‐ So you wish to forget it?

443
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:40,436
Regret it and forget it. Another saying.

444
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,356
‐ Look, here's what I think's happened.

445
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:46,283
You've come in here
with a very romantic notion of me,

446
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,663
and marriage, and your life.

447
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,829
A little naive, I guess. Not a criticism.

448
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,658
It's actually a lovely attribute.

449
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:55,583
You met me, and I'm not a romantic man,
more a practical chap.

450
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:58,754
And I like to have fun,
larks and jokes and weird sex.

451
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:02,424
Point is, we're married,
but we don't do it for each other.

452
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,222
‐ We finally agree.

453
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:09,219
‐ Huzzah. Yes, accepting that truth
might be liberating for us.

454
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:12,353
You're really a drag around court.
I want you to find happiness here.

455
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:13,941
Hence, strawberries.

456
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,266
Also, a new bear,
to replace the one I shot.

457
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,111
Live as empress and enjoy it.

458
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,147
We should also find you a lover.
‐ I should take a lover?

459
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,532
PETER:
Yes, we should reach an agreement,

460
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,109
because what's the alternative?

461
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,533
You remain unhappy, I become
more and more angry, and then I kill you.

462
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:31,124
I don't want to kill you.
You're not a bad person.

463
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,497
‐ I could kill you.
You are a bad person.

464
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,290
[snorts, chuckles]

465
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:43,014
‐ See? I like you. You're funny,
in a droll, despairing sort of way.

466
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,586
I couldn't take a lot of it,
but occasionally, it's refreshing.

467
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:47,795
Now, would it be so bad?

468
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,303
We have enough in common to get on.

469
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,474
‐ We do? Like what?

470
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,733
‐ Well, we're both...

471
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,055
pretty.

472
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,596
[Peter chuckles]

473
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,074
Now, I never imagined myself
as the guy who punches his wife.

474
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,726
‐ And yet you are.

475
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,404
Is that your mother's necklace?

476
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,993
‐ Yes.

477
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,528
I wear it sometimes to feel close.

478
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:09,832
‐ Did your father punch her?

479
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:12,115
‐ I have said regrets and new day things.

480
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,329
You must cheer up
and look forward to the future.

481
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,669
‐ I do, very much
look forward to the future.

482
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,036
PETER:
Oh. That's great.

483
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,763
‐ For I gather,
you will not punch me again.

484
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,585
‐ I won't.

485
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,381
We are agreed?
‐ Oh.

486
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,224
That one is rancid.

487
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,180
As is your whole idea.

488
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,595
[door opens]

489
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,858
[clatters]

490
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,605
[groans]

491
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,819
[Archbishop growling]

492
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,488
[both grunting]

493
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,530
[roars]

494
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,198
‐ You're still strong.

495
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,331
‐ We all are if we know where to find it.

496
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,963
‐ Oh, your heart is pounding.

497
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,170
‐ I've been fighting.

498
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,170
‐ Your joy in pain is disturbing.

499
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,512
‐ We must all know our darkness,

500
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:10,718
for how else do we know
where to shine the light?

501
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,639
‐ So profound, cousin.

502
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,268
‐ Occupational hazard.
It's like a reflex now.

503
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,845
You want some breakfast?

504
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,640
‐ Oh, God, yes.

505
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:21,024
The shit I get served downstairs.

506
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,570
Um, I have a concern
I wish your help with.

507
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,527
‐ Anything.

508
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:28,988
‐ The empress.

509
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,367
I'm worried something she said to Orlo
could be taken the wrong way.

510
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,486
‐ What did she say?

511
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:38,253
‐ She expressed some unhappiness
with the emperor.

512
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:42,127
Orlo may exaggerate the situation
to enlarge himself at court.

513
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:46,629
Be to your detriment if he did,
as you're the author of her presence.

514
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,090
‐ I had a vision from God.
I do not resile from it.

515
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,592
‐ In Catherine's defense,
perhaps Orlo tried to rape her.

516
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,137
‐ To rape her?

517
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:04,273
‐ He is a man who famously lacks
the skills to see his desires met.

518
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,533
Fuck a man up. Don't you agree?

519
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:10,651
If you need a defense, that could be one,
that's all I'm saying.

520
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,156
‐ I will deal with it.

521
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,907
‐ Thank you.

522
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,369
‐ Aah!

523
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,578
‐ My gift.

524
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:26,417
‐ Orlo!

525
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,929
ORLO: No, please.
Please do not speak to me. I beg you.

526
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,390
CATHERINE:
Help me with the coup.

527
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,230
‐ Oh, my God, you cannot say that word.
‐ Why? It's just a word.

528
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,607
But it does excite the mind, does it not?

529
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,475
Here's my plan.

530
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,533
You and I will create a philosophy
and plan for my regime,

531
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,489
one that will inspire others to act

532
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,660
and be a blueprint for my reign.

533
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,789
‐ Your‐‐
‐ My reign.

534
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,826
When we create a strong, vibrant Russia,

535
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:08,802
alive with ideas, humane and progressive,

536
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:12,505
and here people live
with dignity and purpose.

537
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,011
‐ In Russia?
‐ Indeed.

538
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,050
Huzzah.

539
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,604
‐ Do you want to die?

540
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:21,677
‐ I am indifferent.
I certainly do not want to live like this.

541
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,693
‐ You'll get used to it,
and I know it looks bad,

542
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,556
but we make progress.

543
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,983
At the moment, we have an issue
over the free will of beard‐wearing.

544
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,743
I feel if‐‐
‐ Beards?

545
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,355
No. I have no time to waste
and neither do the people.

546
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,820
Are you in?

547
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,448
‐ I cannot join for the simple reason

548
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,751
you have already proved yourself
incapable of executing it successfully.

549
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,456
‐ How?
‐ You chose me.

550
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,336
‐ You are‐‐
‐ A civil servant.

551
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,923
A coward.
‐ I don't believe you.

552
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,631
You are not a coward.

553
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,389
I know you different.

554
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:02,564
When we talk of ideas and humanity,

555
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,098
I see a light ablaze in you.

556
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,809
‐ You don't know me at all.

557
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,568
You married badly.
I'm, I'm sorry you made a mistake.

558
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:15,238
Don't drag me and Russia into it.

559
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:18,867
‐ Russia and I are married
to the same man. It is the same thing.

560
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:22,406
‐ You are an angry, mad person,
so you will forgive me if I say no.

561
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:25,211
And you must promise me
never to speak of this to anyone else.

562
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,745
I beg you, for your own sake.

563
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:31,464
‐ And will you speak of it?

564
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,171
Or will you take it to Peter?

565
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:37,132
‐ It is something I am forgetting
as I walk away from you. Good day.

‐ [gunshot echoes]
‐ [groans]

568
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:54,573
‐ As we hunt, we shall discuss
whether or not to kill the empress.

569
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,528
‐ What? Sir, no, no.
She is a, a radiant presence.

570
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,779
She is shimmering, a godsend.

571
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,781
‐ She is a misery at court,
made fun of the ladies' wig hats,

572
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:06,004
and is a strange creature who I sense is,
at times, laughing at me.

573
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,206
I was thinking a small carriage accident,

574
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:11,287
a suitable period of mourning,
and onward to a new choice.

575
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,593
Archie, you will not be involved,

576
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,876
as you were abysmally fucking wrong,
and tell that to God.

577
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,380
‐ Emperor, she's going through
some transition.

578
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:18,972
We should help her with compassionate‐‐

579
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,427
‐ Shut the fuck up. Orlo, thoughts.

580
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,718
‐ I think not, sir.

581
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,311
It would look bad in Europe
and be whispered at court.

582
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:28,307
‐ No one at court likes her,
except apparently you disloyal fucks.

583
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,980
Go, all of you. George and Grigor stay.

584
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,609
[gunshot echoes]

585
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,235
Mother lit up
when Father walked into a room.

586
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,445
I could kill her and start again.
Why is no one excited by this idea?

587
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,486
GRIGOR:
Orlo's right.

588
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:43,909
It would look like a failure in court,
and in Europe...

589
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,909
[whispering] that you could not keep
your woman happy.

590
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,581
‐ He is the emperor.

591
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,919
You, of course, may kill her if you wish.
She will be forgotten about in weeks.

592
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,916
‐ Finally, some loyalty.

593
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:55,668
[Peter sighs]

594
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:02,261
Between us, I thought her and I
might be as you two,

595
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,641
a perfect union.

596
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:04,887
GRIGOR: [clears throat]
Perhaps she could be.

597
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,468
Why give up now?

598
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:10,603
She may be all you need,
as George is to me.

599
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,982
‐ I suspect I will always need more,

600
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,360
as I am a person who always needs more.

601
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,937
‐ It seems to me, all you really want is
for her to be more cheerful in court

602
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,494
and to bear you an heir,
that is all you want from a wife.

603
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,698
‐ Yes. Yes, and she does not provide it.

604
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,290
[sighs] Grigor,

605
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:28,785
you never told me how tricky
this marriage business is.

606
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,920
‐ Until one is in it, one cannot imagine.

607
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,166
PETER:
Hmm.

608
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,671
ARCHBISHOP:
I sometimes feel that

609
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,670
due to our political differences,

610
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:42,682
I perhaps do not offer you
the spiritual counsel that you need.

611
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,336
This is my flaw.

612
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:47,104
‐ I am fine for counsel, but thank you.

613
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,427
And if you're seeking flaws,
I could also make a list of yours

614
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,564
if it would aid you.
‐ How kind.

615
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,572
I see you occasionally huddled
with the empress

616
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,605
and wonder if you're trying
to butt‐fuck her.

617
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,189
‐ [gasps]
‐ Hmm.

618
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:03,244
As flustered as a freshly
raped novice, Orlo.

619
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,238
‐ No, I am not.

620
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,290
She is my friend in literature,
that is all.

621
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:12,035
‐ Let us go back and ask the emperor,
see what he makes of it.

622
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,119
He seems in a forgiving mood.

623
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:17,674
‐ And perhaps remind him
your vision brought her here.

624
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:20,839
‐ God is right in all things.

625
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,839
[distant gunshot echoes]

626
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,799
But she is upsetting him,

627
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:28,262
when I hoped being married
would settle him.

628
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,141
You and I are men of power,
and I'm sure would like to remain so.

629
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:35,483
We have that much in common.

630
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,519
Do not take advantage of her unhappiness.

631
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:39,944
‐ I am not.

632
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:43,646
‐ You must offer her counsel,

633
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,874
lead her to a safe path, for all of us.

634
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:50,575
‐ So I believe you ask a favor?
‐ Hmm.

635
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,001
I've always said you're the smartest man

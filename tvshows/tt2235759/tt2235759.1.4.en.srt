is as strong as your bond with God,
is it not?

643
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,601
‐ He just said, "Fuck you,"
if you did not get that, Orlo.

644
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,345
‐ I did, sir.
‐ Great. So, my idea.

645
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:42,228
Do your vision. Ask God who I should pick.

646
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,476
‐ What? No. No.
‐ No?

647
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,358
What the fuck are you talking for?

648
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,855
I will pull out your tongue and eat it
with a nice salsa verde if it moves again.

649
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,778
‐ It does not really work like that.

650
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:55,988
God‐‐
‐ Tell him I'm fucking asking.

651
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,279
I am ordained by God,

652
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,992
so he needs to play handball
with me on this

653
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,502
if he doesn't want it all fucked up
by a wrong choice.

654
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:07,245
‐ Of course. I will see if I can
create the conditions for a vision.

655
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:09,841
‐ Fuck me.
‐ Did you just speak?

656
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:26,727
‐ C... D...

00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:29,108

[Orlo groans]

659
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,992
ORLO: He has sent Archie...
‐ G...

660
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:36,945
to commune with God.
[sighs]

661
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:39,697
God will show Archie a sign,

662
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,250
and he will pick the patriarch
and inform Peter.

663
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,705
He fucking has whoever he wants.

664
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,496
Lying, disingenuous prick.
‐ Ow!

665
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,340
‐ Marial!

666
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:53,755
‐ He is a good man,
and a holy man in his heart.

667
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:56,175
‐ He is your friend and cousin.
You are biased.

668
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:58,255
He is a political animal,

669
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,640
always protecting the power
and wealth of the church.

670
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,927
‐ He is a bishop,
that is what you would call his job.

671
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:07,602
As it is your job to be an annoying,
un‐fucked insect.

672
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:09,483
‐ Marial, take a breath.

673
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:14,738
Orlo, if he is a political animal,

674
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,815
he can be reasoned with.

675
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,700
He does at least speak to women,

676
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,407
so he has one up on our man, anyway.

677
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,578
You have done deals in the past.

678
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,083
‐ Yes.

679
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,749
‐ So, push him toward our man.

680
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:29,709
‐ I could talk to him.

681
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,338
ORLO: And he'll wonder why a woman
cares about the patriarch

682
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,666
and tip our hand.

683
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:37,051
[sighs]
It is my job.

684
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:39,379
‐ The patriarch affects the women, too.

685
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:41,847
Just ask my nanny,

686
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,255
who got pregnant out of wedlock,

687
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,684
and they fucking killed her
in her village

688
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,443
at the priest's behest!

[doors slam]

690
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,605
Orlo is wrong.

691
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,450
Archie is a good man.

692
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,322
‐ I never got over the fingering,
to be honest.

693
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,743
‐ He had to do that.

694
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:05,911
It is his role and duty.

695
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,673
When my mother died,

696
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:12,705
and my father clutched a bottle
and a whore to his breast

697
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,169
instead of his young children,

698
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,090
he took care of me,
and my sister, every day.

699
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:24,472
He has a hard head for politics,
but trust me, a good heart.

700
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,971
Leaving the bony fingers aside.

701
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:28,684
[chuckles]

702
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,361
‐ Archie.

703
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,858
‐ Orlo.

704
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:42,702
‐ Can we talk about who the patriarch
should be?

705
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:47,697
‐ Always with the politics, Orlo.
What a small world you live in.

706
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:51,713
‐ Everything is politics, Archie.
That just means your price is high.

707
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,037
You are going to have a vision,

708
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,502
and lo and behold, it will be Kerlov.

709
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:59,383
‐ I feel sorry for you
that you think that.

710
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:01,091
That's the problem with your philosophy.

711
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,011
You aggrandize the individual,

712
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,800
think we're not part of something bigger.

713
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:08,017
It's a barren wasteland of aloneness

714
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,555
that you try to push us towards.

715
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,269

His love enfolds us.

‐ And right now your bullshit
enfolds me.

718
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:22,239
‐ Any warmth I can bring, my friend.

719
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,197
‐ Let us work out
who suits us both best.

720
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,699
All I ask.

721
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,160
‐ I'm God's servant, not yours.

722
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,041
No politics.

723
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,828
He directs me.

724
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,041
‐ Tarcinkus is a good man,

00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,962
all I wanted to say,

726
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,920
a man we can both work with.

727
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:42,052
He has no real opinions.

Hello.

00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:07,994
‐ The women.

‐ Ah, yes.

737
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:11,908
I heard a tea dance got out of hand.

‐ They hate me.

739
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:22,921
‐ Well, you did stripe Svenska
most marvelously.

740
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:25,183
But her surface is what matters to her,

741
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:26,965
and you scratched it hard.

742
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,430
‐ I want them to like me.

743
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,480
‐ Why? They are dreary.

744
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:36,475
All you need to do
is be respected by them

745
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:38,608
and show responsibility for them.

746
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,645
‐ Show responsibility?

747
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:43,189
‐ You are the only voice the women have.

748
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,565
‐ But I do not have a voice.
‐ You must grow one.

749
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:49,832
As you will grow an heir
in your bright, shiny womb.

750
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,285
Oh, wait.

751

CATHERINE:
What are these?

752
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:00,749
‐ Inspiration

753
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,502
and education.

754
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:04,674
‐ Is it physically possible?

755
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:06,263
‐ I thought not,

756
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:08,428
but as long as you have
someone to brace you,

757
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:09,967
that one is excellent.

758
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:12,929
Though painful for a few days after.

759
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,349
You're intrigued.

760

‐ They fire something in me.

761
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,652
‐ Hmm.

762
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:24,398
Which brings me to this horse story.

763
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:29,067
‐ I wanted to, but the horse said no,
and neigh means neigh.

‐ You are a delight.

766
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:36,906
We are all animals, so I would not
judge it harshly if you had.

767
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:39,754
I once saw a deer so beautiful,

768
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,170
I leant against a tree
with my dress raised,

hoping it would mount me.

You may have to slap Marial down.

773
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,557
‐ That's what she said.

774
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,637
‐ Wise girl.

775
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,852
You cannot choose a servant
over a lady. It will not do.

776
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,233
‐ I will not.

‐ Just like that. See?

00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,704
It is not easy being empress,

781
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,079
but you can do it.
[Catherine sighs]

Now, I have these sticks from Asia.

783

They are to enhance your fertility,

784
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:22,131
but I cannot work out
whether we wave them over your womb

785
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,835
or insert them into you.

786
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:27,457
‐ I'm pretty sure it's
a "wave them" situation.

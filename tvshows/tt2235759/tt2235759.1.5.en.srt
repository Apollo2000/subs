00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,443
‐ You criticize Orlo for inaction,

827
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,110
but you are just the same.

828
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:35,436
‐ I can't.

[sighs]

830
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:39,912
‐ I'll do it, then.

831
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,461
‐ No!

VELEMENTOV:
The Empress is missing.

836
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,465
ORLO: You got here quick, is my point.

837
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:04,011
[Marial grunting]
VELEMENTOV: Yes, you keep saying that.

838
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,934
I don't know what‐‐
[Marial yells]

839
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:08,849
‐ Hello.

840
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:11,062
We are just‐‐
MARIAL: Upset, and hysterical.

841
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,903
As women often are.

842
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,070
‐ Guards and clergy are
looking for Ivan, Archie.

843
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,660
Do you know anything about that?

844
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,985
‐ I am loyal to the Emperor,
and when he dies,

845
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,280
I'm to be loyal to what is best
for the country,

846
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:25,834
and the Russian people.

847
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:27,617
‐ Is Ivan in the palace?

848
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:28,581
Do we know that?

849
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,500
‐ Are you both behind the Empress?

850
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:32,669
‐ We must do what is best for Russia.

851
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:34,418
If Ivan is that,

852
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:35,629
so be it.

853
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:37,919
‐ I fear that is a dead end, Archie.

854
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,636
Take him and display him
in the Great Hall.

855
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:50,692
Just so those who would rally behind him

856
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:53,396
realize the futility
of their little quest.

857
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:59,904
‐ Obviously, my preference was always you,
Empress.

858
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:03,025
‐ Goes without saying, um...

859
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:05,414
‐ I...

860
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:09,156
You killed that boy.

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,660
‐ I have that. The good of Russia.

162
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,999
‐ No. It's too intellectual. Something...

163
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,536
Something visceral.

164
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,302
‐ I have it.

165
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,351
[grunts]

166
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,143
[hacking]

167
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,734
[grunts]

168
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,902
[stabs]
[yells]

169
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,946
[exhales]
[Velementov grunts]

170
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,815
[Catherine pants]
‐ All right.

171
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,703
I still suggest doing it in his sleep.

172
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,753
‐ I must do things my way.

173
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,287
‐ I'm gathering that.

174
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,762
‐ So, menu is done. Orchestra.

175
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,966
Should we have a choir? You weren't sure.

176
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,257
And they've caught 19 ducks,
but they're struggling to find one more.

177
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,972
‐ There's something nice
about an odd number.

178
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,642
‐ Ah. Look.

179
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,020
Oh, fuck me. Watch this.

180
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,557
[mockingly]
Oh, Empress. Here is a peach.

181
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,942
Yes, I have really thought this through.

182
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,358
[Grigor and Peter laughing]
‐ [mockingly] Oh, my darling Leo.

183
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,317
I'm completely
cock‐nitized by your sonnets

184
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,778
and fruit and love of trees.
Hum me an opera.

185
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,949
Hum me an opera immediately.
[mocking laughter]

186
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,988
‐ A peach! Of course.

187
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,870
I think I recall how to eat it.
‐ This one's different.

188
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,792
You break this one in half.

189
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,378
‐ Okay, so maybe she likes peaches.

190
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,088
Or is kindly amused by his idiocy.

191
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,675
GEORGINA:
Oh, I think it's got a ring in it.

192
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,835
‐ Oh, that's cute.

193
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,434
‐ Tricky fucker, Leo.

194
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,140
LEO:
It is inscribed.

195
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,560
‐ "To Catherine the Great.

196
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,479
Ruler of Russia."

197
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,807
‐ Sorry the writing's so tiny.
Was a lot to get on it.

198
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,773
They spelled Russia wrong,
which is annoying.

199
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,863
‐ I am touched.
‐ You're extraordinary.

200
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,571
‐ As are you.
‐ No, I'm not.

201
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,111
It's okay.

202
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,454
'Cause I get to watch you
and come along for the ride.

203
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,830
[chuckles]

204
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,913
GEORGINA: Oh!
‐ Fuck.

205
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,963
Annoying. All right,
we have to do something about that.

206
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,170
‐ Marial. There you are.

207
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,960
[inhales] I have news.

208
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,763
I'm going to kill Peter today.

209
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,087
‐ Oh. What?

210
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,142
‐ Also, I'm pregnant.

211
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,216
‐ Shit. That is a lot.

212
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,562
‐ I thought so, too.

213
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,266
‐ Sorry to be late. Uh, happy birthday.

214
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,897
Velementov says you are to kill him.

215
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,555
‐ I just feel it in my gut.

216
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,153
‐ Rational. But it is‐‐ It is better
we secure the palace,

217
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,440
arrest him, get him to sign an abdication,

218
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,204
send him to house arrest,
and burn the house down a month later.

219
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,867
His supporters will be less likely
to rise up in anger.

220
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,946
‐ I like Orlo's plan.

221
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,581
‐ As it makes me safe. Of course you do.

222
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,624
But no one else is safe.

223
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,500
This is Russia.

224
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,335
A leader must show the people
they have ice in their veins.

225
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,337
And fire in their heart.

226
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,465
Velementov will organize the military
so they are ready to take his guards,

227
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,009
or anyone else who wishes to fight.

228
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,433
Leo, be amongst the court.

229
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,852
Sow the seed.

230
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,811
And when the time comes,

231
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,401
you will bring them all to the Great Hall,

232
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,067
and I will address them.

233
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,475
‐ And Archie?
‐ Orlo, you go to him.

234
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,074
Keep him distracted.
Detained until it's done.

235
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,990
Might I suggest a long confession?

236
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,949
‐ Uh, not me?
Makes more sense I would go.

237
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,490
‐ I need you with me.

238
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,333
And you will collect my dress,
and dress me.

239
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,288
This is it, my friends.

240
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,802
‐ Happy birthday, Empress.
‐ Our best wishes.

241
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,851
So young. So beautiful.

242
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,755
‐ But what you said the other night,
after the torture,

243
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,774
were the words of a person
of old wisdom, and charity.

244
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,977
‐ You have had our respect, of course.

245
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,728
But you have our love now.

246
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,730
‐ And I would honestly love to know
how you fucked that horse.

247
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,402
‐ I didn't fuck a horse.

248
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,163
‐ I made it up, Tatyana. You were there.

249
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,155
‐ Really?

250
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,616
‐ I have a busy day improving Russia.

251
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,997
I hope this to be a memorable day
for all of us.

252
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,575
Orlo, you need to kill Archie.

253
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,174
‐ I know.

254
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,669
‐ You were going to do it, anyway.
‐ I was.

255
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,835
‐ Despite my orders?

256
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,840
‐ I wish to win.

257
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,349
And now they're your orders, so...

258
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,387
good for us.

259
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,234
We'll win.

260
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,185
It is fate.

261
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,944
‐ Indeed.

262
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,278
[wings fluttering]

263
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,414
‐ Happy birthday.

264
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,329
Look. They're spelling out
"Catherine."

265
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,459
Well, sort of. Although, that's a "P."

266
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,877
Oh, they had it before, I promise.

267
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,840
‐ It's marvelous. [laughs]
Thank you.

268
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,468
‐ Let's piss on some wheat.

269
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,183
‐ I just went.
‐ I'll get you water.

270
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,220
It could be an auspicious day.

271
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,142
I got pregnant on my birthday,

272
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,730
and I thought, perhaps today
will be the same for you.

273
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,226
‐ Hmm.

274
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,234
I... [exhales]

275
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,147
No luck.
‐ Another glass.

276
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,660
‐ Right.

277
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,455
Can we speak of something
we have never talked on?

278
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,962
‐ I'd like to think we can
tell each other anything.

279
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,381
‐ I do, too.

280
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,835
‐ Ivan.
Was it hard to kill him?

281
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,256
‐ Oh.

282
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,467
Well, he wriggled a lot, so‐‐
‐ I mean inside you.

283
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,972
In your heart.

284
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,150
‐ I lost a child.

285
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,979
My darling Igor.

286
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:22,196
So I just kept telling myself
"You're sending Ivan to Igor.

287
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,406
And now they will each have a friend."

288
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,617
Anything?

289
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,791
I'm worried about Rostov.

290
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,078
There is more to it.

291
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,079
‐ I'm sure it is fine.
‐ Why?

292
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,752
‐ What?
‐ Why are you sure?

293
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,924
You were sure before Rostov
that nothing was happening,

294
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,553
and now you're sure again.

295
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,639
‐ I am too much an optimist, perhaps.

296
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,017
[grunts] Still nothing.

297
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,805
I must get ready for my party lunch.

298
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,850
‐ Ah, well. Later.

299
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,944
Try and let me know.
I have my fingers crossed.

300
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,493
Come!
[snapping]

301
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,201
[footsteps departing]

302
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,486
‐ I will always care for you.

303
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,044
You should know that.

304
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,035
‐ Oh. How sweet.

305
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,375
[sighs]

306
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,799
Why did you ask me that?

307
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,425
About Ivan.
‐ I... just never had.

308
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,099
‐ Are you lying to me?

309
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,647
‐ No.

310
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,317
[groaning]
[urinating]

311
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,366
[sighing]

312
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,963
[urinating]

313
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,035
‐ Oh, my God.

314
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,130
You're the beaver's nose.

315
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,167
‐ What?
‐ You're coming for Peter.

316
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,468
‐ I... what?

317
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,596
No! What? [laughs]

318
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,604
You are a card.

319
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,730
‐ Your heart and brain I never doubted,

320
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,557
but your stomach for the fight, I did.

321
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,812
Clearly, I was wrong.
[laughs]

322
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,784
‐ I am not doing anything.
‐ You are lying to me.

323
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,105
‐ I am not.
‐ Gosh.

324
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,865
‐ But if I was,
what would you do?

325
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,333
‐ For a moment,

326
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,500
merely step back and revel in the sight
of a wild young woman,

327
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,711
going, "What the fuck?
I have a better idea,"

328
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,001
and reaching for it.

329
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,054
‐ Really?

330
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,377
‐ Most women die with an unsaid
better idea in their hearts.

331
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,973
‐ I would be better than him for Russia.
and you know it.

332
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,262
‐ Huh.

333
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,520
‐ Okay, what are you thinking,

334
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,900
because I'm really struggling to read you.

335
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,517
I know you love him.

336
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,071
But he is ruining Russia.

337
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,278
‐ He is the line I swore to protect.

338
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,330
‐ This is the line, also.

339

[exhales]

Will you support me?

Fuck.

‐ Everything okay?

346
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,240
She knows.
‐ She is onside.

347
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,660
‐ Are you fucking kidding?

348
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,083
She's Peter's aunt.

349
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:02,418
We must... stop. We must run, we‐‐ Fuck!

350

Or... kill her.

351
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,553
‐ We are not killing her. She is nice.

352
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,877
‐ She killed a 10‐year‐old.
‐ So, she may be handy for us later.

353
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,431
[sighs] Now dress me,
give me a knife. I'm going to lunch.

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,639
‐ Catherine‐‐

355
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,638
‐ She's read Machiavelli. I'm sure of it.
I trust she will not tell.

356
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:24,102
And if she does, all I have lost
is the element of surprise.

357
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,274
‐ Which is a big part of winning.
‐ Just dress me.

358
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,074
I know what I'm doing.

invitation to hunting.

GRIGOR:
Quick hour before lunch. Always good.

‐ 'Tis a glorious day.

362

I can feel it in the blood, somehow.

363
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,121
‐ Exactly.

364
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,924
Like everything will be different
by the end of the day.

365
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,669
‐ Indeed. I've gone through life thinking
the world will never change,

366
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,972
and lived with it.

367
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,625
Something tells me
the world we are in today

368
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,344
may not be the world we are in tomorrow.

[Leo grunts]

‐ Fuck.

377
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,280
Well, if we kill him now,
he will be shot three times.

378
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,871
How do I explain that
as an unfortunate hunting accident?

379
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,947
‐ She was never gonna buy that.
‐ But we have shot him,

380
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,793
so that doesn't look good to her, either.

381
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,458

ARKADY:
Why not just kill him?

384
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,415
‐ If it was an accident,
she would grieve him,

385
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,182
and I would provide solace to her,
but three shots in him,

386
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,585
and she will probably think I did it,
and be mad at me.

387
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,854
‐ Tatyana would love it
if I killed someone for her.

388
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,517
‐ I think they do and they don't.
I've heard.

389
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,596
‐ Throw him in the carriage.

390
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,850
When you think on it,
I am clearly the better man,

391
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,863
and have not applied myself
to it until now,

392
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,765
but he is annoying.

393
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,282
So we will stash him somewhere
until she loves me.

‐ Hmm. Pretty.

‐ Yes.

399
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,542

when this is done.

‐ Exactly.

401
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,297
Let me focus.
‐ Right.

402
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,604
‐ So.

403
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,403

‐ Do not be here to
lecture me more, Aunt. I am busy.

I will play her an improvised tune
when I present her cake.

‐ Of course.

I just want you to know
I love and support you always.

You're a son to me.

‐ Well, I'm not dead, like yours,
but I appreciate the sentiment.

‐ I am going to the country for a week.

I love to sit in nature and just watch it.

It is beautiful, and sometimes harsh.

But you realize, it is always right.

That is what I know.

He is light, and reason, and humanity.

It's Voltaire!

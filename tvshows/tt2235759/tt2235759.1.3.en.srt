163
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,977
God.

164
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,057
I'm wet at the thought of it.

165
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,726
You perhaps did not need
to hear that story.

166
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,034
‐ I knew it. I was there.

167
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,528
‐ What?

168
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,739
‐ In the room.

169
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,239
Playing soldiers in the corner.
ELIZABETH: Really?

170
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,791
PETER: Mm.
‐ How strange.

171
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,535
‐ Fucking suit's too tight.

172
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,327
‐ You, too, will grow into a great leader.

173
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,924
‐ He didn't think so.

174
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,419
ELIZABETH:
He challenged you, that is all.

175
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,261
Meet it.

176
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,258
[distant bells tolling]

177
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,049
‐ It's too big.

178
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,097
[mutters]: Fucking thing.

179
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,056
[horse whinnies]

180
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,691
ORLO: Know anything about this lover
the emperor has given Catherine?

181
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,689
‐ What? Lover?

182
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,651
‐ That is immoral and disgusting.

183
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,993
Poor child.

184
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,236
‐ So you did not know?

185
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,950
It is not a gambit of some sort?

186
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,161
A spy on her?
[doors open]

187
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,211
HERALD:
The Emperor! Empress!

188

[doors close]

189
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,708
‐ Thank you for the gift.
‐ Hmm. Did you try him yet?

190
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,460
‐ It is very kind,
but I do not need a lover.

191
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,553
I have you.

192
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,128
‐ Our fucking is as dull
as a beaver chomping at a log.

193
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,933
You need a lover. It will cheer you.

194
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,177
Grigor, how happy does it make me
to fuck your wife?

195
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,269
‐ It seems to be a constant source of joy.

196
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,135
‐ And that is exactly what I wish for you.

197
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,311
Here they come. Shut up.

198
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,941
Give me some of your medals.
‐ What?

199
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,729
‐ Give me some of your fucking medals.

200
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,232
[sighs]

201
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,494
[footsteps approaching]

202
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,503
‐ Welcome home.

203
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,745
The Russian fighting man
is the greatest in the world.

204
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,039
I have created a rosemary blini,

205
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,673
stuffed with chicken hearts,

206
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,510
representing those evil,
blond Swedish fucks.

207
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,546
We will munch on their tasty hearts.

208
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,590
ALL: Huzzah!
‐ And then,

209
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,894
wash it down with a black,
pepper vodka that my father loved,

210
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,889
as he loved you all.

211
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,271
Huzzah. To Peter the Great.

212
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,685
[glass shattering]

213
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,070
To me. Peter the...

214
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,526
Me!

215
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,739
ALL:
Huzzah!

216
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,120
‐ Gentlemen, while the Swedes
tend their wounded for a day or two

217
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,078
before we crush them properly,

218
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,458
we will eat and drink,
and celebrate our greatness.

219
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,377
Huzzah.
ALL: Huzzah!

220
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,585
‐ It went well, did you think, Grigor?
‐ It was a triumph.

221
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,510
‐ If I might brief you
on the military briefing, sir.

222
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,140
‐ I am an instinctive military genius
as my father before me.

223
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,757
I need no briefing.

224
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,274
‐ Yes, indeed.

225
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,265
I have, um... [clears throat]
come to understand that you've

226
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,148
gifted a lover to the empress, sir.

227
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,566
I would like to offer my services
in this regard,

228
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,276
if this one does not work out
and a replacement is required.

229
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,453
[both snickering]

230
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,238
‐ Grigor, did you...?
‐ I did.

231
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:02,162
[both laughing]

232
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,924
‐ That's rich, Velementov.
‐ Oh, bravo, sir.

233
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,997
‐ I, I feel, uh...
PETER: Can you imagine?

234
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,382
This warthog with his tiny cock

235
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,130
that spurts only vodka on top of the‐‐

[both cackling]

237
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,354
You have cheered me, no end. Bravo.

238
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,439
‐ Indeed. A remarkable jape from me.

239
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,805
[Grigor laughing]

240
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,032
CATHERINE:
Aunt Elizabeth.

241
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,318
‐ Darling Catherine.

242
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,832
Look at that smile.
‐ Mm.

243
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,615
It's a lifesaver, isn't it?

244
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,408
‐ Indeed.

245
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,162
Look at these fish.

246
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,590
I used to watch them,
thinking them quite content.

247
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,915
Now I realize they've gone
completely fucking mad.

248
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,841
‐ Who's Ivan?

249
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,086
‐ Who mentioned dear Ivan?

250
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,885
‐ I overheard someone. I don't know who.

251
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:07,311
I am still new,
and I'm rather slow to learn names.

252
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,320
But it did seem
a somewhat thrilling mystery.

253
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,781
ELIZABETH:
As you were.

254
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,593
I have the only key.

255
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,506
Ivan!

ELIZABETH:
Oh!

00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,073
‐ This is Catherine.
‐ The empress.

259
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,686
‐ Lovely to meet you.

260
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,238
‐ Do you like my pictures?

261
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,424
‐ Marvelous.

262
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,551
[chalk scraping]

263
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,006
‐ Getting so big.

264
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,183
We must go now.

265
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,182
‐ Is Peter coming to see me?

266
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,193
‐ He's very busy.
‐ I won't stab him.

267
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,734
I haven't even hidden a knife anywhere.

268
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,572
‐ Of course you haven't.
You're far too sweet.

269
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,318
‐ My mother?

270
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,775
‐ Still abroad.

271
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:48,333
‐ Catherine, come visit me again.

272
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,788
‐ I will.

273
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,418
‐ Fucking promise it!

274
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,245
‐ Darling! Darling!
Rude.

275
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:58,921
‐ Sorry. I just want someone to play with.

276
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,382
ELIZABETH:
Of course you do, darling.

277
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,223
I'll be back later.

278
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:17,318
[lock clicking]
‐ He is a danger to us.

279
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,726
I suppose we should kill him,

280
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,944
but he is sort of family,
and we are sentimental.

281
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,315
But now there is you, and soon an heir.

282
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,413
‐ Thank you for showing me.

283
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,118
‐ Oh, you are my family.
I will show you everything.

284
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,159
Including how to find happiness here,

285
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,213
and you will bear us an heir
and strengthen our line.

286
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,088
But you must also know where danger lies.

287
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,955
Oh.

288
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:44,006
If you see who was talking about him,
you point them out to me.

289
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,679
‐ Indeed.

290
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,142
MEN: Huzzah!
[pounding]

291
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,679
‐ Gentlemen, let us begin.
[glass shattering]

292
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,524
The Swede‐‐ First, a toast.

293
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,361
To our friend and leader,

294
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,526
the emperor's father, Peter the Great.

295
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,235
ALL:
Huzzah!

296
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,776
‐ I have a new one, in his honor.

297
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,783
ALL:
Booya! Booya!

298
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:13,464
‐ I also have the Swede's nose
who scratched me, in a bag!

299
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,745
ALL:
Booya! Booya!

300
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,419
TOLSTEN: To our brave Russian fighting men
from my battalion,

301
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,458
who have won a battle on the field,

302
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,172
opening up a chance of victory!

303
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,433
PETER: No, if we‐‐
[all yelling]

304
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,925
COLONEL SVENSKA:
My battalion, outnumbered two to one,

305
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,718
ran these fuckers into a ravine,

306
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,892
and then we just waited
above them for days,

307
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,441
till the fuckers went mad
and shot themselves.

308
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,975
[all laughing]

309
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,109
[men singing in Russian]

310
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,573
‐ Can we start?

311
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,736
‐ Indeed.

312
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,737
Focus up. The Swedes are here,

313
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,964
here, and here.

314
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,825
Now, I suggest‐‐
‐ Give me that.

315
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,917
When I started this war against Sweden,
it was because...

316
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,344
Well, my father beat them, and I...

317
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:11,386
and the Swedes are fucking
depraved animals, as is well known.

318
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,228
Blond, moose buggering,
lingonberry gorging, humorless fucks,

319
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,555
with a seaport we would do well to have.

320
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:21,321
But then, instead of winning,
you allow us to be pushed back,

321
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,685
so they are now in Russia itself.

322
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,152
It's a fucking mess, to summarize.

323
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,823
So I have a plan.

324
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:33,703
I say we...

325
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,289
come from here, through here,

326
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,960
split our forces in four, all at once,

327
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,049
probably at night, so they cannot see us.

328
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,455
Maybe we have horses,

329
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,803
although they are noisy,
so maybe we just run there.

330
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,628
Then, at dawn, when they are breakfasting

331
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,434
with cock in one hand
and brioche in other,

332
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,637
we attack and destroy them,
winning the war in one morning.

Well...

Sir, this is a river, 11 feet deep,

339

which you wish our men to cross.

he would give me a thousand rubles,

bronze my manhood
and put it on display in a museum.

You are friends, I assume?

‐ The famous lover.

391
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,013
‐ It is to undersell him.
He was a fascinating man,

392
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,429
who loved women, music, wine,

forced herself upon me.

He was a big believer
in discovery, and adventure,

and said he would not
deprive me of either.

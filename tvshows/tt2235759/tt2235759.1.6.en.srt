‐ A moment.

00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,535
You are mad at me.
MARIAL: I woke up angry,

169
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,633
with the smell of shit in my nostrils.

170
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,548
It is just a day, as usual.

171

‐ I, too, woke up
feeling ill at ease with‐‐

172
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,889

‐ I can find my own words, Marial.

174
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,885
‐ And I am your servant.

175
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,101
It is my job to furnish you
with whatever you require.

176
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,523
Tea, baths...

177
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,771
Words, courage, I cannot do.

178
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,404
But perhaps some caviar,
with your bubbly libation,

179
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,952
before you ride Romeo's cock
for the rest of the afternoon.

180
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,657
‐ I'm sorry.

181
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,997
I handled the whole thing with
the dexterity of a doughy two‐year‐old.

182
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,405
I am more limited than I thought.

183
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,794
‐ You want to give up. I can see it.

184
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,046
‐ I think a moment's repose would be good.

185
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,835
To rethink, and reset, and...

186
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,845
I mean, I have sent Orlo
to see Velementov.

187
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,845
So clearly, I'm...

188
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,468

ELIZABETH: Dear little fellow.

198
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,925
For the journey.

199
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,222
You're late.
‐ Hello.

200
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,893
Fucking dead, aren't you?

201
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,771
ELIZABETH: Sit.
PETER: Little tyke.

202
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,645
Fuck you.

203
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,765
Never liked him.

00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,324
Thanks, by the way.

205
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,315
Did it yourself?

206
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,396
‐ Of course. Family.

207
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,401
I would not let a stranger do it.

208
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,283
‐ Well, you gave him
a couple of extra years.

209
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,870
I would have done it
when we did his mother.

210
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,325
You do love children.

211
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,535
‐ It is true. I do.

212
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:02,115
‐ It's a shame yours died.
What was he called again?

213
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,750
‐ How do you feel?

214
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,207
‐ I feel great.

215
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,207
A bit weird, being in here.

216
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,089
Had some unsettling dreams
about God and a raven.

217
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,337
Then I dreamed Mother
was biting chunks out of me.

218
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,929
‐ Oh, she only did it the once,
and it was a small piece.

219
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,925
Do not over‐dramatize it, darling.

220
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,806
The idea you might die was terrifying.

221
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,982
‐ You would miss me?

222
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,229
‐ Of course.

223
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,899
And the ramifications.

224
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,069
Poor Catherine looked completely at sea.

225
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,198
‐ Well, she is just a woman.
Weak of mind, and firm of breast.

226
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,196
Do not judge her harshly.
‐ People saw her fragility.

227
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,199
For a moment,
I thought we might have to kill her,

228
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,451
and that I would have to do it,
and I am too busy for that.

229
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,873
‐ Hmm.

230
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,042
‐ I have become interested in fertility.

231
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,540
‐ You do love to fuck.
It runs in the blood.

232
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,173
‐ And fuck you should, my dear.
Your wife.

233
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,341
We need an heir. Preferably male.

234
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,419
‐ I'm trying.

235
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:59,144
‐ Putting your cock in Madam Dymov
does not get Catherine pregnant.

236
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,506
Although, how fabulous if it did.

237
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,684
By doing it to someone,
you could get someone else pregnant,

238
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,604
or fellate one man
and have another feel it.

239
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,063
Oh, how marvelous.

240
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,227
Hmm. I digress.

241
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,862
‐ Dymov makes me happy.

242
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,819
And having nearly died,
happiness is everything.

243
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,741
It is a profound thought
I have taken from the experience.

244
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,907
Don't. Don't.

245
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,832
‐ You will ruin us.

[exhales]

248
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,255

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,219
And we shall prove her wrong.

250
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,760
‐ I am something other than what I was.

251
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,024

and always have been.

Go seed your wife.

253
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,938
Get us an heir.

254
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,938
‐ I will.

255
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,979
I will be the most loved leader
Russia has ever known.

256
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,403
‐ That is my prophecy,
and always has been, darling.

257
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,413
‐ Hmm. Mm.

258
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,241
Mm.

CATHERINE:
I sometimes wake in the night,

and feel like the birds on my wallpaper

00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,295
have flown to different spots on the wall.

262
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,299

delightful stuff and perhaps they will.

[door opens]

Empress, let us fuck.

00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,988
‐ Indeed.

Sorry.

Put this inside you.
It acts as a wall,

278

and the acid kills his juice.

It's just so strange.

284
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,442
Even now. Normally I think of hunting,

285
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,568
and what gooseberry is best with pork,

286
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,815
but now I'm thinking about
how I have a child in my cock,

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,449
and I'm about to shoot it into you.
[breathes heavily]

00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,697
It is extraordinary to think of,
is it not?

00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,329
‐ It is indeed a lot to ponder.

290

‐ Something has shifted in me.

I know not what, but...

Ooh! Here he goes.

What do you normally do now?

‐ Great.

303

Let's do that, then.

You have a rash.

It broke out about the time you were ill.

‐ Mm. I'm touched.

309
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,181
‐ This shift in you. It is for change.

310
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,506
‐ Yes. But how?

311
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,221
I don't know how.

312
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,561
‐ You would like to be loved.

313
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,136
‐ [scoffs] I am loved.

314

[chuckles]
How to change though.

I am perfect,

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,940
but I know I must change somehow.
It's a fucking conundrum.

[sighs]

321
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,661
This shift in you must be
manifested in Russia.

And then you will be who you desire to be.

‐ I said that?

‐ Your point is that you would need to be
a different leader.

‐ Right. Yes. I suppose so.

ever again!

‐ What has happened?

659
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,137

He is no friend of mine.

I am, I'm an official from

Alas, we are all out of seal fat.

‐ Ah! This is fucking freezing,
and honestly,

710
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,752
it takes all the joy out of it,
quite frankly.

711
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:36,843
‐ You must eschew the art of lovemaking
for the science of heir‐making.

DR. CHEKHOV: Yes, sir.
[clears throat]

717

A hundred thrusts, and then ejection.
‐ I'll count them.

718
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,688
‐ I can count them.
‐ Did you say a hundred?

Hmm?

Shit. I lost count.

[Peter breathing heavily]

You know, I was thinking I might stop
the science thingy.

00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:04,607
And the art thingy.

756
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,873
You know, think of other ways to change.

757
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,540
‐ As you wish.

758
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:12,581
Why, though?

759
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:16,456
‐ When I was dying, God sent me dreams.

760
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,708
‐ Really.

761
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:19,919
‐ Archie thinks they are
to turn me to godliness.

762
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,300
Maybe he's right.
Plus, suddenly everything tastes shit.

763
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,179
Might be a sign.
‐ Arsenic affects the taste.

764
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,467
Might just be a lingering after‐effect.

765
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,971
‐ Really?
‐ Science.

766
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:33,064
‐ Hmm.

767
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,437
‐ I had a dream once

768
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:41,018
that a horse ate some berries
out of a gold hat.

769
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,904
‐ Gold hat. Berries.

770
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:44,531
Amusing. Huh.

771
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:47,068
‐ I don't think all dreams mean things.

772
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,450
What did you think of when you were dying?

773
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,830
‐ My parents.

774
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,583
That I'd be joining them.

775
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:56,872
‐ And?

776
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,134
‐ I pissed myself at the thought of it.

777
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,746
Or, just because of the poisoning.
Hard to say.

778
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:06,048
It was terrifying.
‐ She was cruel to you.

779
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,757
‐ She worried I would not be enough.

780
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,265
‐ You can be.

781
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,354
It is as simple as deciding to be.

782
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,395
‐ Sleep here.

783
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:21,766
‐ Oh. Of course.

784
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:27,646
‐ What do you think
our children will be like?

785
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,779
‐ Small.
‐ Hmmph. Indeed.

786
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,082
I feel like an agave muffin.
Do you want anything?

My Bible. I want to read before I die.

and compassion.

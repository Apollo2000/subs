I have learned since my near death,

it is that knowledge is all.

You know it can be done,

He is in the cupboard.

We can probably just
carry him outside in that,

449

as it is wood, and it'll burn quite well.

DR. CHEKHOV:
There is an outbreak downstairs

in the servants' quarters.
We must deal with this.

452
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,706
‐ It is the way they do it.
They burn them all. This is why I hid him.

‐ We are not burning him.

‐ What about treatments?

455

Believe me, I know it is difficult to find

457
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,965
good service people,
but there will be others.

458
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,062
‐ Not everyone dies from the pox.
You burn them all?

459
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,638
‐ It is standard process.

460
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,733
‐ No one is burning anyone. Treat him.

461
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,734
‐ Let's push the cupboard into that room,
and shut him in there.

462
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,697
PETER: Now, can anything
be shot from a gun?

463
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,159
Let us see.

464
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,738
And... if it lives,

465
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,374
have we invented a new form of travel?

466
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,372

CATHERINE:
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,970
I need to speak with you.

472
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:25,217
There's an outbreak of smallpox
in the servants' quarters.

473
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,510
‐ Don't fret, dear wife.
We will quarantine them,

474
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,394
and burn them so the disease is destroyed.

475
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,231
‐ They do not all die.

476
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,226
‐ They do, usually. It's a big fire.

477
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,146
‐ The disease does not kill all, I mean.

478
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,439
‐ Oh.

479
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,902
‐ The Empress has a novel idea, sir,

480
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:44,113
that the serfs should be treated
as the nobles are.

481
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,334
[all chattering]
‐ And why'd we do that?

482
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,485
It's risky enough that we treat nobles.

483
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,412
From what I understand,
this thing gets nasty.

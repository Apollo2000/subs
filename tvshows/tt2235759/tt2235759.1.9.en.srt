00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,582
Not interested.

320
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,924
Fascinating, all the same.

321
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,260
[growls]
‐ He knows it's her. Fuck.

322
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,676
What do we do?
‐ Get a rock.

323
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,005
Uh, Gorky?

324
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,509
I was... just, uh, one more thing. Um...

325
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,813
I, I, I forgot to‐‐
[grunts]

326
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,387
[grunts]
‐ Aah!

327
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,732
[smacks]
Aah!

328
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,149
‐ One more.

329
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,685
[grunts]
[thuds]

330
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,645
‐ Fuck.

331
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,149
‐ Not ideal. Let's go.

332
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,369
ROSTOV: Mm. [chuckles]

333
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,624
I hoped it was that kind of drink.

334
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,038
I remember it fondly.
‐ As do I.

335
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,747
‐ Mm.

336
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,879
‐ Firstly, I wish to tell you something.

337
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,469
I have a friend who...

338
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,676
believes in change.

339
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,101
[whispers] Changing Peter.
‐ The Empress, perhaps?

340
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,559
‐ Oh, never said that.

341
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,150
If it were to happen?

342
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,315
‐ I would hang balloons
from every fucking tree in the region.

343
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,147
Tell your friend I am in.

344
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,109
Do you fuck me for that?

345
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,282
‐ I fuck you because I want to fuck you.

346
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,789
[Rostov groans]
[Marial exclaims]

347
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,615
[sighs]
[Rostov chuckles]

348
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,876
[footsteps approaching]

349
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,048
‐ Yes?
ORLO: Yes.

350
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,586
If your philosophy stretches
to blackmail,

351
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,840
two million rubles, and a port,

352
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,642
then Raskolnikov is ours.

353
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,926
Mercenary pig‐eating pig.

354
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,260
‐ Agreed.

355
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,604
‐ We have Rostov.

356
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,939
‐ You look... relaxed.

357
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,765
‐ Indeed.
[footsteps approaching]

358
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,610
‐ It is mostly my fault.
VELEMENTOV: Agreed.

359
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,895
‐ What is?
‐ We had to kill Gorky.

360
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,109
ORLO: What?
‐ I let it slip that it was Catherine.

361
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,634
‐ Did anyone see you?
‐ No.

362
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,550
‐ This is bad.
‐ We do not know that, Orlo.

363
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,088
It is a random killing in a court
that has them often.

364
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,682
‐ If it is read like that.

365
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,797
‐ I will make sure it is.

366
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,351
No one do anything else!

367
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,494
[sighs wearily]

368
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,366
‐ Okay?

369
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,909
‐ What? Sorry.

370
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,162
‐ I was thinking about Grigor.
‐ So was I!

371
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,084
‐ No, he has to shave his beard off.

372
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,383
I don't want to be a prick about it,

373
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,546
but it is a bad look,
and unfair on others.

374
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,295
‐ I know.
‐ Why is he doing it?

375
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,507
‐ I‐‐ He thinks it looks good.

376
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,007
‐ He is fucking handsome,

377
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,259
but we all must pay a price
for the unity of court.

378
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,101
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ You know, especially at the moment.

379
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:18,853
[door closes]

380
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,229
‐ You shoot your shot in her,

381
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,265
and I will be very,
very disappointed in you!

382
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,981
I said stop fucking her!

383
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,612
‐ Is there something you want?
‐ It's coming.

384
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,900
Gorky's dead.

385
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,576
‐ Where are you going?
‐ I have to stop him thinking
there's a coup.

386
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,577
If he does, he'll be ready for it,
and it will be harder.

387
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,370
[exhales]
‐ I'm sorry.

388
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,083
‐ It's okay.
‐ Not really. I messed it up a bit.

389
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,384
‐ It's just frustrating,
relying on everyone.

390
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,668
I do not think it will go perfectly,
but...

391
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,632
just that I will have my hands
on the mechanism.

392
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,804
‐ Faulty human mechanism, unfortunately.

393
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,689
‐ Are you all right?

394
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,190
Killing a man.

395
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,520
You must be devastated.

396
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,569
‐ I've... killed before.

397
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,161
‐ What?
‐ This is Russia. It happens.

398
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,865
It's not my thing, but... it happens.

399
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,036
‐ Right.

400
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,327
‐ Go.

401
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,869
And I'm sorry, again.

402
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,292
I'll make it up to you.

403
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,591
[Peter yelling angrily]

404
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,933
[shattering]
[yelling continues]

405
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,429
[clattering]

406
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,388
[yelling]
[shattering]

407
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,314
‐ Best to wait it out.

408
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,572
As a child, he was always
smashing something.

409
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,765
‐ [mutters] Aah! Fuck!

410
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,074
‐ A toy... A footman...

411
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,278
[smashes]
[yells]

412
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,903
[exclaims]

413
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,663
[exhales, then pants]

414
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,163
‐ What is wrong?

415
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,659
‐ Tartar Nick's dead.
Drowned in the fountain.

416
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,712
‐ Like Leontov.
That fountain is cursed.

417
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,997
‐ That's exactly what I said.

418
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,670
‐ And now Gorky's dead.

419
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,498
‐ Elizabeth thinks I should
be worried about it.

420
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,753
That they're always coming.

421
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,974
Which is a saying of my father's,
and not hers,

422
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,545
and it is annoying that she uses it,

423
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,930
as well as annoying that she
reminisces of his cock

424
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,257
in her various holes when I'm right there!

425
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:24,933
‐ No. You just won the war.
People love you.

426
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,523
‐ Exactly! That's what I said!

427
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,609
You are quite marvelous nowadays.

428
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,975
‐ Catherine, you have a heart of snow.

429
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,229
‐ Cold?
‐ Pure.

430
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,824
You're not a political animal,
and that is fine.

431
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,990
But his bodyguard is dead,

432
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:42,079
and now Gorky,
his father's best friend, is dead.

433
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,985
‐ Best friend?
PETER: He kept it quiet.

434
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:47,084
He used to hide friendships,
so people would be led the wrong way.

435
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,830
‐ That's actually very clever.

436
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,462
‐ You know, I have stopped the war,

437
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,959
given them art and science for a time,

438
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,590
let them draw donkey‐fucking
cartoons of me,

439
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,588
and still they come after me.
What do these fuckers want?

440
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,931
So ungrateful.

441
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,046
‐ Who could want anything more?

442
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:05,103
That is why it does not make sense
that anyone is up to anything.

443
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,098
‐ It is coming.
You both need to understand that.

444
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,771
‐ All right! Fuck it.

445
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,360
If it is this, then it is this.

446
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,565
I do not get to choose the Emperor
I wish to be.

447
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,485
These fuckers make me choose
to be the Emperor I have to be.

448
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,985
So be it.

449
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,406
Leadership is a cruel master.

450
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:23,025
We will torture everyone at court.

451
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,793
BOTH: What?
‐ Man, woman, and child will be tortured

452
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,246
until someone confesses.

453
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,496
Hopefully we find them early,

454
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,667
as we do have a banquet
celebrating the war this evening.

455
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,586
‐ That is an appalling idea.
‐ You can't hurt people like that.

456
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,665
‐ I can. We torture people all the time.

457
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:38,051
Loosen a person's ball bag,
it seems to loosen their tongue.

458
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,548
‐ Oh, dear God.

459
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,090
‐ It is a flaw to need their love,
but I will take their fear instead.

460
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,684
I need to know if there is someone,

461
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,059
so this will find them efficiently,
and speedily.

462
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,056
So it's actually
a great idea. [chuckles]

463
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,308
You are women, and this is men's things.

464
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,770
‐ Surely suspects could be deduced
over a very, very,

465
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,232
very long period of investigation.

466
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,903
And only then should you act
as if there is a coup.

467
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,242
‐ We're doing this.

468
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,027
The court could do with reminding
how benevolent and fun,

469
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,831
and war‐winning I usually am.

470
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,945
And they should know that I could be
a fucking prick if I wished, instead.

471
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,619
[door closes]

472
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,535
[bangs]

[indistinct chattering]

475
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,840
‐ He's not seriously gonna do this.

476
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,724
‐ He is. I'm 3:30, you're 3:15.

477
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,852
‐ Shit! Arkady, we're on the list.

478
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,270
‐ Me, too!

479
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,098
‐ Fucking hell! We're loyal. His friends.

480
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:34,984
Why would he...

481
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,400
[all chattering]

482
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,736
‐ He can't torture everyone. It is mad.

483
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,029
‐ I don't mind a little ruthless.

484
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,123
But it does seem ill‐advised.

485
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:51,459
‐ Must you watch?

486
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,705
‐ Technically, I do not have to,
but I enjoy it.

487
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,287
[urinating]

488
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,880
Hmm. Nothing.

489
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,801
It does not always bloom directly, though.

490
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,595
[footsteps departing]

491
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,306
‐ He is to torture everyone.

492
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,226
‐ I heard. Drink this.

493
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,140
‐ We are not on the list.

494
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,773
‐ I know. Everyone but us.

495
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,771
And Catherine. And Elizabeth.

496
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,693
‐ He really loves us.

497
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:20,861
‐ I know.

498
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:26,907
‐ When my father used to gamble,
I watched the men and their cards.

499
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:29,698
The good gamblers played
the cards they were dealt.

500
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,201
The bad went mad waiting for an ace.

501
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,044
[Grigor sighs]
Hoping.

502
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,625
You've been dealt a complicated woman.

503
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,746
And hand.

504
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,632
But you must play the cards
you've been dealt.
‐ Humph.

505
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,670
‐ I love you with all my heart.

506
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,005
And soul.

507
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,934
[groans]
If there is such a thing.

508
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,770
Haven't seen much evidence
of it around here.

509
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:55,015
‐ Oh. I feel a bit‐‐
‐ Groggy? I know. Jordansk.

510
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,848
[Grigor exhales, then sighs]

511
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,404
‐ Wha...

512
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,274
What are you do...

513
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,526
[thuds]

514
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,780
[clattering]

515
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,910
‐ So you all have to hold fast
during torture.

516
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:19,134
Remember our glorious future,
and hold to that day.

517
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:22,086
‐ I, I'll, I'll just say it.
I'll, I'll spill my guts.

518
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:26,087
I have a low pain threshold.
Um, a medical condition, I think.

519
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,681
‐ If they go for my balls,
I'm not completely trustworthy, either.

520
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,597
‐ What are you talking about?
‐ True. They come for your balls.

521
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,927
All bets are off.

522
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,101
We should practice some pain management.

523
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,520
‐ [grunts] Fuck!
‐ Are you drunk, Velementov?

524
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,319
‐ A tiny bit.
What's, what's in these mules, Voronsky?

525
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,815
‐ Ooh, uh, some vodka.

526
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:43,776
‐ Can you‐‐

527
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,355
ORLO:
Leo, what are you even doing here?

528
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,486
Have you not fucked up enough already?

529
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:51,407
I mean, this, this is life and death.
Not drinks and... fucking snacks.

530
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,488
‐ Well, I just killed someone,
so I'm well aware of that, Orlo.

531
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,543
And if I didn't kill him,
we'd all be dead by now.

532
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,747
‐ Well, if you hadn't told him it was her,
you wouldn't have had to kill him.

533
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,708
‐ You all need to‐‐
‐ We need to fucking go kill Peter,

534
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,128
before this starts
and he gets too prepared.

535
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,336
‐ Marial might be right. I'll get a rock.

536
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,797
I‐‐
‐ Everyone stop.

537
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,916
We are not killing anyone.

538
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,264
We are not ready.

539
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,048
The pieces are not in place.

540
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,716
We will not fail because we panicked.

541
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:17,732
‐ It's called responding to circumstances
as they happen.

542
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,096
‐ No.

543
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,652
We need to get him to believe
the threat is over.

544
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,226
He will not stop
until he finds the plotters.

545
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,241
We need to find him one. Or some.

546
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,028
We need a scapegoat.
[door opens]

547
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,661
‐ Fuck! Guards!

548
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,237
[Velementov mutters]

549
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,169
‐ Remember, think of our glorious future,
and not the searing pain in your balls.

550
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,012
[doors close]
[distant footsteps departing]

551
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,375
‐ I thought word "searing"
was uncalled for.

552
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,263
[Velementov grunts]

553
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:53,299
‐ They do not inspire confidence
in victory, our comrades.

554
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,223
‐ They will. Just need aligning.

555
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,520
What do you seek here
without asking entrance?

556
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,808
PETER:
Uh, it's me!

557
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,652
I was worried for your safety.

558
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:04,687
Come on.

559
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,569
‐ You have a lot of guards.
‐ Indeed.

560
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,492
Fucking come for me,
you'd die a lot first.

561
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,121
We will confine ourselves together
until it is safe.

562
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,829
ARCHIE: Emperor!
‐ Archie.

563
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,539
Yes, I'm in here.
ARCHIE: Right.

564
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,170
I am to begin the interrogations.

565
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:27,208
‐ Indeed.
Fucking shake their souls, Archie.

566
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,262
ARCHIE:
Will do.

567
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,045
‐ I see a fruit bowl through there.
Toss an apple over, will you?

568
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,139
‐ Uh, right.

569
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,013
[crunches]

00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,765
[indistinct chattering]

571
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:45,897
‐ How are we supposed to enjoy the picnic?
I can't judge their looks.

572
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,978
What is fucked about this job is
you never fucking know.

573
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:52,784
You know, my father always used to be
hyper wary. Hyper scared.

574
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,569
And I told myself,
in this, I would be different.

575
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:58,544
And instead,
I'm a prisoner in my own palace.

576
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,405
‐ I suppose you never know,
when you are king,

577
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,042
whether loyalty and love is true.

578
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,329
‐ Exactly. How does one live unsure
of the love others have for them?

579
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,634
‐ It is difficult.

580
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,167
‐ It is fucking cruel.

581
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,590
It's how I used to feel about Mother,
and now I feel it again.

582
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,134
‐ You just need to find the plotters.

583
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,008
Let your feelings focus your action.

584
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,892
‐ That seems smart.
Your hair is golden in the sun.

585
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,017
‐ Like Archie, perhaps.

586
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,229
The Church is a powerful entity.

587
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,610
And they do not like
your free‐thinking ways.

588
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,777
‐ He is often disdainful and does
occasionally get yell‐y at me these days.

589
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,357
‐ He called me evil.

590
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,032
And put his fingers inside me.

591
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,660
‐ And put the raven in my room.

592
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,447
And does not fuck.
That can do things to a man.

593
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,081
‐ Indeed.

594
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:44,998
I suggest for safety, you place Archie
under house arrest immediately.

595
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,328
We will find a malleable bishop
in his group

596
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,424
who will send his forged sermons,
sign his name to them,

597
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,720
and at some point,
when you have found a loyal replacement,

598
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:54,925
kill him,

599
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,545
and we can go back to normal court life.

600
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:58,142
[chuckling]

601
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,296
‐ Brilliant.

602
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:02,144
Once, you gave me a twig
and were a doe‐eyed fool.

603
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,980
Now you want to kill the Patriarch.

604
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:06,596
Huh. I have never wanted to
fuck you so much.

605
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,693
‐ I care for you. That is all.

606
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,900
‐ Huzzah. Let us go.

607
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,440
‐ Where?
‐ See if you're right.

608

‐ Oh. This looks great.

612
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,971
DR. CHEKHOV: Yes. We have five stations
going at the moment,

613
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,177
working from left to right.
We have fingernails,

614
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:42,468
face eels, uh, medical chair, various,

615
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,232
and then a kind of mental torture.
They walk in a small circle,

616
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,895
knowing a brick will drop on them
at some point,

617
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:50,105
and they can save themselves
by confessing.

[smacks]
[thuds]

619
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,648
Or not. And finally, uh, Colonel Tolsten
just beats the shit out of them.

[grunts]

621
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,820

622
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,742
‐ Help me!

623
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,158
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Any confessions yet?

624
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,041
‐ Not yet, but early days‐‐

625
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,868
Can someone mop the blood up?
Someone could slip!

PETER: Archie!

627
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,208
You're up.
‐ Uh, no, I'm last.

628
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:17,883
4:45 on the schedule, sir.
PETER: Uh, fuck that. Now.

629
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,473
‐ What?
PETER: Or is that a problem? Hmm?

630
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:23,429
If so, we should discuss why it is.

631
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,060
‐ Delighted.

He doesn't seem in much pain. Come on.

Bloody flesh hurts when salted.

PETER: [chuckles] Brilliant, Leo.
It is good to laugh about it.

I thank you all for your loyalty,
and we will celebrate it.

Uh, enjoy the hog. Um...

Pear soufflé, for dessert.

First pears of the season.

...and my heart breaks.

972
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,009
For your pain.

00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:10,774
For your sorrows.

974
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,940
But I also see, externally...

00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:23,533
...signs of what we all carry inside us,
every day...

And also love.

For today, you are all as one.

983
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:56,557
And when you look at each other,
recognize it.

Understand, we are all Russians.

985
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:05,954
In our pain, and in our sorrows.

986
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:08,276
In our simple hopes for less pain...

987
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:11,488
...and less wounded future.

988
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,871
For a future where our hearts sing,

989
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,254
and rush with joy at the country we build.

990
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,416
One where we trust in each other,

knowing we are bonded
by our love for Russia.

You could have mentioned me
in your speech.

I may love you.

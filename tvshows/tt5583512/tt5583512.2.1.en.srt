1
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,596
- I forgot to tell you.
- Mm.

2
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,867
Kelly got a job today

3
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,631
at a coffee shop.

4
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,736
I thought she was coming
home for the summer.

5
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,605
<i>Well she changed her mind.</i>

6
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,208
She's moving in with some friends.

7
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,114
<i>It's not about that, John.</i>

8
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,153
She had a gun to her head.

9
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,790
She doesn't blame you.

10
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,066
I want to show you something.

11
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,067
And Black flies?

12
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,494
Brutal little mothers.

13
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,063
You gotta stop eating candy, bro.

14
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,798
<i>They like the sweet stuff.</i>

15
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,433
Yeah? Why aren't they all over you,

16
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,667
Mr. Nice Guy?

17
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,838
They can smell my bitterness
from a mile away.

18
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,505
<i>She's totally out of it!</i>

19
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,376
<i>Wow.</i>

20
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,181
<i>We're going to have a good time, huh.</i>

21
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,683
<i>Can we get a tequila?</i>

22
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,250
<i>Double shot?</i>

23
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:48,374
<i>Blaine.</i>

24
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,568
The redhead.

25
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,022
What's she drinking?

26
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,791
The guy over there bought her a beer.

27
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,025
She didn't drink it.

28
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,505
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

29
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,506
Back off, buddy.

30
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,741
<i>Shut up.</i>

31
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,711
<i>Miss, are you okay?</i>

32
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,815
I don't know.

33
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,283
Do you know what day is it?

34
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:21,618
<i>I said back off.</i>

35
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:22,853
Um...

36
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,389
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

37
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,993
<i>Hey, Chief.</i>

38
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,995
Why don't you get out of
here before I kick your ass.

39
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,229
Oh, yeah?

40
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,303
Miss.

41
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,705
Do you have a purse on you?

42
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,374
A phone?

43
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,377
I don't think so.

44
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:51,781
Hey!

45
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,752
Does anyone in here
know who this lady is?

46
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,688
I thought she was just being nice.

47
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,491
<i>Miss.</i>

48
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,993
<i>I'm gonna take you to some place safe.</i>

49
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,861
<i>If that's okay with you.</i>

50
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,964
Sure.

51
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,492
I don't want to sell our house.

52
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:27,444
We've been talking about
a place on the water

53
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,478
ever since we came up.

54
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:29,702
Some day.

55
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,449
My thirty's coming up in September.

56
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:38,418
Sure and then it'll be your thirty-five,

57
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:39,519
and then your forty.

58
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:40,921
<i>Catherine.</i>

59
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:42,155
I was thinking

60
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,025
that I might actually...

61
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
I don't think we should
look too far ahead.

62
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:54,634
There.

63
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:57,770
Perfect!

64
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:17,923
Cardinal.

65
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,233
I was on a date.

66
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,652
Ah.

67
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:30,702
Sorry.

68
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,937
He spent the whole time explaining

69
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,006
how prosecution works.

70
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,675
He was probably nervous.

71
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,181
These are detectives Cardinal and Delorme

72
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,182
from the Algonquin Bay Police Department.

73
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,186
They'll be taking over
the case from here.

74
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,354
<i>Okay, well,</i>

75
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,121
<i>the bullet entered the
victim's left temporal lobe.</i>

76
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:52,053
Lodged near the hippocampus.

77
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,254
So lobotomy by gunshot.

78
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,523
<i>That would explain her placid mood.</i>

79
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,525
What's her condition?

80
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,626
The bullet's close to a cerebral artery.

81
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:02,462
Based on her EEG...

82
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:04,597
one or two strong seizures

83
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:06,066
and she's dead.

84
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,373
<i>They're assembling a
trauma team in Toronto.</i>

85
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,183
- Can we see her?
- <i>Mmm hmm.</i>

86
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,441
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- Thanks.

87
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:15,675
<i>All right, thank you.</i>

88
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,478
So, I've been calling her "Red"

89
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:19,912
because I don't think that Jane Doe

90
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,047
is appropriate for a living victim.

91
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,215
Is she local?

92
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,917
Nobody recognized her in the bar

93
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,953
and I ran her picture
against our missing persons

94
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,187
and no hits.

95
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:32,157
No, ah, cell phone? Purse?

96
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:33,325
Just the clothes on her back

97
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,060
and judging by the leaves
and the dirt and everything,

98
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:36,962
she had to be out in the bush for a while

99
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,397
before she went into the bar.

100
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,631
Huh.

101
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:44,936
<i>Hi.</i>

102
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,972
<i>I'm Detective Cardinal.</i>

103
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:48,636
<i>This is Detective Delorme.</i>

104
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:50,775
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

105
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:53,578
Great.

106
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:54,813
How are you?

107
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:57,248
<i>Um...</i>

108
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:00,585
<i>There's a helicopter that's
going to take you to a hospital</i>

109
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:01,586
<i>in Toronto.</i>

110
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:02,821
Why?

111
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:05,278
I feel fine.

112
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:07,791
Ah...

113
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,995
Well, because you have a bullet

114
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:12,363
lodged in your brain

115
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,399
and the doctors want to take it out.

116
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,501
Oh.

117
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,282
Okay.

118
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,507
Ah, can you help us with something.

119
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,041
We'd like to go through your clothing,

120
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:26,443
see if there's any identification.

121
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:27,678
<i>Sure.</i>

122
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,148
Ah, do you mind if I take your photo?

123
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:35,719
Is my hair crazy?

124
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,689
No.

125
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,996
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

126
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,155
who might have done this to you?

127
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:53,736
Done what?

128
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:58,708
Looks like you're ready to go.

129
00:09:58,743 --> 00:09:59,943
Come on.

130
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:04,254
And I will meet you in Toronto.

00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:45,877
<i>Maybe from school?</i>

174
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:47,779
I don't think so.

175
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:50,748
What about hanging around
the Northern Raiders?

176
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:51,916
<i>Your biker friends.</i>

177
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:53,517
I haven't been around them in six months.

178
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:54,786
But I don't know her.

179
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:57,621
Hey, if you're walking alone,

180
00:13:57,657 --> 00:14:00,624
just beware of your surroundings, okay?

181
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,125
No headphones.

182
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,794
You don't think I can handle myself?

183
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:06,530
I know you can.

184
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,399
Just be careful.

185
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:15,772
Plain, unjacketed, lead,

186
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,340
thirty-two caliber bullet.

187
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,474
And it looks to me like a

188
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,776
thirty-two long.

189
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,311
See normally with a head shot,

190
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:23,680
you'd expect the bullet to mushroom

191
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:25,015
and look here,

192
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,117
<i>it's almost intact.</i>

193
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:29,186
Now old or waterlogged maybe.

194
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:31,387
That's why it didn't kill her.

195
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,822
<i>Six right-hand grooves,</i>

196
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:35,625
<i>with a land groove ratio
of one-to-one-plus.</i>

197
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,493
Grooves are zero point five-six;

198
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,395
lands are zero point six-oh.

199
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:40,463
Pistol.

200
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:42,998
The rifling on the weapon
has a left-hand twist.

201
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:44,667
That narrows it down
to two possibilities:

202
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,202
a J.C. Higgins model 80,

203
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:48,370
or a Colt Police Positive.

204
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,604
That helps.

205
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:53,275
There are hundreds of these in Ontario.

206
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,883
<i>Our redhead have a name yet?</i>

207
00:15:01,418 --> 00:15:02,384
No prints in the system.

208
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,618
In Canada.

209
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:05,887
We're working our way

210
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,556
through the individual state databases.

211
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:10,693
No one's reported her missing?

212
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:11,713
Not yet.

213
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:12,994
<i>We still have hours of bus station</i>

214
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,629
and airport footage to go through.

215
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:16,431
You don't think she's local?

216
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,699
We don't know.

217
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:21,169
<i>Healthy, perfect teeth.</i>

218
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,004
She wasn't living on the streets.

219
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,172
If she's local,

220
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,207
someone would have reported
her missing by now.

221
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,461
How ya feeling?

222
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,560
Sorry, do I know you?

223
00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:57,037
I'm Detective Cardinal.

224
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:59,472
We met in Algonquin Bay.

225
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,776
They're gonna transfer you
back up there tomorrow.

226
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:04,244
Then I can go home?

227
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,414
<i>Any idea where that might be?</i>

228
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:11,684
I was hoping that you knew.

229
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:17,290
Get some rest.

230
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:30,069
<i>Great.</i>

231
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:31,703
Yes. Okay, thank you.

232
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:33,372
Yeah, thank you.

233
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,342
I found a witness.

234
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:38,644
Says he saw a truck drop off Red

235
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,112
at the World Tavern last night.

236
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,614
And he remembers the make,
model and plate number?

237
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,616
He remembered it was a grocery truck.

238
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:46,614
Fruit painted all over it.

239
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:49,287
I tracked down the driver.

240
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,422
He's local?

241
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,423
Mmm-hmm.

242
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:53,291
He's on his way in.

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,434
<i>You picked her up southbound Highway 11?</i>

244
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,468
Yeah.

245
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:04,469
She was wandering.

246
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:06,838
I thought maybe she was drunk.

247
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:09,040
She didn't flag you for a ride?

248
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,514
You saw her and you pulled over.

249
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,112
<i>I don't usually pick up hitchhikers.</i>

250
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,981
But she caught your eye.

251
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,017
I have three daughters.

252
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,152
I'd like to think that if one
of them was lost out there...

253
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:24,021
<i>What made you think she was lost?</i>

254
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,157
<i>She didn't know her name.</i>

255
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,694
Didn't know where she'd been,
where she was going.

256
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,129
So you dropped her off at a roadside bar.

257
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,953
Instead of here

258
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,621
or the hospital.

259
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,168
She saw the World Tavern,

260
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,370
said to drop her off there.

261
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,371
What am I gonna do?

262
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:42,406
Keep her prisoner in my cab?

263
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,011
So you were worried
enough to pick her up,

264
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,713
but not enough to take
her somewhere safe?

265
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:50,947
It's not...

266
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,350
I started thinking it was a scam.

267
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,858
Ah, maybe I do want to call a lawyer.

268
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,192
Is she a lumberjack?

269
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:25,630
Okay, how old is she?

270
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:28,674
Twenties. Five four, a
hundred and twenty pounds.

271
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,371
Hey Dad, we're not shopping for
your girlfriend here are we?

272
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,222
Who is she?

273
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:40,378
Just tell me. I-I won't say anything.

274
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,413
She's someone who needs my help.

275
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:52,857
I'm staying here 'cause I like it.

276
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:53,858
Not because of what happened.

277
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,000
She needs pants.

278
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:06,003
- We have a suspect yet?
- Got it.

279
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:08,338
Forensics is going through the truck.

280
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:09,573
Nothing yet.

281
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,375
And his story checks out.

282
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,910
I don't think he's our guy.

283
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,812
I sent you Venn's, uh,

284
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,414
preliminary firearms report. Have you...

285
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,683
<i>Yeah, I pulled a
list of registered owners</i>

286
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:21,752
<i>matching the two gun types.</i>

287
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,353
<i>We've got six in town.</i>

288
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,489
I thought I'd start with these before

289
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:27,255
working my way further out.

290
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:28,521
How's Red?

291
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:31,324
Ah, she forgets who I am
every time I leave the room.

292
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,927
I'm shopping for clothing for her now.

293
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:35,962
As if she hasn't been through enough.

294
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,265
Hey, is that Mom?

295
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:42,569
I gotta call ya back.

296
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:44,636
Yeah.

297
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:34,318
Do you have a minute?

298
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:35,586
What's up?

299
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,255
I want to apply for training

300
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,124
with the National Intelligence Service.

301
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,093
I need your letter of recommendation.

302
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:46,497
You're not happy here?

303
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:49,400
I want to keep my options open.

304
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:52,436
Well, the timing couldn't be worse.

305
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,472
The interviews start in a few days.

306
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:56,706
Mmm hmm.

307
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:01,412
You've only been here for six months.

308
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:04,281
Why should I pick you over anyone else?

309
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:09,418
You need detectives
committed to being the best.

310
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:13,957
Have you talked to Cardinal?

311
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,527
He won't mind.

312
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,549
It's summer, isn't it?

313
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:43,185
Yeah.

314
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:46,021
Anything coming back to you?

315
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:53,562
Where are we going?

316
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:56,264
Algonquin Bay.

317
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,668
Am I coming home with you?

318
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,903
<i>No.</i>

319
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,933
No, we have a private room
for you at a hospital.

320
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:07,909
And a neuropsychologist who will help you

321
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:09,777
get your memory back.

322
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:13,547
Do I like him?

323
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:16,650
I don't think you've met him.

324
00:22:19,355 --> 00:22:20,755
We'll have fun.

325
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,612
<i>What do you think I did?</i>

326
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:53,253
I mean, to get shot in the head?

327
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,289
What makes you think it
was something you did?

328
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,423
What're you doing?

329
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,425
Yeah, I thought you were drowning.

330
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,593
Drowning?

331
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:36,027
I'll drown you!

332
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:39,864
You're such a jerk!

333
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:43,968
Oh, I'm so sorry.

334
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:45,837
Hey!

335
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:47,739
I'm going into town.

336
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:49,473
Come on.

337
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:50,709
All right.

338
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:52,811
<i>Shotgun!</i>

339
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,179
<i>Aw, you suck!</i>

340
00:23:54,214 --> 00:23:55,246
You can pick the music Toof.

341
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:56,314
<i>What? No, no!</i>

342
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:58,115
<i>I'll-I'll let him take the front.</i>

343
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,417
Kev, I love ya man.

344
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:01,252
But your music is shit.

345
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:02,587
Yeah, it brings me down.

346
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:04,021
You guys have no taste.

347
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,989
<i>Here.</i>

348
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,859
I don't want your wet asses on my seats.

349
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:41,319
I think you'll like this place.

350
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:44,922
<i>Come on in.</i>

351
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,226
Lise Delorme.

352
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:51,096
<i>You're next.</i>

353
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:53,965
Jordan Akiwenzie.

354
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,734
He's got way too many
schemes going on in his head.

355
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:58,769
Needs a place to channel that energy.

356
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:03,474
Can I talk to you?

357
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:13,157
I don't mind helping out,

358
00:25:13,452 --> 00:25:16,052
but I can't commit to
being here all the time.

359
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:17,921
- Of course not.
- No.

360
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:19,156
But when you are here,

361
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,024
you're a rock star.

362
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:23,793
I'm leaving Jordan here.

363
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,038
<i>And time.</i>

364
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,515
Ever boxed before?

365
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:49,785
I know how to fight.

366
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,126
<i>So, uh, I'm just wondering
if you've made your decision</i>

367
00:25:57,162 --> 00:25:58,517
about NIS.

368
00:25:58,553 --> 00:26:00,363
The interviews start on Thursday.

369
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,580
I've decided to go with someone else.

370
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:06,782
Oh yeah? Who?

371
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,379
<i>I've managed to eliminate</i>

372
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:20,215
<i>two owners of the gun
types we're looking at.</i>

373
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,683
How many province wide?

374
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:24,952
Two hundred ninety-seven.

375
00:26:24,988 --> 00:26:26,854
That's only the registered ones.

376
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,790
Well let's hope it's registered.

377
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,024
And local.

378
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:33,662
Dyson recommended you for
NIS training, didn't she?

379
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:36,964
I've been here six years.

380
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,399
You've been here what?

381
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:40,702
Why'd she pick you?

382
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:42,837
I'm sleeping with her.

383
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,512
Intelligence and analysis.

384
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,547
- Is that what you...
- That's what came up.

385
00:26:58,221 --> 00:26:59,820
<i>Six months away.</i>

386
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:00,987
Seems like a good idea.

387
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:02,423
It's a good career move.

388
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:05,807
<i>John.</i>

389
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,776
I knew you wouldn't have time
to come home and change.

390
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:10,890
Oh, thanks.

391
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:12,314
- Hi Lise.
- Hi.

392
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,570
Uh, I won't keep you but, ah,
guess who has 12 students

393
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:18,571
signed up for Toronto.

394
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,006
- When do you leave?
- Friday.

395
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,842
And I got a million
things to do before then so,

396
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:23,076
I better run.

397
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:24,550
<i>- See you for dinner?
- Yeah.</i>

398
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:44,296
You know what a long shot this is.

399
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,765
The shooter and the gun

400
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,867
could be in Calgary by now.

401
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:49,301
Where to next?

402
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:52,525
3675 Spencer Road.

403
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:00,439
Catherine looked happy.

404
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:02,771
She is.

405
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:17,820
<i>- Come on in.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

406
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:20,722
I, uh, inherited it from my grandfather.

407
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:23,091
He died, uh, ten years ago.

408
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:26,061
<i>No idea why he left it to me.</i>

409
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:27,162
<i>Have you ever fired it?</i>

410
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:28,931
<i>No. I'm not a gun guy.</i>

411
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:31,799
I just tossed it into the safe,
with the rest of the ammo.

412
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:34,302
<i>I thought about selling it,</i>

413
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:38,673
<i>but I figured I'd hold
onto it for my nephew.</i>

414
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,542
<i>You know, leave it to him when I die.</i>

415
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,813
That's really weird.

416
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,982
I never open this thing.

417
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,784
Who knew you had this gun?

418
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:53,120
Um, well my-my grandfather's lawyer,

419
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:54,421
ah, my sister.

420
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:56,757
Um, nobody would steal it.

421
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,860
When was the last time you saw it?

422
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:00,461
<i>Ah, I don't know, um-</i>

423
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:02,329
And no one else knew it was here?

424
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,200
My friend Dave.

425
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:10,436
Um, he came over for a
beer about a month ago,

426
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:12,984
<i>but he wouldn't steal it.</i>

427
00:29:13,674 --> 00:29:14,773
You showed him where you kept it?

428
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:15,808
Yeah, but I don't...

429
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:18,111
<i>How well do you know this Dave?</i>

430
00:29:18,146 --> 00:29:20,046
<i>Well I-I just keep my boat at his marina</i>

431
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:23,383
and, um, well we go fishing sometimes.

432
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:24,417
Ah-

433
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,667
I haven't seen him in a couple weeks.

434
00:29:29,793 --> 00:29:32,057
You know, he was acting jittery.

435
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:35,360
Um, talking about fresh starts and

436
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,796
moving away.

437
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:39,665
We'll need Dave's last name.

438
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:46,004
Haven't seen Dave in almost two weeks.

439
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,672
Took off on his boat.

440
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:51,143
He say where he was going?

441
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:53,108
No. Never does.

442
00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:55,380
He does this a lot?

443
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:56,381
<i>Yeah.</i>

444
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,982
<i>He takes off a couple times a year.</i>

445
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:00,685
Says the stress gets too much.

446
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:03,922
Does he have any family in town or?

447
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:06,591
<i>Um, I think he's from
the Maritimes somewhere.</i>

448
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:08,660
He's kind of a loner.

449
00:30:08,695 --> 00:30:10,595
<i>And you're his only employee?</i>

450
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,831
<i>Yup. And we've got a
charter for a bachelor party</i>

451
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:15,766
<i>that's supposed to be here in 15 minutes.</i>

452
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:17,734
<i>Dave's left you with a,</i>

453
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,002
a lot on your plate.

454
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:20,704
He hasn't checked in at all?

455
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:22,239
<i>You know, it's uh...</i>

456
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:23,840
It's actually easier when he's not here.

457
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:26,210
<i>Marci, is this the boat he's out on?</i>

458
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:28,143
<i>Yeah. The "Muskee-Doe".</i>

459
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,781
Have you seen this woman?

460
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:32,732
She's really pretty.

461
00:30:32,768 --> 00:30:33,782
Who's she?

462
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:35,852
We were wondering if Dave might know her.

463
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:36,853
Dave?

464
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:38,521
You've seen Dave right?

465
00:30:38,557 --> 00:30:39,923
<i>He'd never get a girl like that.</i>

466
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,893
<i>Listen, if you hear from Dave,</i>

467
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,728
or find out where he is,

468
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:46,615
give us a call.

469
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,464
Okay.

470
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:56,406
Maybe Marci isn't the only
young woman Dave's into.

471
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:00,042
What if Dave developed
an obsession with Red,

472
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,579
didn't like hearing "no"?

473
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:04,114
Stole his buddy's gun,

474
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,816
took off on his boat after he shot her?

475
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,084
Not impossible.

476
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,953
Let's get a BOLO out on Dave

477
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,421
and his boat.

478
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,289
We should run this by Red.

479
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,830
She's highly open to suggestion.

480
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,897
She might "remember" this
is the man who shot her,

481
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:24,233
even if he isn't.

482
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:26,168
Someone out there tried to kill her.

483
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:28,137
And the sooner she
remembers who she is...

484
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:30,305
She hasn't forgotten who she is.

485
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:32,341
She just can't retrieve the
information right now.

486
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:37,912
So what are you doing to help her?

487
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:41,449
Art therapy has proven to be
very successful in some cases.

488
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:44,085
Tomorrow I'm going to
introduce various stimuli

489
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:45,920
music, images, smells...

490
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:48,640
Okay. So just add this
picture to the other ones.

491
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,092
One of many,

492
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,527
it's not suggestive.

493
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:07,808
You seen anyone outside this door?

494
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,044
Anyone called her phone?
Sent her flowers?

495
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,311
Nothing.

496
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:13,714
Alright, she so much
as talks in her sleep,

497
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:15,482
Fox, I want a full transcript

498
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,350
and make sure the night
shift knows that too.

499
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:18,952
Yeah, I won't let anyone
get near her, Detective.

500
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:20,387
Don't worry.

501
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,401
<i>How long you be gone?</i>

502
00:32:34,728 --> 00:32:35,802
We leave Friday morning,

503
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:37,237
back Sunday night.

504
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,339
<i>Good group?</i>

505
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,840
I think so.

506
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,309
A few of my past students,

507
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:43,945
a bunch of new faces.

508
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:47,824
Probably sneak in a visit
with Kelly while I'm there.

509
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:50,917
<i>What is it?</i>

510
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:53,886
No, it sounds great.

511
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:56,756
<i>I'd ask you to come.</i>

512
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,024
This case.

513
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,924
I won't have any time for you anyway.

514
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:10,722
You sure about this?

515
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:16,269
It's only two days.

516
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:20,411
I shouldn't have asked.

517
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,987
You don't need to worry.

518
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:40,697
<i>Delorme.</i>

519
00:34:42,535 --> 00:34:43,967
<i>Sergeant.</i>

520
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:45,402
Summer's finally here.

521
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:49,840
Yeah.

522
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:53,477
Heard you nailed your
interview this morning.

523
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,147
I'll be happy to put in a good
word with my buddy Richard.

524
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,016
He's on the ah selection committee.

525
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:02,853
That won't be necessary.

526
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:04,087
Well I just...

527
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:08,559
I'd hate to see you lose this.

528
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:11,794
And you're putting

529
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:13,829
National Intelligence Service
on the resume.

530
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,434
Sky's the limit.

531
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:21,804
You need a hobby.

532
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,506
<i>You're going to tank
your career for Cardinal?</i>

533
00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:28,744
He's not going to leave his wife.

534
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,768
How did you feel when John questioned

535
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:42,794
your decision to take
your students to Toronto?

536
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:47,378
I wanted to slap him.

537
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:51,265
But this will be the
first time I've been away

538
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:53,301
since I got out of the hospital, so.

539
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:55,547
<i>Are you worried?</i>

540
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:57,305
I'm excited.

541
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,588
When I try to share that with John I...

542
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:03,844
I can see him gauging me.

543
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:06,414
But John is your partner.

544
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:08,515
He knows you're going
to have highs and lows,

545
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,951
just as everyone does.

546
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:13,954
I have to prove I'm okay.

547
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:17,624
He's trying to pretend he isn't
looking for that proof and...

548
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,726
Ugh!

549
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,954
That sounds exhausting.

550
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,701
We both want to believe we
can prevent the next time.

551
00:36:27,736 --> 00:36:29,135
That's very common.

552
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:33,973
When we were in Toronto, years ago,

553
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,643
John was working undercover.

554
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:39,078
<i>He'd be gone for weeks at a time.</i>

555
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:41,948
<i>One day, he came home,
just for a few hours.</i>

556
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:45,651
I was manic.

557
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:47,086
Apparently, he tried
to get through to me,

558
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,087
<i>but it was too late.</i>

559
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:52,068
You say 'apparently'.

560
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:53,993
I don't remember.

561
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,828
Now this is the episode

562
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:58,741
that led to your suicide attempt.

563
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:06,739
John's always felt it
wouldn't have happened

564
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:08,173
if he'd been home.

565
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:11,943
<i>Is he right?</i>

566
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,218
I don't know.

567
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:29,494
<i>Good morning.</i>

568
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,663
Are you up for a short slide show?

569
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:34,965
Do I know what to do?

570
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:36,601
<i>I'm going to show you some random slides.</i>

571
00:37:36,636 --> 00:37:38,202
Don't look for anything specific.

572
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:39,804
Just let the images wash over you.

573
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,038
<i>Okay?</i>

574
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:18,942
<i>Pause it.</i>

575
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:23,046
<i>You know it?</i>

576
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,914
No.

577
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,782
What do you remember about that?

578
00:38:31,256 --> 00:38:32,688
I don't know.

579
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:38,661
Where was that photo taken?

580
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:39,995
Beaufort Hill.

581
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,430
Near the trailhead.

582
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:48,203
<i>The back side of Beaufort Hill</i>

583
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,239
dumps out just off Highway 11,

584
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:52,107
<i>right where the truck
driver picked her up.</i>

585
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,277
Let's go hiking.

586
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:05,668
<i>Okay, hold still.</i>

587
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:10,739
That stuff doesn't work.

588
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:12,842
The only thing that
works is staying inside.

589
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:13,843
Trust me.

590
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:15,178
They hate lemon eucalyptus.

591
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:16,846
You've been here before?

592
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,246
No.

593
00:39:18,282 --> 00:39:19,348
You?

594
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:21,216
With my dad when I was a kid.

595
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,757
All right, two main trails.

596
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:30,425
Switch back up the mountain from here

597
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:31,594
and meet at the top.

598
00:39:31,629 --> 00:39:33,028
I'll take that one.

599
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,300
Made it to the end of the Beaufort Trail.

600
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:14,735
I'm heading for the creek.

601
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:16,870
<i>Over.</i>

602
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,939
Copy.

603
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,594
How's the eucalyptus working?

604
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,248
Just great.

605
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:49,969
I'm on the old Nishinabe Creek Trail.

606
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,440
Copy. I'm halfway up.

607
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:19,198
I got something.

608
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:21,266
A cave by the waterfall.

609
00:41:21,302 --> 00:41:22,301
<i>Copy.</i>

610
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:23,768
<i>I'm on my way over.</i>

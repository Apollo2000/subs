1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:02,713
Previously on "Cardinal".

2
00:00:02,748 --> 00:00:04,715
The bullet entered the
victim's left temporal lobe.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,918
So lobotomy by gunshot.

4
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:07,919
What do you see?

5
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,486
Over there. Moons.

6
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:10,487
Got it.

7
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:11,555
Do you know her?

8
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,857
I don't think so.

9
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:14,826
What about hanging
around the Northern Raiders?

10
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:16,060
Your biker friends.

11
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:17,728
I haven't been around them in six months.

12
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:18,995
We leave Friday morning,

13
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,331
back Sunday night.

14
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,332
You sure about this?

15
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:22,833
You don't need to worry.

16
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,134
I want to apply for training

17
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:25,736
with the National Intelligence Service.

18
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,438
You put National Intelligence Service

19
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:29,573
on the resume and sky's the limit.

20
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:31,308
You gonna tank your career for Cardinal?

21
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:32,576
Who knew you had this gun?

22
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:33,743
My friend Dave.

23
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:35,511
I haven't seen Dave in almost two weeks.

24
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:36,947
Is this the boat he's out on?

25
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:38,315
Yeah. The "Muskee-Doe".

26
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,983
The sooner she remembers who she is-

27
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,651
She hasn't forgotten who she is.

28
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:44,821
She just can't retrieve
the information right now.

29
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:45,822
Where was that photo taken?

30
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:46,823
Beaufort Hill.

31
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:47,924
I got something.

32
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,959
A cave by the waterfall.

33
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:17,186
There's way fewer
maggots than I'd expect.

34
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,454
Found another one of these in the bush.

35
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,890
Looks like blood.

36
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:22,924
We'll test it against the victim's.

37
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:25,627
Not much blood on the ground.

38
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,662
This might not be the kill site.

39
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:36,037
Ah, this is some sort of sacrifice.

40
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:37,972
A ritual.

41
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:41,009
Okay. You guys could come
on over and take a closer look now.

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,313
Genitalia's been removed.

43
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:46,547
Mhm.

44
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,450
Compass rose.

45
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:54,389
Same as the one in the
photo at the marina.

46
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,056
You know who it is?

47
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,562
Dave Elhurst.

48
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,832
Our only suspect in a
shooting three days ago.

49
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,266
Lise.

50
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:12,372
When Red was in surgery,

51
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:14,007
she said,

52
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:16,209
"Over there. Pointing.

53
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:17,644
Moons."

54
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:22,615
I found this.

55
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:25,252
The nearest train tracks are at least

56
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:26,719
six kilometres away.

57
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:30,857
Not exactly sharp enough
to be a murder weapon.

58
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:32,892
Doesn't mean the killer didn't bring it.

59
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,296
Ugh, you called?

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,299
Yeah, I uh,

61
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,401
I wanted you to have a look at this.

62
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,316
Good thing you called me, man.

63
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,385
See? I knew it had to be a Native thing.

64
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,752
Oh yeah, definitely.

65
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:03,125
Okay. So,

66
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,492
what do the markings mean?

67
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,961
Well, they refer to time and space.

68
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:11,262
Roughly translates to

69
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:12,998
"I'll meet you at Tim Hortons,

70
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,867
three p.m. on Saturday."

71
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:17,102
I don't know,

72
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,669
I'm not an expert on cave drawings, Ian.

73
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:19,971
You know, believe it or not,

74
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,007
with all those bows and arrows and stuff,

75
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,642
you might want to talk to somebody

76
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,311
in Behavioural Sciences.

77
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,945
We've got a guy at OPD.

78
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:28,946
I'll hook you up.

79
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:30,181
Yeah.

80
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:46,397
So, you really
think Red was in that cave.

81
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:51,002
I hope not.

82
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:37,046
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

83
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:08,977
For Catherine.

84
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,503
How'd your interview go?

85
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:14,115
I won't get it.

86
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,450
Beautiful morning.

87
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,527
Dr. Chin,

88
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,887
Detective Lise Delorme.

89
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:21,623
Cardinal.

90
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:24,859
You looked at the bugs
we found on our victim?

91
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,594
Mainly Phormia Regina.

92
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,529
A blowfly, common everywhere.

93
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:31,765
Then there was Calliphora
Vicina, which is rarer.

94
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
They mostly go places
that are shady and cool.

95
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,154
I assume that fits with the crime scene?

96
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,373
Your body also contained maggots

97
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:41,275
of Cynomoyopsis Cadavarina,

98
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,809
or the shiny bluebottle.

99
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,445
You only get that fly in the

100
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,979
advanced stages of decay.

101
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:48,248
But those were the only
three species we found.

102
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:49,315
You're surprised.

103
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:51,484
Well, normally, you'd
expect a lot more species

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,819
at an outdoor site.

105
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,254
Especially in the late stages.

106
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,556
The body was found in a-a cave.

107
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,557
Near water?

108
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:58,558
Yeah.

109
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,627
The flies didn't smell the body.

110
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:02,095
Didn't even know it was there.

111
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,297
The bugs you did find.

112
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:05,665
Can they give us time of death?

113
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,067
Yes, thanks to the bluebottle.

114
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,269
Your victim was killed approximately

115
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,503
twelve days ago.

116
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,474
Thanks.

117
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,342
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

118
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:21,346
Dave was already missing his head

119
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,815
when Red was shot.

120
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,751
So he didn't shoot her.

121
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,787
But he crossed paths with whoever did.

122
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,112
You were gone early.

123
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,980
Yeah, I went up Beaufort Hill.

124
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,917
Cops have been there.

125
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,696
Yeah, I heard.

126
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,888
They only found one body.

127
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,192
Told you that girl was still alive.

128
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,538
But you said she was dead.

129
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,529
She is, Ray.

130
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,231
She's halfway down the hillside.

131
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,898
In the trees.

132
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,502
Surprised that the, uh,

133
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,739
cops didn't find her.

134
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,375
Yeah.

135
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,211
Ah, anyways,

136
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:29,245
I buried her deep.

137
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,490
I know you've been wanting to ask.

138
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,725
Go ahead.

139
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:46,796
Jesus.

140
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,034
Must've hurt like a mother!

141
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,904
Every crack of my whip
brought me into my power.

142
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,541
You did that to yourself?

143
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,284
Discipline, Leon.

144
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,882
Mind, body and spirit.

145
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,473
We have appetites,

146
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,721
you and me.

147
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:23,399
How's her memory coming?

148
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,200
Short term's improving.

149
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,603
Nothing before her trauma.

150
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,705
Will it all come back at once?

151
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,774
Every case is unique.

152
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:34,309
Memories are stored in
many traces in the brain.

153
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,344
Some more accessible than others.

154
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,419
How ya feeling?

155
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,288
Well, someone tried to kill me.

156
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:49,123
I don't know if it was some

157
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:50,625
rando, or my boyfriend,

158
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,061
or if I even have a boyfriend.

159
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:55,935
We're working on that.

160
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:59,689
Just try to relax.

161
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:07,107
Do they think that I'm dead?

162
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,279
Or are they going to try again?

163
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:45,546
You're going in early.

164
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,548
I was trying not to wake you.

165
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,983
Birds beat you to it.

166
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,420
You need anything

167
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:56,390
for your trip?

168
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:57,831
I'm all set.

169
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:05,130
I-I'm thinking about taking
a break from therapy.

170
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:08,869
Don't look at me like that.

171
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:15,909
I mean, you've said that in the past.

172
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:17,277
God, John. Relax.

173
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,411
I'm not saying I won't go back.

174
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:19,846
Well then what's the problem, then?

175
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:20,847
Is it-

176
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:22,515
Is it Dr. Bell?

177
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,018
No. I-I feel like I'm going
over the same things,

178
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,019
again and again.

179
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:28,755
I'm-I'm so sick of hearing myself talk.

180
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,623
I just need a break.

181
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:37,630
I think it's a bad idea.

182
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:56,548
All right,

183
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,184
remember to keep your skin covered,

184
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:59,451
Black flies.

185
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:00,686
Have fun!

186
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:19,804
Hey Marci.

187
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,039
Where's Dave?

188
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,274
I don't-I don't know.

189
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:28,246
Come here!

190
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,549
Look,

191
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,084
I swear that I don't know where he is.

192
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,084
He just took off-

193
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,686
He just took off on his boat.

194
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:50,734
Tell him the Northern Raiders

195
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,202
are looking for him.

196
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,010
All right.

197
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,444
Two victims:

198
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:03,847
one dead marina owner,

199
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,916
and one living Jane Doe.

200
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,684
Are you thinking it's one case?

201
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,085
Two completely different M.O.'s.

202
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,588
Dave Elhurst stole
the make and model of gun

203
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:13,089
that put a bullet in Red.

204
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,024
And we only found him because of her.

205
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:17,260
We're still working on how and when

206
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:18,695
Red came to town.

207
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,963
Ah, there's no record of
her coming by bus or train

208
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,032
and there's no overdue rental cars.

209
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,633
We need to cast a wider net.

210
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:26,202
Gas stations between Pearson Airport

211
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:27,436
and Algonquin Bay.

212
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,205
That's a huge net.

213
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,306
Mhm.

214
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:31,340
I'll get started.

215
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,376
Where are we with Dave Elhurst?

216
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:35,211
Ah, search of his house
turned up nothing.

217
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:36,545
We don't see Marci cutting him up,

218
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,281
but we've asked her and Dave's friends

219
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:39,715
to account for their whereabouts.

220
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,116
And still no sign of his boat?

221
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:42,117
Not yet.

222
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,252
But Jerry Commanda
offered us an OPD boat.

223
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:45,788
We'll cover more territory.

224
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:47,456
What about VICLAS?

225
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,257
I searched bodies with missing parts,

226
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:50,459
plus the pictographs.

227
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:51,760
No hits.

228
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,962
But when I searched
just missing body parts,

229
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:56,175
I found a few unsolved
cases from Toronto.

230
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,067
Keep us posted.

231
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:00,068
That's it.

232
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:01,702
Let's get to work.

233
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:07,508
Dave's autopsy?

234
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,377
I'll stay on his financials.

235
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,281
Detective Delorme.

236
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,689
Marci?

237
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,260
Any preliminaries you can share?

238
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:44,044
Well, the torso's got,
uh, two puncture wounds

239
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,912
from when he was suspended in the cave.

240
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:48,782
What about these?

241
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:49,783
Ah, they're smaller,

242
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,651
about one inch in diameter.

243
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,854
Ah, the sharpened sticks
we found at the scene.

244
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:55,088
Very possibly.

245
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,858
Genitals were removed
by a serrated blade.

246
00:13:57,893 --> 00:13:59,092
Pre mortem.

247
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:01,895
Including draining the body of any blood.

248
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:07,000
Like you'd string up a deer?

249
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,868
Ideally, the deer would be dead first.

250
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:13,373
But I'll leave the metaphors
to the poets and detectives.

251
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:15,588
So why take the blood and the body parts?

252
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:27,252
♪ Little girlie,

253
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,856
where are you? ♪

254
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,070
Come on. Come on!

255
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:48,606
Anybody comes around here

256
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:49,841
asking about a little redhead girl,

257
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:51,243
you give me a call, okay?

258
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:52,544
- Okay.
- Hey.

259
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:53,978
Just me.

260
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:28,743
Sweet bike.

261
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:30,778
Yeah, I found it in the woods over there.

262
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,299
Man, we hit the jackpot.

263
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,708
I mean, free food,

264
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,217
free rent.

265
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:39,692
You know?

266
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:44,405
Ah, no thanks.

267
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,263
Shit, I forgot. My bad.

268
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,883
Hey uh,

269
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,452
they tell you anything else about

270
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,854
how it's going down later?

271
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,955
Leon doesn't tell me shit

272
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:57,956
when you're not around.

273
00:15:57,992 --> 00:15:59,825
Yeah. He's not a big talker, huh.

274
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,396
What are you gonna do with your share?

275
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,364
Head back west.

276
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,451
What like, for like for a holiday?

277
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,568
No.

278
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,043
When I was using, I uh-

279
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,678
I hurt people.

280
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,048
Boys.

281
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,055
Leon's back with pizza.

282
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,721
Sweet.

283
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,225
Come on.

284
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,460
Yeah.

285
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,497
- Hey.
- Hey.

286
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,400
I had a talk with Commanda's
Behavioural Sciences guy

287
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,901
and he feels we're dealing with

288
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,604
an Afro-Caribbean spiritual practice.

289
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,005
Voodoo or Santeria?

290
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,274
He's never seen anything like it.

291
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,828
He suggests we consult
an expert in the field.

292
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,411
Hm.

293
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,042
Well, Dave Elhurst was
in financial trouble.

294
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,316
Until about eight months ago.

295
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,251
And now he's in the black?

296
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,486
Mhm.

297
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,956
Suddenly flush.

298
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,356
Cash business.

299
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:10,526
The biker intimidating
Marci at the marina:

300
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,728
Dave was laundering money

301
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,596
for the Northern Raiders.

302
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,832
This is why NIS needs you.

303
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,945
Maybe Dave crossed paths with the bikers.

304
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:29,712
Stole his friend's gun and took off.

305
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,947
If the bikers killed Dave,

306
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,983
why is one of them looking for him?

307
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:37,252
Could be one of them went rogue,

308
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,588
killed him without the club's knowledge.

309
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,289
Or they're covering their tracks.

310
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:43,826
Maybe Dave saw something
he shouldn't have.

311
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,293
Maybe Red did too.

312
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:50,886
Dave's crime scene
doesn't feel like bikers.

313
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:52,934
Shot to the girl's head.

314
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,470
To me, that fits.

315
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:56,976
Execution-style.

316
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:00,275
Maybe we're trying to draw a line

317
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,010
where there isn't one.

318
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:03,911
Is that the biker that threatened Marci?

319
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:05,146
Mhm.

320
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,082
I know a guy at OPD.

321
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:09,684
Alan Clegg.

322
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,318
If this guy's with the Raiders,

323
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,440
he'll know him.

324
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,961
That's Bryan Giblin.

325
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:22,663
Goes by "Wombat".

326
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:24,831
He's an enforcer for the
Northern Raiders biker gang.

327
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,967
He killed those dealers
in Mattawa last year.

328
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,169
What's he doing out?

329
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:29,336
He never went in.

330
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:31,104
Scott Lasalle, who runs the Raiders,

331
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,207
made sure that one of
his low level initiates

332
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,208
took the fall.

333
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,877
He was looking for our Vic, Dave Elhurst.

334
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:38,344
Owns the marina.

335
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,113
We think Dave was laundering money

336
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,015
for the Northern Raiders.

337
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,616
I've been working the
Raiders for three years.

338
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:45,251
I never heard of the guy.

339
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:47,860
Well Mr. Elhurst

340
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:50,323
is out of the game now.

341
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:53,293
Oh Christ.

342
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,701
Does that look like
Raiders' handiwork to you?

343
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,898
Well, if he crossed Lasalle

344
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,601
I wouldn't put it past them.

345
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:12,578
Scott Lasalle?

346
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:13,579
Yeah.

347
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:15,014
We're looking for a friend of yours.

348
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,048
Bryan Giblin,

349
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:17,649
also known as Wombat.

350
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:19,651
Well I can't help you there.

351
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:20,886
But, um,

352
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:24,724
we've got a new wheat ale
on tap if you want a beer.

353
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,592
Its got a hint of honey in it.

354
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,660
He was looking for Dave Elhurst

355
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:30,529
at the marina yesterday.

356
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:32,864
Okay.

357
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,566
We want to talk to Dave
in connection with a shooting.

358
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:36,668
But somebody got to him first.

359
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:38,103
Took his head.

360
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:40,105
And other parts.

361
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,373
Am I supposed to know this Dave guy?

362
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:43,441
His profits have gone way up

363
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:46,577
since your club started
renting boats there.

364
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,613
Happy to support the local businesses.

365
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,283
We'll need your whereabouts between

366
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:54,343
May 29 and June 4.

367
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,988
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

368
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,790
If you're talk to Mr. Giblin,

369
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,459
have him call us.

370
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,410
Who took him out?

371
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,279
Not us.

372
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:24,447
I'll find 'em.

373
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:25,682
Set 'em straight.

374
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,335
We need a new cleaner.

375
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:30,654
Want me to find somebody?

376
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,159
No, you gotta be with Crowchild.

377
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:38,795
I'll talk to ya later.

378
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:14,996
Toof.

379
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,635
- Eyes open.
- Yeah.

380
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,918
Toof.

381
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,687
Stay here.

382
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:40,888
Okay.

383
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:42,557
Kevin, stay close to me.

384
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,198
Who the hell are you?

385
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,209
Okay, Leon.

386
00:22:37,244 --> 00:22:38,778
That's enough.

387
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:40,245
Tie him up.

388
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:43,215
Put the bag in the closet.

389
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,462
He's a full patch biker.

390
00:22:57,965 --> 00:23:00,565
Ah, shut up, Kevin.

391
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
They'll kill us!

392
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:03,668
They won't.

393
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:06,638
He works for us now.

394
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,174
Kevin.

395
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:19,743
Get the door.

396
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,011
Trust me.

397
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:43,098
Peter Crowchild.

398
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:45,534
I called your reservation.

399
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:46,735
I talked to your uncle,

400
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,771
Chief Northwind.

401
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:50,238
He vouched for you.

402
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,844
Bikers are your problem, not mine.

403
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,345
Like I told you,

404
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,214
you don't have to worry about them.

405
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:03,584
Leon.

406
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:50,464
Hm.

407
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,058
It's about eighty percent purity.

408
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:55,301
Good doing business with you.

409
00:25:11,452 --> 00:25:12,852
This is crazy.

410
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:14,787
Ray knows what he's doing.

411
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:15,988
I'm not saying he doesn't

412
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:17,823
but I didn't know we were going
to be ripping off bikers!

413
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,024
Just think about how much dough

414
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,025
we're going to have, Kev.

415
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,494
Like, starting tomorrow.

416
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,463
What you boys talking about?

417
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:28,967
The future.

418
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:42,814
Take him to the shed and hang him up.

419
00:25:43,317 --> 00:25:44,516
Okay.

420
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:45,617
Let's go, boys.

421
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:47,052
Get the wheelbarrow.

422
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:56,561
Amazing.

423
00:25:57,564 --> 00:25:58,763
Thanks.

424
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,929
John, if you're going to ask if I'm-

425
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:07,187
I'm not.

426
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:11,708
I'm not.

427
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:17,548
I booked an appointment with Dr. Bell

428
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,102
after I get back.

429
00:26:33,365 --> 00:26:34,498
Hey.

430
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:35,499
Yeah?

431
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,568
No sign of Dave's boat.

432
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:39,902
We checked every dock and
boathouse on Trout Lake.

433
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:41,537
Let me see if I can get the bird up,

434
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:42,772
do a fly over.

435
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,041
Yeah. I appreciate the help.

436
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,910
So how's it going in here?

437
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,048
Rachel is losing focus.

438
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,150
Yeah, saw that coming.

439
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:58,554
Thought these kids weren't your thing.

440
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:28,783
Mmm, everybody enjoy their dinner?

441
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:29,784
Yeah, it was amazing, man.

442
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,153
You could be on, like, Iron Chef.

443
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:37,125
So-

444
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,760
Bet you boys want to know the plan, huh?

445
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:40,194
- Hell, yeah!
- Okay.

446
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:46,967
First off,

447
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:48,836
Leon pass this around,

448
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:50,804
stop using your old phones. Okay?

449
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,071
Just use these burner
phones that I got you.

450
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,012
Most of our product will be
reinvested into expansion.

451
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,280
Think of it as seed money

452
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:01,148
to grow our sales territory.

453
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:05,352
You know, I like to say

454
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:07,387
that there are three kinds of people.

455
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:10,024
Those who see.

456
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Those who see when they are shown,

457
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:17,130
and those who do not see.

458
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,366
Machiavelli.

459
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:25,738
I-I was, uh, an Arts major before.

460
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:32,812
Woo-ooh.

461
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:41,688
So, all you boys are gonna
need some cash up front, right?

462
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,723
So each one of you will
be given a small portion

463
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:45,491
of our product to sell

464
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:47,159
just for yourselves.

465
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:48,895
Whatever profits you make

466
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,696
is yours to keep. Good deal?

467
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:51,697
Yeah.

468
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,566
Yeah, it sounds awesome, man.

469
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,348
You'll never have to
worry about money again.

470
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:59,179
As long as you follow my three rules.

471
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:01,507
Number one:

472
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:05,685
keep your mouth shut about our plans.

473
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:07,412
Number two:

474
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,514
Never lose control.

475
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:12,255
And number three:

476
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,846
No one at this table

477
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:15,987
uses our product.

478
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,288
Ever.

479
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,759
Break any of my rules

480
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,496
and I kill you.

481
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,871
So-

482
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,108
Who's ready for dessert?

483
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,047
I am.

484
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,516
Yeah. Let's make some money.

485
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,698
Pretty quiet during dinner.

486
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:03,699
You okay?

487
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:04,733
Yeah.

488
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:06,135
Yeah.

489
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,604
Ray's something else, huh?

490
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,972
Told you I'd hook you up.

491
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:15,863
Hey, Leon, uh-

492
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:19,754
Isn't Ray worried about the bikers?

493
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:24,720
Ray doesn't worry.

494
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:26,588
Okay, yeah, I-I know, but-

495
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:29,224
It seems like the wrong
guys to be messing with.

496
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:30,392
I mean, if they catch us dealing-

497
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,626
Okay, look.

498
00:30:32,348 --> 00:30:34,882
Ray is protected.

499
00:30:34,952 --> 00:30:36,384
So we are, too.

500
00:30:37,173 --> 00:30:40,074
And I know that you don't
believe all the spirit stuff.

501
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:42,599
But I swear to God,

502
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:44,868
he knows things,

503
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,370
things that he can't.

504
00:30:48,378 --> 00:30:51,145
It's gonna be all good, Kev.

505
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:53,181
I wouldn't have brought
you guys in otherwise.

506
00:30:58,487 --> 00:30:59,687
We cool?

507
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:02,990
Yeah, man.

508
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:05,224
We're cool.

509
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:06,448
Good.

510
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,066
How long do you think you'll be here?

511
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,837
I don't have anywhere to go.

512
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:20,445
Least you got a hot guy checking on you.

513
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:24,010
Code Blue. Second Floor.

514
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:27,714
Room 237. Bed Two. Code Blue.

515
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:47,031
I'll come visit you soon,

516
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:48,465
but it might be on the weekend.

517
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,969
Yeah, I'll bring you some real food.

518
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:55,072
Yeah, you must be getting
tired of that hospital crap.

519
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:56,306
Okay. Love you.

520
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:59,025
So I hear that you're not
losing your partner after all.

521
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:01,244
NIS.

522
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,679
Delorme didn't get it.

523
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:07,917
I don't know who she
pissed off at the RCMP.

524
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,590
Delorme,

525
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,459
OPD busted a Raiders
pick-up point last night.

526
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:17,994
House was rented online.

527
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:19,596
Clegg says that a few months back

528
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:20,597
they busted another house

529
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:22,298
that was rented through the same site.

530
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,532
Same renter?

531
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:25,534
You tell me.

532
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,126
Time.

533
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:53,629
Hey.

534
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,867
Are ya up for a round?

535
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:00,736
I'll go easy on you.

536
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,771
I don't want you to go easy.

537
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:05,640
Okay. Let's get out of here.

538
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,345
My mom.

539
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,779
I gotta go.

540
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:13,014
- Now?
- Sorry.

541
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:15,617
Maybe your battery died.

542
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:16,851
Maybe she never got her text.

543
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:18,319
That would only make things worse.

544
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:19,754
I'll call you tonight.

545
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:22,156
Yeah.

546
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:44,044
Hey!

547
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:46,739
Are you okay?

548
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:50,584
Yeah.

549
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:53,452
Ah, I couldn't-

550
00:33:54,022 --> 00:33:55,421
I couldn't sleep.

551
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:58,704
Are you getting your memory back?

552
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:00,927
No.

553
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:09,235
Hey.

554
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:11,136
It's me again, uh,

555
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,537
just was thinking about you

556
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,443
about how we-

557
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
we both said some
things that we didn't mean.

558
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:26,798
I don't want things to be bad between us.

559
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:28,721
So just-

560
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:31,616
call me back.

561
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,299
Great. Thank you.

562
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,036
Both the Raiders' houses
had fake renters.

563
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,304
But the fakes

564
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,072
used the same online payment system,

565
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:49,874
linked to the same credit card.

566
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,909
That account rent any other properties?

567
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:53,878
Different house,

568
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:54,879
same account.

569
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:56,314
On the lake.

570
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:58,616
Worth a shot.

571
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:58,741
Shit.

572
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,958
Whose blood was on that floor?

573
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:00,930
Was it Wombat's?

574
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:06,770
Does somebody out there have a beef

575
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:08,438
with the Northern Raiders?

576
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,746
What were you doing in the house?

577
00:37:24,288 --> 00:37:26,802
Did your ex Zackary take you there?

578
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:33,195
The biker you said you
left six months ago.

579
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:41,437
You told me you'd been clean.

580
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,740
Is that a lie too?

581
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:51,044
I want to talk to Alan Clegg.

582
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:06,728
She's Clegg's C.I.?

583
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,132
I knew she was arrested on drug charges

584
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,367
six months ago.

585
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:15,769
I guess she avoided jail time

586
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:18,112
by agreeing to inform on the Raiders.

587
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,642
Rock and a hard place.

588
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,064
Go ahead, Rachel.

589
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:47,967
We were supposed to check on Wombat.

590
00:38:48,003 --> 00:38:49,836
He wasn't answering his phone.

591
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:53,440
Lasalle.

592
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,177
Wombat was supposed to get
his shipment yesterday.

593
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,645
When we got there, the place was empty.

594
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,988
No cash. No drugs.

595
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,716
Lasalle thinks Wombat ripped him off?

596
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:04,717
No.

597
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:07,420
They came up together.
They're like brothers.

598
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:09,255
So if Lasalle thinks it's Wombat's blood.

599
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,924
Who does he blame?

600
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,191
He didn't tell us.

601
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:14,827
Somebody moving in on the Raiders?

602
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:16,228
A rival club?

603
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:17,463
I don't know.

604
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:20,433
But Lasalle is freaking out.

605
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,879
You don't have to keep doing this.

606
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:41,053
Clegg will charge me for the drug thing.

607
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,287
I'll go to jail.

608
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,023
We can get you a good lawyer.

609
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:47,459
My parents would find out.

610
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:50,328
Is that worse than
going back with the bikers?

611
00:39:58,305 --> 00:39:59,737
I want to help you.

612
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,046
You can't.

about Raymond?

168
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,907
You don't forget a kid like that.

169
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,406
Extremely bright.

170
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,075
Obsessed with death and religion,

171
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,144
<i>anything to do with the afterlife.</i>

172
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,915
<i>At first, I encouraged his curiosity,</i>

173
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,583
it was good to see a kid reading a book.

174
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:42,918
But then

175
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:47,052
he asked me if I'd ever
seen the inside of a cat.

176
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,925
<i>And he went into graphic detail,</i>

177
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,994
how Leonardo da Vinci found god

178
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,462
inside corpses.

179
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,933
And the look in his eye.

180
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:01,936
Did you ever see him hurt an animal?

181
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,938
SANDRA: <i>Catch him in the act? No. But,</i>

182
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:04,939
around that time,

183
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,974
animals were going missing.

184
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,475
And after Raymond left-

185
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:10,611
it stopped.

186
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:11,946
Where did he go?

187
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,448
Florida, I heard.

188
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,115
But he'd aged out of the system,

189
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,650
so we didn't keep tabs.

190
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:20,820
Do you remember an Aaron Osborne?

191
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:22,622
He went to school with Raymond.

192
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:24,657
The kid he bashed with the shovel.

193
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:26,459
Yeah. What happened?

194
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:29,219
SANDRA: <i>Aaron called
his mother a biker slut.</i>

195
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,998
She was associated with bikers?

196
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:33,999
Mhm.

197
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,467
For years.

198
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:37,502
They passed her around 'til
there was nothing left.

199
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:42,641
DELORME: <i>Ray was 11 when
he hit Aaron Osborne</i>

200
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:43,809
with a shovel.

201
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,644
Then he found him again in Toronto,

202
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,878
20 years later.

203
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,313
Hell of a grudge.

204
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:50,444
Sensitive about his mom.

205
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,151
Maybe that's why he
targeted the Northern Raiders.

206
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,352
Payback.

207
00:09:57,356 --> 00:10:00,992
So, he's fascinated with
death and immortality

208
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:01,993
and then he-

209
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:04,161
he finds Palo Mayombe.

210
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:06,663
It would give a kid like
him a sense of control

211
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,665
over the chaos in his life.

212
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,199
He learns the basics in Sudbury,

213
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,502
and then he goes to
Florida to learn more.

214
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:13,503
That makes sense.

215
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,006
There's a Palo Mayombe community there.

216
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,309

223

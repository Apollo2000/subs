1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,893
Previously on "Cardinal".

2
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:02,961
What did you see?

3
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:03,995
A white guy

4
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:05,096
with blonde hair.

5
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:06,730
You saw Terri get on the bus, right?

6
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,565
I dropped her at the station.

7
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,901
But my prints are all
over that kilo of coke.

8
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:12,302
Make the fingerprints disappear,

9
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:13,904
and I'll tell you what I got on Cardinal.

10
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,238
We have confirmation.

11
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:18,075
A rival moving in on the
Northern Raiders drug trade.

12
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,409
I didn't know he was a dealer.

13
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,410
Is there anything at all

14
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:22,012
that you can tell us about him?

15
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:24,113
He had like this crazy tooth.

16
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,015
The Northern Raiders don't
own this town anymore.

17
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,050
Toof.

18
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,785
Keep your mouth shut about our plans.

19
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,787
No!

20
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,121
Never lose control.

21
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:35,925
No one uses our product.

22
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,161
Break any of my rules and I kill ya.

23
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:39,861
You left your meds at home.

24
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:41,296
Please, step back from the edge.

25
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,497
I'm working.

26
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:43,999
Jesus, John.

27
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:45,466
Go home!

28
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:11,948
♪ you and I

29
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:19,622

32
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:28,654
What have we got?

33
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,455
Vic's been dead between twelve

34
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,456
and twenty-four hours.

35
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:32,457
Cause of death,

36
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:34,159
either blunt force
trauma or gunshot wound.

37
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,194
You'll understand when you see the body.

38
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:41,121
This must be the kill site.

39
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,939
You get a match on that

40
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:50,341
and you call me right away.

41
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:51,575
Hey.

42
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,543
When did you get back?

43
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,619
Last night.

44
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,115
Call Ballistics, Ash.

45
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,017
Give them a heads up we
got something coming in.

46
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:01,886
I want a quick turnaround on this.

47
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,702
Hey guys,

48
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:20,936
check this out.

49
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:23,372
Can I tell you how good I am?

50
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:24,639
Maggot casing?

51
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:25,874
Irrefutably.

52
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:28,076
What's so exciting?

53
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:29,844
The distance from the flesh.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,914
Maggots will eventually
fall off a dead body.

55
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:32,915
But this little guy

56
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,317
was eight feet from the corpse.

57
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:36,851
Right inside a footprint.

58
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,986
Looks like a work boot.

59
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:41,155
Like the one Terri saw at the cave maybe.

60
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,390
Size 10, I'd wager.

61
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:46,227
Yeah, but why would a guy
have a maggot casing

62
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:47,228
on his boot?

63
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:48,429
My question exactly,

64
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,097
which is why I'm taking this

65
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,565
to the master of entomology.

66
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,734
Chin.

67
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,001
He'll be ecstatic.

68
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,212
The guy has an extra incisor.

69
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:10,050
Rachel Wells bought heroin from a dealer

70
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:11,284
with a tooth like that.

71
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:13,419
She OD'd.

72
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,829
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,462
No one stood up for her.

74
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,830
You did.

75
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:26,285
It wasn't enough.

76
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,633
Jordan, her boyfriend, said
that she bought the drugs

77
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,356
at the Corner Pocket.

78
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,804
From a guy who had a,

79
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:36,274
what do you call it,

80
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:37,508
a snaggletooth?

81
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,712
So maybe he's one of the new dealers

82
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:43,314
trying to cut out the bikers.

83
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,949
Lasalle's boys find him,

84
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,816
beat some Intel out of him.

85
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:47,817
Shoot him.

86
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,286
Or the other way around.

87
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,622
You knock somebody out
and then shoot him,

88
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,091
that's one kind of person.

89
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:56,793
You put two bullets in their brain

90
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,462
and then bash their head in,

91
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,264
what does that make you?

92
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,665
Sadistic.

93
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,303
Or maybe the owner of defective bullets.

94
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,306
I'm betting on both.

95
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:19,882
Thought you'd be happy.

96
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,752
I got no complaints with you

97
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,287
putting Lasalle out of business.

98
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:29,457
Hey, did it together, Alan.

99
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:30,691
No.

100
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,738
A couple bikers get
roughed up in a turf war,

101
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,840
nobody looks too closely at that.

102
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,381
But the mutilation,

103
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:40,709
the sacrifice,

104
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:43,779
I can't be part of that, Ray.

105
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,216
You're a big part of it.

106
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:51,988
You've earned this.

107
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:58,493
It's just the beginning.

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,472
You know what, you keep it.

109
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:06,801
I'm out.

110
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:08,603
There is no out. Take it or leave it.

111
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,072
I held up my end of the deal.

112
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:12,999
You work for me now, Alan.

113
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,844
Alive or dead.

114
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,098
It's your choice.

115
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,021
So,

116
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,289
what do ya got for me?

117
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:37,816
Cops found, uh, your friend Toof

118
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,533
with his head caved in.

119
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,768
What else?

120
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,108
Been looking for Leon's truck.

121
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,648
What about the redhead?

122
00:07:57,718 --> 00:07:58,950
Terri Tait?

123
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:03,687
So you did shoot her.

124
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:06,891
The hell'd you do that for?

125
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:09,727
She had nothing to do with Lasalle.

126
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:11,695
Where is she?

127
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:18,469
She's in protective custody.

128
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:22,205
I don't even know where.

129
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:27,511
Find her.

130
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,186
So, Jordan gave us a description

131
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,020
of Rachel Wells's dealer.

132
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,222
I followed up at the Corner Pocket,

133
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,894
one of the regulars ID'd him as "Toof".

134
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,930
Sergeant?

135
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,533
Who is this?

136
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:47,701
Our shooting Vic.

137
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,836
There's only one "Toof"
alias in Northern Ontario,

138
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,070
Morris Tilley.

139
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,306
Local. Low level pot dealer.

140
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,674
Is he connected with
the Northern Raiders?

141
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,843
Ah, Clegg says no.

142
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:59,411
But we do think he's connected
to a drug operation

143
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:01,543
who are taking over from the bikers.

144
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,632
We're still digging.

145
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,301
Sounds promising.

146
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:33,494
Morris is a good boy,

147
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,664
you know, maybe too
fond of that marijuana.

148
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,915
I-I-I tell him all the time to lay off.

149
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,918
Always puts you in a fog.

150
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:48,208
Mrs. Tilley.

151
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,111
I'm sorry but your son is dead.

152
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:55,248
We found him this morning

153
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,749
on the edge of the forest,

154
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:58,725
just off the 17.

155
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:01,987
What?

156
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:03,955
No.

157
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,399
No, he's not.

158
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:08,494
He was just here

159
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:09,495
the other day

160
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,571
wolfing down a sandwich.

161
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,065
No, your son was murdered.

162
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:18,995
He's a sweet boy.

163
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:21,839
He never hurt anybody.

164
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,109
Could you tell us about

165
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:28,779
anyone he was friends with,

166
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,814
um might have been hanging around with.

167
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,683
I don't know.

168
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,387
Ah, he moved out two months ago.

169
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,921
Was he living with anyone?

170
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:42,359
Um...

171
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:46,481
Leon ah-ah-ah something.

172
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,531
And uh-

173
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,667
a native friend.

174
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,870
A fancy name.

175
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,993
Uh, Toof said he was psychic.

176
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,043
Um-

177
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,579
Northwind.

178
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,882
Yeah, that was it.

179
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,889
Do you have family or friends nearby?

180
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,129
You shouldn't be alone right now.

181
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,472
Is-is Terri there?

182
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:34,908
Terri Tait.

183
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,610
She works there.

184
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,844
I'm her brother.

185
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,079
Yeah.

186
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,550
The-

187
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:47,250
The-the cops said what?

188
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:50,690
No. No, thank you.

189
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,024
That's fine.

190
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,226
Thank you.

191
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,490
Give me a sec.

192
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:29,560
Well I'd offer you a beer

193
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:31,427
but uh, you probably shouldn't drink.

194
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:34,063
You're sending your boys to the rez

195
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:35,498
looking for drug dealers.

196
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,401
Tell me what you know about the guys

197
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,035
moving in on your territory.

198
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:43,205
I don't know what you're talking about.

199
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,517
You think they're Native.

200
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:48,477
Why?

201
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,944
I know how close you and Wombat were.

202
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:02,491
They cut off your
brother's head off, man.

203
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:07,828
So tell me what you know.

204
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:10,337
And then what?

205
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,367
We can offer you protection.

206
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:15,296
Before this escalates.

207
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,302
I'm sorry, man, I can't help you.

208
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,070
Fine.

209
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:26,746
The offer remains.

210
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,648
In the meantime,

211
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,651
you set one more foot on my rez,

212
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,606
I'm coming for ya.

213
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:51,903
I can now link your first body

214
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:54,239
to your second body through DNA results.

215
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:56,140
But we didn't give you DNA.

216
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:58,175
Abby Harris gave me a maggot casing.

217
00:14:58,211 --> 00:14:59,910
We have the same DNA at both sites.

218
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,045
Whose DNA?

219
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,447
The fly's.

220
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:04,349
So the same species of
fly can be found at both sites.

221
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:05,350
No.

222
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:07,652
The DNA of the same individual fly.

223
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,654
The maggot that came out of this casing,

224
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,522
found in the footprint at
the second murder site,

225
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,657
has the same mother as
dozens of other eggs

226
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,225
found at the first site.

227
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,160
Chin's evidence
confirms that Toof's killer

228
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:18,729
was also at the waterfall.

229
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,196
We're waiting on ballistics,

230
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:21,732
but I'm betting the
bullets in Toof's brain

231
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,066
match the one in Terri's.

232
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:24,501
So you got one guy shooting people

233
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:25,769
and dumping the bodies.

234
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:27,604
And another guy who's
chopping up his vics

235
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,205
to gain spiritual power.

236
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,205
At least two.

237
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:31,841
Working together.

238
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,709
And the ritualistic one

239
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,679
likes to make his sacrifices
under a new moon.

240
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:37,747
Sacrifices?

241
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,749
That's definitely not part
of any Native ceremony

242
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:40,983
that I know of.

243
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,085
Any suspects?

244
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,855
Toof's mom said he
was staying with a "Leon"

245
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,855
and a,

246
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,723
a Native guy named "Northwind".

247
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,291
Doesn't ring any bells.

248
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,852
Northwind is a big name
on the Moose Bay rez.

249
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:55,530
We think that the
heroin's being shipped up

250
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:56,931
from a rez in Michigan, right?

251
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:00,101
Yeah.

252
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:03,704
This could be a brotherhood thing.

253
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:06,540
Native dealer wants to do
business with his own people.

254
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,275
So he gets rid of the white guy.

255
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,144
Could be how
Northwind cuts out the bikers.

256
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,313
We have two days until the new moon.

257
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,283
We have to find Leon and
Northwind before then.

258
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,318
It's been a while since
I've been to Moose Bay.

259
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:21,521
Hey.

260
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:22,955
Hm?

261
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,343
I heard about Rachel.

262
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:28,994
I should've pulled her out sooner.

263
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,332
Yeah.

264
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:00,431
You're lucky.

265
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:03,067
The drugs were incinerated.

266
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,702
Only thing left was a

267
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:07,538
fingerprint card and a

268
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,973
photo of the prints.

269
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:13,276
So.

270
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,770
You had something to tell me.

271
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,882
Yeah.

272
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,427
I have a friend

273
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:32,894
works in lock-up.

274
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:38,633
She says you signed out
a box of cold case files

275
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:39,634
but failed to mention

276
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,670
you'd hidden another case inside of it.

277
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:46,240
Things get misfiled all the time.

278
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,442
You lied.

279
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:48,676
You stole evidence.

280
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,412
And you're on tape.

281
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:57,418
You are exactly

282
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,754
what I thought you were.

283
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:04,491
Lise Delorme is an
excellent investigator.

284
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:06,360
NIS will be happy to have her.

285
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:07,760
She was good.

286
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,098
I'm sorry I put her in your path.

287
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,133
They make their decision
today, don't they?

288
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,349
Chief Northwind?

289
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:33,252
That's me.

290
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:35,953
Jerry Commanda.

291
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,056
Ndishnikaaz.

292
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,724
Aaniishna Nishkaa?

293
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,193
You're OPD.

294
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:43,995
Out of Algonquin Bay.

295
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,071
I'm trying to locate a man
by the name of Northwind.

296
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:51,906
But I don't know his first name.

297
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,408
And we think he's taken
over the heroin trade

298
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:55,843
in Algonquin Bay.

299
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:58,745
Northwinds are good people.

300
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,980
Traditional.

301
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:05,586
You ever heard of uh-

302
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,923
the Northern Raiders?

303
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,162
You see, a few days ago

304
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,697
we found the severed head of one them

305
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,892
in some drug dealer's house.

306
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,812
We think that Northwind has
something to do with it.

307
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,338
Without a first name,

308
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,192
I really can't help you.

309
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,944
Respectfully, I think you can.

310
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:34,115
I got nothing to say.

311
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,709
Did he threaten you?

312
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:57,721
Yesterday I took the body
of a girl to the morgue.

313
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,837
She overdosed on heroin

314
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:03,310
probably sold to her from this guy.

315
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:10,609
He's killing children.

316
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:17,253
All I need is his name.

317
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:25,627
Ray.

318
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,063
Ray Northwind.

319
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,133
He's not one of us.

320
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:35,236
Where's he from?

321
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,721
The guy just turned up here one day,

322
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,842
he showed me his status card.

323
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:44,685
Wanted me to say that I was his uncle.

324
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:48,883
Said some Peter Crowchild was gonna call,

325
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,185
Chippewa from Iron River.

326
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:55,029
I had to say that he was
born and raised here.

327
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,090
What did you say?

328
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:58,858
What do you think?

329
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,093
Kicked him out.

330
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:04,413
The next day,

331
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:07,180
I wake up.

332
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:10,495
There was this sound at the door.

333
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:14,974
You ever hear the sound a dog makes

334
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:17,051
with his paws cut off?

335
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,891
My grandkids over there.

336
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,395
He knew their names.

337
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,489
Ah-

338
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,959
I'm looking for John Cardinal.

339
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,394
Ah, he's not here.

340
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:16,443
You must be Catherine.

341
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:19,534
How do you know John?

342
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:20,802
I'm Tammy.

343
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,364
Lidstrom.

344
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,870
I used to go out with Kyle Corbett.

345
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,346
Ah-

346
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:33,680
Can-can you just-

347
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,516
Can you give this to John?

348
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:37,423
Tell him I can't take it.

349
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,760
You look like you could use a cup of tea.

350
00:22:57,372 --> 00:23:00,904
I burned through the
last of the money John gave me.

351
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:06,146
And I didn't know what
I was going to do and,

352
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:07,379
then he called.

353
00:23:08,382 --> 00:23:09,981
Said his partner

354
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:12,583
was paying the price for what he did.

355
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:14,986
Lise Delorme?

356
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:18,157
Yeah, she was investigating him.

357
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:20,225
Thought he was dirty.

358
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:23,010
When he was covering up
for your phone call.

359
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:26,164
I know he felt responsible
for that officer's death,

360
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:30,768
but all he ever wanted
was to protect you.

361
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:33,103
And I used that.

362
00:23:35,608 --> 00:23:37,691
I don't want to be that person anymore.

363
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:52,116
(Ethereal Instrumental

364
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:15,105
Anything biting?

365
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:17,507
I'm parking the truck for now.

366
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:20,876
You gave me that truck.

367
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:22,111
It's mine.

368
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,079
I said, I'm parking it.

369
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:28,383
Take the other car, go into town,

370
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:29,827
wait for my call.

371
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:31,954
I'll have an address for you.

372
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,250
Have faith, Leon.

373
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,706
Even when you think you've messed up,

374
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,898
you find out it's all
part of a bigger plan.

375
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,372
Leon Rutkowski.

376
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,108
Did eight years for running
heroin and aggravated assault.

377
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:55,375
In Collins Bay.

378
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,378
His time overlapped Kevin Tait's.

379
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:02,415
How many Leons in Algonquin Bay with both

380
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,685
assault and drug charges on their record?

381
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,186
He's the only one.

382
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:08,055
Don't suppose he owns a black truck?

383
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,659
No vehicles registered under his name.

384
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:12,692
Let's get a BOLO out.

385
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:14,121
Leon Rutkowski.

386
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:16,528
- Delorme.
- Mhm?

387
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:18,197
I just got off the phone with NIS.

388
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:20,794
They want you in Ottawa next month.

389
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:22,301
I got it?

390
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,435
Apparently somebody over there

391
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,704
changed their mind.

392
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:25,938
Congratulations.

393
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:35,637
Okay. Thanks.

394
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:36,871
You're welcome.

395
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:15,240
Commanda got a hit on Northwind.

396
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:16,508
First name, Ray.

397
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:20,705
Yeah.

398
00:27:22,783 --> 00:27:24,016
John.

399
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:31,956
I need to know.

400
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,513
What did you do to make
Musgrave back off?

401
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,764
You got it.

402
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,233
That's all that matters.

403
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:45,457
- Yeah.
- All right.

404
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:46,536
Listen,

405
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:49,605
you were right about Wasserstein.

406
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:51,708
We could've Skyped.

407
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:53,576
I went to Toronto to find Catherine.

408
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:58,740
Was she?

409
00:27:58,775 --> 00:27:59,816
It was a mistake.

410
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,558
Things shouldn't be hard for you

411
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:12,294
because of-

412
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,562
because of this.

413
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:16,232
It's too late for that.

414
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,880
That's him.

415
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:34,949
He dumped me in the cave.

416
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:39,419
Leon Rutkowski?

417
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,454
Or the name Ray Northwind?

418
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,657
I don't think so.

419
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,693
Does he have Kevin?

420
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,262
Do you know where he is?

421
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:51,431
That's what we're trying to find out.

422
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:13,684
Oh.

423
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:30,957
Oh.

424
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,368
Yo. Jesus Christ. Dude!

425
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:43,602
Hey.

426
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:45,471
What happened to you?

427
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,739
Nothing man.

428
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,241
I went for a hike.

429
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,245
Dude, your face.

430
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,782
Oh, ah-

431
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:00,952
I fell off a rock.

432
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:02,421
I guess I hit my head.

433
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:03,655
Hm.

434
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:07,426
Where you been, you been selling?

435
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,761
I just had some stuff to do in town.

436
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,128
Oh nice.

437
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:13,397
You uh, you got any extra stash?

438
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,565
I got some guys interested and I'm-

439
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,144
I'm running low.

440
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:22,973
You better not be using again, Kev.

441
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:24,308
No, no.

442
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:25,609
I'm not.

443
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:26,810
I swear.

444
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,010
It's just-

445
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:29,845
business is booming

446
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:31,159
and I'm all out.

447
00:33:32,255 --> 00:33:33,455
Go talk to Ray.

448
00:33:34,425 --> 00:33:35,624
Okay.

449
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,456
Aw man,

450
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:40,890
he got rid of my truck?

451
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:43,912
Guess so.

452
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:46,195
Alright,

453
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,963
go get some ice for your head,

454
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,264
you look like shit.

455
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,133
Ha. Sure. Okay.

456
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:05,625
Online shopping?

457
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,529
What's up, Jerry?

458
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:12,320
This guy calling himself Ray Northwind,

459
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:13,993
posing as Anishnaabe.

460
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:15,823
Wait, wait.

461
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:17,057
He's not from Moose Bay?

462
00:34:17,093 --> 00:34:19,726
He's not from anywhere I can find.

463
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:21,161
I think he's pretending to be Indian

464
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:24,030
to get a deal from the
supplier down in Michigan.

465
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:25,451
Who's that?

466
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,257
Peter Crowchild.

467
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:29,175
Iron River Rez.

468
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,250
That's good work.

469
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,841
You know, I'm thinking that

470
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:41,380
Crowchild is flying the
heroin across Lake Huron,

471
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,849
up the French River to Lake Nipissing,

472
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:45,917
where he does the hand-off to uh,

473
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,719
"Ray Northwind".

474
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,222
Keeps the shipments out
of federal jurisdiction,

475
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:52,090
both sides of the border.

476
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:54,725
Does Cardinal have any leads

477
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,194
on Northwind's real identity?

478
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,629
He's working on it.

479
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,950
Cath?

480
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:58,286
Hi.

481
00:35:58,529 --> 00:35:59,728
You're back.

482
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:03,895
I'm making stir fry.

483
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,279
Did you hit traffic on the way?

484
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,103
No.

485
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,975
I saw your medicines

486
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,111
in the cabinet and I thought

487
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:26,546
you had stopped taking them.

488
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:34,753
You embarrassed me in
front of my students.

489
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:36,344
What was I to do?

490
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,257
You wouldn't answer your phone.

491
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,491
I was working.

492
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:45,631
I have to be able to reach you.

493
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,632
If something were to happen-

494
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,700
I'm fine.

495
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:50,984
Why can't you see that?

496
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:55,172
The signs-

497
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,540
The signs were there-

498
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:58,574
Because you were looking for them.

499
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,165
You wanted to protect me.

500
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:08,918
And I'm grateful for that.

501
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:12,255
But where's the freedom-

502
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:15,325
For either of us?

503
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:33,691
How's Lise doing?

504
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:37,601
Delorme?

505
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:41,831
NIS wants her in Ottawa next month.

506
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:43,327
Special training.

507
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,718
She'll be hard to replace.

508
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:03,222
This is one of the good times.

509
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,489
There are so few.

510
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:11,327
And we both know, they never last.

511
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,131
Cardinal.

512
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,404
Send me the coordinates.

513
00:38:58,439 --> 00:38:59,739
I'm on my way.

514
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,454
Anybody in the truck?

515
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,522
No.

516
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:18,956
The car's registered to Raymond Bedford.

517
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:20,625
Delorme's running his details.

518
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:22,058
Good job spotting it.

519
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,734
Anything yet?

520
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:34,171
The connection's bad out here.

521
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,039
I'm sure NIS will be better equipped.

522
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,377
You should have stayed out of it.

523
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,245
And let you take the hit.

524
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,281
It was my choice.

525
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,850
I won't be the one holding you back.

526
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:52,508
Here he is.

527
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,627
Raymond Bedford.

528
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,227
Ray Northwind.

529
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,433
There's drug paraphernalia in the truck.

530
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,554
Traces of heroin.

531
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:31,715
Rules, Kevin.

532
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:42,925
Maybe your brother thinks you're dead.

533
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,461
I mean, it's weird that he
hasn't checked the hospitals

534
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:47,129
or called the cops, right?

535
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:49,632
Maybe he can't.

536
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,470
Fire!

537
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:56,671
Everyone out now.

538
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:57,672
Leave your stuff.

539
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:58,907
Come on!

540
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,777
Naz. Come on!

541
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,813
Come on. We'll be fine. Come on.

542
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,832
Stay with me, you'll be okay.

543
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:36,208
Shut up!

544
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:37,443
Shut up!

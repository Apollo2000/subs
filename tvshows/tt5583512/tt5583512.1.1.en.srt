1
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:14,622
You're not answering your phone.

2
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,623
It's off.

3
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,024
Were you sleeping?

4
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:18,659
No.

5
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:19,902
Dyson sent me.

6
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:22,387
They found a body.

7
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:26,090
Where's McLeod?

8
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,864
<i>No, she doesn't want McLeod.</i>

9
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:29,904
She wants you.

10
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,029
Look at this, Delorme.

11
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:34,375
A young couple gets a new TV set.

12
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,477
<i>You'd think it'd be a happy day.</i>

13
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:39,347
<i>These two hate each other right now.</i>

14
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,381
Cardinal.

15
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:44,151
It's not my department anymore.

16
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:52,883
It's a child.

17
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,227
<i>They think it might be her.</i>

18
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:26,460
<i>I thought you were in exile.</i>

19
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,495
<i>So did I.</i>

20
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:29,797
<i>You got the call on this?</i>

21
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,933
<i>Yeah. First on
the scene was one of ours.</i>

22
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:34,135
<i>Gentlemen, who's been inside?</i>

23
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,369
<i>Collier and our civilian.</i>

24
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:36,804
<i>The guy was here stripping wire.</i>

25
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,906
I took a look inside too, sir.

26
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:40,808
I thought I'd get a little jump on things.

27
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:41,842
Okay.

28
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:43,945
All right.

29
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,713
<i>Gentlemen, suit up. In you go.</i>

30
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,214
<i>Let me know what you need.</i>

31
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:48,449
<i>Fox, come here.</i>

32
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:49,350
<i>Yeah.</i>

33
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,419
There's a lot of snow to cull here.

34
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,659
We're gonna need tents,
generators, the whole circus.

35
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:55,214
I mean, I can put in the call if you like.

36
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,325
Constable, I'm gonna need your boots.

37
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,130
- My boots?
- And then I want you to go home.

38
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,412
You're dismissed.

39
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,897
Sir.

40
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,498
<i>You have kids? Pets?</i>

41
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,133
Carpet in your TV room?

42
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:08,102
I have... two kids.

43
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:10,568
Their DNA is now
contaminating the crime scene,

44
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,792
the unprocessed crime scene

45
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,696
- that you chose to enter.
- Sir, I swear, I...

46
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,111
Let me tell you something.

47
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:19,042
If one day we're lucky
enough to get this guy,

48
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,482
I can't have you serving up freebies

49
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,284
<i>to his defence attorney.</i>

50
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:24,318
So...

51
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:27,438
off they come.

52
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,589
<i>Facial
features partially obliterated,</i>

53
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,204
<i>and likely by animal interference.</i>

54
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:45,006
<i>Left eye missing.</i>

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,448
<i>Right eye damaged but intact.</i>

56
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:50,011
<i>Body is clothed.</i>

57
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:53,314
<i>Denim jeans cover the lower portion.</i>

58
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:55,516
<i>Torn away at the left leg.</i>

59
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,637
<i>There's a spot up top</i>

60
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,729
<i>where it looks like water collects.</i>

61
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:01,817
<i>I bet she's resting on a drain.</i>

62
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:04,205
<i>Partially
detached from her skull.</i>

63
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:06,453
Filled up around her.

64
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,329
Froze solid.

65
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,132
<i>It's her.</i>

66
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:17,204
You're sure?

67
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:18,802
Blue hoodie.

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,881
She was wearing it when she disappeared.

69
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:23,051
<i>Okay. Well, let's do this then.</i>

70
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:24,563
Let's have our moment.

71
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,712
<i>I'm serious, John.</i>

72
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:27,903
<i>If you want to say I told you so,</i>

73
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,050
now's your chance.

74
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:30,555
I don't have anything to say.

75
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,119
She could have run away.

76
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:34,098
She could have been with
some cousin in Temiskaming.

77
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:35,189
We didn't know.

78
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:36,305
That's why you keep looking.

79
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:37,329
<i>We tried.</i>

80
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:38,893
We failed.

81
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:40,027
We moved on.

82
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,695
You should put on that on the crest.

83
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:46,033
If I make you the lead on this,

84
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:48,562
<i>I need to know that
you're not gonna drift.</i>

85
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:54,404
Yeah.

86
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,344
So McLeod can't be your second.

87
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:58,879
He's in court all month.

88
00:05:58,914 --> 00:05:59,914
<i>Who then?</i>

89
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,797
You're kidding. She just transferred.

90
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:05,386
Lucky her.

91
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,027
She gets to learn from the best.

92
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:12,167
I'm glad to be working on this with you.

93
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,431
<i>How long were
you in Financial Crimes?</i>

94
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,611
<i>Five years.</i>

95
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,605
Any homicide rotations?

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,478
Scene work?

97
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:35,513
Anything?

98
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,666
No.

99
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:40,014
But look, I know this case.

100
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:41,015
I know the history.

101
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,293
<i>Everyone thought
Katie Pine ran away,</i>

102
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:44,385
except you.

103
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,118
Lot of good that did her.

104
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:47,976
How'd you know she'd been abducted?

105
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,102
What was your thinking?

106
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,156
You want to be careful.

107
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:52,415
Those questions got me kicked off homicide.

108
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,830
I thought yelling at your Sergeant

109
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,407
got you kicked off homicide.

110
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,809
<i>Is that what you heard?</i>

111
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:04,236
What I heard is that you
ran through a year's manpower

112
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:05,506
<i>on this one case,</i>

113
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,975
<i>ran everyone ragged</i>

114
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,394
and then fell asleep
driving home one night,

115
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:13,214
<i>crashed into a dumpster.</i>

116
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:14,248
Wrong.

117
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,484
It was a hydro box.

118
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,553
Much more expensive.

119
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:21,188
Here's what I need you to do.

120
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,223
As my new partner,

121
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:24,225
I need you to cover off my active cases,

122
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,684
unsolved B&Es,

123
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:26,360
dozens of them,

124
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:27,732
stretching back a year.

125
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:29,886
Get up to speed.

126
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,320
Okay.

127
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,526
See, the thing with John is two-fold.

128
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,840
First, whatever you do, stand up to him

129
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,775
and don't be a yes man.

130
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,810
I'm not.

131
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:45,012
And second?

132
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:46,879
Never disagree with him.

133
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,051
Sure.

134
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,065
<i>Katie's remains</i>

135
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,892
<i>have been transported
to the forensics lab</i>

136
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:14,966
<i>in Toronto.</i>

137
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,710
Okay.

138
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:18,067
<i>It'll take a few days</i>

139
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,192
<i>and then we'll release her to you.</i>

140
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:23,868
<i>There will be more questions</i>

141
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,018
and we'll have to go over some ground

142
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,421
we've already covered.

143
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,123
I'm sorry to put you through that again.

144
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:35,306
We're gonna throw everything
we have at this, Dorothy.

145
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:39,959
You said that before.

146
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,222
Then you stopped looking.

147
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:08,383
<i>There'll be
a fire later for Katie.</i>

148
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,164
<i>You're welcome to come if you want.</i>

149
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:12,740
I don't know, Jerry. It
wouldn't-wouldn't feel right.

150
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:14,739
<i>Hey, John.</i>

151
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,239
People are gonna think what they think.

152
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:22,516
But I know you did everything
you could for Katie.

153
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:48,936
<i>Delorme here.</i>

154
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,298
<i>Katie Pine wasn't
this guy's first victim.</i>

155
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,274
<i>You wanted to know my thinking.</i>

156
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,575
<i>There it is.</i>

157
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:55,609
<i>He's a predator.</i>

158
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:56,787
<i>She didn't know him.</i>

159
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,214
<i>A little girl gets murdered,</i>

160
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:02,750
you look close.

161
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:04,551
A neighbour. An uncle.

162
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:07,054
I looked, Delorme.

163
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,211
Babysitters,

164
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,423
band mates, cousins.

165
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:10,524
I talked to them all.

166
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:12,826
I know her life inside and out.

167
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:15,162
Favourite song was "Shake It Off".

168
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,953
<i>Favourite food, canned peaches.</i>

169
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:17,898
<i>Best friend, Tina.</i>

170
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:19,233
<i>Boyfriend, Arnold.</i>

171
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,935
I know Katie Pine

172
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,656
and this guy is not from her world.

173
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,040
He stalked her.

174
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,742
He picked his moment and he struck.

175
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,185
And who does that?

176
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:33,046
A repeater.

177
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:35,764
But there's just one small problem.

178
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:37,084
No more bodies.

179
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:38,418
<i>Unless we missed it.</i>

180
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,621
<i>When I first took this case,</i>

181
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,340
<i>another file caught my eye.</i>

182
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:44,894
<i>Billy LaBelle.</i>

183
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:46,727
<i>Age ten.</i>

184
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:47,728
<i>He drowned in the lake.</i>

185
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:49,069
<i>You remember?</i>

186
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:50,465
Yeah. An accident.

187
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,133
There were witnesses.

188
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:54,134
<i>No.</i>

189
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:56,105
<i>LaBelle's mom went for smokes.</i>

190
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,396
<i>When she came back, Billy was dead.</i>

191
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,276
No one saw it happen.

192
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,077
<i>No one saw what happen?</i>

193
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,803
<i>A serial killer swoop in</i>

194
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,410
<i>at that exact moment?</i>

195
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:10,284
<i>LaBelle was
found face up in the water.</i>

196
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:12,653
I talked to three different coroners.

197
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,788
They all say that's unusual.

198
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:17,124
The weight of your limbs

199
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:19,827
keeps you face down.

200
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:20,861
Unless,

201
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,231
it wasn't an accident.

202
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,566
<i>Young kid.</i>

203
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,835
<i>All alone.</i>

204
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:28,869
<i>Small.</i>

205
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,571
Vulnerable.

206
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,643
That's how these guys start.

207
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,405
<i>He holds LaBelle under</i>

208
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:40,113
<i>until his lungs fill.</i>

209
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:41,860
Looks him in the eye while he does it.

210
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,608
The biggest thrill of his life.

211
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:50,123
What does Dyson think?

212
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:52,406
Forget Dyson. I'm asking you.

213
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,356
It's a stretch.

214
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,865
LaBelle's mom was right there.

215
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:01,684
The timing doesn't work.

216
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:06,236
I'll see you in the morning.

217
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:08,462
We're done?

218
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:10,116
Good night.

219
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:14,284
<i>And that's the new partner?</i>

220
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:17,736
What did he want?

221
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,765
He wanted to hear himself talk.

222
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,049
<i>Westbrook building is clear.</i>

223
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,450
<i>I'm gonna head to Chalmers Street.</i>

224
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,317
<i>Yeah.</i>

225
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:51,752
<i>Copy that.</i>

226
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,154
Who are you?

227
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,188
<i>Mrs. LaBelle,</i>

228
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:55,824
<i>I am Detective John Cardinal.</i>

229
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:58,059
<i>I told him not to go in.</i>

230
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:01,595
<i>Told him to wait until I
got back but, you know,</i>

231
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,130
<i>he's such a water rat.</i>

232
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,099
<i>That's all he ever wanted to do.</i>

233
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,934
So you're there,

234
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,298
for about an hour

235
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:09,804
and then

236
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,495
you go back up to the car for cigarettes.

237
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:12,558
Is that right?

238
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:16,944
And how far away was
the car, would you say?

239
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:18,990
I don't know. Five minutes, if that.

240
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:21,633
Is there something wrong?

241
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,198
I told all this to the
other cop a bunch of times.

242
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:25,986
Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult.

243
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,248
I'm just,

244
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,439
I'm just doing some follow up.

245
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:34,815
<i>So, gone ten minutes</i>

246
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:37,373
and when you come back that's,

247
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:39,422
that's when you see Billy in the water.

248
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,898
<i>And that was about ten a.m.?</i>

249
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:45,054
Yeah.

250
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:48,672
Mrs. LaBelle,

251
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,689
I spoke with your friend,

252
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,348
Rosalyn this morning,

253
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:55,667
<i>Rosalyn Garret.</i>

254
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,423
She was with you the
night before Billy died.

255
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,669
Do you remember that?

256
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:02,248
<i>You were at the legion together.</i>

257
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:04,969
Sounds about right.

258
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,564
And you stayed pretty late,

259
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:07,979
closed the place down.

260
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,152
<i>What's
this got to do with Billy?</i>

261
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,097
I'm just,

262
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:12,961
I'm just trying to get
the timeline straight here.

263
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:16,424
So up until two a.m.,

264
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,305
having a good time and then

265
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,407
first thing next morning

266
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,516
with your son at the beach.

267
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,742
Mrs. LaBelle,

268
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,751
I couldn't help but notice

269
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,753
in the pictures of the scene,

270
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,655
<i>I didn't see anything like a blanket</i>

271
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:36,981
<i>or a picnic basket.</i>

272
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:38,359
Picnic basket?

273
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,400
Sorry. I don't own a picnic basket.

274
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,331
<i>Mrs. LaBelle,
I know this is difficult.</i>

275
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,610
<i>I know you've been through a lot</i>

276
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:48,068
<i>and I'm not here to
add to your pain.</i>

277
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:49,379
My son is dead.

278
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:51,943
What do you think you can add?

279
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,911
<i>If you weren't
with him that morning,</i>

280
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:58,612
<i>if you were sleeping it off</i>

281
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:00,550
<i>and he was out there on his own,</i>

282
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:03,706
<i>I need to know that.</i>

283
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:16,803
I want you to go.

284
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:33,095
McLeod, you got a minute?

285
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:34,257
It's forensics on the line.

286
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,138
I could use an extra brain in the room.

287
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:54,074
Len, it's John.

288
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,134
I've got, Detective McLeod with me.

289
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,255
We're ready when you are.

290
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,640
<i>All right.
It's all very preliminary so</i>

291
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,760
<i>bear with me.</i>

292
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:06,714
Doctor?

293
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:09,149
<i>Before you start, I wanted
to introduce myself.</i>

294
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,843
<i>I'm Detective Lise Delorme.</i>

295
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:13,454
I'm second on the case.

296
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:15,366
You guys want to call me
back when you're all sorted?

297
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,596
That's everyone, Len.

298
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,670
Go ahead.

299
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:20,828
<i>Okay. A
lot of animal predation so</i>

300
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:23,163
there's lots we can't know but,

301
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:25,299
wrists and ankles have ligature marks

302
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,967
so she was tied up.

303
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,585
<i>Petechial hemorrhaging
in her remaining eye</i>

304
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:30,938
<i>shows that she suffocated,</i>

305
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:32,973
<i>and we can thank the
ice for that detail.</i>

306
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,041
<i>Strangled?</i>

307
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:35,209
<i>Maybe.</i>

308
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:37,311
<i>Not enough neck tissue to be sure.</i>

309
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:38,812
Stomach, empty.

310
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:41,348
She hadn't eaten in at
least twenty-four hours.

311
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,017
<i>As for the killer,</i>

312
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:44,018
<i>no blood,</i>

313
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:45,052
<i>no hair.</i>

314
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:49,690
<i>Toxicology is positive
for benzodiazepine</i>

315
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:52,159
<i>but, and I can't say
this with certainty,</i>

316
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:55,129
there's no indication of sexual activity.

317
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,497
<i>Now her right eye,</i>

318
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:58,132
<i>this is a little different,</i>

319
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,366
<i>four abrasions,</i>

320
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:01,035
<i>two upper, two lower.</i>

321
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:03,337
<i>Leukotriene B4 is present</i>

322
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:06,071
<i>and what that means is
that there's inflammation</i>

323
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:08,906
<i>and, those injuries
came before she died.</i>

324
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,177
And what do you make of that?

325
00:18:10,211 --> 00:18:12,980
Could be some random injuries.

326
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:14,848
Certainly can't rule that out.

327
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,550
<i>Or they could be from a speculum</i>

328
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:18,342
<i>to keep her eyes open.</i>

329
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,127
<i>And that, for now, is
all that I have for you.</i>

330
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,522
<i>- Thanks, Len.
- Sure.</i>

331
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:32,782
He wanted her to see him.

332
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:35,002
Just like Billy LaBelle,

333
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,036
face up in the water.

334
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:37,689
Jesus. Here we go.

335
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:39,769
He tell you his repeater theory?

336
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:41,939
Maureen LaBelle lied, Ian.

337
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:44,345
Billy was unattended the morning he died.

338
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:46,347
John, you want my advice?

339
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:47,918
You have a victim.

340
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:49,474
<i>Don't go looking for more.</i>

341
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,006
Stay on the B&Es.

342
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:07,769
<i>Mare?</i>

343
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,169
I'm gonna need all the
uncleared missing person files

344
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,306
dating back two years,

345
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,774
starting with minors.

346
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:16,211
You want locals or just passing through?

347
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,554
All of them.

348
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,586
<i>And Mary, do me a favour.</i>

349
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:21,362
Keep this between us.

350
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,081
<i>Hi. It's Detective John Cardinal</i>

351
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:29,603
<i>with the Algonquin Bay Police.</i>

352
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,777
<i>I'm calling about a missing person.</i>

353
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,870
<i>Yeah, thanks for
getting back to me.</i>

354
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:35,604
<i>Question about a find...</i>

355
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,039
Seventeen.

356
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,474
<i>I'm wondering if there's any</i>

357
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:39,541
<i>new information since?</i>

358
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:41,477
<i>I see. So he was seen in St. John's?</i>

359
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:43,537
<i>I'm gonna show you some pictures.</i>

360
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,380
<i>Can you tell me if...?</i>

361
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:45,740
<i>Well, if you hear anything more,</i>

362
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:46,657
<i>will you let me know right away?</i>

363
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,417
<i>Yeah. I know it's an
Alberta case but...</i>

364
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,989
<i>I see, so there's a history of...</i>

365
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,421
<i>Can you call me at this number</i>

366
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:53,455
<i>when you have a minute?</i>

367
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,154
<i>Yeah. Hi. It's
Detective John Cardinal.</i>

368
00:19:58,461 --> 00:19:59,728
<i>She may have been...</i>

369
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:11,240
<i>Stir plate, gone.</i>

370
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:13,142
<i>Grain mill, gone.</i>

371
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,310
<i>Six brand new ball-lock kegs.</i>

372
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:16,453
<i>He took them all.</i>

373
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,847
<i>And insult to injury,</i>

374
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:19,882
<i>look at this.</i>

375
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,173
Didn't touch the beer.

376
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:24,686
<i>Maybe he prefers lager.</i>

377
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,488
I've won awards with this beer.

378
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,246
He was a finalist once.

379
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:31,333
I got a friend at the paper

380
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:33,485
says, houses are
getting robbed all over town.

381
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,363
Is that true?

382
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,764
<i>Let her do her job, Phil.</i>

383
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,976
Says it's been going on for months

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,467
and you guys are nowhere on it.

385
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:41,637
I'm afraid I can't
talk about other cases.

386
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:44,206
<i>Guess everyone'll be
focused on Katie Pine now.</i>

387
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:46,569
<i>Kinda surprised you're here at all.</i>

388
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,145
What goes there?

389
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:51,747
<i>Microwave.</i>

390
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,482
<i>I just got the thing.</i>

391
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:55,350
<i>I didn't even get a
chance to install it.</i>

392
00:20:58,054 --> 00:20:59,054
And when was that?

393
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:00,989
Wednesday.

394
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:03,644
<i>Is that important?</i>

395
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,805
<i>The fire will burn for four days</i>

396
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:14,139
<i>while Katie's spirit
walks the world.</i>

397
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,482
<i>Miss Pine,</i>

398
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:29,184
I'm Noelle Dyson with
the Algonquin Bay Police.

399
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:31,220
<i>I'm so sorry for what
you're going through.</i>

400
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,046
I've, um,

401
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:43,365
I've come with a message
from my fellow officers.

402
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,110
I understand that you intend to give Katie

403
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:47,603
a Christian service?

404
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:48,637
That's right.

405
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,674
<i>On behalf of the police</i>

406
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,243
<i>and the mayor's office,</i>

407
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:55,511
<i>we'd like to offer you the use</i>

408
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:58,046
<i>of the St. Francis church.</i>

409
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,704
<i>We'll cover the costs.</i>

410
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:02,497
Why?

411
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:05,087
<i>Miss Pine,</i>

412
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,773
there are so many people

413
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,411
feeling your pain right now.

414
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:12,856
<i>I know that they
would be very grateful</i>

415
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,576
<i>for an opportunity to
pay their respects.</i>

416
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,708
<i>Man.</i>

417
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:43,709
<i>Good to see you too, Francis.</i>

418
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:45,067
<i>What happened to your truck?</i>

419
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,379
I hit a squirrel.

420
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,597
Why so much this time?

421
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:52,888
<i>You're not gonna count it?</i>

422
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:54,089
I trust ya.

423
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:59,254
Heard they found that dead girl.

424
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,737
Night, Detective.

425
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,222
Your phone is off again.

426
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,014
<i>I have news on the B&E file.</i>

427
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,923
<i>Well, this is nice.</i>

428
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:53,856
What happened to your face?

429
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:57,847
I was in the crawl space.

430
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,691
I hit it on a pipe.

431
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:05,893
<i>What's your news, Lise?</i>

432
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:12,069
<i>Well, starts
with a microwave oven,</i>

433
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,537
<i>brand new,</i>

434
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,873
<i>bought four days ago.</i>

435
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,934
Stolen the night before last.

436
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,512
Something about it rang a bell

437
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,347
so I went back and checked.

438
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,549
Every one of the B&Es,

439
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,386
there's always something new stolen,

440
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,854
a computer,

441
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,122
a stereo,

442
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,998
something right out of the box.

443
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:38,049
<i>And all of them were
bought at one of the two</i>

444
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,457
<i>big box electronics stores.</i>

445
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,466
And what does that tell ya?

446
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,127
Our thief is staking out these stores.

447
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:48,229
<i>He follows his targets
home with their new stuff.</i>

448
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:50,305
Then he hits their house later.

449
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,819
<i>That's what you were doing</i>

450
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:56,047
when I found you spacing out by the mall.

451
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,049
You were looking for this guy.

452
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,196
<i>Whenever somebody left
with a big ticket item,</i>

453
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:03,820
I noted their licence plate

454
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,923
and the licence plates of anyone

455
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,623
<i>who followed them out of the lot.</i>

456
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,973
There you go. Last night's victim.

457
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:15,661
<i>Let's see here.</i>

458
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:17,797
<i>Chu-cha-chu.</i>

459
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:23,464
<i>Left 4:30 with his microwave.</i>

460
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,643
<i>Followed out by five cars.</i>

461
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,288
So one of these is our thief.

462
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:32,986
<i>There you go.</i>

463
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,487
When were you planning on sharing this?

464
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:38,621
I didn't know it would amount to anything.

465
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:41,746
I'll go meet the candidates.

466
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:50,013
<i>- Delorme.
- Hey.</i>

467
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:51,124
Check this out.

468
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:53,921
<i>Who's he?</i>

469
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,147
Malcolm Musgrave,

470
00:27:55,227 --> 00:27:56,702
RCMP Staff Sergeant.

471
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,813
<i>To what do we owe the honour?</i>

472
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:00,619
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

473
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:01,728
I mean, there's a rumour

474
00:28:01,794 --> 00:28:03,488
our department's under investigation.

475
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:05,932
What for?

476
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,198
Well, if they brought in the horsemen,

477
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:08,669
it's gotta be a dirty cop

478
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:10,077
or we'd handle it internally.

479
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,947
Well, that's just what we need right now.

480
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,158
<i>This fellow here,</i>

481
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:31,645
<i>yeah, yeah, he stayed with us.</i>

482
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:33,048
<i>Todd Curry. You're sure?</i>

483
00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:35,763
<i>Can you tell me, when that was?</i>

484
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,431
<i>You'll have to forgive me.</i>

485
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,146
<i>We-we still do this by hand.</i>

486
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:43,771
<i>We upgraded the system
a while ago but,</i>

487
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,285
<i>I found our guests
weren't crazy about</i>

488
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:46,828
<i>being keyed into a computer.</i>

489
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:47,907
There we go.

490
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:53,675
Let's see.

491
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,331
Todd Curry.

492
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:57,845
Stayed with us the night of

493
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,304
January the 7th.

494
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:00,120
Hasn't been back.

495
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,430
Do you know where he was going?

496
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,142
If he was travelling with anyone?

497
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:03,757
<i>Well, like I say,</i>

498
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,447
<i>we try to keep them fed and warm,</i>

499
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:06,862
<i>no questions asked.</i>

500
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:10,241
<i>I recognize you, don't I?</i>

501
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:13,107
You attended service for a while?

502
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:16,585
My wife and I.

503
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:18,481
<i>Didn't stick.</i>

504
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:22,275
<i>I figure it's best to keep my
attention where my work is,</i>

505
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:23,987
right down here in the dirt.

506
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:26,585
And your wife, um,

507
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,967
Catherine Cardinal.

508
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,049
Right?

509
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:31,140
She came to us at a difficult time.

510
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:36,851
I hope we were able to
provide some comfort.

511
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:42,296
She wanted to believe
that faith could heal her

512
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,330
and you let her.

513
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:49,752
Keep 'em.

514
00:29:49,803 --> 00:29:52,237
If any of those kids come through,

515
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:53,288
please call me.

516
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,458
Right away.

517
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,493
<i>Of course.</i>

518
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,759
You look tired.

519
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,232
You know what I need?

520
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,209
Tea.

521
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:31,625
From a Styrofoam cup.

522
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,846
I need to call work,

523
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,848
make sure everything's going okay.

524
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:35,883
Catherine.

525
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,353
I spoke to them last week.

526
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:40,666
Your students are covered.

527
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,989
Everything's good.

528
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:44,224
We need more firewood at the house.

529
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,793
I'll take care of it.

530
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,872
Well, I gotta get in touch
with my dad about their visit.

531
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,163
I can't remember if I did.

532
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:50,251
Catherine.

533
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:55,599
I should come home.

534
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:22,674
Excuse me.

535
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,329
We could have used all this manpower

536
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:28,268
when Katie Pine was still alive.

537
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,128
This isn't the time.

538
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,787
The killer's still out there

539
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:34,341
and you've got half
the force doing theatre.

540
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:37,043
We are paying our respects
to a grieving mother.

541
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,505
Is that what this is?

542
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Indeed.

543
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,167
Dorothy Pine's not coming.

544
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:27,561
Why?

545
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:32,056
Maybe she had better things to do.

546
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:08,476
<i>Detective,
it's-it's Father Presnell.</i>

547
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:10,899
I-I was just, speaking with one of our

548
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:13,521
<i>volunteers who remembers Todd Curry.</i>

549
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,746
<i>Turns out he did come back.</i>

550
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:17,017
To stay.

551
00:33:17,052 --> 00:33:17,868
<i>No, no.</i>

552
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:20,054
<i>He came to borrow a sleeping bag.</i>

553
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:21,414
He found a place to squat.

554
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,558
<i>One of the kids went to visit him.</i>

555
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:24,736
You know where?

556
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,368
<i>It's an abandoned house.</i>

557
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:27,499
<i>From the description,</i>

558
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:30,006
<i>it sounds like the one
on Sparhawk Street.</i>

559
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,857
<i>Do you know that?</i>

560
00:33:30,904 --> 00:33:32,426
<i>Yeah, I do, I do.</i>

561
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:33,461
<i>Thank you.</i>

562
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,200
<i>First Billy LaBelle,</i>

563
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,301
<i>and now Todd Curry.</i>

564
00:33:58,335 --> 00:33:59,353
<i>Seventeen years old,</i>

565
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:00,982
<i>last seen at that address.</i>

566
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:02,515
<i>If I can get in there,
have a look around,</i>

567
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:04,241
<i>maybe I can track him down.</i>

568
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,145
<i>No judge will
grant this warrant.</i>

569
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,101
They will if you back me.

570
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,400
And when this kid shows up
alive and well, what then?

571
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:14,594
<i>You gonna move down your list</i>

572
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:17,106
<i>until you've cleared every
missing person in the province?</i>

573
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:19,455
If this is real, we need to catch the guy

574
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,325
and to catch the guy we
need to act like it's real.

575
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:26,995
The Chief is considering handing Katie Pine

576
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,379
<i>over to the OPD.</i>

577
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,234
- What?
- We've got a murdered indigenous girl

578
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,887
who has slipped through the cracks.

579
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,647
<i>Everybody is watching.</i>

580
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:39,670
I am trying to give you a chance here

581
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,979
<i>but you are gonna have to work
the case that is in front of you</i>

582
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,577
or you are going to lose it.

583
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:46,661
Again.

584
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,879
<i>So,</i>

585
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:53,226
you decide.

586
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:56,989
Get me the warrant.

587
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,345
Hi.

588
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,290
I'm Detective Delorme.

589
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:26,556
I'm here about a noise complaint.

590
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,395
<i>Okay.</i>

591
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:28,558
Now we have reports...

592
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,026
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

593
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,627
<i>Of a loud engine sound.</i>

594
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,482
<i>We're trying to locate the source.</i>

595
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:35,231
No. We haven't heard
anything, Detective.

596
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,411
Are you sure?

597
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:41,137
Nothing unusual?

598
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:42,271
<i>No.</i>

599
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,908
<i>I mean a noise like that,
it'd wake the boy and then</i>

600
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,063
we'd know about it, that's for sure.

601
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:51,824
Is it just the two of you here?

602
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,116
With the boy.

603
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,923
Maybe someone else has heard something?

604
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,658
No. Just us.

605
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,869
I noticed all the skis.

606
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:04,567
<i>Well, they're mine.</i>

607
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,131
Three different sizes.

608
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:09,153
Different conditions.

609
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:14,268
Well if you

610
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:18,536
do hear that noise, Mr...?

611
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:25,126
I will call you, Detective.

612
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:26,877
Good luck with,

613
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,239
the noise complaint.

614
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:17,748
<i>Cardinal.</i>

615
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,561
Woodrow "Woody" Baldwin.

616
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:22,898
He did three months in
Drumheller for auto theft.

617
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:23,933
<i>He's our guy.</i>

618
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:25,584
<i>- I can feel it.
- Good work.</i>

619
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,036
<i>You should see him.</i>

620
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,813
<i>Thinks he can charm his
way out of anything.</i>

621
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,142
<i>All right, listen, well,</i>

622
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:35,645
<i>we'll put a patrol on him.</i>

623
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,829
Lise, I gotta call you back.

624
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,949
<i>I'll call when I know more.</i>

625
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:55,117
<i>- McLeod.
- Yeah?</i>

626
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:57,166
Your three favourite
detectives on the OPD side.

627
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:58,322
Grab a pen, write them down.

628
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,152
We're gonna need help.

629
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:00,909
<i>- And I don't want their dregs.
- Got it.</i>

630
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:01,693
<i>Lise?</i>

631
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:04,525
<i>Yeah? Yeah.</i>

632
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,578
You're not coming on scene,

633
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:06,827
you're needed elsewhere.

634
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,979
- Now?
- Yeah. Now.

635
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,259
Don't keep 'em waiting.

636
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,199
<i>I'm sorry to pull you away.</i>

637
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,224
<i>I know it's not a good time.</i>

638
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:44,107
<i>He suspect anything?</i>

639
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,098
<i>No. He's focused on Katie Pine.</i>

640
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,574
Okay.

641
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,799
I know it's early, but
give me your generals.

642
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:53,337
Well, he's stubborn.

643
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:55,234
Smart.

644
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:57,621
Thinks he knows better.

645
00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:59,259
<i>He never would have
found that second body</i>

646
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,887
<i>if he'd done what he was told.</i>

647
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:02,937
<i>And?</i>

648
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:04,871
<i>And...</i>

649
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:07,926
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

650
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:17,887
<i>What's discussed in here</i>

651
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:20,338
<i>can't leave these walls.</i>

652
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:22,407
<i>Not to your Sergeant,</i>

653
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,176
<i>not to your spouse.</i>

654
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,411
<i>Not even to members of my team.</i>

655
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:27,835
<i>We clear?</i>

656
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:31,700
<i>You'll know the name Kyle Corbett,</i>

657
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:32,584
<i>Sudbury-based,</i>

658
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:33,435
<i>came up in the 90's,</i>

659
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:37,118
<i>controls the bulk of the
drug trade north of Toronto.</i>

660
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,191
<i>Among his greatest hits,</i>

661
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:41,837
<i>2011, he blew up a rival's
garage in Val-d'Or.</i>

662
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:43,598
<i>Killed an eleven-year-old boy.</i>

663
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:48,733
We have reason to believe
that someone from our side

664
00:41:48,824 --> 00:41:50,969
is feeding Corbett information

665
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:53,237
<i>and we believe that that person</i>

666
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:55,207
<i>is Detective John Cardinal</i>

667
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:57,709
<i>of the Algonquin Bay
Police Department.</i>

668
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:59,623
<i>Delorme's been transferred
to Cardinal's section</i>

669
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:00,716
<i>at my request.</i>

670
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:02,247
<i>She's our inside guy.</i>

671
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:04,983
<i>Hansen, I brought you in
to work the Sudbury side.</i>

672
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,190
<i>The job</i>

673
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:08,573
<i>is to draw a line between the two.</i>

674
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,889
You find the link

675
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:12,824
between Cardinal and Corbett.

676
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:13,858
<i>Questions?</i>

677
00:42:15,206 --> 00:42:16,496
<i>You know John Cardinal?</i>

678
00:42:16,574 --> 00:42:18,068
Not well.

679
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,983
<i>Do you think he's the
kind of guy who'd do this?</i>

680
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:27,583
I don't find that question
to be especially useful.

681
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:30,522
<i>Did he?</i>

682
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,957
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

683
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:42,042

332
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,347
Ellegua for crossroads,

333
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,215
Oggun for iron or metal.

334
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:38,518
And how does one invoke them?

335
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,685
You make offerings.

336
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,853
Ellegua likes sweet things.

337
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,456
Oggun wants iron.

338
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,624
Railway spikes?

339
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,839
That would do it, yes.

340
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,564
Ah, the power of the spirit world

341
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,798
grows as the moon waxes,

342
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,533
and weakens as it wanes.

343
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,769
So if I were wanting to make an offering?

344
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,771
The most potent time
would be at new moon.

345
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,599
Under cover of darkness.

346
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:05,146
Has human sacrifice

347
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,379
ever been a part of this?

348
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,880
There are some missionaries' accounts,

349
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,148
but they've been discredited.

350
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:11,950
I mean, certainly human sacrifice

351
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:13,185
would be a

352
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:15,489

to any legitimate spiritual practice.</i>

355
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:27,164
But in the context of animal sacrifice,

356
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,734
the spirit must be able to
get around in the afterlife.

357
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,235
To do the shaman's bidding.

358
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,571
It would need feet to travel.

360

361
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,677
What do I do with them?

362
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:42,480
You put them in your iron pot.

363
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:43,947
Your nganga.

364
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,348

You would need fresh
blood to keep it working.

368
00:20:55,446 --> 00:20:57,794

369

In theory.

Huh?

10
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,275
No, no, no. No.

Bravo, bravo.

That's good.

29
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:16,710
Golden hippy.

30
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:19,254
No, no, no. It's just Paul.

31
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,989
Francesc...

32
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:36,589
They're gonna kill me, right?

33
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,785
I would.

34
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,546
Nobody came.

35
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:52,820
Nobody paid.

36
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,813
And no one's gonna pay.

37
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:00,710
I'm worth nothing.

38
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,092
Nothing.

39
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:32,533
You got any brothers and sisters?

40
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,673
I miss mine so bad.

41
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:40,153
I think about what
they're doing back home.

42
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:48,528
Like, right now, they're probably, uh...

43
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,735
fighting, um, over their snack.

44
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,680
Shouting at each other to pass the jar

45
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,368
of peanut butter and jelly.

46
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:04,016
And my mom, she, um...

47
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:15,360
You can't get peanut butter in Italy.

48
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:19,850
Not the real stuff, anyway.

49
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:23,568
Yeah, we get it sent.

50
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:34,504
It's really beautiful here.

51
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,627
You think they'll do it out here?

52
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,256
In the open?

53
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:56,877
I wouldn't mind that so much.

54
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:03,340
If I could see the sky and the trees.

55
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:30,223
<i>Grazie, Francesco.</i>

56
00:39:21,256 --> 00:39:23,259
There's nowhere to go.

57
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:27,690
There's nowhere to go!

58
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:45,726
Cut it.

59
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:47,953
- No.
- Yeah.

60
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:49,511
- Cut it.
- No.

61

<i>Posta</i> to<i> Mama e Papa.</i>

62
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:54,028
Cut.

63

Cut!

64
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:59,035
No.

65
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,621
Please. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

66
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,611
You need to do this,
'cause I don't want to die yet.

67
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:05,408
- No.
- Hey!

68
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:08,103
Please. Please.

69
00:40:08,136 --> 00:40:11,038
- No!
- Please. Please!

70
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:12,732
Cut.

71
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,099
Please.

72
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,946
I don't want to die. Not yet.

73
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,400
Please.

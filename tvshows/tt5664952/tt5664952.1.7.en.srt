1
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,744
Ah...

2
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,288
Eh?

3
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:50,697
Where is it, where is it, where is it?

4
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:52,998
Pauline, Pauline.

5
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,775
Here it is. Look at this.

6
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,681
I love the outfit.

7
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,372
Oh, this was California.

8
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:03,643
It was 1960... I don't know.

9
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,377
Little Paul was a baby,

10
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,380
and I was literally out front,

11
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,161
uh, pumping gas
and cleaning windshields.

12
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:12,575
You look happy.

13
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,605
Oh. Oh, we were. We were.

14
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:17,894
Broke but... happy.

15
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:22,328
Then<i> this</i> shows up out
of the blue from the old man.

16
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:27,274
"Dear Paul, I was pleased
to hear from George

17
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:30,008
"that you are working hard
pumping gas for Getty Oil.

18
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,344
"What better place to learn
about the oil industry

19
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,743
"than from the customers themselves?

20
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,911
"It's time you were promoted.

21
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,246
"Come to Italy. It's time we met.

22
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,017
Your loving father."

23
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,588
"Your loving father."

24
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,256

25
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,597
Oh.

26
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:20,583
Well, at least I won't have
to pick him out of a crowd.

27
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,889
I don't even know
if I could recognize him.

28
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,590
- It's been so long.
- Your own father?

29
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:27,011
Oh, it's been 15 years.

30
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:30,296
- He's not like<i> your</i> father.
- Paul.

31
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,423
Hi, uh... Dad.

32
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:41,341
Hmm. You may call me Paul.

33
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,210
Gail, I presume.

34
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,648
Yes. Lovely to meet you.

35
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,203
Why didn't you tell me
your wife was so pretty?

36
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:52,184
Oh, well, I...

37
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:53,872
I trust the flight was satisfactory.

38
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:55,855
Oh, it was amazing.

39
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,291
- Thank you.
- Are you my granddad?

40
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,627
- Yes.
- Well, how do you do?

41
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,728
Now, how do<i> you</i> do?

42
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,803
- I'm Paul.
- I'm Paul, too.

43
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:06,186
I know, silly.

44
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,117
Ah.

45
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,219
Don't you have a nanny?

46
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:29,688
- Oh, no, no. We can't, uh...
- Come here.

47
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,089
- We can't afford one.
- Sweetie.

48
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,625
Really?

49
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,537
Come on, Ma. Paul.

50
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:39,614
Hey, can't you keep him quiet?

51
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,242
He's tired, hungry and bored. So am I.

52
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:43,568
Gail, this is important.

53
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,966
I know.

54
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,327
Does Renaissance art

55
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:49,538
not interest our young visitor?

56
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:51,212
Oh. I'm sorry.

57
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:53,640
He's not usually so, um...

58
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:56,082
It's just that it's his dinnertime.

59
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:57,972
Well, it's really his bedtime.

60
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:59,819
Oh, the Italians eat late,

61
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,683
pay late, they do everything late...

62
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,620
but they sure can paint.

63
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,759
Paul, let me show you something.

64
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,969
Do you know what a hammer is?

65
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,097
Yes.

66
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,619
- And do you know what a nail is?
- Yes.

67
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,573
Well, that, young man,

68
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:19,102
is all you need to know
about crucifixion.

69
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:21,406
Now, these fellas here

70
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,468
have decided that this old man
with the beard,

71
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:26,148
Peter, shouldn't believe

72
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,814
in the things that he believes in,

73
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,344
so they took a hammer and some nails

74
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,295
and they banged them
straight through his hands

75
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,617
and his feet to that piece
of wood there.

76
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:40,538
Bang, bang, bang. See?

77
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,461
And then they stuck that
piece of wood up in the air

78
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,906
and left him hanging there
until he was dead.

79
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,470
What do you think of that?

80
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,995
Do you want to know what happened

81
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,707
to this poor fella here?

82
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,010
It was perfectly unpleasant.

83
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:02,181
- Herod was having dinner...
- Well, maybe another time.

84
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,850
Yes, yes.

85
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,651
We will go and have our own dinner,

86
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:09,101
and I will show you a rabbit.

87
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,491
Look out for the bird, little rabbit.

88
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:27,053
Look out for the bird.

89
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:30,609
Oh. Did you see the bird?

90
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:31,844
No.

91
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:33,246
Strange.

92
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,514
Neither do I.

93
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:38,817
A bird!

94
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,420
What do you say?

95
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,782
Watch out for the bird, little rabbit.

96
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:44,357
Watch out for the bird.

97
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,508
What bird?

98
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,328
Oh, look, now, someone else

99
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,062
has come to see you.

100
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,065
The sandman.

101
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,109
He's come to say good night.

102
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:57,222
Watch him closely.

103
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,181
Count to three.

104
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:02,808
One... two...

105
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,277
three.

106
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,158
How did you do that?

107
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,955
I like him.

108
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:18,097
I don't care for children,

109
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,560
but him I like.

110
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,797
Put him to bed, will you?

111
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:28,267
We have business to discuss.

112
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,722
Yes. Of course.

113
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:41,756
You have an appetite. I can see that.

114
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,768
- An appetite?
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:46,325
I saw you looking
at that waitress back there.

116
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,507
Oh, I'm a happily married man, sir.

117
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,786
Probably true but irrelevant.

118
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:56,487
Drink. Food. Sex. Appetite.

119
00:08:57,114 --> 00:09:00,120
You need that to succeed.

120
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:03,055
And then there's money, of course.

121
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,633
You have an appetite for that, too?

122
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,329
Well, we could certainly use
a bit more. That's for sure.

123
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:13,172
Don't play the self-effacing
lapdog with me.

124
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,734
There's millions in the trust.

125
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:19,868
Hundreds of millions and you know it.

126
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:22,688
Is that your appetite?

127
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:25,299
Yeah, looks like it, doesn't it?

128
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,714
But you can only drive
one car at a time.

129
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:32,084
You can only live in one house
at a time.

130
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:34,186
No.

131
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:38,255
What money gives you is power...

132
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,490
and<i> that</i>...

133
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,729
is the real ache in the balls,
young man.

134
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:46,598
Power.

135
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:50,869
A bit of it makes you want a lot of it,

136
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:55,708
and a lot of it
makes you want all of it.

137
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,212
You want some?

138
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:11,990
Well?

139
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,762
Jesus.

140
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,857
It's a promotion, all right.

141
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,465
So, why does it look
like you've just been fired?

142
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:22,468
Because it's in Saudi Arabia.

143
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,466
- Oh.
- Yeah. Oh.

144
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,941
He wants me to run
the whole setup down there.

145
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:31,643
The whole goddamn thing.

146
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:33,825
It's a huge job. It's massive.

147
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,215
He's showing his faith in you.

148
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:38,316
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

149
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,794
- He likes you.
- Yeah?

150
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:44,403
He likes you, too, the old goat.

151
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,666
Actually, I, I saw him
looking down my cleavage.

152
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,849
- No.
- Yeah.

153
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,967
Jesus, those eyes.

154
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:02,774
It's only a couple of years, right?

155
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,235
And then we'll be transferred

156
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,469
- back to the States.
- Yeah.

157
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,766
I'm in if you are.

158
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,354
Thank you.

159
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,821
Well, drink up.

160
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,122
Because all we're gonna
be getting in Saudi

161
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,356
is some potato hooch

162
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,124
that we buy off a Bedouin.

163
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:23,680
And I hope you're happy wearing a veil.

164
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,931
Because that is all
you're going to be wearing.

165
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:27,532
Don't be stupid.

166
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,589
God, it's amazing...

167
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,508
the shadow puppets.

168
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:39,878
He never did that with me.

169
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,238
He never did anything.

170
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,453
Poor baby.

171
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,411
Granddad!

172
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:24,223
Well, well, well.

173
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,991
Archaeologists have combed here,

174
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:31,796
and you find this.

175
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:34,332
Two and a half thousand years

176
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:36,905
it's been waiting for you to find it.

177
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:40,589
You're gonna go far, young man.

178
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:44,083
May I have this? No, you want it back.

179
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,872
All right, you can have it back.

180
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:48,779
You just have to tell me

181
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,348
which hand it's in, okay?

182
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:52,618
Wrong.

183
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:54,787
Ah...

184
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:02,726
We went all over, the four of us.

185
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:06,091
Like a... like a proper family.

186
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:09,388
You know, blue skies, laughter...

187
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,278
The wine was cold, the sun hot.

188
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:15,926
My wife... this beautiful,
flame-haired angel...

189
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:19,256
my son, my father. He-he liked me.

190
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:23,849
Jesus Christ, he liked me.

191
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:28,528
Just for a while, for a while...

192
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,389
we were happy.

193
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:40,714
Where are the children, ma'am?

194
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:42,394
- They're at La Fuserna.
- Oh.

195
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,569
I thought it should just be
the two of us

196
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:48,467
when he... you know... is back.

197
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,873
Um, it's gonna be his birthday.

198
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,144
Hmm.

199
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,181
Isn't that, um...?

200
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,283
It is going to happen, isn't it, Chace?

201
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,320
Everything's on schedule.
Contracts are drawn up.

202
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:03,021
Money's being counted.

203
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:06,355
Um, there are a few loose ends to tie up

204
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,026
that'll make him look pretty,

205
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:10,394
and other than that, we're good to go.

206
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:14,332
And Paul, he's met with the old man?

207
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,302
I believe that's an ongoing situation.

208
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,803
You know they don't get on.

209
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,806
Well, to my understanding,
it's just business now.

210
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,761
They're not normal, Chace... the Gettys.

211
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,850
It's okay, he's your boss.
I know you can't say.

212
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:35,152
They seem normal human beings,

213
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:39,391
but there's a slice
of pure animal in the old man.

214
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:42,569
- Animal?
- Yeah, you know, that thing

215
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:45,847
that the rest of humanity
holds onto for dear life?

216
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:48,784
Love, compassion, care, kindness...

217
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,901
whatever you want to call it.

218
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,127
There is a...

219
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,659
a-a switch

220
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,216
in him that clicks.

221
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:02,880
And it's gone.

222
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,705
- You know how to swim?
- No.

223
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:14,725
- Well, it's important.
- Will you teach me?

224
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:17,763
You don't want me to teach you.

225
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,064
I do.

226
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,165
I suggest not.

227
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,168
Yes.

228
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,983
If you insist.

229
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,609
Hey!

230
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:33,711
What the hell?

231
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:36,367
- Paul, get him!
- No, wait. Leave him.

232
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:41,287
Paul! Paul!

233
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:11,316
The water's pretty cold.

234
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,652
Winter's coming, I guess.

235
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,018
Here.

236
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:17,901
- For me?
- For you.

237
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,150
Thanks.

238
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:20,479
You are going home.

239
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,203
Really?

240
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,633
Yeah?

241
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:39,944
How could you do that?

242
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:41,555
What if he drowned?

243
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,347
I don't do "what if."

244
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:46,685
He didn't, and now he can swim.

245
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:51,818
Hey. Jesus.

246
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,925
What's the matter with him?

247
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,128
Saudi's not much of a place, you know.

248
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,370
No, but, hey, all part
of learning the ropes.

249
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:10,307
Right? And I do appreciate you

250
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,234
putting your trust in me, sir.

251
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:13,857
It's not like Italy.

252
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,714
A lot of sand.

253
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:17,849
Ceremony.

254
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,552
Not much sex.

255
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:25,665
You-you okay?

256
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,692
We... We-we could...

257
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,996
We could... we could what?

258
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:33,064
W-We could...

259
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:36,867
- What?
- We could send Gordon...

260
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,409
in your place.

261
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,905
Well-well, but Gordon, Gordon
doesn't know the first thing

262
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,799
- about oil.
- I know.

263
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,088
Not a thing.

264
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:49,181
But what about me?
I mean, I, I-I want to work.

265
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:52,085
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You stay in Italy.

266
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,219
Mm. That's what I've been doing here...

267
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:56,053
buying out Piomboil.

268
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:57,489
Somebody has to run it.

269
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:59,524
You.

270
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,044
Me? Really?

271
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,794
Why not?

272
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,623
Gordon.

273
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,490
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

274
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:32,729
Paul.

275
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,905
Wow.

276
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,932
What a place.

277
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:55,033
Needs to be taken in hand, Paul.

278
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,870
You know that they take

279
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,148
a two-hour lunch, for God's sakes.

280
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:03,687
Needs to be trimmed down
to its essential.

281
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,130
Squeeze it till it starts
turning a profit.

282
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:08,180
Yes, of course.

283
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,482
You're going to have to let at least

284
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,061
half of those people go.

285
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,310
What, th-them?

286
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:15,177
Which ones?

287
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:18,382
Well, you're in charge. You choose.

288
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,517
I'm gonna keep in touch with you.

289
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,876
You'll keep in touch with me?

290
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,186
Yes. I have to go to England.

291
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,549
What, England?

292
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,224
Stop repeating everything I say.

293
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:28,891
- But...
- Yeah, but I will be in touch

294
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:32,215
with you every evening at 7:45.

295
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:35,065
Make sure you are available
for the call. All right?

296
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,600
I will be.

297
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,634
- It's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

298
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:41,318
Just choose well.

299
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:52,748
Well, I'm, uh...

300
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:54,992
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to let you go.

301
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,877
Your position is no longer available.

302
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:06,406
I'm terribly sorry.

303
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:07,883
It is impossible!

304
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:10,657
I'm s... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

305
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:42,163
<i>No, that's a bad idea.</i>

306
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:44,841
All of it? The, the entire proposal?

307
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:45,809
<i>Why would we expand</i>

308
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,630
at a time of such
international uncertainty?

309
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:51,207
Because the price of oil will go up.

310
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:53,253
<i>You might care to gamble the family,</i>

311
00:20:53,277 --> 00:20:54,791
silver on that

312
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,779
but I do not.

313
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,119
<i>All right, but don't
embark on that by yourself,</i>

314
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:05,856
for heaven's sakes.
You need Enzo on that.

315
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:08,058
<i>- Get him on it.</i>
- But Enzo doesn't work for us anymore.

316
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,060
You let him go?

317
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:12,701
- Well, I... you...<i>
- Enzo is the sharpest mind</i>

318
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:14,462
in the whole company.

319
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:16,099
Was.

320
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:18,100
E-Extraordinary decision.

321
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,458
I...

322
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:23,506
<i>Now, we sign a five-year contract,</i>

323
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,678
<i>and even if their shipping
costs go up, our bill doesn't.</i>

324
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:32,944
It was a tough negotiation,
but Onassis will undercut

325
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:36,780
any rival carrier by 15%.

326
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:40,090
Good work, Paul.

327
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,290
Thank you.

328
00:21:42,437 --> 00:21:44,026
But no.

329
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,829
- No?
- No. I've decided

330
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,630
not to go forward with that.

331
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:50,169
I think we should purchase
our own tankers.

332
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,869
I mean, why pay someone else
to ship our oil

333
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,986
when we can ship it ourselves?

334
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,874
And you decide to tell me this now?

335
00:21:57,907 --> 00:21:59,676
I wanted you to have the opportunity

336
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,110
to make your proposal.

337
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:03,054
And it's very promising.

338
00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:06,718
It's just not as promising as mine.

339
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,063
<i>It's not an excuse, but I was lonely.</i>

340
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:33,146
Even with four kids?

341
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:36,334
Only a man could say that.

342
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,615
Yes, even with four beautiful,
beautiful children,

343
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:44,543
I couldn't have been lonelier.

344
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,835
Huh.

345
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:49,020
Makes you do stupid things.

346
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:01,504
Darling, well, you're not even dressed.

347
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:03,766
We were due there ages ago.

348
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,986
Well, I got to get this right
before the old bastard calls.

349
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,180
Well...

350
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,386
Can't it just wait?

351
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:14,376
This once?

352
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,211
It's gonna be fun.

353
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:19,783
The-the actors from<i> Roman
Invasion</i> are gonna be there.

354
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:23,133
And, um, you know, they're gonna
do some scenes, and...

355
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:25,721
Why don't you t-take Little Paul?
He loves that stuff.

356
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,429
Please?

357
00:24:35,665 --> 00:24:37,834
Paul, honey?

358
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:40,047
You're my date!

359
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,905
Again.

360
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:07,738
Grazie.

361
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,480
I like your new boyfriend.

362
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,015
Shut up.

363
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,370
I'm serious,
he's definitely looking at you.

364
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,231
No, he isn't.

365
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,266
But even if he was, I'm married.

366
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:12,301
I thought you and Paul, you
know, you had an arrangement.

367
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,506
We do, but...

368
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:16,566
I've never acted on it.

369
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,301
Well, Paul has.

370
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:22,381
And, Gail, I mean, where is he?

371
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:23,936
Where is he, ever?

372
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,609
Ladies.

373
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:32,681
Tesserarius Lang Jeffries,
of the Ninth Legion,

374
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:33,983
at your service.

375
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,596
Gail.

376
00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:39,254
An honor.

377
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,987
- Are you sick?
- No, no.

378
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:00,881
You're not on top of it.

379
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:02,157
Any of it.

380
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:05,729
They tell me you're hardly ever
at your desk in the morning.

381
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:07,493
What's going on?

382
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,673
I'm trying my best, sir.

383
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:10,903
Do better.

384
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:12,340
I'm trying,

385
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:13,582
but every time I do something,

386
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:15,810
you suggest I do something different.

387
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,644
I have 40 years' business experience.

388
00:27:19,184 --> 00:27:20,813
You expect me to stand by

389
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:23,601
and watch you make a fool of yourself?

390
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:25,496
No.

391
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:28,508
Take the advice from someone who knows.

392
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:30,756
I hear your marriage is in trouble.

393
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:33,737
That'll cost you.

394
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,779
<i>You're not focused.</i>

395
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:38,782
I've talked to Enzo,
I'm bringing him back.

396
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:40,095
Oh, right.

397
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:43,353
Take some time off, sort yourself out.

398
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:45,130
How much time?

399
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:46,257
Wait, wait.

400
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,892
Are you firing me?

401
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,172
Paul, I'm hearing talk
about drink and drugs.

402
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,361
But that accounts for the mess
we're in around here.

403
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:58,678
Well, maybe if you'd let me
handle a few things myself...

404
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:03,907
Paul, no one who takes drugs
works for me.

405
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:05,910
You know that... nobody.

406
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:10,501
We'll talk again when you're better.

407
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,460
Well, we had an arrangement.

408
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:58,341
It was the '60s, right?

409
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,677
Let it all hang out, baby.

410
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:05,060
<i>The idea was, we could see other people,</i>

411
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:07,101
but we'd stay married.

412
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,172
For the kids.

413
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,531
And how'd that work out?

414
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:15,383
How it always works out, I imagine.

415
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:22,009
I won't be long, okay?

416
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:23,129
Sure.

417
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:46,334
If you look up, the dome

418
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,745
of the church causes
an extraordinary effect,

419
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,397
similar to the famous whispering gallery

420
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,339
in St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

421
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:56,650
If you sit in the center here,

422
00:29:56,675 --> 00:30:00,612
your voice is channeled through
this grate down to the crypt,

423
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:03,095
where both your friends and your enemies

424
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,558
may listen to it.

425
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,104
If we turn our attention to the...

426
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:09,212
Paul.

427
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:10,642
He saw us.

428
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:13,085
So we met in a church.

429
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,338
He's gonna find out soon enough.

430
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:17,041
Not yet.

431
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:18,709
When I'm ready.

432
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:21,286
I want to be with you.

433
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,779
I love you, Gail.

434
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:25,817
Will you still love me
when I have no money?

435
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,751
I won't take a cent from him.

436
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:29,873
I got a job at Lucia's.

437
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:31,359
- It pays the rent, but I...
- It's...

438
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:33,232
It's not about the money.

439
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,594
Well, you're clearly not a Getty.

440
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,230
Damn right, there.

441
00:30:40,365 --> 00:30:42,568
I want to be with you, too, Lang,

442
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:45,896
but this is going to break
his little heart.

443
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,472
He'll adjust.

444
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:50,073
Kids are adaptable.

445
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:52,346
Paul loves his dad.

446
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:54,442
That's okay.

447
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:56,253
I'm not stopping him.

448
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,348
But we need to be together.

449
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:00,060
You and me.

450
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:03,321
Like it or not, he's just gonna
have to get used to that.

451
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:16,237
Hi.

452
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,639
Sorry, I bumped into Lang,
which I know you saw.

453
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:26,978
Do you know why this church is famous?

454
00:31:27,665 --> 00:31:28,906
Because it's beautiful?

455
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,147
No?

456
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:33,517
No.

457
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,520
Why don't you educate me, smart-ass?

458
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:39,901
The shape of the dome
creates an acoustic weirdness,

459
00:31:39,956 --> 00:31:41,626
like a magic trick.

460
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,127
Wow.

461
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:46,401
If you stand below the grill
in the middle,

462
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:48,654
you can hear people
from all over the church.

463
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:50,795
Wow.

464
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,670
Cool.

465
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:56,772
Hey.

466
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,776
What are you gonna do with the money?

467
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,371
I don't know.

468
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:44,748
You're just like my grandfather.

469
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:46,299
All that money, he doesn't know
what to do with it.

470
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:48,393
No, no, no, no. Big difference.

471
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:50,635
We are poor.

472
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,235
We will spend it.

473
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:58,905
Why so long?

474
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:00,608
Your father.

475
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,206
If my son is kidnapped,
I pay the next day.

476
00:33:06,914 --> 00:33:08,483
Everything I have.

477
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,794
Yeah. My, uh...

478
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:13,279
my dad's tricky.

479
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:16,055
You know, sick in the head.

480
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:19,692
- Ah,<i> pazzo.
- Pazzo.</i>

481
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:22,324
He was in love.

482
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,245
Yeah.

483
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,802
With this, uh, beautiful woman.

484
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,097
Not his wife?

485
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:32,508
No, my mom... she ran off with an idiot,

486
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,711
and my dad fell in love
with someone else.

487
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,502
Talitha.

488
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:51,193
I will be back in a sec.

489
00:33:51,284 --> 00:33:52,308
Can I come?

490
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:55,026
No, just a quick stop. Five minutes.

491
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:03,068
Five minutes.

492
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,100
Where have you been?

493
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:34,135
You said five minutes,
like, an hour ago.

494
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:36,387
Sorry, my fault.

495
00:34:38,316 --> 00:34:39,428
Hi.

496
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,061
I'm Talitha.

497
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:43,411
Wow.

498
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,282

589

You often get them
to open up after hours?

605

I have an understanding with
the director, Lord Jefferies.

606
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:52,531
It's actually more
of a misunderstanding.

607
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,222
He believes that I'm going to bequeath

608
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:57,183
my two fragments to the museum.

609
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:58,718
And you're not?

610
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,355
No, I'm going to give them
much more than that.

611
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:06,892
I've been to Rome.

612
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:09,055
You've b... You don't travel.

613
00:45:10,029 --> 00:45:11,831
Do you remember Hadrian's Villa?

614
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,567
Yes. Yeah, of course.

615
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,496
- Amazing place.
- Well, it's... it's the same.

616
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:20,291
I found this.

617
00:45:25,243 --> 00:45:27,171
It's just like the one
Little Paul found.

618
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:28,412
Indeed.

619
00:45:28,413 --> 00:45:31,350
Apparently, they're everywhere.

620
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:36,388
I met with the leader
of the Mafia outfit

621
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:38,328
that is holding your boy.

622
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:41,149
We did business. Good business.

623
00:45:41,516 --> 00:45:43,681
I agreed, on your behalf,

624
00:45:43,734 --> 00:45:47,736
to a ransom of $5 million
payable within a week.

625
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:50,619
Oh, right. $5 million, well...

626
00:45:50,736 --> 00:45:52,557
that's a good price.

627
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:55,027
It's considerably less
than the asking price.

628
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:58,410
Still, you do not have the money.

629
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:01,055
In cash, no. Obviously, no.

630
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,415
So I propose

631
00:46:02,448 --> 00:46:05,762
that you pay the ransom
out of the trust.

632
00:46:05,787 --> 00:46:07,553
Agreed?

633
00:46:09,754 --> 00:46:11,520
Really?

634
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:14,893
- God. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

635
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:17,190
Oh, God, thank you.

636
00:46:17,215 --> 00:46:20,231
Um, we ha... we have a little
problem with time,

637
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:22,895
given your allergy to the telephone.

638
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,238
- I...
- Lansing.

639
00:46:29,082 --> 00:46:30,651

640
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,980

641
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:40,653
I'm so glad that
we're finally able to...

642
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:43,137
I can't tell you

643
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,658
how pleased I am, Paul.

644
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,372
Uh... wait.

645
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:01,917
Wait.

646
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:05,050
This is a-a loan?

647
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,413
Minimally so, yes.

648
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:09,540
It has an interest rate

649
00:47:09,597 --> 00:47:12,511
repayable at four percent over base.

650
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:16,191
- You're lending me the money.
- No.

651
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:18,589
The trust is lending you the money,

652
00:47:18,656 --> 00:47:20,480
and you have a responsibility

653
00:47:20,527 --> 00:47:22,538
- to pay it back.
- But it's my money.

654
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:23,812
No, it's the trust's money.

655
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:25,609
Money in the trust that belongs to me.

656
00:47:25,648 --> 00:47:27,033
The money in the trust

657
00:47:27,065 --> 00:47:29,334
has been earned entirely by my efforts.

658
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:32,399
I don't want to get into
an argument about semantics...

659
00:47:32,438 --> 00:47:35,532
Semantics? Semantics.
You're gonna make a profit

660
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:37,196
off the kidnapping of your own grandson.

661
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:40,079
Oh, please. Don't be ridiculous.

662
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,047
You know, you-you can go to a bank

663
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:43,522
and see what kind
of an interest rate you...

664
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:45,485
Oh, God, I am so stupid.

665
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,520
So stupid.

666
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,655
I mean, I'm-I'm such an idiot.

667
00:47:50,689 --> 00:47:51,940
What are you talking about?

668
00:47:51,965 --> 00:47:54,060
I-I-I thought you were gonna
give me something.

669
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:55,979
I thought you were giving me something.

670
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:58,938
I mean, all my life,
that is what I have wanted,

671
00:47:59,198 --> 00:48:02,537
for you to give me something,
anything. I don't care what.

672
00:48:02,562 --> 00:48:05,138
That-that little bit of pottery
in your pocket.

673
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:07,739
It's worthless apparently, everywhere

674
00:48:07,772 --> 00:48:10,622
apparently, but you still
had to have it back.

675
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:14,913
And it's a loan of my money,
to me, with interest!

676
00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:16,262
Of course it is!

677
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:19,551
- Paul, I am trying to help you.
- By burying me deeper

678
00:48:19,585 --> 00:48:21,540
and deeper? Well, I will not do it.

679
00:48:21,595 --> 00:48:23,470
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

680
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:26,392
I will not be buried!
I can't do it anymore!

681
00:48:26,424 --> 00:48:27,926
No! No!

682
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,263
No! No! No!

683
00:49:22,413 --> 00:49:24,417
No...

684
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:33,894
No...

685
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:58,248
Yes, sir.

686
00:49:59,817 --> 00:50:01,584
I understand.

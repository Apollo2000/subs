1
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,006
It'll ring.

2
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:02,391
You don't know that.

3
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,826
How could you possibly know that?

4
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:07,463
You don't know anything.

5
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:13,167
- Sorry.
- Eh...

6
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:22,059
I've got a son.

7
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,208
You've got a son?

8
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:27,749
Jesus, Chace.

9
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:30,358
All this time?

10
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:31,954
How old is he?

11
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:33,322
About 12.

12
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:35,983
You've got a 12-year-old son, and you...

13
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,340
Why didn't you tell me?

14
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:40,796
This is about your son, not mine.

15
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,397
Bullshit,

16
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,433
Fletcher, that's bullshit.

17
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,703
All this time,
you've known the pain in here?

18
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:50,980
- And you've said nothing?
- I was ashamed.

19
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,377
- Of your son?
- No.

20
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,402
Of me.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,343

22
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,381
Hey.

23
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,272
Yeah.

24
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:48,488
<i>...President Nixon has ordered</i>

25
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,652
<i>the attorney general, Elliot Richardson,</i>

26
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:54,148
<i>to fire special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox,</i>

27
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:57,484
<i>after Cox announced that
he'll continue his court battle</i>

28
00:05:57,518 --> 00:06:00,755
<i>to hear the presidential tapes
in the Watergate case.</i>

29
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:04,153
<i>President Nixon's attorney...</i>

30
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:07,696
<i>...arguing that the Constitution...</i>

31
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:13,001
Chace?

32
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,501
What?

33
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:15,770
It's not the worst,

34
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,240
but it's not good.

35
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,717
<i>We have no proof this is Paul's ear.</i>

36
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:25,006
These are Paul's freckles.

37
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:28,439
Lots of people have freckles.

38
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,916
I washed his hair as a baby,

39
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:36,625
kissed him
when he went to sleep at night,

40
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,146
kissed him in the morning,

41
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:45,130
tucked his hair behind his ears
every... when he went to school.

42
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,068
This is my son's.

43
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:52,574
Then I suggest you pay the ransom.

44
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,879
Can I keep these?

45
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:59,748
Yes.

46
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,234
Strange decision,

47
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:18,031
removing an ear.

48
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,971
It's not definitive.

49
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,285
A finger comes with a print.

50
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:25,846
Better.

51
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:28,672
Perhaps they'll send a finger next time.

52
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:32,157
Maybe it's a metaphor, Paul.

53
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,384
Maybe they're trying
to get someone to listen.

54
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:38,709
- I don't follow.
- No.

55
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,510
No, you really don't, do you?

56
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,214
- Paul.
- Hmm?

57
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,348
Gail's been waiting quite some time now.

58
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,817
All right.

59
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,553
Very impressive picture, Gail.

60
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:54,491
I'm more of
a Renaissance era man, myself.

61
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:57,995
Well, there were certainly
many instances of mutilation

62
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:01,543
in those pictures,
now that I think about it.

63
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,236
Hello, Paul.

64
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,371
Hello, Gail.

65
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,944
Are you sure that the ear
belongs to Paul?

66
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,680
I couldn't be more certain.

67
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,582
Whatever the rights and wrongs

68
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,418
of his behavior, sir,

69
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,090
he's your grandson.

70
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:29,027
They're sending him back in pieces.

71
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,630
I implore you.

72
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,367
Please.

73
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,768
Help him.

74
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,104
I have attempted
to resolve this situation

75
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:43,273
on a number of instances.

76
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:48,012
I went to Italy, and put myself
at considerable risk,

77
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:51,449
so that I could negotiate
a very fair deal

78
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:55,752
that the boy's father refused to accept.

79
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,300
There's really nothing else
that I can do.

80
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,003
The key to resolving this situation

81
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,164
lies with your ex-husband.

82
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:11,868
And you tell him

83
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:15,739
that he should come to his senses.

84
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:12,496
Where's the head gardener?

85
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,197
That's me, mate.

86
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,200
As of today.

87
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,335
The other bloke did a moonlight flit.

88
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,223
Gail's waiting downstairs.

89
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:28,598
It-it doesn't even look
like a human ear.

90
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,614
Gail wouldn't know an ear
from a piece of prosciutto.

91
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,752
Honestly, Paul,
that's a vile thing to say.

92
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,820
Well, she wouldn't.

93
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,810
Remember when he dressed up as Jesus?

94
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:51,402
One of the photos they took
was a close-up of his face.

95
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:55,406
We matched the ear to that.

96
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:59,454
It's not a piece of prosciutto.

97
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,110
Well, I'll leave you to it.

98
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:14,258
He made a beautiful Jesus, didn't he?

99
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,260
Yeah.

100
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,296
Huh.

101
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,632
You look, uh...

102
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,768
It's, uh, it's good to see you.

103
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,771
It's good to see you, too.

104
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:30,773
It's been a long time.

105
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:32,234
Yeah.

106
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:51,826
Please, accept your father's loan.

107
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:55,529
See, that's-that's the problem
exactly, it's a loan.

108
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:58,801
Now, he's offering to lend me
my money from the trust

109
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:02,038
at-at four percent above the base.
My own money.

110
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,807
He stands to make a profit...
the bastard stands to profit

111
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,576
off the kidnapping of our son.

112
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:08,811
I know.

113
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,481
But how much more of him
do you want to see hacked off

114
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,484
and put in the post?

115
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,655
Please.

116
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,322
Put your name on a piece of paper...

117
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:22,426
No! No, no, no. I can't.

118
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,161
- Sign the damn thing.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

119
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:25,429
- Please.
- I can't.

120
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,555
You don't understand.
If I sign, then he has got me.

121
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:32,444
I mean, don't you remember
the phone calls day and night?

122
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:35,339
The visits, the-the repayment schedule,

123
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:39,376
the bullying that slowly, slowly
sucks the life out of you

124
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:42,345
until you are in a garage
at a party, stabbing yourself

125
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:44,681
to death in the chest
with a barbecue fork.

126
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:46,684
It killed George. It-It killed him.

127
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,686
And I-I can't do it, it'll kill me.

128
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,521
It's our son who will be killed, Paul.

129
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:53,263
I can't... I can't do it.

130
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,274
<i>Of course any
assistance that I can give,</i>

131
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:28,691
but I'm sure you've seen the news.

132
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:32,562
President Nixon has a lot
on his plate right now.

133
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,230
I can appreciate that.

134
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,533
Do you have children,
Ambassador Annenberg?

135
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,628
A daughter.

136
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,324
Forgive me...

137
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:42,637
you had a son.

138
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,239
I did. Yes.

139
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,111
He died.

140
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:53,173
Around the time that
I first met your father.

141
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:55,919
And is that why you came to me?

142
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,482
Because you thought you had an angle.

143
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:01,392
Yes.

144
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:05,178
I've run out of options, sir.

145
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,399
You know what it's like to lose a son.

146
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm losing mine.

147
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,859
Every day, he's slipping away from me.

148
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,640
I feel it, sir. I feel it in my bones.

149
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,213
All right.

150
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:28,321
<i>Mr. President, as a mother,</i>

151
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,487
<i>I am begging you to...</i>

152
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,771
<i>I am appealing to you</i>

153
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,983
<i>with all my heart.</i>

154
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:51,359
<i>My son is in great danger...</i>

155
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:03,854
<i>You are my last hope.</i>

156
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,177
<i>Please help me.</i>

157
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,336
<i>Please, God,
let these be the right words.</i>

158
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:24,040
Thank you.

159
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,351
<i>Because people have got to know</i>

160
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:31,488
<i>whether or not
their President's a crook.</i>

161
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,015
<i>Well, I'm not a crook.</i>

162
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:35,018
<i>I've earned everything I've got.</i>

163
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,952
A fax for you, Mr. President.

164
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:42,191
What are they throwing at me now?

165
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,617
<i>I'm appealing to you as
a citizen of the United States.</i>

166
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,032
When do they not?

167
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:51,015
<i>I have no more options.</i>

168
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:53,202
<i>As a citizen, one is supposed to be able</i>

169
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,140
<i>to appeal to their president.</i>

170
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,373
<i>As a friend of my father-in-law,</i>

171
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:58,941
<i>Mr. John Paul Getty,</i>

172
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:03,817
<i>and as a human being, please help.</i>

173
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:05,816
<i>I don't know what else to do.</i>

174
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:21,327
What's wrong with the man?

175
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:25,788
I don't know. Something's very wrong.

176
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:29,826
And at what point does one say
"That's enough"?

177
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,094
- Patrick, don't.
- Just a question.

178
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:35,589
If an ear turned up in my post,
I'd bloody well pay up.

179
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:38,058
I know you would.

180
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,736
Look, I'm no billionaire.

181
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,013
The only things I own in the world are

182
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:44,086
a biplane with an oil leak

183
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:46,675
and a house with dicky plumbing.

184
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,778
I can't even guarantee you a hot bath.

185
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,472
- Patrick, please don't.
- But I love you.

186
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,616
Only you. And the dog.

187
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:58,674
With all my heart, Penelope.

188
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,724
Come and live with me. Please.

189
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,365
Please.

190
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:16,972
This had better be good.

191
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,081
I regret I am unable to say, sir.

192
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,377
I've about had it with
your regrets, Bullimore.

193
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,653
Who the fuck is it?

194
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,528
The President of the United
States of America, sir.

195
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:32,221
Oh.

196
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,924
Mr. President.

197
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:36,391
<i>I hear you have a problem in...</i>

198
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:39,061
- Wyoming.
- <i>Indians.</i>

199
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:41,501
Of the red variety, sir.

200
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,433
Getting in the way of my drilling.

201
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,093
<i>Expensive?</i>

202
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:49,238
It's costing me millions.

203
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,431
Well, the cavalry just arrived.

204
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:55,578
Is this an offer of help, Mr. President?

205
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,615
<i>Maybe.</i>

206
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:01,490
<i>Let's just talk about this
grandson of yours first.</i>

207
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,408
Ho.

208
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:21,381
Ho!

209
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:22,538
Ho.

210
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,446
I believe an apology is in order.

211
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:49,901
Well, I don't think that I have
anything to apologize for.

212
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,968
Not from you.

213
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,659
From me.

214
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,008
I was wrong.

215
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:03,637
You were wrong?

216
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,248
It does happen.

217
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,925
I propose a compromise.

218
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,818
Wha... A compromise?

219
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:12,921
Paul! You continue

220
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,025
to repeat everything that I say.

221
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:23,636
Yes. I will pay

222
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:25,657
half the ransom personally.

223
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,275
Personally?

224
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,571
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,173
My own money.

226
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:34,676
And... the other half?

227
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,536
A loan from the trust.

228
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:38,583
Oh, well, we have been here before.

229
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:40,983
Interest-free.

230
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:49,900
Well...

231
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,293
I see.

232
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:08,945
We have a deal?

233
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,983
Yes, yes, I, uh... I-I think we do.

234
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:17,720
Penelope.

235
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:33,902
Be anything else, or...?

236
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:35,270
Let Gail know.

237
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,902
How many millions will you make
from your Nixon deal?

238
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:48,700
Considerably more than I loaned my son.

239
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:51,512
Extraordinary.

240
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:56,525
He made no attempt to negotiate at all.

241
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,194
The boy has learned nothing.

242
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,400
But I have. Finally.

243
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,701
I couldn't leave until I knew
Little Paul was

244
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,136
going to be all right.

245
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:11,761
But now he is. I can say good-bye.

246
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:18,580
Good-bye, Paul. And good luck.

247
00:21:41,337 --> 00:21:46,142
Tell Fifty the money's coming.
It'll be here in two days.

248
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:49,415
Do you understand?

249
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,817
At least do me the courtesy
of a yes or a no.

250
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,118
Yes.

251
00:21:57,152 --> 00:22:00,523
And tell the mutilating bastard
to leave my son alone.

252
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:38,558
It's not too late.
You could still get rid.

253
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:43,771
If I have to choose between
my baby and him,

254
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:46,971
- it's not much of a contest.
- But it's not just him, is it, darling?

255
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,624
It's all this, it's us.

256
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:52,526
We have fun, don't we?

257
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,541
We did.

258
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:07,127
Thank you, Bullimore.

259
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:13,643
Kensington, please.

260
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:21,728
There goes another one, Bullimore.

261
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:23,084
Indeed, sir.

262
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,262
Breach of contract.

263
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:29,124
You see?

264
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:32,123
Will there be anything else, sir?

265
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:35,803
No, nothing.

266
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:42,209
Hmm?

267
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:02,834
A pen?

268
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,972
The money goes in white suitcases.

269
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,964
<i>Wear white clothes.</i>

270
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:46,230
<i>You have to drive a white car.</i>

271
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,580
That's a white car.

272
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:58,783
No marked bills and no invisible ink.

273
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:49,090
Hey.

274
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:22,033
Five minutes. Five minutes is all.

275
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,228
Sure, five minutes.

276
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:27,016
I just want to see the sun, that's all.

277
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:30,928
- Hey.
- Yeah?

278
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:34,045
I'm sorry.

279
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:37,056
- Your ear.
- What? No need to apologize.

280
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,117
No, no. My son...

281
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,530
- It was a bad thing.
- Francesco?

282
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:47,241
- He's your son?
- Yes.

283
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:50,195
Oh, shit.

284
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,036
I asked him to do that.

285
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,597
To cut your ear?

286
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:03,055
Yeah, I begged him, man.

287
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,226
I-I thought it was, you know,

288
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:10,715
it's-it's the only way
to make my family pay attention.

289
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:15,253
It's all good, really.

290
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:20,292
Don't blame him.

291
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,093
They said to keep going
until stones hit the car.

292
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,524
What if they miss us?

293
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:45,558
Then they miss out on $5 million,

294
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:47,026
and that ain't gonna happen, trust me.

295
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,997
<i>How are we for gas?</i>

296
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,877
<i>Not so good.</i>

297
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:55,335
We'll stop at the next place.

298
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:02,710
<i>Shit.</i>

299
00:31:03,188 --> 00:31:05,044
<i>Just go to the next town.</i>

300
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:07,448
<i>They're bound to have gas
around here somewhere.</i>

301
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:20,828
Gas, gas, right there.

302
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:34,608
Ah, damn it.

303
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:49,356
Ciao.

304
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,843
Petrol. Uh... petrolina.

305
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,890
Um... fuel.

306
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:04,438
We can pay well.

307
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:13,071
<i>Allora, benzina?</i>

308
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:06,499
White suitcases on a white car
in a snowstorm.

309
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:09,031
Reckon only the Lord can see us now.

310
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,575
Thank you, Lord.

311
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:40,872
Money.

312
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,201
- Evening.
- Money.

313
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,403
Hey, whoa, whoa.

314
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:46,573
Easy, easy, easy. Cut the shit.

315
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,475
- Give me the money.
- Where's the kid?

316
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:49,857
Where's the Getty boy?

317
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:52,396
Let me explain to you
how this is gonna work.

318
00:33:52,745 --> 00:33:54,814
No kid, no money.

319
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,867
Where's my son?

320
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,406
Where's Paul?

321
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:10,397
We will tell you where
he is when we have the money.

322
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,006
Fifty?

323
00:34:12,623 --> 00:34:15,736
We will not release the boy
without the money, understand?

324
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:17,904
That's not what we agreed!

325
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,775
You know that!

326
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,008
But this is what is happening.

327
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:24,143
Paul is not here, okay?

328
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,949
How do I know you won't
cut his other ear off?

329
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:29,035
Or slit his throat?

330
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:31,090
Or set him on fire?

331
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:35,445
If I give you the money,
what keeps you from doing that?

332
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:52,538
This is me. My face.

333
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:55,003
You don't get the boy alive,

334
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:57,110
you go to the police and say my name.

335
00:34:57,143 --> 00:34:58,646
Stefano Nizzuto.

336
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:05,789
Take it.

337
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:07,492
Huh?

338
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:19,049
You will continue the road to...
towards Reggio Calabria.

339
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:23,002
After a ruined church,
there is a pay phone.

340
00:35:23,603 --> 00:35:26,926
We will call the pay phone
and tell you where the boy is.

341
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,333
Hey!

342
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:03,542
Hey!

343
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:04,945
<i>Allora...</i>

344
00:36:35,156 --> 00:36:37,430
They always pay in the end.

345
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:21,455
<i>My great-grandmother started</i>

346
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,115
a delivery business in San Francisco

347
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:26,561
just after the earthquake.

348
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:30,163
She sat her office right down
in the middle of Chinatown.

349
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:31,931
Off-limits to white people at the time.

350
00:37:31,964 --> 00:37:33,471
Hmm.

351
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:36,268
Got her the concession
to deliver all the Chinese mail

352
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,204
- just off the boats.
- Nice.

353
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,290
Yeah.

354
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:42,508
She was scared of nobody.

355
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,626
Answered to nobody.

356
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:47,118
Did things her own damn way.

357
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,252
She'd disown me.

358
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,793
- Hey.
- Hey.

359
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:10,439
<i>Allora...</i>

360
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,073
<i>It'll ring.</i>

361
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:35,179
<i>What if it doesn't?</i>

362
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,163
<i>What then?</i>

363
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:39,228
<i>"He shall cover thee with his feathers</i>

364
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:42,377
"and under his wings shalt thou trust.

365
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:46,377
His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler."

366
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:50,105
Faith.

367
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,741
According to the Psalms.

368
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,538
A great bird.

369
00:39:56,944 --> 00:40:01,082
"Under his wings shalt thou trust."

370
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:06,654
Isn't that something?

371
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:17,520
Gail, no matter what the rights
and wrongs of the past...

372
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:23,673
you're the only one who has had faith.

373
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:28,809
You stood by your boy
in beating heat, freezing snow.

374
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:32,080
Everyone else has been frail

375
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:34,801
and selfish with their children.

376
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:37,985
And I count myself to be among them.

377
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:39,853
God forgive me.

378
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:48,531
Look, Gail, if I am wrong
and that phone don't ring,

379
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:51,332
you still will have proven
yourself to be a woman

380
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:56,119
of courage, faith and love.

381
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,712
But it's gonna ring.

382
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:14,743
No disrespect...

383
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:18,368
but you're kind of strange, Chace.

384
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,977
I've been called worse.

385
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:23,946
But you're the kindest man
I've ever met.

386
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:37,978
Hmm.

387
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:43,695
See?

388
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:26,507
- I fell asleep.
- It's okay.

389
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,250
I didn't.

390
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:38,749
It's not gonna ring.

391
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:43,949
It'll ring.

392
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,729
Pronto?

393
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:07,692
You talk, we find you.

394
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:10,491
- We kill you.
- I understand.

395
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:49,447
Time to get out.

396
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:51,392
Come on, out.

397
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:57,656
What about your girlfriend?

398
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:01,775
Hey. I'm freezing here.

399
00:46:04,712 --> 00:46:06,931
Your mother, she's waiting.

400
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,968
Near... that gas station.

401
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,969
Back there.

402
00:46:54,196 --> 00:46:57,049
Uh, hello?

403
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,369
Wait.

404
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:07,024
Help! Hey, don't...

405
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:08,426
don't do that.

406
00:47:09,274 --> 00:47:10,735
Help!

407
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,563
Please, come on. Don't do that, please.

408
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,713
Please.

409
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:56,107
Paul? Paul!

410
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:00,957
- He's not here.
- We'll find him.

411
00:48:01,036 --> 00:48:02,793
He's not here!

412
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,088
Paul?

413
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,708
Paul!

414
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:44,700
Paul!

415
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:47,603
Mama.

416
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,744
Oh, my baby.

417
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,399
Oh, my boy.

418
00:48:57,845 --> 00:48:59,931
Oh, my boy.

419
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,907
My boy.

420
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:12,470
Oh, my God.

421
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:14,266
Come on.

422
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:54,288

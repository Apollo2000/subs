00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:01,836
- And like the rest of your life is sane?
- Lucy talking to me

331
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:03,838
from the TV is weirder
by several orders of magnitude

332
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:05,471
than anything that's
ever happened to me.

333
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:06,841
So far.

334
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:09,509
Oh, at times
the universe does seem

335
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:12,212
to have singled you out
for unique abuse.

336
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:14,882
In these moments,
you gotta ask yourself:

337
00:29:14,982 --> 00:29:16,350
Would I rather be ignored?

338
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,118
Yes.

339
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:19,486
Okay, yes, ignore me.

340
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:22,156
Always better dead
than forgotten.

341
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:24,524
And no one is ever
gonna forget you.

342
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:26,326
Now, flattering as that may be,

343
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:27,946
this, on top of
your other adventures--

344
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:29,864
Hmm.

345
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,866
Sudden onset of strange.

346
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:35,502
Fair cause for consternation,
unless strange is a new language

347
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,939
and what we're doing here
is vocabulary building.

348
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,707
Fuck your vocabulary.

349
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,542
Okay?
This is gibberish.

350
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:46,080
Seems you have a choice.
You may have to consider

351
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,750
that you didn't see
what you saw.

352
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:54,054
- Or...
- Or you did.

353
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:56,356
The world is either crazy
or you are.

354
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:57,892
They're both solid options.
Take your pick,

355
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:00,727
and when you decide,
come and tell me.

356
00:30:00,895 --> 00:30:03,197
But don't rush into it.
Take your time.

357
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:06,100
Difficult decision.

358
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:11,838
They threatened
to reprogram reality.

359
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:13,941
I mean, is--
Is that what this is?

360
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,475
Are they just
fucking with my head?

361
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:17,111
Are you fucking with my head?

362
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:23,283
There are bigger sacrifices

363
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:25,785
one might be asked to make

364
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:28,388
than going a little mad.

365
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:38,999
Well, this is good.
This is very good.

366
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:40,099
You can read a list.

367
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:42,980
What--
What the hell is this?

368
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:47,041
- You don't have one.
- I don't want one.

369
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:49,576
Well, you need one. What if
someone wants to talk to you?

370
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:52,312
Why the hell would I want
to talk to anyone?

371
00:30:52,412 --> 00:30:53,914
Okay, what if I
need to talk to you, huh?

372
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:56,283
- Try shouting.
- What--

373
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:59,186
Or in a pinch...

374
00:30:59,286 --> 00:31:00,820
a telegram.

375
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,322
Oh, you know I miss those.

376
00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:04,791
Dots and dashes, secret code.

377
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,226
There was drama in there.

378
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:08,795
Someone gave you an envelope,
you got anticipation.

379
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:11,098
What's in there?
So you'd open it very slowly.

380
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,967
Every phrase chosen carefully

381
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,701
'cause they charge you
by the word.

382
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:17,004
First wire ever sent

383
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:20,374
by Samuel F.B. Morse
himself in 1844,

384
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:22,142
"What hath God wrought?"

385
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:25,679
Goddamn information age is what.

386
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:29,049
Best thing about these
states we're headed towards--

387
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:31,986
Minnesota, Wisconsin--

388
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:33,153
is that they have
the kind of women

389
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:34,989
that I loved when I was younger.

390
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:37,391
Pale-skinned, blue-eyed.

391
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,659
Hair so fair it's almost white.

392
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,163
Wine-colored lips,
full round breasts

393
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:44,731
with veins running through them

394
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,001
like a good cheese.

395
00:31:47,101 --> 00:31:51,538
Only when you were younger?
You did alright last night.

396
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:54,541
You wanna know the secret
of my success?

397
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:57,477
The secret is charm.

398
00:31:57,577 --> 00:31:59,613
Yeah, well, you either
got it or you don't.

399
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:02,016
Charms can be learned
like anything else.

Our other sister
is still asleep.

432
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:25,399
Something to warm
your bedside table.

Our guests stay for dinner.
Go back to store.

00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:30,837
A roast, six potatoes,
a rye loaf with seeds.

- No seeds, take the wheat.

You sit. You are guest.
Coffee first.

The Zorya sisters always
make a marvelous home.

We do okay.
We pay rent on time even.

00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:49,423
We make some money
from the slaughterhouse.

My sister and I make a dollar here,

I make the most of course.

It's because you tell
the prettiest lies.

The truth is not what
people want to hear.

You want from me.
My sisters are garbage.

You do not believe in fortunes.

I am nobody's wife.
Relatives.

493
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:25,939
We come over here together
long time ago.

494
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,242
Family is who you survive with
when you need to survive.

495
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:31,845
Even if you do not like them.

496
00:42:34,714 --> 00:42:36,115
Everything looks great.

497
00:42:36,215 --> 00:42:38,084
Meat will be tough,
potatoes will be soft.

498
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:39,986
I am not a good cook.

499
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:41,955
When I was young, there were
servants to make meals.

500
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:43,857
Here, there are no servants.

501
00:42:43,957 --> 00:42:47,393
There's only us,
and learning is beneath me.

502
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:48,728
[chuckles]

503
00:42:57,503 --> 00:42:59,673
Thought you were supposed
to read tea leaves.

504
00:42:59,773 --> 00:43:02,008
Tea is disgusting.

505
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:09,916
So what does it say?

506
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:13,119
[whispering]

507
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:18,792
You will have a long life,

508
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:21,895
and a happy one,
with many children.

509
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:27,366
That bad, huh?
Any good news?

510
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:29,869
Your mother die of cancer.

511
00:43:32,706 --> 00:43:33,873
Yeah.

512
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:36,375
You no die of cancer.

513
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:45,384
Czernobog: Can you get out?
I want you to get out!

514
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:47,253
And take your man with you.

515
00:43:47,353 --> 00:43:48,788
Or I will break him open...

516
00:43:48,888 --> 00:43:51,858
- Shh! Shh!
- ...and I will choke you slowly

517
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,092
with his heart.

518
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:55,428
I'm not going with you anywhere!

519
00:43:55,528 --> 00:43:57,797
- Shh!
- What's the matter? Let her wake up.

520
00:43:57,897 --> 00:44:00,366
Let your sister hear
this con man,

521
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:02,736
this son of a bitch,
come into my home

522
00:44:02,802 --> 00:44:05,772
and try to make me die.

523
00:44:05,872 --> 00:44:08,274
You brought that madness
into my life once.

524
00:44:08,374 --> 00:44:11,745
- Never again.
- They'll all be there.

525
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:15,949
- Everyone except you--
- [chuckles]

526
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:18,985
...each of them thinking
they know what strong is.

527
00:44:19,085 --> 00:44:22,088
And if you're not there
to show them otherwise...

528
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:25,024
They respect you.

529
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:26,926
They know you.

530
00:44:27,026 --> 00:44:28,227
No, no.
They don't know me.

531
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:31,130
You know me.

532
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,599
You know what
these hands have done.

533
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,069
You don't want me.
You want my brother,

534
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:38,137
and he's not here.

535
00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:40,774
Then we'll die.

536
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,943
It will be glorious,
win or lose.

537
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:46,780
I'm tired of glorious.

538
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:51,785
- Is something wrong?
- Nothing at all, my sister. Go back to sleep.

539
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:53,987
Mister Wednesday:
I'm not successful.

540
00:44:56,455 --> 00:44:57,455
We should go.

541
00:44:57,523 --> 00:44:59,959
Said you needed him.

542
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:01,160
There's always another way.

543
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,496
No, no, no. No.
Food is cooked.

544
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:08,401
Zorya Vechernyaya invited you
for dinner, right?

545
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:11,170
So you stay and you eat.

546
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:14,107
Otherwise, she will be insulted.

547
00:45:14,207 --> 00:45:16,142
You understand?

548
00:45:16,242 --> 00:45:17,811
But if you want to leave after,

549
00:45:17,911 --> 00:45:20,146
I will hold open the door.

550
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,817
[thunder rumbling]

551
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,318
♫♫

552
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:34,260
Mister Wednesday:
Mmm. Mmm.

553
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,929
Mmm!

554
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:38,364
Mmm.

555
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,235
Mmm.

556
00:45:42,335 --> 00:45:43,837
Mmm. Delicious.

557
00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:47,841
To think I nearly missed
this fabulous meal, hmm?

558
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:50,910
Thank you, ladies.
Shadow.

559
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,145
My old friend, hmm?

560
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:59,085
You're black, right?

561
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,858
That a problem?

562
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,961
Eh, we never much care about
skin, like the Americans.

563
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:12,098
Where we're from,
everyone has the same color,

564
00:46:12,198 --> 00:46:15,334
so we must fight over shades.

565
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:18,271
Hmm.

566
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:21,507
You see, my brother had
light hair and beard.

567
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:23,776
Me dark, like you.

568
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:26,779
I was like the black man
over there.

569
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,116
As against my brother,
the white.

570
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:31,584
[laughs]

571
00:46:31,684 --> 00:46:35,288
Everybody thought
he must be the good one.

572
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:38,024
Yeah.

573
00:46:38,124 --> 00:46:40,159
So I became me.

574
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:44,397
But time passes.
Now I'm gray.

575
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:48,968
Yeah, he too, I--
I believe, now is gray.

576
00:46:49,068 --> 00:46:50,937
So you wouldn't be able to tell

577
00:46:51,037 --> 00:46:54,307
who is light, who is dark.

578
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:57,944
So much for fighting over color.

579
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:02,448
Yeah, you see,

580
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:04,083
when we came to America,

581
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:06,252
we first came to New York.

582
00:47:06,352 --> 00:47:08,387
Everyone first come to New York.

583
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:09,522
New York was--

584
00:47:09,622 --> 00:47:11,124
Yeah, it was all right.

585
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:12,758
Sometimes even good,
right? Aye?

586
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:15,995
And then we came here, Chicago,
everything became bad.

587
00:47:16,095 --> 00:47:17,964
[chuckles]

588
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:20,466
I think in the old country,
you know, I am forgotten.

589
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:23,402
Here, I'm like a bad memory.

590
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:28,007
So, I had to find work,

591
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:31,477
and I found meat business.

592
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:32,578
You know it?

593
00:47:32,678 --> 00:47:34,480
I know the eating part.

594
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,149
I know the killing.

595
00:47:39,018 --> 00:47:41,054
[chuckles]

596
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:44,991
So I got job on killing
floor as a knocker.

597
00:47:45,091 --> 00:47:46,960
It was a good job.

598
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,962
Yeah, skilled labor.

599
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:53,032
A cow comes up the ramp.
Boom, boom, boom.

600
00:47:53,132 --> 00:47:55,334
And you take a sledge hammer,
and-- Boop!

601
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:58,604
You knock the cow dead.

602
00:47:58,704 --> 00:48:00,339
It takes strength.

603
00:48:00,439 --> 00:48:02,976
No cow-killing stories
during dinner.

604
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:06,012
How do you think meat get
on your plate? Huh?

605
00:48:06,112 --> 00:48:08,214
[chuckles]

606
00:48:08,314 --> 00:48:11,631
It takes strength,
but not only strength.

607
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:13,786
It takes talent,
because it's a craft.

608
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:15,721
You have to do it right,

609
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:18,024
or the cow gets angry.

610
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:21,694
And angry meat taste bad.

611
00:48:21,794 --> 00:48:24,297
Yeah, you need arms
to break the skull,

612
00:48:24,397 --> 00:48:26,199
but that's not the goal.

613
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:29,302
The goal is to crush
the brain inside the skull,

614
00:48:29,402 --> 00:48:32,438
and quick, before
the pain can travel

615
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:34,540
from outside the brain
to the inside,

616
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,310
so the brain never knows
the brain is crushing.

617
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:41,314
To give a good death is art.

618
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:43,716
But nowadays,
they have this bolt gun.

619
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:45,017
You know?

620
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:46,185
Put it on the forehead.

621
00:48:46,285 --> 00:48:48,254
[imitates gun firing]

622
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:50,356
Yeah.

623
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:52,791
Now every monkey
with a thumb can kill.

624
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:54,093
[chuckles]

625
00:48:54,193 --> 00:48:56,229
They sit there all day,
all night.

628
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:04,070
Yeah, so much for killing.

629
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:08,574
Hey, do you know checkers?

630
00:49:14,513 --> 00:49:17,150
[chuckles] I was in
prison for three years.

631
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,352
[laughs]

632
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:22,821
Yeah, people go crazy for chess.

633
00:49:23,056 --> 00:49:24,423
But you know what?

634
00:49:24,523 --> 00:49:27,126
Checkers is honest.

635
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:28,261
Hmm.

636
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:30,096
Every man's an equal.

637
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:32,198
Eh, exactly.

638
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:33,699
After you finish eating,

639
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:35,634
maybe you and I play checkers.

640

[inhales]

641
00:49:37,103 --> 00:49:38,837
I shall play black.

[chuckles]

643
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,208
Is good?

644
00:49:42,308 --> 00:49:45,111
- Is good.
- Yeah.

645
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:46,879
I like it. Confident.

646
00:49:47,146 --> 00:49:48,447
[laughs]

647
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:52,085
Maybe we even bet a little, huh?

648
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:53,719
You don't have to play him.

649
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:57,356
What do you say?

650
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:03,196
You guys play a lot of checkers?

651
00:50:03,296 --> 00:50:06,165
Oh, the sisters don't play.

652
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:09,968
But I keep sharp,
not like my arms.

653
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:12,037
They don't get the workout
they used to, huh?

654
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:16,142
[chuckles] No more killing
floor to swing my hammer.

655
00:50:19,178 --> 00:50:23,449
[chuckles]
First blood is mine.

656
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:28,787
So you've lost.
Game is done.

657
00:50:31,624 --> 00:50:34,227
I just started.

658
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:35,461
Hmm.

659
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:38,697
[chuckles]

660
00:50:38,797 --> 00:50:40,266
Confident.

661
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,739
You wanna see it?

662
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:49,242
See what?

663
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:51,477
The hammer.

664
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:56,382
The one I used to kill.

665
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,694
It's dull now, but...

666
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:12,731
The secret
to keeping it clean is use.

667
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:15,334
Yeah, blood feeds it,

668
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:19,272
gives it shine.

669
00:51:19,372 --> 00:51:23,176
You know, the best blood
flows at sunrise,

670
00:51:23,242 --> 00:51:26,779
when the cattle is rested,
fed, and calm.

671
00:51:28,981 --> 00:51:32,551
Oh, now my hammer
is red with rust.

672
00:51:32,651 --> 00:51:34,287
[chuckles]

673
00:51:34,387 --> 00:51:36,855
No more sunrise blood.
[chuckles]

674
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:47,766
Ten thousand deaths
made right here.

675
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:50,503
[blood dripping]

676
00:52:02,215 --> 00:52:05,518
Are you going to play or what?

677
00:52:07,453 --> 00:52:09,822
It's your move.

678
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:21,699
Your move.

679
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,302
[chuckles]

680
00:52:25,404 --> 00:52:30,276
Hey, we make a wager
on our little game, huh?

681
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:34,913
You relax.
This is not your game, okay?

682
00:52:35,013 --> 00:52:37,283
You see, your master
wants me to come with him

683
00:52:37,383 --> 00:52:40,353
to deal with his nonsense.

684
00:52:40,453 --> 00:52:41,654
[chuckles]

685
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:43,689
- [checker tapping]
- Well...

686
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:47,826
Listen. If I lose,

687
00:52:47,926 --> 00:52:51,129
I will go with Votan
and do what he asks,

688
00:52:51,264 --> 00:52:54,500
and I will nod
in front of the others.

689
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,902
And if you win?

690
00:52:57,002 --> 00:52:59,638
I get to knock your brains out
with my hammer.

691
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:06,111
But first, you have
to go down on your knees,

692
00:53:06,279 --> 00:53:08,481
and I will hit you with this.

693
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:10,983
Just one blow.

694
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:17,290
Right here.

695
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:18,757
Sunrise blood.

696
00:53:18,857 --> 00:53:19,892
Is good?

697
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:27,500
He'll take that shot...

698
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,304
no joke, no boast,
no half-measures.

699
00:53:33,772 --> 00:53:35,341
How good are you?

700
00:53:37,576 --> 00:53:39,312
How bad do you need him?

701
00:53:42,615 --> 00:53:43,682
It's your decision.

702
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:57,330
[chuckles]

703
00:53:57,396 --> 00:54:00,065
All right,
if-if all this is real,

704
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:04,069
and-- and-- and TVs talk,

705
00:54:04,337 --> 00:54:05,904
and she can read fortunes

706
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:08,206
and hammers bleed,

707
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:12,177

708
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:14,347

Yo, fuck it.

711
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,158
Is good.

712
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:27,960
Is good?

713
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,728
Yeah.

714
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:30,896
Good.

715
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:35,468

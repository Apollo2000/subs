1
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:09,898
I think I'm losing my mind.

2
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:12,091
Hello, Shadow.

3
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,177
There are bigger sacrifices

4
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:16,012
one might be asked to make

5
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,515
than going a little mad.

6
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:21,685
What's in Chicago?

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,770
The hammer.

8
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:28,692
If I lose, I will go with
Wōtan and do what he ask...

9
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,694
And if you win?

10
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,947
I get to knock your brains
out with my hammer.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,074

13
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,969
Right there.

14
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:54,170
Okay.

15
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,010
Mmm.

16
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,347
Mmm. Perfect.

17
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:05,849
It's too good for them.

18
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:09,853
Eight grandchildren,
each one smart as a table.

19
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,688
Assaf with his music.

20
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,940
He sounds like you. Yeah.

21
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:18,111
No, it's too early
to fry the onions.

22
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:20,196
Assaf likes them crisp.

23
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,366
No, no, it's not perfect.

24
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,452
More cinnamon.

25
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:32,709
Assaf? I told you
no come before 5!

26
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,928
And no more bringing me
your laundry!

27
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:38,097
I tell you I am done
being your maid--

28
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:41,351
You are in wrong floor.

29
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,052
Black people family is upstairs.

30
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:48,057
No mistake.

31
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:51,227
You are to come with me,
Mrs. Fadil.

32
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,782
You have died, Mrs. Fadil.

33
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,952
And it is time for you
to come with me.

34
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:01,738
I have company soon.

35
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:04,791
If you are here to rob,
then rob.

36
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,910
There is a television,
and I-- I have a phone

37
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,462
my grandson says
is also a camera.

38
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,167
I wish I was but a thief.

39
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,419
I am not.

40
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,721
I am of Death.

41
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:21,674
You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.

42
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,016
- That is me?
- That is you.

43
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,936
Your family will come soon
and find you.

44
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,155
They will do right by your body

45
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,690
and bury you as is proper.

46
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,492
They will be sad for a time,

47
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,778
then they will find
happiness again.

48
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:44,447
Your Assaf will marry in a year

49
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,750
and name his first daughter
for you.

50
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:49,502
A bullshit middle name?

51
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:52,956
A bullshit middle name.

52
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,875
This is how they will find me?

53
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,520
This is a Muslim home.

54
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,975
Why does Anubis hold out
his hand for me?

55
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,477
It is my thanks.

56
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,814
You were once a girl
with your own Tita.

57
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:20,783
Who taught you
the ways of Egypt old,

58
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:23,653
of when the Nile
was full and flooding.

59
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:27,740
She told you stories
of the Wolf and the Jackal,

60
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:30,627
the Red Wind,
and of the Child of Bast.

61
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:33,963
- I remember.
- You do.

62
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:38,418
For that,
I bring you to the Scales.

63
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,136
Come.

64
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:49,896
My family will find me.

65
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,100
They will not try it.

66
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,021
You taste.

67
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:06,112
It is perfect.

68
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,582
Sixty-eight years.

69
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:13,786
It's not much for America,

70
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:18,841
but... more than my Tita
ever prayed for.

71
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,711
Come.

72
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,570
This is not Queens.

73
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:22,989
This is not Queens.

74
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,054
I was using that.

75
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,473
We shall see
if you have used it well.

76
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,982
I was unkind

77
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,201
to the first boy who loved me.

78
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,655
I stole a doll once
from my cousin.

79
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:16,325
I-- I tried...

80
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,877
my best.

81
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,548
Your best is good.

82
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,433
Each will take you to the Du'at.

83
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,902
The Du'at has many worlds.

84
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:45,438
Choose.

85
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,442
Which has my father?

86
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:50,860
He beat me,

87
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:54,197
and I would like not
to see his world.

88
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:56,833
Choose.

89
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:03,873
You are a kind boy.

90
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,759
You choose for me?

91
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,699
Are you sure I do this with you?

92
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:31,784
Follow the wrong god,

93
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,821
I do not see my Tita again.

94
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:53,983
Careful!

95
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,546
The Buffalo is waning tonight.

96
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:15,004
You're Zorya Poluch... ch...

97
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,340
the sister that was sleeping.

98
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,760
I am Zorya Polunochnyaya, yes.

99
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:23,930
And you are called Shadow.

100
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,770
What are you
looking at up there?

101
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,856
I was looking at that.

102
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,074
See?

103
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,859
The Big Dipper?

104
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,161
Odin's Wain, they call it.

105
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:40,746
And the Great Bear.

106
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:44,867
It is a thing.
It's not a god.

107
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,202
Like a god.

108
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,621
It's a bad thing.

109
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:51,123
Chained up in those stars.

110
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,926
If it escapes, it will eat
the whole of everything.

111
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,544
So we watch the sky...

112
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,383
all day, all night,
the three sisters.

113
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,970
If he escapes,
the thing in the stars,

114
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:05,805
the world is over.

115
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,606
Like that.

116
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,026
And people believe that?

117
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,228
A long time ago.

118
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:16,899
You're not cold?

119
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,151
Cold doesn't bother me.

120
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:21,370
This time is my time.

121
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:25,458
My sisters,
they're of their times.

122
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:26,792
When is your time?

123
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,544
Your birthday?

124
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:31,714
No, I-- I don't want
my fortune told.

125
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,001
My fortunes are the best.

126
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,219
Virgins have the advantage.

127
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,058
And now we have something.

128
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:47,396
Oh.

129
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:48,597
No.

130
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,349
You have nothing.

131
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,486
You believe in nothing
so you have nothing.

132
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:57,857
You are on a path...

133
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:01,527
from nothing to everything.

134
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,780
You had something recently.
You lost it.

135
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,534
- My-- my wife.
- Not your wife.

136
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:12,171
Did you sell your head
to Czernobog?

137
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,592
Yeah.

138
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,295
You keep giving away your life.

139
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,264
You don't much care
if you live or die, do you?

140
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,635
The world's not
what I thought it would be.

141
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,474
You'd rather die

142
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,778
than live in a world
with bears in the sky.

143
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,900
I can help you.

144
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,953
- First, you must do something for me.
- What is it?

145
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:46,822
Gotta fight you?
Play checkers?

146
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,325
You have to kiss me.

147
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,160
I have not ever been kissed.

148
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:53,746
I don't know if I like it.

149
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:54,914
We do this now.

150
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,665
I--

151
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:07,176
Kissing is disgusting...

152
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:10,096
but-- but in a nice way,

153
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:14,483
like, uh, bleu cheese or brandy.

154
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,191
Take the moon.

155
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,028
What?

156
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,412
Just take it.

157
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,164
Here.

158
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:42,094
Don't lose this.
Don't give it away.

159
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:44,046
You've been given
protection once.

160
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,048
You had the sun itself.

161
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,217
I can give you the moon.

162
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:52,888
It's the daughter,
not the father.

163
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:55,558
Now...

164
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,193
you wake up.

165
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,875
Is not sunrise yet.

166
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,245
Enjoy your time.

167
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,382
How about another game?
Same terms.

168
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:23,252
How can be same?

169
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:26,055
You want me to kill you twice?

170
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,893
Right now you only have
one blow.

171
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:32,978
One is all it takes.

172
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,648
That is...

173
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,400
the art.

174
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,904
How long has it been...

175
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:46,659
since you last swung a killing
hammer in the stockyards, though?

176
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:49,111
It's gotta be, like,
what, twenty years?

177
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:51,413
Thirty?

178
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,333
I think you got used
to the bolt gun.

179
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:58,254
I think you got weak, and I don't
think you can kill me with one shot.

180
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,757
You could just leave me
brain damaged,

181
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:05,678
a drooling piss bag reminder
that you got old.

182
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:09,765
That's not gonna do
either of us any good, is it?

183
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,103
If you're gonna
smash my brains in,

184
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:16,272
I'd rather you finish the job.

185
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:25,481
I win, you come with me
and Mister Wednesday,

186
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,616
you'll still take your shot
when we're through.

187
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:30,653
But you win...

188
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:33,906
come sunrise,
you'll take your second swing,

189
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,407
if you need it.

190
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:39,545
No one needs to know but me.

191
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,565
Okay. Another game.

192
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:04,987
You are light, I'm dark.

193
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:19,201
Enough visiting.

194
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:20,703
Go to bed.

195
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,755
I'm trying to.

196
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,180
You deserve better than this.

197
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:34,183
You no like it,
you sleep on floor.

198
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:36,135
Is good enough for me.

199
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
You only learned
to live with less.

200
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,055
There is food, there is roof.

201
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:42,024
What more do you need?

202
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,810
A court to adore you.

203
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,480
In the old country,
you were draped with pearl,

204
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,983
loved, feared, waited upon.

205
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:53,535
Excess suits you.

206
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:57,239
Things will be better
again soon enough.

207
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,213
Ah.
Your turn.

208
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,248
Ah.

209
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:10,669
Mm-hmm.

210
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:11,920
Bye-bye.

211
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,174
In old country,

212
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,894
I opened the gate
for my father at dusk

213
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,929
when he returned to us,

214
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:25,734
then climb into
black satin sheet.

215
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,821
Here, I tell pretty fortune
for dollars.

216
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:33,776
Now, you've never told me mine.

217
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:42,785
This thing you want to do.

218
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,254
You will fail.

219
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,423
And they will win.

220
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,960
That's only my fortune today.

221
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:01,553
Come. Walk with me, hmm?

222
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,939
It will rain now.

223
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:05,941
Boy, will it ever.

224
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:09,361
Since when were you afraid of
getting a little wet, hmm?

225
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:25,294
You're playing
the same game, old man.

226
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:26,962
Only get to fool me once.

227
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:28,330
Shut your mouth.

228
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,666
Still so beautiful.

229
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,502
I thought I told
the pretty lies.

230
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:36,472
You want fortune
or you want truth.

231
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:39,057
Oh, I want knowledge
over comfort,

232
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,510
over all things, always.

233
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:44,763
They will kill you this time.

234
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,014
Ahh...

235
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:53,272
Do you remember
when we were young?

236
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:54,940
Barely.

237
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:59,528
Well, let me remind you.

238
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,209
What have you done?

239
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:40,903
I can taste you on the rain.

240
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,242
What else can I taste?

241
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,244
War.

242
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,584
All right.

243
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,288
I'll go with Wōtan
to his Wisconsin.

244
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,294
Then I'm gonna kill you.

245
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:44,132
Is good?

246
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:50,772
Is good.

247
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:45,944
Oh, you're up.
This is good.

248

- No, it hasn't.

250
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:54,336
You want some coffee?

251
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,982
You best be getting on, son.

252
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:27,069
Jack's Crocodile will take
a bite outta you.

253
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:29,821
You won't shoot.

254
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,907
You'll try,
but the gun will jam,

255
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:36,662
or worse it'll backfire
and you'll lose two fingers.

256

Excuse me.

293
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:49,748
Can you perhaps
call Mr. Blanding

294

and tell him I am still waiting?

295

Mr. Blanding.

He won't be coming back today.

301
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:32,757
Can I make an appointment
for tomorrow?

302
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,342
You have to telephone.

303
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:37,545
Appointments only by telephone.

304
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,216
I see.

305
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,552
Why are you smiling?

306
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:49,107
A salesman is naked

307
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:51,192
Tomorrow I will telephone.

Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fuck!

310
00:30:13,894 --> 00:30:18,063
Been driving this Allah-forsaken
taxi for 30 hours.

311
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:19,314
It's too much.

312
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:22,150
I spent the day
waiting to see a man

313
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,402
who will not see me.

314
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:27,038
My brother-in-law hates me.

315
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:29,124
I have been in America
for a week, and it

316
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:30,825
has done nothing
but eat my money.

317
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,660
I sell nothing.

318
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:34,996
Hmm.
What do you sell?

319
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,999
Worthless gew-gaws
and baubles

320
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:39,834
and tourist trinkets.

321
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,004
It's horrible, cheap,

322
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,640
foolish, ugly shit.

323
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:50,345
- You try and sell shit.
- I sell shit, yeah.

324
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,430
And they will not buy it?

325
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,348
- No.
- Eh, strange.

326
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:56,568
'Cause when you look in the stores
here, that's all they sell.

327
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:58,269
Shit.

328
00:30:58,355 --> 00:30:59,988
Take Eighth Avenue.

329
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:01,656
We'll go uptown that way.

330
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:04,085
My grandmother...

331
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:06,337
once swore that
she had seen an ifrit,

332
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,423
or perhaps a marid,

333
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,727
late one evening,
on the edge of the desert.

334
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:15,263
We all told her that it was
just a sandstorm,

335
00:32:15,348 --> 00:32:17,182
a little wind,

336
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:21,569
but she had seen its face.

337
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:25,690
And its eyes, like yours,
were burning flames.

338
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:31,029
Grandmothers came here, too.

339
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:33,865
Are there many jinn in New York?

340
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,783
No.

341
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:39,587
There are angels,

342
00:32:39,673 --> 00:32:42,790
there are men
who Allah made from mud.

343
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,680
Then there are
the people of the fire,

344
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:49,881
the jinn.

345
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:53,268
They know nothing
about my people here.

346
00:32:53,353 --> 00:32:56,721
They think all we do
is grant wishes.

347
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:59,474
If I could grant a wish, do you
think I would be driving a cab?

348
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:03,478
Once I had a man shit
in the back seat.

349
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:06,447
I had to clean wet shit
from that seat.

350
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,199
Tell me, is that right?

351
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,990
That's not right.

352
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:03,037
Keep the change.

353
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:20,555
I'm in room 318.

354
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:27,395
Going to 76th and Madison.

355
00:35:25,455 --> 00:35:28,423
I wish you can see what I see.

356
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,617
I do not grant wishes.

357
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:02,540
But you do.

358
00:39:43,596 --> 00:39:45,963
I do not grant wishes.

359
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:58,526
This is the bank
I'll be robbing,

360
00:39:58,611 --> 00:39:59,810
so let's go say hello.

361
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,228
Are you outta your goddamn mind?

362
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,897
Have a little faith, son.

363
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:04,065
Hell, no.

364
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,783
Well, how about faith
in a higher power

365
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,068
wanting me to succeed?

366
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:08,069
Fuck, no.

367
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:09,320
Oh, fuck, yes.

368
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:11,706
You're my bodyguard, huh?

369
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,624
That means you guard my body.

370
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,793
Is that not right?

371
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,079
Not when you're robbing a bank.

372
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:20,414
At the moment,
my body is going to the bank.

373
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,550
It's not robbing it.

374
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:23,751
Come on, learn.
It'll be fun.

375
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:25,419
All right, look.

376
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,595
We had a compact or whatever
the fuck you called it.

377
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,473
Okay? I'm not doing
anything illegal.

378
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:31,475
Oh, you're not.
Well, apart from maybe

379
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:32,927
a little aiding and abetting,

380
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:34,762
and, of course,
receiving stolen money.

381
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:36,230
I'll tell you what,
at the end of this,

382
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,099
you're gonna come out
smelling like a rose.

383
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:44,405
Fuck.

384
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,773
Fuck.

385
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,576
Fuck.

386
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:55,950
Excuse me. Could you tell me where
the deposit slips are, please?

387
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:57,368
Right out the front door
on the wall.

388
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,670
And if I needed to make
an overnight deposit?

389
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,422
- Same forms.
- Oh, thank you.

390
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:18,806
Oh, you do not look happy.

391
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:20,441
I am five days out of prison,

392
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:22,193
you're fixing to put me
back in by six.

393
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:25,362
Do not bleed before
you are wounded, huh?

394
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:27,732
Would you like me to
get you a hot chocolate?

395
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,457
Yeah, come on!
Let me buy you a hot cocoa.

396
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:34,038
Jot that number down.

397
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:56,343
Got you marshmallows
in your cocoa.

398
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,479
You like marshmallows?

399
00:41:57,563 --> 00:41:59,323
Why are you talking to me
about marshmallows?

400
00:41:59,398 --> 00:42:02,733
Like I'm worried
about marshmallows.

401
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:04,268
Yeah, I like marshmallows.

402
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:05,353
What we need is snow.

403
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:08,606
Hard, driving, irritating snow.

404
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,574
I want you to think "snow."

405
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:12,610
Think "snow."

406
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,245
Think "snow."

407
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:15,446
- Snow?
- Snow.

408
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:16,864
Yeah, snow.

409
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:19,033
See those clouds
over there to the west?

410
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:23,537
Concentrate on making
those bigger, darker.

411
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:27,208
Think about dark skies
and driving winds

412
00:42:27,293 --> 00:42:29,043
coming down from the Arctic.

413
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:32,379
- Think "snow."
- Okay.

414
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:34,381
- And how's this gonna help?
- Might not do anything.

415
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:37,268
But at least it will
concentrate your mind.

416
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:39,804
Snow, snow.

417
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:47,561
Snow.

418
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,124
Snow.

419
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:03,327
Snow.

420
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:15,890
We're here.

421
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:18,342
Well, I'm here.
You're somewhere else.

422
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:23,430
Just thinking about snow.

423
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:36,443
That woman thinks Jesus
suffered for her sins.

424
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:37,778
They're her sins.

425
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:40,948
Why should Jesus do
all the suffering?

426
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,450
'Cause his dad sacrificed
his ass.

427
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:44,668
Don't blame the parent.

428
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:47,171
Plenty of suffering
and blame to go around,

429
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,124
although that White Jesus, well,

430
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:52,626
could stand
a little more suffering.

431
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:57,298
He's doing very well
for himself these days.

432
00:43:57,383 --> 00:43:59,633
And how many colors
does Jesus come in?

433
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:03,020
Why, you got your
White Jesuit-style Jesus.

434
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:04,521
You got your
Black African Jesus.

435
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,307
You got your
Brown Mexican Jesus.

436
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:08,309
You got your swarthy Greek Jesus.
You've got--

437
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:10,945
Well, that's a--
That's a lotta Jesus.

438
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:14,782
There's a lotta need for Jesus,

439
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:18,786
so there's a lotta Jesus.

440
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,788
Now, the Mexican Jesus came here

441
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:22,656
the same way
a lot of Mexicans do.

442
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:23,908
- Illegally.
- Oh--

443
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,376
No, that's not being racial.

444
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:26,710
You can ask Him.

445
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:27,962
He'll tell you.

446
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:30,214
He waded across the Rio Grande,

447
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,917
his back as wet
as the epithet suggests.

448
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:34,802
Next customer.

449
00:44:34,887 --> 00:44:36,637
Good afternoon.

450
00:44:36,722 --> 00:44:39,173
I want to insta-print a couple
of sets of business cards.

451
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:42,593
And I may need your assistance
with printing some posters.

452
00:44:42,678 --> 00:44:44,645
Snow.

453
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,730
Snow.

454
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:47,514
Snow.

455
00:45:57,803 --> 00:45:59,420
I think that's enough.

456
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:02,473
Enough what?

457
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:05,225
Snow.

458
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:09,146
Don't want to immobilize
the city.

459
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:32,536
- I thought of snow.
- And it snowed.

460
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:34,254
What do you know?

461
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:45,966
I love this place.

462
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:47,968
Food's not particularly good,

463
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:49,686
but the ambiance--

464
00:46:49,805 --> 00:46:51,138
...unmissable.

465
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:53,440
Come on, eat up.

466
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:55,726
Can't rob a bank
on an empty stomach.

467
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:57,061
No, I'm not hungry.

468
00:46:57,146 --> 00:47:00,064
Who says you have
to be hungry to eat?

469
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:03,033
Wasn't supposed to snow today.

470
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,235
Wasn't even supposed to be cold.

471
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,740
So, you're perfectly
okay believing

472
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:12,292
that tiny people on television
can predict the weather,

473
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:14,661
but you crinkle
with consternation

474
00:47:14,747 --> 00:47:17,381
at the mere suggestion
that you could make it snow.

475
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,049
One of those things
is science, okay?

476
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:20,168
The other is fantasy.

477
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:21,385
You're talking about it

478
00:47:21,504 --> 00:47:22,970
like it's apples and oranges.

479
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:24,304
It's not apples
and oranges, okay?

480
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,974
It's reality and fantasy.

481
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:29,843
Oh, so that's how
the world works!

482
00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:31,845
It's either real
or it's fantasy?

483
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:33,347
Yeah, that's how
the world works.

484
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:35,682
Yeah, says the man
who hasn't seen it.

485
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:39,937
Shadow, at best, you suffer
from a failure of imagination.

486
00:47:40,022 --> 00:47:41,321
We're gonna have to fix that.

487
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:43,107
Uh-oh, look what
the goat dragged in.

488
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:44,358
- Cat.
- Goat.

489
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:45,659
Big, rank, stinking goat.

490
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:47,361
Mad Sweeney, you look like a man

491
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:50,197
who's fallen on hard times
from a great height.

492
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:52,666
Thought I wasn't gonna see you
until Wisconsin.

493
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:54,034
I'll never make it to Wisconsin,

494
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,650
not with the current
state of my luck.

495
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:57,538
This cunt's got my coin.

496
00:47:58,924 --> 00:48:00,591
Give me my coin, cunt.

497
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:04,178
- The coin you gave me?
- Witness. He has a point.

498
00:48:04,263 --> 00:48:06,597
I gave you the wrong coin.

499
00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:09,550
The one I gave you
was my lucky coin.

500
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:13,137
Well, you can't afford to be too
careless with a lucky coin.

501
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:14,862
Something like that,
you wanna hang on to.

502
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,225
Tell you what, I'll give you
your lucky coin back

503
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,195
when you tell me how you
plucked it out of thin air.

504
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,980
I plucked it outta thin air

505
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:26,116
is how I plucked it outta
thin air, ya bug-eatin' nonce.

506
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:31,738
Now give me my coin.

507
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:35,292
I threw it away.

508
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:39,496
Where did you throw it away?

509
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,834
Eagle Point, Indiana.

510
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:49,173
So, if you want your
lucky coin back,

511
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:51,925
make your way
to Parkview Cemetery.

512
00:48:52,011 --> 00:48:53,677
There you will find
my wife's grave

513
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:55,762
with your coin on top.

514
00:48:55,848 --> 00:48:58,765
Oh, you fucker.

515
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:01,485
Suppose I'll just be one more
in a long line of men

516
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:02,986
to climb on top
of your dead wife.

517
00:49:03,105 --> 00:49:05,189
Be nice.

518
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:09,693
- I'll see you in Wisconsin.
- Yeah.

519
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:12,496
Good luck, Mad Sweeney.

520
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:14,114
I'll see you back at the car.

521
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,250
Just make sure
he doesn't steal it, huh?

522
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,213
Now, you're gonna do a little light
shopping at the grocery store.

523
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:30,430
Pass a little time
at the phone booth.

524
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:31,798
If anybody asks you
what you're doing,

525
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:34,301
well, you're waiting for
a call from your girlfriend.

526
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:35,686
Her car broke down.

527
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,554
Here.

528
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,024
- Who the fuck is this?
- You the fuck is this.

529
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:44,778
"A. Haddock, Director of
Security, A1 Security Services."

530
00:49:44,863 --> 00:49:46,146
Yeah, that's you.

531
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:47,147
But what's the "A" stand for?

532
00:49:47,283 --> 00:49:50,484
Alberto? Alphonse? Augustine?

533
00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:52,369
Ambrose?
It's entirely up to you.

534
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:54,871
"Asshole" is what I feel like.

535
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,156
Nice to meet you, Asshole.

536
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:58,292
I'm James O'Gorman.
Jimmy to my friends.

537
00:49:58,377 --> 00:49:59,826
I got a card, too.

538
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:03,630
Okay. Let's get outta here.

539
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:08,385
I'm gonna leave you
with one question.

540
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:10,971
If at the end of this night
you do not end up in jail,

541
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:12,339
will you believe in me?

542
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:15,676
Don't answer that question.

543
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,452
No. No, no, no, no, no.

544
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:19,623
Fuck!

545
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:44,564
A1 Security Services.

546
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:46,233
Can I speak to A. Haddock?

547
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:47,851
Uh, this is Andy Haddock.

548
00:51:47,936 --> 00:51:49,770
Mr. Haddock,
this is the Chicago Police.

549
00:51:49,855 --> 00:51:51,488
You've got a man
at the First River Bank

550
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:52,856
on the corner
of Market and Second.

551
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:55,525
Uh... yeah.
That's-- That's right, Officer.

552
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:59,162
It-It should be James O'Gorman.
Is there a problem?

553
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:01,832
No problem, sir. Just wanted to
make sure everything's in order.

554
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,284
- Well, thank you.
- We're just concerned,

555
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,371
because something like this really
ought to be handled by two personnel.

556
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:09,423
Oh, tell me about yet.
B-Better yet,

557
00:52:09,508 --> 00:52:12,509
you tell those stingy bastards
down at First River Bank about it.

558
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:14,378
I mean, these are my men
I'm putting on the line.

559
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,129
You know, they're good men.

560
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:17,681
You know,

561
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,717
you sound like a bright
young man, Officer...

562
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:24,221
- Myerson.
- Officer Myerson.

563
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:26,473
If you ever need
any extra weekend work,

564
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:28,275
you just give us a call.

565
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,360
You got my card?

566
00:52:29,395 --> 00:52:30,477
Yes, sir.

567
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:32,028
Hang onto it.
You call us.

568
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:33,147
Yes, sir.

569
00:52:33,198 --> 00:52:34,648
Have a good evening, sir.

570
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:45,992
So that's what you do
to make money.

571
00:52:46,128 --> 00:52:48,328
You believe in me now?

572
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:49,996
I believe you exist.

573
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:53,550
Oh, I think I deserve a
little more faith than that.

574
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:55,635
Are you back in jail?
All that whining

575
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:58,338
about going back to jail,
and you haven't, have you?

576
00:52:58,474 --> 00:52:59,673
Not yet.

577
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:09,099
This is the
only country in the world

578
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:11,151
that wonders what it is.

579
00:53:11,236 --> 00:53:14,354
You've been to a lot of
other countries, have you?

580
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,023
No. No, never,
just this one.

581
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:18,859
Just that the others
know what they are.

582
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:22,529
I mean, no one wonders
about the heart of Norway

583
00:53:22,614 --> 00:53:25,332
or goes searching
for the soul of Mozambique.

584
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:26,700
Mozambique knows what it is.

585
00:53:26,835 --> 00:53:28,418
They all know what they are.

586
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:30,203
Americans know who they are.

587
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:31,705
They pretend they know.

588
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,290
But it's still just pretending,

589
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:34,541
like I'm pretending now.

590
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:35,542
Just like you.

591
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:36,843
What am I pretending?

592
00:53:38,096 --> 00:53:42,716
You are pretending you cannot
believe in impossible things.

593
00:53:47,022 --> 00:53:50,724
Uh, I'd be genuinely deluded
if I believed that shit.

594
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:52,893
If you are deluded,
I believe it's genuine.

595
00:53:52,978 --> 00:53:56,696
You don't strike me as
the disingenuous type.

596
00:54:15,717 --> 00:54:18,668
Okay, let's go.

597
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:22,256
Huh?

598
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:24,591
Did I make snow?

599
00:54:26,261 --> 00:54:28,094
Did you make snow?

600
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:36,353
Well, if you choose
to believe you made snow,

601
00:54:36,438 --> 00:54:39,523
then you get to live the rest
of your life believing

602
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:43,777
that you can do things
that are impossible.

603
00:54:43,862 --> 00:54:45,695
Or you can believe
it's a delusion.

604
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:47,914
No, see, delusions
feel real, okay?

605
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,617
That's why it's a delusion.
None of this feels real.

606
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:51,952
It feels like a dream.

607
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:55,922
What a beautiful,
beautiful thing

608
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:58,542
to be able to dream
when you're not asleep.

609
00:55:01,797 --> 00:55:04,681
I've-- I've crossed
enough paths

610
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,384
to know that one in four
people are rock stupid.

611
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:10,637
Even the smart ones have got some
kind of delusion they believe in,

612
00:55:10,722 --> 00:55:13,106
whether it's gods or ghosts.

613
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:19,312
Do you believe in love?

614
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:21,531
Yeah, I believe the shit
out of love.

615
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,401
Did you always?

616
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:26,152
Not before Laura.

617
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:28,822
So you didn't believe
till you did,

618
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:31,157
and then the world changed
because you believed.

619
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:34,828
Belief is only a product
of the company we keep

620
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:37,547
and how easily we scare.

621
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:39,215
And you do not scare easily.

622
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:43,053
And my company is questionable.

623
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:44,754
Always has been.

624
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,313
The only thing that scares me
is being forgotten.

625
00:55:53,398 --> 00:55:56,983
I can survive most things
but not that.

626
00:55:57,069 --> 00:56:01,855
Very best part of memory is
it's mostly about forgetting.

627
00:56:02,324 --> 00:56:05,325
We remember what's
important to us.

628
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:10,747
I wonder what'll be the first thing
that drifts through your mind

629
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:12,699
when you look back
on this evening?

630
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,871
Snow, I bet.

631
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:45,365
Room 55.

632
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:48,928
Hi, puppy.

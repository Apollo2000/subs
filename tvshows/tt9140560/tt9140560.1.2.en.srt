1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
Previously on WandaVision...

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,754
We are an unusual couple, ya know?

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,342
My wife and her flying saucers.

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,053
My husband and his indestructible head.

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,889
Hello, dear.
I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.

6
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,724
You're like a walking computer.

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,351
What? I most certainly am not.

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,270
Dinner with Mr. Hart
and his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart.

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,414
What brought you here?

10
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,791
- How long have you been married?
- Why did you come here?

11
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,108
Damn it, why?

12
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,736
Stop it. Stop it.

13
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,572
Vision, help him.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,074

15
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,702
What was that?

16
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,420
Wanda?

17
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,504
Yes, dear?

18
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,174
Are you using your powers
to turn on the light?

19
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,633
Yes, dear.

20
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,468
Allow me, sweetheart.

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,100
What do you see?

22
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,811
Only your lovely rose bushes.

23
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,855
That's all?

24
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,232
Are you using your night vision, Vision?

25
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,484
I assure you, my love,
I see nothing amiss.

26
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,820
You have absolutely
no reason to be frightened...

27
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,743
You were saying?

28
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,787
Actually, I did overhear
a couple of lads at work

29
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,957
remarking on a few unsavory characters
settling in the neighborhood.

30
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,002
Now, who knows
what those ne'er-do-wells might be up to?

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,254
Robbing houses, vandalizing property.

32
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,007
Walking through walls,
moving objects without touching them.

33
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,636
Wanda, darling, you can't be suggesting
my colleagues were referring to us.

34
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,643
One of us should really
determine the source of that sound.

35
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,479
Yes, one of us should.

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,482
Oh, this is getting ridiculous.

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,984
I'm going to take a look.

38
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,819
Oh, God! Darling!

39
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,202
Well, I think we handled that well.

40
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,412
Yes, I must say
I'm rather proud of myself.

41
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,542
And look how you seized
on the opportunity to redecorate.

42
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,211
- This is better, isn't it?
- Mmm.

43
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,298
Wanda, darling?

44
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,550
Yes, dear?

45
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,260
Get the light.

46
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,071
WandaVision!

47
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,165
WandaVision!

48
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,097
WandaVision Wa-WandaVision

49
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,641
WandaVision Wa-WandaVision

50
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,686
WandaVision Wa-WandaVision

51
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,397
WandaVision!

52
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,904
Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick,

53
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:01,283
I bring you the Cabinet of Mysteries.

54
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,705
- Darling, that's your cue.
- You said, "Cabinet of Mysteries?"

55
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,292
I said, "The Cabinet of Mysteries."

56
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,086
Oh, that's my cue. Ooh!

57
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,506
Holy Toledo!

58
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,051
Darling, do all the other acts
in the talent show

59
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,345
have such elaborate props?

60
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,555
Are you kidding?

61
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,224
Fred and Linda are building a moat

62
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,143
and a fully-functioning portcullis
and no one even knows why.

63
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,311
Let's keep going.

64
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,355
Yes, yes. Where was I? Um...

65
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,067
Watch closely as I, Illusion,
Master of Enigma,

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,779
make my captivating assistant,
Glamour, disappear.

67
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,451
You really are very dashing.

68
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,119
Mmm, thank you, darling.

69
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,205
Fear not, Glamour.

70
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,835
For I, Illusion,
vow to bring you back exactly as you are.

71
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,588
Abracadabra!

72
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,385
Ta-ta...

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,684
Yes, um, Wanda, you're not at all worried

74
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,729
that the audience might just see
through this little charade?

75
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,398
Well, that's the whole point.

76
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,859
In a real magic act, everything is fake.

77
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,531
Darling, the talent show fundraiser
is the most important event of the season

78
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,409
and it's our neighborly duty
to participate.

79
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,996
Plus, it's our chance to appear
as normal as possible while doing so.

80
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,456
Well, I don't think
that should be a problem.

81
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,709
This is our home now.

82
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,212
I want us to fit in.

83
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,841
Oh, darling, we do. We shall.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,178
And we're gonna knock their socks off,

85
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,473
especially with you wearing this.

86
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,684
Oh, that's actually
the rest of your costume.

87
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,768
Oh!

88
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,063
Well, I better get going

89
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,274
If I'm gonna make
the planning committee meeting.

90
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,942
That's me off as well, actually.

91
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,045
There's a gathering
of the neighborhood watch

92
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,654
at the public library.

93
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,948
And after last night's excitement,

94
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,368
I want to make sure
this town's security is up to snuff.

95
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,078
That's a swell idea.

96
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,249
You tell those tree branches who's boss.

97
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,960
Would you look at us?

98
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,922
Wanda and Vision, Westview fitter-inners.

99
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,884
I'll see you at curtain call.

100
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:37,833
Look, it's the star o' the show.

101
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,001
Agnes.

102
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,962
I'm sorry. What did you say?

103
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,132
Oh, I brought my pet rabbit.
For your magic act.

104
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,428
Yes, of course! Thank you, Agnes.

105
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,306
We will take good care of him.

106
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,058
Señor Scratchy just loves the stage.

107
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,395
He played baby Jesus
in last year's Christmas pageant.

108
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,105
Oh.

109
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,109
Oh, morning, Dennis.

110
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,611
Morning, Agnes.

111
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,778
Stick 'em up.

112
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,990
Don't shoot. I'm just a messenger.

113
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,742
Pew-pew!

114
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,203
Mmm.

115
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,457
- Shall we?
- Oh, we shall.

116
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:27,466
So, are you ready to meet Queen Cul de Sac
and her Merry Homemakers?

117
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,760
Agnes,
Dottie can't be as bad as you say.

118
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,972
Hmm, well, you'll notice
her roses bloom under penalty of death.

119
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,395
Wanda, can I give you
a bit of friendly advice?

120
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,189
Is it about the way how I'm dressed?

121
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,233
Yes, but it's too late for that.

122
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,445
Dottie is the key
to everything in this town.

123
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,949
Country club memberships, parties,
school admissions...

124
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,243
Well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

125
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,913
You get in with Dottie and it'll be
smooth sailing from here on out.

126
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,583
Just mind your P's and Q's
and you're gonna do just fine.

127
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,753
Or maybe I could just be myself?
More or less?

128
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,594
Oh, Wanda, that's good.

129
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,474
Everybody, hurry up please.

130
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,270
Hiya, Dottie! Your roses are divine.

131
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,689
Well, thank you.

132
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,659
The Rotary Club is finishing
the stage set-up as we speak.

133
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,036
They've given the gazebo
a fresh coat of paint

134
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,957
and will be installing the final
decorations all through the town square.

135
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,917
And if you recognize
the antique footlights,

136
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,128
it's because they're from my store.

137
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,713
And the chairs?

138
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,926
I'm sorry, Dottie.
I didn't ask about the chairs.

139
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,972
So you better not ask me if you can
chair any committees in the future.

140
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,477
The devil's in the details, Bev.

141
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,938
That's not the only place he is.

142
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,149
As you all know, the talent show

143
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,068
is the sole fundraiser
for Westview Elementary.

144
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,195
This might help.

145
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,906
In the eight years
since I founded our little club,

146
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,242
this event has gotten
bigger and better every season.

147
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,120
Say, those pants are peachy keen.

148
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,747
Do you really think so?

149
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,082
The other ladies are in skirts.
I was worried.

150
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,168
We only have a few hours until show time,

151
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,421
so a little less cross chatter
and a little more focus.

152
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,423
Okay.

153
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,468
Those little boys and girls
are counting on us.

154
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,346
All of this is for the children.

155
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,764
"For the children."

156
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,391
"For the children."

157
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,815
So, I want you all
to give yourselves a big hand...

158
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,446
...at the appropriate time, of course.

159
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,991
But first let's review event etiquette.

160
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,953
Dress code is upscale garden party...

161
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,122
The only reason I didn't clap
is because I'm afraid to move.

162
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,290
Yeah.

163
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,626
I actually don't know what I'm doing here.

164
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,921
I'm starting to feel that way myself.
I'm Wanda.

165
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,259
- I'm, uh... Geraldine.
- Hi.

166
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,302
And I'm irritated.

167
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,100
Tickets for tonight
are completely sold out.

168
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,018
Now, you can clap.

169
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,272
And stop.

170
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,359
Really, how is anybody doing this sober?

171
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,246
- Let's say green.
- Yeah.

172
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,081
I mean, the other side could be dirt.

173
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,876
Pardon me.
Is this the neighborhood watch meeting?

174
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,421
Oh, hiya, Vision.

175
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,548
Didn't expect to see you here.

176
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,761
This is sort of
a "members only" type deal.

177
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,639
Ah! Certainly. Right. Well...

178
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,851
I'll just stay here
and be as quiet as a church mouse

179
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,061
till you open up the floor
for new business.

180
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,148
Well, in truth,
we were just getting to new business.

181
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,193
Oh, splendid! Could you tell me
how often you rotate security patrols?

182
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,695
Do you interface directly
with local law enforcement?

183
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,031
What are your protocols for threats
such as burglary,

184
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,449
graffiti, and reckless driving?

185
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,535
- No, Vision.
- I know these are indeed grave matters.

186
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,997
"New business"
actually means another round of Danish.

187
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,542
Raspberry or cheese-filled?

188
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,961
Oh, neither for me, thank you.
I don't eat food.

189
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:43,222
What I mean to say is that I don't eat
food in between meals but at mealtimes.

190
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,891
I'm a regular eating machine.

191
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,313
Hey, fellas.
Vision here has got a point.

192
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,275
Now, listen up. I got some
top secret intelligence for you.

193
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,401
Oh, excellent.

194
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,904
Now, you know
how Johnson's been braggin'

195
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,781
about that treehouse
he built for his kids?

196
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:01,990
Yeah.

197
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,076
It's a prefab job.

198
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,663
That blockhead can't even swing a hammer.

199
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,623
I can do you one better.

200
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,125
You know those bowling trophies
Arthur's always polishing?

201
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,338
He bought 'em all
at a yard sale in Hackensack.

202
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,341
I knew it. I've never once seen him
down at the lanes.

203
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,471
I too have
some top secret gossip to share.

204
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,101
Norm here's a Communist.

205
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,154
Vision, you're a real cut-up.

206
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,532
You know, I always
thought you were kind of a square.

207
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,077
Me? No, I'm as round as they come.

208
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,080
Hey, care for a stick o' Big Red?

209
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,832
Well, hold on there a second.

210
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,209
Didn't you hear the man?
He doesn't eat food.

211
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,836
Is gum food?

212
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,547
Well, my understanding
is that it's purely for mastication.

213
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,966
No, I don't do that.

214
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,887
Well, when in Westview... Cheers.

215
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,307
Who knew you were such a funny guy?

216
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,895
And to think you came here all hot
and bothered about protocols and nonsense.

217
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,938
We actually thought you were serious.

218
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:27,034
He's funny.
All right, so, back to this barbeque.

219
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:37,211
That is why you never do
a seating chart on an empty stomach.

220
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,339
Golly, you're a whiz
at all this committee stuff, Dottie.

221
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:44,593
Thank you for choosing me to help
you clean up today. I feel so lucky.

222
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,220
You are.

223
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,768
I can't help but wonder if you and I

224
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,187
haven't gotten off
on the wrong foot, Dottie.

225
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,690
And I would like to correct that if I can.

226
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,484
And how would you do that?

227
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,073
I've heard things about you.

228
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,202
You and your husband.

229
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,248
Well, I don't know what you've been told,

230
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,671
but I assure you
I don't mean anyone any harm.

231
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,258
I don't believe you.

232
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,308
Wanda. Wanda, can you read me, over?

233
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,436
- Wanda?
- Who is that?

234
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,729
Wanda?

235
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,610
Who are you?

236
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,154
Wanda?

237
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,198
Wanda.

238
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,868
Who is doing this to you, Wanda?

239
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,538
Wanda? Wanda? Wan...

240
00:15:58,876 --> 00:15:59,960
Dottie!

241
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,049
You... Oh!

242
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,224
Pop quiz, Wanda.

243
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,687
How does a housewife
get a bloodstain out of white linen?

244
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,524
By doing it herself.

245
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:36,288
They say a man is never fully-dressed
without two important accessories.

246
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,040
His special lady...

247
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,711
and his Strücker.

248
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,762
Strücker. He'll make time for you.

249
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,615
Glad I don't have to follow this guy.

250
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,242
Huh? What?

251
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,369
Oh, but you're gonna be great.

252
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,289
What time is it now?

253
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,583
Mmm, two minutes
after the last time you asked.

254
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,461
I don't know where he could be.

255
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,218
Oh, is that him?

256
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,555
Well, it looks like
he's got a little hitch in his giddy-up.

257
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:35,931
Whoa!

258
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,647
Wanda, my little cabbage,
you look smashing!

259
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,148
Whoa!

260
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,778
- Vis.
- Hmm.

261
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,196
- Where have you been?
- Oh.

262
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,740
Uh, well, me and the boys were playing

263
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,618
a rather thrilling
game of horses with shoes.

264
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,870
No, that's not it.

265
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,830
Shoe horses! No.

266
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,790
Ah! Horse's shoes.

267
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:06,003
Listen, something strange
happened with Dottie.

268
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:10,966
Well, something strange happened
before that, too. It's hard to explain.

269
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,552
I was just playing with his shoes.

270
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,262
What is going on?

271
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,430
You are!

272
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,723
Huh?

273
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,226
I want to thank you all for coming out

274
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,606
to support Westview Elementary,
"For the children."

275
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,900
"For the children."

276
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,193
And for our final act...

277
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:33,197
I give you, Wanda and Vision.

278
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,299
Hey! Hey! You're up, Cowboy!

279
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,510
What?

280
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,471
Oh! Yeah! I've to go!

281
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,683
Hello, Westview! Good afternoon.

282
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,101
It's so lovely to be...

283
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,646
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

284
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,941
I am Glamour and this
is my delightful assistant, Illusion.

285
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:13,320
I am Glamour and he's Illusion.

286
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,406
Yeah, what she said.

287
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,621
Today, we will lie to you and yet
you will believe our little deceptions

288
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,540
because human beings are easily fooled

289
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:28,669
due to their limited understanding
of the inner workings of the universe.

290
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,128
Flourish!

291
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,256
You just do it,
you don't say it out loud, honey.

292
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,386
And now my wife and I will delight

293
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,097
in your dumbstruck little faces.

294
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,766
Flourish!

295
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,992
Ha! See there? He's using a rope.

296
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:04,329
Wanda, what's... Oh, no!
Oh! No! Wanda, please!

297
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,165
- Darling, let me down!
- Oh!

298
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:11,003
I'm feeling pukey!

299
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,421
Ooh!

300
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,593
Uh, what's next?

301
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,929
Oh! Yeah, this is...
This is gonna be great!

302
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,099
A staggering feat of strength.

303
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,066
- Ah?
- Illusion... Uh... Uh...

304
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:38,864
- Illusion, Master of Enigma, allow me.
- Yeah?

305
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,283
What?

306
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,744
Oh!

307
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,290
Whoops! You weren't supposed to see
how we did that trick.

308
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,294
That was my grandmother's piano.

309
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,341
Oh, Sherbert! Yeah,
this is my old mate, Sherbert.

310
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,760
Stand up, Sherbert.
Say hello to the crowd.

311
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,428
It's Herbert, Herb.

312
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:05,516
Pipe down, Sherbie, and pick a card.
Any card.

313
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,060
Yeah, put it back in the deck.

314
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,230
I'm not looking. All right. Watch this.

315
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:14,983
Is this your card?

316
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,528
Uh, no.

317
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,738
I beg to differ.

318
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:20,906
Mmm-mmm.

319
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,659
Really? Is this your card?

320
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,869
- Vision...
- Mmm-mmm.

321
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,249
Is this your card? Is this your card?
Is this your card? Is this your card?

322
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,460
- Is this your card?
- Mmm-mmm.

323
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,504
Argh! Is this your card?
Is this your card?

324
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:36,856
- No. No. No. No.
- Is this your card?

325
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,925
Is this your card? Is this your card?
Is this your card? Is this your card?

326
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,218
Is this your card?

327
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,511
Oh, it is!

328
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:43,679
It is what?

329
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,930
It's my card.

330
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,350
Well, pardon me, Herb. Have it back.

331
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,936
Oh, no, you did the trick right.

332
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,564
Well, of course I did the trick right!
I'm Illusion!

333
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,566
Flourish!

334
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,904
And now, for my next trick...

335
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,614
Oh, goodness me.

336
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,950
Who stole my hat?

337
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,952
Oh! Oh, stop that rabbit!

338
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,329
I gotta need to pull a hat out of it.

339
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,959
Señor Scratchy's got real star quality,
don't you think?

340
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,504
Maybe we leave the poor bunny
out this one, shall we?

341
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,299
Well then,
I will just have to pull this hat...

342
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,385
...out of myself.

343
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,014
Vision, no.

344
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,473
I'm doin' it.

345
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,603
Ah-ha!

346
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:39,359
If only you all knew our secret.

347
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,863
Oh!

348
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,823
Is that how mirrors work?

349
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,158
Shut up, Bev.

350
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,705
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for our grand finale.

351
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:56,835
I bring you, The Magnet of Crysteries!

352
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,295
The Cabinet of Mysteries!

353
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,714
Yeah, yeah. What she said.

354
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,426
I will now make my wife...

355
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,471
...disappear.

356
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:14,478
Are you sure you don't want an audience
volunteer named "My husband Ralph?"

357
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,985
No. Abracadabra!

358
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,324
- Uh, sweetheart?
- Yeah?

359
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,160
- Hi.
- Oh.

360
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,081
What's in the box?

361
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,751
What's in the box?
What's in the box? What's in the box?

362
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,670
Yeah, what's in the box?

363
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,922
What's in the box?
What's in the box?

364
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,133
What's in the box?
What's in the box?

365
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:52,975
Oh!

366
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,185
Oh, yes!

367
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,353
Flourish.

368
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,195
Let's get outta here.

369
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,739
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

370
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,575
- I'm so stupid.
- Vis? Vis, it's all right.

371
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,427
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

372
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,786
But what is going on with you?

373
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,915
I have no idea.
I've been feeling weirdy all day.

374
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,667
Okay. Okay. Okay.

375
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,837
Oh!

376
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,390
Would you look at that?

377
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,642
That really gummed up my works, didn't it?

378
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,352
Hmm.

379
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,523
I'm not as funny without it, am I?

380
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,276
Well, you're back to yourself
and that's all I care about.

381
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,403
Now, let's get out of here before Dottie

382
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,948
and the planning committee
string us up for ruining the show.

383
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,918
You two, stop right there.

384
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:08,091
Nothing like what you two just did up here

385
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:11,887
has ever happened
in the history of our talent show.

386
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:16,475
Dottie, we are so...

387
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,684
Hilarious.

388
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:24,107
That was the most hilarious act
we've ever seen.

389
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,442
Wouldn't you all agree?

390
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,361
Yeah.

391
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,323
Oh, yes.

392
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,784
You two, come on up. Come on.

393
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,164
On behalf of the planning committee,

394
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:40,457
I would like to award you

395
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:44,545
with the inaugural
Comedy Performance of the Year.

396
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,046
Oh, thank you.

397
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,605
- I have to ask.
- Hmm.

398
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:08,026
One second, I'm backstage and in the next,
I'm in a dark cubby hole.

399
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,403
How'd you do it?

400
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,530
Oh, a magician never reveals his secrets.

401
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,323
He leaves that to his assistant.

402
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,992
And she's not talking.

403
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,162
I had a feeling you'd say that.

404
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,251
"For the children!"

405
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,545
"For the children!"

406
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,928
You were tremendous, Glamour.

407
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,639
As were you, Illusion.

408
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,895
I don't know what I was so worried about.

409
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:46,398
It wasn't so hard to fit in after all.

410
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:49,401
And all we had to do was be ourselves.

411
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,862
Well, with a few modifications.

412
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:55,699
- And it was all for the children.
- For the children.

413
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,994
Well, I think the children
might need some popcorn.

414
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,455
Wanda.

415
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,706
Hmm, what?

416
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,797
Vision... Is this really happening?

417
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,469
Yes, my love.

418
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,262
It's really happening.

419
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:24,728
If it's that damn tree again,
I am going to rip it out by the roots!

420
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,695
I don't see anything.

421
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,125
What is that?

422
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,218
Wanda.

423
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,192
No.

424
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,706
Vision... Is this really happening?

425
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,876
Yes, my love.

426
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,004
It's really happening.

427
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,268
Vision...

428
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,888
Wanda?
Who's doing this to you, Wanda?

429
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:24,640
Wanda?

430

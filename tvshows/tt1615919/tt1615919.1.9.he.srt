1
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:04,746
Good morning, marketeers.

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:08,349
Now I don't think I need to tell everyone
that today is not just any Saturday.

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:12,714
It is the Saturday,
the Saturday before the Thursday.

4
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:16,148
Oh, uh, sorry, Betty, um...

5
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,552
Thank you.

6
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:26,088
Why is Betty always
the only one with store spirit?

7
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:27,474
What's Thursday?

8
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,136
Thanksgiving.

9
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:31,367
Ah, yeah, I forgot, hah.

10
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:32,916
How could you forget Thanksgiving?

11
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:34,995
We don't really think of it
as Thanksgiving.

12
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:37,729
We think of it as the only Thursday
of the year we don't have to work.

13
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:40,981
Well that, and Senior Skip Day,
which my dad still celebrates.

14
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:44,694
Now, we will start employing
subliminal directions.

15
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,271
If somebody asks you where the cereal is,
you tell them...

16
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:49,381
"Go to the turkey, make a left...

17
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,291
"and when you pass the yams
and the cranberry sauce...

18
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,291
"it will be on the right hand side."
Josh!

19
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:57,106
- Where are the pickles?
- They're right behind you.

20
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:00,099
Okay.

21
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,984
One more time.

22
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,778
I can't believe you
don't do anything.

23
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,380
I love Thanksgiving.

24
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:07,849
Seeing all four of my
grandparents together

25
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,652
just makes me feel really
connected to my family.

26
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,687
I've never met
Hope's grandparents.

27
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,155
Lucy never introduced you

28
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:16,057
during your storybook
romantic courtship?

29
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,325
Oh, right.

30
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:18,693
You did it in the back
of your van,

31
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,128
and then she was executed.

32
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:22,263
You know, it cheapens it
when you say it like that.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,366
Mmm. Maybe Hope should
meet her grandparents.

34
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,102
All right, crew,
let's bring it in.

35
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:29,003
Come on.

36
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,005
<i>Store opens in 30 seconds.</i>

37
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,757
Chop-chop.
We only get one shot at this.

38
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,875
Okay, team.

39
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,894
"Gobble, gobble," on three.

40
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:39,380
One, two, three.

41
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,282
Gobble, gobble!

42
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:49,207
This is why
our softball team sucks.

43
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:55,044
+

44
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:58,326
+

45
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:08,026
+

46
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:13,830
+

47
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,425
+

48
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,769
+

49
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:24,088
Ah, what are you
guys doing here?

50
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:24,959
<i>We wanted to talk to you</i>

51
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:26,728
about what we're going
to blow up on Thursday.

52
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:28,980
Yeah, we found a deer head
some hunter left in the woods.

53
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:30,398
It would be spectacular.

54
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,951
And I think it would be
disrespectful and macabre.

55
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,503
Ever since you learned
that word,

56
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,238
everything is macabre to you.
Listen, guys.

57
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,108
I'm not sure I can blow
something up this year.

58
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,793
Pretty sure I'm going
to do a family thing.

59
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:44,879
But, for the record, I think
the deer head sounds awesome.

60
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,583
So you're just blowing us off
for a family thing?

61
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:51,052
Dude, that is macabre.

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,475
I can't believe
you bought a turkey.

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,328
For all the money you spent
on that thing,

64
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,290
you have any idea how many
pizzas we could have bought?

65
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:05,381
Two.
I'm not going to deprive Hope

66
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,999
- Untranslated subtitle -

67
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:08,897
of Thanksgiving
the way you deprived me.

68
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:10,138
We're having turkey.

69
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,440
And I'm thinking of inviting
Hope's other grandparents over.

70
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,409
The murderer's parents?
That's crazy.

71
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:15,877
We don't even
know those people.

72
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,279
Creeps me out...
The thought of sharing our table

73
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,114
with the parents
of a serial killer.

74
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:22,450
Would you eat
with Mr. and Mrs. Dahmer?

75
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:25,920
Or the parents of that chimp
that ate that lady's face?

76
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,205
That's creepy, man.

77
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,590
Creepy.

78
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:30,992
Look, guys, I know
we may not be able

79
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,794
to get Hope
the best things in life

80
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,996
<i>or even the second best things.
We may be able to get her</i>

81
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,898
the third best things,
but even those

82
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,166
will probably come secondhand.

83
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:40,001
This is something
we can actually do.

84
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,569
Now, as a parent...

85
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,071
Fine, if it'll get you to end

86
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:44,862
your big, stupid speech,
we'll do it.

87
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:50,979
Great.

88
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,816
That's two and a half hours
we'll never get back.

89
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,022
I'm Jimmy.

90
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,357
Uh, I tried calling,

91
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,892
but I felt weird
saying this on a machine.

92
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:07,729
Um, I'm the guy
who impregnated your daughter

93
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:09,297
before she got electrocuted.

94
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:16,337
Well, hello.

95
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,339
I, um, I'm Dale.

96
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,807
You can call me "Dr. Dale."

97
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,208
Because I'm a doctor.

98
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,578
But just call her "Margine"
because she's not a doctor.

99
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,545
So...

100
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,581
I'm going to go to the kitchen

101
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:29,117
and make some iced tea
for the person who is here.

102
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,219
Yeah.

103
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,453
Is she okay?

104
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,088
Well, Margine
has not handled the fact

105
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:35,857
that our daughter
became a serial killer

106
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,393
But we're getting there!

107
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,995
We're not getting there.

108
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,664
Yeah, the psychiatric
community frowns

109
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,465
on therapists
treating their spouses,

110
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,602
but she was my patient
before we started dating, so...

111
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,704
Here's your iced tea.

112
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,572
It's empty.

113
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,241
Just drink her iced tea.

114
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:01,949
Listen. I came over to invite you over
to our house for Thanksgiving.

115
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:03,468
You could, uh,

116
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,353
meet your granddaughter.
She's pretty cute.

117
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:06,854
I got her picture here.

118
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:08,222
Keep it in my wallet

119
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,091
next to the condom
I always carry with me now.

120
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,326
You know.

121
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:13,561
Fool me once, right?

122
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,064
No?

123
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,469
All right.

124
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,675
Oh, she's funny.

125
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,795
Uh, you know,

126
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,314
maybe it is time for Margine
to take the next step

127
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:34,749
in her therapeutic process.

128
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:35,917
We'll be there.

129
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:38,219
No, we won't!

130
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:40,154
Don't listen to her.
She's crazy. Just...

131
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:44,292
Guys?

132
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,063
Good news.

133
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,798
Lucy's parents are coming.

134
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,417
What's their deal?
Are they weird?

135
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,919
Weird? No.

136
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,887
They're not weird.

137
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,492
They're weird.

138
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,328
I can't stand weird people.

139
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,065
Stop doing that!

140
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,335
Get down.

141
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:08,346
+

142
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,434
Do we really have to use Maw
Maw's coffin as a dinner table?

143
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,903
It's the only thing we
own that seats seven.

144
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,705
Anyway, it's not necessarily
for Maw Maw.

145
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:30,906
It's for whoever dies first.

146
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,041
Can't be me.

147
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,375
It's too short.

148
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:34,877
Unless I die in a magic trick.

149
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,178
Which is never gonna happen

150
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:37,813
because no matter how high
I raise my hand,

151
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,181
they never pick me
as a volunteer.

152
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:42,184
Somebody parked a clown car
in front of our house.

153
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,253
That's one of those cars

154
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,587
<i>you told me I'd never
be able to lift up</i>

155
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,989
all by myself.

156
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,390
I'm gonna go lift it.

157
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,526
Dad, don't. I think
that's the Carlyles.

158
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,632
Sorry we're early.

159
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,267
But Margine can
only leave the house

160
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,369
when all the numbers in the
digital clocks are the same,

161
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:03,105
so we left at 11:11,
because if we left at 1:11,

162
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,239
we'd be late.

163
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:07,776
Okay. Well, um,
do you want to come in?

164
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,979
Margine, do you
think you're ready

165
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:12,047
to meet your granddaughter?

166
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,228
I still think we
need a few minutes.

167
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,569
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!

168
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:34,737
Virginia!

169
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,839
I'm lifting a car!

170
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:39,525
You think you can

171
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,076
steal my table.

172
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,178
Just because you
slept with the boss.

173
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,580
Maw Maw, no!

174
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,250
What the hell?

175
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:50,369
She saw the food and now
she thinks she's still

176
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:53,088
working the lunch counter at Woolworth's
in 1949.

177
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,915
86! Turkey!

178
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:05,901
Oh, I think it's okay.

179
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,102
Five second rule, right?

180
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,333
<i>Well, you can forget
about Thanksgiving.</i>

181
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:12,174
It's too late to cook and
the stores are closed.

182
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,044
I can fix this!

183
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,209
Go for Barney.

184
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,089
James, it's Thanksgiving day.

185
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,774
I knew it was a long shot.

186
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,960
Our dinner got ruined.
I figured I could maybe go down

187
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,228
to the store
and pick up some things.

188
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,580
Throw something together.

189
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:38,834
Uh, well, this party I'm at
is kind of dying down.

190
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:41,003
Uh, Aunt Mildred, don't
hog all the giblets.

191
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,922
Uh, text me your address
and any food allergies,

192
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:45,074
and I'll come whip up a meal.

193
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,342
See, that's not really what I...

194
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,510
Hello?

195
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,281
Deep breaths.

196
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,885
Visualize yourself
in a beautiful place.

197
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,827
Do any of these burners work?

198
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,395
Half of the right front one.

199
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,130
You have to put
the center of the pot

200
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,316
in the middle of that half
and then balance it with a lid.

201
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:18,574
Hi!

202
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,809
Come in. Come in.

203
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,611
I'm Virginia. This
is my husband Burt.

204
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:23,980
Hello. I'm Dale.
This is my wife Margine.

205
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,314
Nice to meet you, Margine.

206
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,187
Yeah, it's probably best,
no one touch each other yet.

207
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,355
Don't worry.

208
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,522
She won't burn anything.

209
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,991
She just needs
to feel some pain

210
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,059
to calm herself down.
Oh.

211
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,428
I can't wait to do
this every year.

212
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,564
I think I know what
will cheer her up.

213
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:43,032
I'll go get Hope up
from her nap.

214
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,317
No, no.
Too soon for that.

215
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,235
I think Margine
is uncomfortable here

216
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:49,238
because this is bringing up
some of her feelings about Lucy.

217
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,974
You know, what might help
is some role-playing.

218
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,743
Uh, Virginia,

219
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,311
will you pretend to be Lucy?

220
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,913
I'd really rather not.

221
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,849
This is important
to the therapy.

222
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:03,953
Burt?
Will you pretend to be Lucy?

223
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,388
Sounds great.
What do you want?

224
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:06,422
Young Lucy?
Prison Lucy?

225
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,590
Ghost Lucy?

226
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,058
Whatever Lucy you want
will be fine.

227
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,176
Can I do it
with a Spanish accent?

228
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,378
Let's keep it simple.

229
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,867
I'm Lucy.

230
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,803
I'm a pretty, pretty girl.

231
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,805
I have medium-sized boobies.

232
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,358
Okay, then.
You guys enjoy your little game.

233
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:26,542
Call me when dinner's ready.

234
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:29,641
Mom?

235
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,414
<i>Ah! Help!</i>

236
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,160
What? What?

237
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:34,900
Help me!

238
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:35,751
What the hell's going on?

239
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:38,621
This little pipsqueak cook
sent me out there

240
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,289
to serve runny eggs
to the mayor!

241
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:44,043
Easy. Easy.

242
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,295
I don't know
what she's talking about.

243
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:49,131
But she keeps making me look
at a napkin full of her snot.

244
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:54,136
Barbara, I need you to stay
in this storeroom

245
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,538
and take-take inventory.

246
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,676
Jimmy, we don't want to mess
with your traditional
family thing,

247
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,344
but we need something else
to blow up.

248
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,613
Javier wussed out
on the deer head.

249
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,849
I looked into his eyes,
and he touched my soul.

250
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,584
You can blow up anything
you find in the yard.

251
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,586
I just need you to
keep Maw Maw busy

252
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,121
while I'm giving Hope her
traditional Thanksgiving.

253
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,656
You boys cannot come
in this door.

254
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,658
You have to sit out
in the colored section.

255
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,276
Looks like she's still back
at Woolworth's again.

256
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,194
Follow me.

257
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,097
Don't you stare at my keister.

258
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,899
No, stop punishing yourself.

259
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,469
I am not gonna let you
take the blame

260
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:29,171
for the awful things
that I did.

261
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,172
+

262
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:33,956
+

263
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,245
<i>Jimmy, this is
going fantastically well.</i>

264
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:38,147
I think Margine is ready
to meet the baby.

265
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,187
I know I shouldn't have
avoided you,

266
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:48,357
but I was scared that somehow
you'd be like Lucy.

267
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:52,128
And that somehow that would
be my fault, too.

268
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:54,363
But you're just an adorable
little treasure.

269
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:58,100
You don't have a bad bone
in your body. No!

270
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,468
Pick her up, Margine.

271
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,871
Give her time, Dad. Geez!

272
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:05,474
Hear that?

273
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:13,916
Well, Mom, you'll be happy
to know that

274
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,918
Margine has bonded with Hope,
Dad's having fun.

275
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,787
If you come join us,
I think we can actually have

276
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,889
a real Thanksgiving.

277
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,357
What the hey?

278
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,193
I'm drunk and my team is up
three kicking points.

279
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:28,464
Let's go talk to Dr. Dumbass
and his nutball wife.

280
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,201
That's the spirit.

281
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,737
Okay, who's who?

282
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,071
I'm Lucy.

283
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:37,506
Everyone else is
pretty much themselves.

284
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:39,492
Which means you can be Virginia.

285
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,643
Or Burt.

286
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,710
I'm gonna stick with me.

287
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:47,482
Lucy, I am very sorry
I was not a better hostess

288
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,450
when you visited.

289
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,386
I am sure you did not expect me

290
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,588
to hit you on the head
with the TV.

291
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:54,523
When did you hit Lucy
with the TV?

292
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,611
Right before
I called the police.

293
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:59,429
And the TV has not worked
the same since, by the way.

294
00:12:59,464 --> 00:13:01,377
Not that you need
to buy me a new one, but...

295
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,232
You're the ones
that turned Lucy in?

296
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,050
Yeah. It's sort of
a family policy

297
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,870
to call for help when there's
a murderer in the house.

298
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:10,406
But that was my daughter.

299
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,607
Who was a murderer.

300
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:12,808
<i>So, Margine,</i>

301
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,343
you play any instruments?

302
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,111
You know, you keep
saying "murderer"

303
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:19,081
like we're the only parents
who have a kid with issues.

304
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,618
I mean, yours is a slacker who
still lives at home.

305
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:23,953
Hey, time out.

306
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,122
I'm gonna have to step out
of Lucy here for a second.

307
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,092
We really being judged by the couple
of parents of serial killers?

308
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,361
Yeah, a serial killer
with a college degree.

309
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,896
Who had her own apartment.

310
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:36,599
Which was a lot nicer
than this dump!

311
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,267
Oh! Whoa!
Okay,

312
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:39,251
Mom, Dad,

313
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:40,769
bedroom.

314
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:45,407
Guys, relax.
So they called me a slacker.

315
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:46,942
Slacker's not even
the worst thing

316
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,577
<i>I've been called today, by you.</i>

317
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:49,812
That's different.

318
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,614
I'm allowed to criticize you.

319
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:53,849
<i>I made you.
You're my mistake.</i>

320
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,551
Look, I know that
this is a big pain,

321
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:57,486
but it's worth it, 'cause
Hope's gonna get a tradition

322
00:13:57,554 --> 00:14:00,623
out of it... We just have to get through
one meal a year with these people, and then

323
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,791
we can spend the rest
of the year making fun of them.

324
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,994
Why would I want
to make fun of people?

325
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,563
You always make me out
to be such a monster.

326
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:11,433
You with your beady eyes
and your Ruth Buzzi haircut.

327
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:15,479
Tell me you didn't enjoy that.

328
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:22,444
Where did the weirdos go?

329
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,999
Hey.
Where's Hope?

330
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,801
Did those sons of bitches
steal our baby?!

331
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,836
FYI: I had to switch
allspice for the nutmeg,

332
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,189
so we'll be missing some of the
low notes on the sweet potatoes.

333
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:40,083
I shouldn't have told them that.

334
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:40,094
+

335
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:43,576
Let's just call the cops...
They'll lock up these fruitcakes

336
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:44,852
and we can get our baby back.

337
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,292
Hope's already
lost her mom to jail...

338
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,408
I don't want her losing
her grandparents, too.

339
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:52,075
I'm going around back
to see if the windows
are locked.

340
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:58,468
Look, Dr. Dale,
I could've called the police,

341
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:00,970
but I didn't.
If you give Hope back now, we can all

342
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,473
still have a nice turkey dinner
together, and this will all just be

343
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,275
a silly story we laugh
about years from now.

344
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:07,620
I-It's too late... Margine's
bonded with the baby now.

345
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:08,812
And the truth is,

346
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,247
we can raise Hope far better than
a man in suspended adolescence,

347
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:14,150
his bipolar, alcoholic mother
and the...

348
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:15,652
well, whatever this one is.

349
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,053
Pool guy.

350
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:20,924
Now, I admit we didn't do a
perfect job with Lucy,

351
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:24,027
<i>but mistakes are why
pencils have erasers,</i>

352
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,094
<i>why they have that
little "delete" button,</i>

353
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,113
and why they invented Wite-Out.

354
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:28,748
What?

355
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,668
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

356
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:45,061
Hey.

357
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:46,779
What's Shelley doing here?

358
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,815
We couldn't handle
Maw Maw alone.

359
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,616
She thought I was talking
about civil rights.

360
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,435
Then she started spraying
me with the garden hose.

I'll hold 'em off...
You go get the TV.

370
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,176
<i>No, no, wait, wait,
no, we didn't...</i>

371
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,128
we didn't come to fight,
we just came to apologize.

372
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:22,515
You had every right to hit
me with the TV.

373
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,051
<i>Just like you had every right</i>

374
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,352
to hit our daughter with a TV.

375
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,189
We're not good parents...
We'd probably ruin Hope

376
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,191
the same way we ruined Lucy.

377
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,628
And I know she said
her crimes were not my fault,

378
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,631
but... that was probably
your husband talking.

379
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,201
So we just wanted
to say we're sorry.

380
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,249
Hang on, hang on.

381
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,909
It took a lot for you

382
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:51,911
to come here
and admit you were wrong.

383
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:55,214
I know what it's like
to feel like a bad parent.

384
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:58,651
Jimmy's always yapping in my ear
about what a crappy job we did

385
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,152
<i>raising him.</i>

386
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,304
What are you doing?

387
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,672
They tried to steal the baby.

388
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,791
Who among us has not
done something crazy?

389
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,194
I got a tattoo
of a foot on my foot.

390
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:09,829
Grown-ups are
talking now, hon.

391
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:11,464
<i>Look, we can't undo</i>

392
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,099
the mistakes we
made as parents.

393
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,735
All we can do is try
to be good grandparents.

394
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:20,506
And I think
that means making a...
good tradition for Hope.

395
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,777
Great! So everyone
forgives everyone?

396
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,615
Let's go make a memory!

397
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,751
Burt, would you, uh,
like to say grace?

398
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,654
Rock on.

399
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,492
What up, God?

400
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,677
Thank you for my family,

401
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:45,331
and even though this baby
is the last thing we wanted,

402
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,900
she's turned out
to be pretty cool.

403
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,770
As for this meal,
I don't really like turkey,

404
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,040
but thank you for...

405
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:58,778
my good hair, which
thou hath not takeneth away,

406
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,514
my strong jaw, straight teeth,

407
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,016
rock-hard abs and...

408
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:08,621
They took Hope. Again.

409
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,889
Damn it!

410
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,026
Hope you enjoy spending

411
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:17,997
the next five to ten
Thankgivings in jail, bitch!

412
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:21,300
Boy, at my age, you think
you've seen it all,

413
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,402
and boom, something
else happens.

414
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:23,413
+

415
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,004
I slaved over a
hot oven all day,

416
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,026
and then you guys just run off,
and my food gets cold and ruined.

417
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:37,328
I hope getting your precious
baby back was worth it.

418
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:39,314
You were right, Mom.

419
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,984
I shouldn't have tried to start
some silly new tradition.

420
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:43,652
Trying is
the first step to sucking.

421
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,988
Lesson learned.

422
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,897
Worst Thanksgiving ever.

423
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:56,432
We had this cheese sauce,

424
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,800
it irritated my dad's IBS.

425
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:59,835
He spent the whole afternoon
in the bathroom

426
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:02,805
but forced us to include him
via video chat.

427
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,875
Yeah, well,
my baby was stolen. Twice.

428
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:08,010
I can't beat that.

429
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:10,846
Let's drink!

430
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:16,585
<i>All my plans went to crap.</i>

431
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,055
<i>We didn't start the perfect
Thanksgiving tradition</i>

432
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:21,624
<i>with a big family
sitting around a turkey.</i>

433
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,295
<i>But when you think about it,</i>

434
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:28,998
<i>maybe we stumbled into
an even better tradition.</i>

435
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:35,404
<i>You're not surrounded
by a lot of relatives...</i>

436
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:38,474
<i>but you're surrounded
by people who helped you out</i>

437
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:42,178
<i>and stuck around when things
started to really fall apart.</i>

438
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,314
Here we go,
everyone.

439
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:46,565
Happy Thanksgiving.

440
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:01,063
They're your real family.

1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,200
This is Western DMG.

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,960
Excuse me. Miss...

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,120
On the morning of November the 29th,
Wesley Ndoyo departed

4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,720
West India Quay Station,
through the Eldon Street exit.

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,080
At 10:30am, Mr Ndoyo entered
the Eldon Street branch of Cafe 66.

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
Here you go.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
Oh, thank you so much.

8
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,840
- Where did I leave it?
- On the DLR.

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,240
You're lucky I grabbed it.
It would have ended up in Shadwell.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,400
Wait, you got off the train for me?

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,440
I guess so, yeah.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,480
That's amazing.
Let me give you something.

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,720
What? Nah, man. No, seriously.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
I've only got the debit anyway.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Don't worry about it, yeah?
We've all been there.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,120
I really hope not.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Um...

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,080
Sorry.

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,320
Let me buy you a coffee or a tea,
maybe, anything?

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,720
- Please.
- All right, you twisted my arm.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,560
- I'll have a coffee.
- Double shot for me today, I think.

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm Emily.
Sorry, I didn't get your name.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,640
GUNSHOT, GLASS BREAKING

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,680
SCREAMING, MORE GUNSHOTS

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
MAN SHOUTS

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,640
Mate, just put that down.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,000
GUNSHOT

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,320
Oh, my God!

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,520
At 10:32am,

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,520
Mr Ndoyo was shot by the assailant

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
in the Eldon Street branch
of Cafe 66.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,880
Mr Ndoyo was pronounced
dead at the scene.

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,600
You were at your office
when you were first made aware

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,000
of the attack, is that correct?

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,280
That's correct.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,040
What did you know
at that moment in time?

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,400
Only what was reported
by the first responders.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,600
Shots fired, multiple casualties.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
The suspect was down.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,200
By down, you mean deceased?

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
I mean incapacitated.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,960
He wasn't dead yet.

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160
Witness K, was the perpetrator known
to you at this time?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,720
I can't discuss that in an
open forum.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,360
BEEP

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,320
Was the perpetrator known
to you at this time?

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,440
Yes, he was.

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,600
In what capacity was he
known to you?

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,440
_

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,720
So, Raza, who are you, then?

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,760
Kind of a heavy question, bruv.

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,160
- Feels like I'm on X Factor, innit?
- OTHER PEOPLE CHUCKLE

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,200
Um, I guess I'd say, "I go out,
chill out, hang out."

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,680
But I'm clean. I pay my rent.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm not too loud but I'm not sitting
in the corner like a weirdo neither.

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,200
No, for real, I think
I'd make a legit flatmate.

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,880
Cool. We're all in the arts.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
We use the studio to collaborate.

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,440
Yeah, do you do anything creative?

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,640
Who's the photographer?

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,920
- This one.
- You mind?

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
No, go for it.
Are you into photography?

63
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,600
I like what Robert Capa said,
you know?

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
"Pictures are already there,
you just have to take them."

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,160
- Very good.
- You took all these?

66
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Sound.

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,680
Yeah, I do mainly street
photography.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,640
That's over by Altab Ali, isn't it?

69
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,200
I used to run round there as a kid.

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Of course, you wouldn't want
to live here back then.

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,320
We're a lot different.

72
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, I use my lens to highlight
shifting urban environments.

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,240
Hold up.
That's my street.

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
- What?!
- No way, bruv!

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,200
No way. I'm in this one.

76
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,400
- Where?
- No word of a lie, that is me.

77
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,080
- Shut up.
- Really?

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,800
- That is actually me.
- No way.

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,520
That is so random.
I took that like two years ago.

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,680
Young Radicals.

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,960
What's that?

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,760
Oh, it's the title of the piece -
it's just a play on words.

83
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
That dude there's a tramp,
no-one's really listening to him

84
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,920
and there's me having a fag break.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,800
What's radical about that?

86
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,680
No, it's more like the guy
in the background handing

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
out the flyers.

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, OK.

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
That's Tarik.
He works over at Aladdin's Garden.

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,160
Those are menus, bruv.

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,480
It's been in galleries?

92
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,880
Er, yeah, I, um...
I had a show last year.

93
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,520
Cool, cool.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,680
Well, keep me posted, yeah?

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,760
- Yeah, of course.
- Sure, will do.

96
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,080
- Salam, Aunties.
- Hi, Faza.

97
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,760
Don't fret.
I can't see nothing.

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
You look lovely, though.

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,720
What are you doing in bloody
Shoreditch looking for flats?

100
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,440
Don't... Don't think I don't
have eyes everywhere.

101
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
You don't have eyes
at the school, Ummi.

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Nasir texted me - detention again.

103
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,880
What?
Well, you'll have to go fetch him.

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,960
Drug money.

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,600
Please don't joke like that.

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,960
Remember Anara's boy, he walked
all the way to Ipswich,

107
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
thinking he was Jesus.

108
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,160
Of course, he had to be high
to go to Ipswich.

109
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,200
So, how was it, this flat?

110
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
500 quid for a room
in an old handbag factory.

111
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,680
He's not going anywhere.

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,680
Miss Woods?

113
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,960
I'm Raza Shar.

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,960
Yes, yes, Nasir's brother.

115
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,760
Ah.

116
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
I was really expecting your mum.

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,560
She's stuck at work, Miss Woods.

118
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,640
What's he done?

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
Uh...

120
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Nasir is one of my brightest pupils

121
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,440
but I can't have this
in my class, you understand?

122
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,120
I'm going to have to suspend him.

123
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
_

124
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,520
_

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,800
_

126
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,760
_

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,280
_

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
Hold on.
What were you telling him?

129
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,000
My father will deal with him.

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
Nasir won't shame us
like this again.

131
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
It's not the end of the world.

132
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,840
They shouldn't really
be selling these things,

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
let alone to kids.

134
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
There's no need to overreact.

135
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,520
RAZA AND NASIR LAUGHING

136
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,520
What, you OG now?

137
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,080
Taking knives into school and that.

138
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,560
It's protection, isn't it?

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,040
Someone's messing with you?

140
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,160
No, Mr Roy gave me an A in maths,
so I've got to even out

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,960
my street cred.

142
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,960
You're going to be an astronaut.
What do you need street cred for?

143
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
They barely let Pakis on planes,

144
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,280
how are they going to let me
up into space?

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
Spaceman, Samurai,
multitudes, innit?

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,280
Presto, now, you're a photographer.

147
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,880
This is old.
It's got no screen.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
- So, you don't want it, then?
- Nah, nah, I do, I do.

149
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,760
Don't...
Show me how it works.

150
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,960
All right. Wind, click.

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,160
Google it.

152
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,000
Yo, turn around.

153
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Quick, get upstairs.

154
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,920
What's going on in the world, Abu?

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Still spinning, barely.

156
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,120
Where's the shorter one?

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,000
Hiding in his room.

158
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,040
Bloody pocket knife!

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,960
It's a dangerous world out there.

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,160
Smells good, Ummi.

161
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,720
Get out. Go.

162
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Nothing to see here, huh?

163
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,960
SHE CHUCKLES

164
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,880
- PHONE RINGS
- Gotcha.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
Yo.

166
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,120
Hello, hello.

167
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
I knew I could smell you up there.

168
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,400
That's what you've got
a big nose for.

169
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,800
Come down.
Let's see if you can fly.

170
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,840
All right. Coming right down.

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,040
Heads up, yeah?

172
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Where are you off
to dressed like that?

173
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
- Too much?
- Nah, you look well sharp.

174
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
That's a lot of Kush, big spender.

175
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,040
Nah, bruv. I want them rolls.

176
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,800
Big night out, then, who is she?

177
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,760
How many's that fetch me?

178
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,520
Ten, but I'm going
to give you seven.

179
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Any more is intent.

180
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,920
Feds don't mess around
with that Class A shit.

181
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
There you go, killer.

182
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,200
No sleep till Brooklyn.

183
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,200
..from Syria, under the
leadership of Ahmed El Adoua,

184
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,880
- known to have been behind...
- What have you got chopsticks for?

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
Ummi thinks she's a
comedian or something.

186
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,160
He can't be trusted
with sharp objects, can he?

187
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,840
- You not eating?
- Nah.

188
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,600
..Rotterdam yesterday. Dutch
authorities have confirmed...

189
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
Hey. Careful tonight, yeah?

190
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,800
Anyone picks on you, don't be brave,
tell them you're a Hindu.

191
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,720
Don't freak, I'm a Sikh.

192
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,720
That's my boy.

193
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,760
..have launched a manhunt for
the perpetrators.

194
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
Ahmed El Adoua is...

195
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Charlotte...

196
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,280
Raza.
Sorry the signal's crap.

197
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,480
I just got your texts.

198
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,760
Good, found you.

199
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
Who you all dressed up for?

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,200
I roll out of bed like this, innit?

201
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,040
Tristan, Angel, this is Raza.

202
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,640
With your birthday cake.

203
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,880
Oh, my birthday cake!

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,320
Fucking brilliant.

205
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,800
- How goes it, Raza?
- Are you good, mate?

206
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,000
You want to...?

207
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,800
Happy birthday, innit.

208
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,360
Our usual bloke's in Ibiza.

209
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,440
Rakes it in this time of year.

210
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,080
This ain't cut like the shit
he gets you.

211
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,240
Lottie, where did you meet
this rascal?

212
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,440
Well, swiped right, didn't she?

213
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,520
- Raza!
- You little piggy.

214
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,200
- You won't say anything, Raza?
- Easy, easy.

215
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,840
- Oi, oi.
- Are you getting in or what?

216
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,360
- I'm not driving anyone like that.
- Just take us to the nearest hospital.

217
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,560
Keep the change.

218
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,520
In here, in the back.

219
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,960
- You're joking.
- Just paid up, mate.

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,400
Go. You got your money, go.

221
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,280
You're gonna be OK.
All right, all right, all right.

222
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,280
Just grab her legs.

223
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,520
SHE MOANS

224
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,400
Help.

225
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,000
Can I get some help, please?

226
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,560
- Can you tell me your name, love?
- Charlotte. Charlotte Humphreys.

227
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,960
- Tell me what she took?
- MDMA, just the one.

228
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,320
- How long ago was that?
- Three hours, at the most.

229
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,800
Do you have a number I can contact?

230
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,560
She's got a mobile. It's probably in
her purse. Is she going to be OK?

231
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,640
- Can't go back there, sir.
- Is she going to be OK?

232
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,120
I need you to step aside, please.
That's for the doctors now.

233
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,080
- Put your hands against the wall.
- What am I doing?

234
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Sir, put your hands against the
wall.

235
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,120
Do have any weapons or sharp
objects in your pockets?

236
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,640
Is this what you gave
the young lady?

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm arresting you on possession
of a Class A drug.

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,520
You do not have to say anything...

239
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,680
# Wise men say...

240
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,040

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:28,240

# Take my whole life too

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,480

Look sharp, here she comes.

251
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,280
Welcome to CTSU, Miss Morton.

252
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,040
Would you like
to introduce yourself?

253
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,920
Holly.

254
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,680
Apparently not much of a charmer.

255
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,960
I'll leave you
to make your own assessments.

256
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,360
Gabriel, Holly will ride with you.

257
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,640
Yes, guv.

258
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,800
Now, you will have heard
about the untimely death of El Adoua

259
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,200
in a drone strike last night.

260
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,640
The Dutch confirmed he recruited the
Rotterdam bombers late last year.

261
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,680
But, before conspiring to deliver
the caliphate to Holland,

262
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Mr El Adoua might have brought
a piece of it here.

263
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Shall we?

264
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,200
AIVD, or whatever the Dutch are calling
themselves these days, found El A...

265
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,600
Is it "Eladoua" or "El Ad-ou-a"?

266
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,080
El Adoua.

267
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,320
Either way, AIVD found
his travel documents.

268
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
One of the passports got a hit,

269
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,920
flight to London Stansted
on June 11th.

270
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,600
CCTV trawls from Stansted that day
show El Adoua disembarking.

271
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,200
Until they have something to share,
that's as much as the gods

272
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,680
have given us.

273
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,040
We paint the rest of
the picture ourselves.

274
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,920
Prior to his death,
he was in London.

275
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,840
Where did he stay? With whom?

276
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,360
And why in Christ was
Mr El Adoua in my lovely city?

277
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,720
Yes, guv.

278
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,280
- Yes, guv.
- PHONE ALERT

279
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,120
Number Three says five to
at the Croxford Street Cafe.

280
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
No, tell him Nunhead Road.

281
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,800
And text him at five to and tell him
Hardess Street at quarter past.

282
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,800
We set the agenda, always.

283
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,840
You haven't worked informants
before, have you?

284
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,240
Not personally.

285
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,680
Well, there's no other way to do it,
other than personally.

286
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,880
Obviously, I understand building
relationships is crucial

287
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,040
to gathering intelligence
and preventing terror attacks.

288
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,880
You like to win, don't you?

289
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,600
Who wants to lose?

290
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,960
Well, let me spare you the grief.

291
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,720
We'll fail.

292
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,320
And when we do, people die.

293
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,280
Someone always slips
through the net.

294
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,240
Yeah.
Stand there, please, mate.

295
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,680
Turn to your right.

296
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,680
Look at the blue dot on the wall.

297
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,240
CAMERA CLICKS

298
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,640
Excuse me, sir. Could you step to
the desk, please? Thank you.

299
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,520
PHONE RINGING

300
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,960
You have reached the voicemail
box of Hanif Shar.

301
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,880
Stop messing with me, not now.

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
Raza, love, you've got
to lighten up.

303
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,840
I got arrested, Abu.

304
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,600
- Ah, you broke your cherry.
- Yeah, Listen,

305
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
I need you to open up the salon, OK?

306
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,080
I can't. I'll be coming down there,
read them your rights.

307
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,560
No, I don't need that.
I need you to open up the salon.

308
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,360
- BEEPING
- Hang on, bloody battery.

309
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
- Hello.
- Abu? Abu?

310
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
DIAL TONE

311
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
Of course you've not charged...

312
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Of course you've not charged
your phone.

313
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,680
Just be on the lookout for
new snouts

314
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,440
and don't bother with the mosques.

315
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,680
All my best assets are
on the Devil's wishlist already.

316
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,240
Junkies, dealers, perverts,
any one you can get leverage on.

317
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,640
They'll grass on their mates
and their families.

318
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,800
They'll just as easily turn on you.
They're not your friends.

319
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,040
You squeeze them, rinse them.

320
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,880
If they give you any trouble,
you drop them, move on.

321
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,720
This guy here, El Adoua.

322
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah, I think I saw this guy come
in my shop this morning.

323
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

324
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,240
Cos he spent most of yesterday
in a bomb crater in Syria.

325
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
Well, maybe I'll have
an improved memory

326
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,240
if you catch the wanker that keeps
graffitiing my windows.

327
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,880
Never seen this shithead.

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,360
I'd have lamped him if I had.

329
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,120
Ah, there's this one bloke though,
come up to me.

330
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,640
Bigging up Al-Qaeda and them.

331
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
Who's this?

332
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,360
I don't know.
Like, long hair and a beard.

333
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Mm-hm.

334
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Looks like a Bangla Hagrid.

335
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
You're drawing attention
to yourself.

336
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,080
Stop trying to instigate
jihad in the mosques.

337
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,880
- I get another complaint, I'll arrest you.
- I'm trying my best.

338
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,800
How else do I get these
people exposed?

339
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,120
MAN RETCHING

340
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,320
What?

341
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,040
Looks like he can afford it,
though, innit?

342
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,120
Other wrap must have bust in
my belly.

343
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,080
I'm cheesing my tits off.

344
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,280
Yeah, I'm regretting that Mandy
right about now.

345
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,120
Don't matter, though.

346
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,080
Only the guilty sleep in rusty.

347
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,040
That's from that movie, Kaiser Sose.

348
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,640
What about you?

349
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,000
We all got a
little haram in us, bro.

350
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,800
Dadir.

351
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,200
Raza.

352
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,680
Raza the Rizla.

353
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,640
I'ma burn you up.

354
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,160
What's your postcode, brother?

355
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,120
What's that?
What are you writing?

356
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,640
2123, source meeting, Bow Canal.

357
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,720
Hey, do me a favour.
Leave this one out.

358
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,760
Yousef's a bit skittish.

359
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,720
Maybe hang back here, yeah.

360
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,760
What on earth is
she doing out there?

361
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,920
It's her first day.

362
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,480
I didn't know Feds
come in that size.

363
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,120
Is she going to make it to day two?

364
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,680
One of the Rotterdam bombers
was spotted in London.

365
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,440
El Adoua, you heard of him?

366
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,600
Yeah, I've got a telly, yeah.

367
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,360
Look, there's got to be a bit
of give and take today.

368
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,160
Feds have got my brother
on possession.

369
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,120
You saw El Adoua in London.

370
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,840
What about my brother?

371
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,360
You're going to have to sell me
a little harder.

372
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,200
I saw your man around, yeah,
back in the summer.

373
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,600
Hanging near Bridgetown
with this bigshot dude.

374
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,400
Word was they met in Raqqa
a whiles back.

375
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,600
Raqqa?
Have you been holding out on me?

376
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,840
Nah.
You're the one asked the questions.

377
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,840
Bigshot - what's his name?

378
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,880
Look...

379
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,680
my brother's out, we talk.

380
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,680
I'll see what I can do.

381
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
See what you can do then, innit?

382
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,320
Oi, don't dream of dodging me
on this one.

383
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,880
Get Shorty an umbrella.

384
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,240
She's going to catch the death.

385
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,320
Yo. Yo, yo, yo, yo.

386
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,840
Wake up. Wake up, yo.

387
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,120
What?

388
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,200
Right. Tadir Hassan's release
should be processed by the morning.

389
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,840
His case officer will
have a bleeding hissy fit.

390
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,400
CPS approved.

391
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,520
We all have to make sacrifices
to win the war on terror, John.

392
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,840
Lee...

393
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,440
Tadir Hassan, evidence compromised.

394
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,760
- OK.
- Cheers.

395
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,040
This guy with Tadir Hassan,
did they get picked up together?

396
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,280
That chappy is one Raza Shar.

397
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
I'll take a look, please.

398
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,880
- Thanks.
- Brought in on his own.

399
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,440
Seems like a potential source.

400
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,040
What gave him away?

401
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,680
Nice tan, funny name.

402
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,400
Young, IC4 male,
lives in council housing.

403
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,320
At possession,
could be bumped up to intent.

404
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,680
- That's how you want to turn him?
- First arrest. He'll want home.

405
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,760
Have you got an interview room
for us, John?

406
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,040
He hasn't spoken to his
defence solicitor yet.

407
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,520
He'll get round to it.

408
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,800
Come on, then, let's go meet
your first recruit.

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,840
Raza Shar, let's have you.

410
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
Raza the Rizla.

411
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,520
Come by Bridgetown, yeah?
We'll kick it.

412
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,040
Be easy, bruv.

413
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,320
Come on.

414
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,960
Come on.

415
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,040
Nah, mate. I'm getting released.

416
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,640
Life's full of disappointments.

417
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,080
Have a seat, Raza.

418
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,520
Interview commencing
at 12:24am with Raza Shar.

419
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,800
Don't I get a lawyer?

420
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,160
It doesn't have to come to that.

421
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,160
If you enrol in our confidential
informant programme,

422
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,800
we'll drop the charges and you'll
be free to go home.

423
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,400
RAZA LAUGHS

424
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,120
Go on, share the joke.

425
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,720
You want me to grass -
on possession.

426
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,040
With intent to supply?

427
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,440
Four pills.

428
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,800
They didn't catch me
with scales and baggies.

429
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,360
No intent, no previous.

430
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
My mate got the same rap

431
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,040
but he walked away with
40 hours' community service.

432
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,880
If I'm choosing between
being a snitch

433
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
and working the counter
at Age Concern,

434
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,920
yeah, bring on the grey army,
bruv.

435
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,200
- Is that a high school blazer you're wearing?
- It was, yeah.

436
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,960
Why did you take the badge off?

437
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,120
Had a date, needed a jacket.

438
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,320
Interview terminated at 12:26am.

439
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,760
Raza Shar, you are hereby
charged with possession

440
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
of a Class A substance.

441
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,120
You've been deemed a flight risk
and will be remanded in custody

442
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,200
- until you face the magistrates.
- Flight risk?

443
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,400
What are you on about?

444
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,880
I've never even left the country.

445
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,240
You're supposed to charge me,
turn me out.

446
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
Park him in Bin 5.

447
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,120
How's he a flight risk?
They'll toss his case.

448
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
There is no case, the boy will walk.

449
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,440
I bought you 24 hours to find some
real leverage

450
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,280
or get yourself another snout.

451
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,400
SIREN BLARES

452
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,440
Pigs.

453
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,040
Yo, this is mad.

454
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
Come on, Faisal, stand up.

455
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,080
Yo, what have I even done?

456
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,040
You going to do this again?

457
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,840
- Keep still.
- This is profiling, man.

458
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,080
All right?

459
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
Beard's coming along.

460
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,040
Itches like a dog's arse.

461
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,360
You should try coconut oil.
How's that limp working out for you?

462
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,400
It slows me down, but, you know,
all part of building out

463
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,720
the legend, darling.

464
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,720
Who's your friend?

465
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,120
DC Holly Morton, first week.

466
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,840
This is DC Imran Aziz,
the local level two.

467
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

468
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,560
One of my snouts reckons El Adoua
was seen knocking round your patch

469
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,120
back when he was still breathing.

470
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,360
No. No chance.

471
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,080
I've still got to kick it
up the chain.

472
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,080
I'll see you back at home.

473
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,240
What's his name, then?

474
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,960
Raza Shar.

475
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,320
Raza Shar.

476
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,840
Yes.

477
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,920
And you're his father?

478
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,960
Yes.

479
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,480
ID, please.

480
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
- Expired.
- Is it?

481
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,440
I need valid identification.

482
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,000
That's my face, that's my name.

483
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,080
- It's not bloody complicated.
- Sir, you need to lower your tone.

484
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,080
Where's my son?
Then I'll lower my bastard tone.

485
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,480
Sir, I believe you've
had a drink or two.

486
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,360
Take a breath, think about
what you're going to say next.

487
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,760
OK, I say...

488
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,280
..up yours.
Can you release my son?!

489
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,320
- DADIR LAUGHS
- Hands off, fascist bastards.

490
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,160
- Go on, boy.
- Police state.

491
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
When are you going
to catch the real baddies?

492
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,720
Police!

493
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,480
- Choked on it.
- You're a dickhead, man.

494
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,720
I told Mum
you're at the new girl's.

495
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,040
Why you done that? You've got her
planning a wedding now.

496
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,640
I tell her the truth,
she'll be planning the prison break.

497
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
- They didn't charge you, then?
- Nah.

498
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,480
So, I'm in there all night
and then, this morning, they said

499
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
them clowns lost my gear at the lab.

500
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,680
Can you imagine?

501
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,480
Idiots, man.

502
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,080
God's smiling on me today, you know?

503
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Stuff and lot.

504
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,160
He's got better things to do
than fuck about with you, Bruv.

505
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,240
Shut up, man, drive.

506
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,840
I'm way too tired for your shit.

507
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,440
PHONE RINGS

508
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,840
MUSIC PLAYING

509
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,000
Mr Hassan, this is the Post Office.

510
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,880
We have a package ready for you at
the Harness Street branch.

511
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,400
We close half an hour early today.

512
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,000
Yousef, let's go.

513
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,840
Yeah, yeah, in a bit.

514
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,640
Come on, bruv. We're away.

515
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,120
Two seconds, man.

516
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,000
Yousef, seriously,
play it later, yeah.

517
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,240
- MUSIC OFF
- Long, man.

518
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,160
Yes. Jab, jab, jab.

519
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
OK, wrap.

520
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,400
You OK, yeah? You all right?

521
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,480
LAUGHING

522
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,320
Good work today.

523
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,520
Yo, you headed home?

524
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,760
Got to work.

525
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
How about you drop me
off on the way?

526
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,040
Don't want your sweat
sticking up my leather.

527
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,880
Are you for real?

528
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,400
You're a mug, you know that?

529
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,600
You're a snake.

530
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,760
You're supposed
to be my big brother. It's cold.

531
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,520
RINGING

532
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,880
This is Yousef.
You know what to do.

533
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
- BEEP
- Hello, Yousef.

534
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,600
Post Office again.

535
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,960
Better collect that package soon
or we're going to toss it.

536
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,880
You know, in all my years
on this job, I have never come

537
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,520
across an informer lying
to get what they want.

538
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,920
Leaving their handler pissing
in the wind is unprecedented.

539
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,120
He was just telling you
what you want to hear.

540
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,600
If I had £1 for every idiot
informant blathering on about Raqqa

541
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,920
and Daesh, I could buy you all
a black flag for Christmas.

542
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,400
He's been on my books for three
years, always been kosher.

543
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,200
They all cash out eventually.

544
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,280
I say we're looking at his endgame.

545
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,480
We'll see.

546
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,840
El Adoua was nowhere
near Bridgetown estate because,

547
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,640
if he was, I would have seen him.

548
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,440
If you were psychic, darling,
you'd be in my chair.

549
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,800
Yes, guvnor.

550
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,240
He's defensive.

551
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,440
Because he's wrong.

552
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,000
The SS traced El Adoua's
e-mails to an IP address

553
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,360
of an internet cafe
on the Bridgetown estate.

554
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,080
Imran's been under cover a while.
You know, he gets foggy.

555
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,440
Don't like foggy, Gabriel.

556
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,040
Yousef Hassan dropped you.

557
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,720
We're supposed to handle
the sources,

558
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,760
not the other way round.

559
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,400
We need more eyes in Bridgetown.

560
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,520
Holly, where are you at
with that kid, Raza Shar?

561
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,720
I have found something
quite interesting.

562
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,640
The Shar family own Delights hair
and beauty salon on Romford Street.

563
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,040
I pulled this photo
from their website.

564
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,000
We have the two boys - Raza, Nasir -
and that's Mum and Dad.

565
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,240
Happy days.

566
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,560
Except I searched the GRO and found
Miriam Shar's death certificate.

567
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,560
Raza's mother died in...2002.

568
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,600
So, who's the mother here then?

569
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,360
Website says Sadia Shar,

570
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,880
but I couldn't find
a marriage certificate,

571
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,400
no NI number, no passport.

572
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,080
Another intruder
to Fortress Britain.

573
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
- Possibly.
- Could be leverage.

574
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
I think so.

575
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,000
Know so.

576
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,440
I'll cross-check travel
with Border Agency.

577
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,680
Too slow.

578
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,520
Our boy's up in court in 16 hours.
After that, he's not our boy.

579
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,480
I can request an extension
from the Home Office.

580
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,240
On minor possession?

581
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,320
Good luck with that.
They'd rather ship her home.

582
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,560
What are we supposed to do -
interview the family?

583
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Not we.

584
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
Two strangers turn
up on your doorstep,

585
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
that's the police.

586
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,920
Anyone in here police?

587
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,720
No.

588
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,880
Understood?

589
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,520
Hello. Is your mum home?

590
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,600
- Ummi?
- Yeah.

591
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Hello. Can I help you?

592
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,560
Mrs Shar, I'm a counsellor from
Cornell Parkside Primary School.

593
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,440
Oh, my boy goes to Ashton Wood.

594
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm here to talk about Raza.

595
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,400
He's not here right now.

596
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,320
OK. But you are.

597
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,800
Would you like to invite me in?

598
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,840
Come, this way.

599
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
What is it you want?

600
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,560
It's been years since
Raza left primary.

601
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,480
What's left to say?

602
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,640
Before I begin, I just
need to see some proof

603
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,400
that you're his legal guardian.

604
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,760
Hm?

605
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,400
Now's really not a good time.

606
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,360
I just need to check a passport,
driving licence - anything, really.

607
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,600
And I'm politely asking you
to come back another time.

608
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Mrs Shar, I think
you'll want to sit down.

609
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,040
A former teacher at our school

610
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,640
has been accused of sexually
molesting some of his students.

611
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,640
Raza may have been one of them.

612
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,560
Molested?

613
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,960
What?

614
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,000
How?

615
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,840
What bastard teacher did this?

616
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,840
I can only say
he followed a pattern.

617
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,120
Children short on friends,
foreign nationals mainly.

618
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,840
He convinced them that
if they talked,

619
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,080
he could have their
parents deported.

620
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,240
Does that sound
like Raza's situation?

621
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,400
Where were you born, Mrs Shar?

622
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,640
Are the police looking into this?

623
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,360
I can't go into any more details
until I see some proof

624
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,280
that you're his mother.

625
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,800
Mrs Shar, I'm just trying
to understand what happened

626
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,120
to your son.

627
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,960
So, I was born in Pakistan.

628
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,760
What bloody difference
does that make?

629
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,400
How did you come to be in the UK?

630
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,880
What did this teacher do to him?

631
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,160
If you're living here illegally,
Mrs Shar, it alters our procedure.

632
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,560
What did...?

633
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,920
Go and play on your computer.

634
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,400
What's she saying about Raza,
someone's been touching him?

635
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,080
No, no, no, nothing, nothing.

636
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Go on. Go.

637
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,280
What is the name of this...?

638
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,520
DOOR CLOSES

639
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,680
Hello?

640
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,840
Cornell Parkside Primary

641
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,200
wants to launch a nationwide
manhunt for you.

642
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,840
Fortunately, the mother doesn't want
to make this a police matter.

643
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,600
Because she's undocumented -
which I was able to confirm.

644
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,440
I was under the instructions
of a superior officer.

645
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,640
DS Waters has flaunted the letter
of the law on numerous occasions.

646
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,120
Shh. It's unbecoming.

647
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I did warn you, she's no charmer,
but I'll let you be Caesar.

648
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,800
Let's see if you can cause
less damage tomorrow.

649
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,280
Paedo routine's a new one.

650
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,160
Marks for originality.

651
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,240
Piss off.

652
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,640
She'll get there.

653
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,840
You were a babe once yourself.

654
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,800
Old case of yours
has come up for parole.

655
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,800
Belmarsh appears
to have had enough of him.

656
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,680
What, Skittle's
out on good behaviour?

657
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,680
I'm afraid CPS needs you
at the hearing.

658
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,840
Gabriel, it was a long road
bringing you back.

659
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,920
I haven't worn that guy
in a long time.

660
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,160
He was a beautiful boy.

661
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,560
Scared the daylights out of me,
though.

662
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,320
BEEPING, PHONE RINGING

663
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,840
Look, if you're not
going to answer it,

664
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,760
can you put that thing
on silent, please?

665
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,920
Yousef...

666
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,960
Yo.

667
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,840
PHONE STILL RINGING

668
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,960
This is Yousef. You know what to do.

669
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,240
BEEP

670
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,680
No sleep just yet, lad.

671
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,520
Nightmare's almost over.

672
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,400
Adrian Hodge, your legal aid.

673
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,120
Been chasing your ghost all day.

674
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,000
First things first,
any one you need to call?

675
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,680
Just plead me guilty already.

676
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,400
I've been here forever.
When do I go home?

677
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,560
You're going in front of
the magistrate first thing.

678
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,880
Now why are you here, Raza?

679
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,920
Should have turned you out
already with a charge.

680
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,120
They said I was a flight risk.

681
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,320
You don't have an accent.

682
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,120
Got family abroad, have you?

683
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,040
Someone's pulling your chain, lad.

684
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,920
Look, what I'd like to do tomorrow
is lodge a formal complaint...

685
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,640
No, man. No complaints.

686
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,440
I'm not just going
to get you out, lad.

687
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,480
I'll get the case dropped,
keep your record clean,

688
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,520
that's for your future.

689
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,080
Look, if they mark you,
brand you, career,

690
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,800
mortgage loan,
for the rest of your life,

691
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,440
that's the first question they ask.
And I promise you, Raza,

692
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,720
Simon White Face or whoever,
with his Jesus and his Eton

693
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,000
and his Oxbridge,
he's not checking that box.

694
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,560
I'm not trying to bleed
the Matrix, bruv.

695
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,240
Just get me out.

696
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,720
Christ, don't you ever knock?

697
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,200
How intelligent do you look getting
duped by a low-rent pusher?

698
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,880
- Sir...
- You told me you had a snout

699
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,880
with a bead on El Adoua's
man in London.

700
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,200
You swore up and down
your man was reliable.

701
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,000
Now he's in the wind and I'm left
cursing the weather.

702
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,080
Some bear fruit, most don't.

703
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,480
Italian AC are closing in
on attack cell in Turin.

704
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,000
If El Adoua has taught those
pillocks how to build the same bomb

705
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,120
that took 17 lives in Rotterdam,

706
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,240
he was in London
long enough to do the same.

707
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,120
I promise you, we're doing
everything we can

708
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,040
to find his network.

709
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,480
So, I promised Downing Street
Rotterdam won't happen here.

710
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,840
You promised me
your snout's good word.

711
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,200
History teaches us wars
are fought with bombs and bullets.

712
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,280
Promises are buried
along with the dead.

713
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,400
There he is,
Mr Get Out of Jail Free.

714
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,840
Take care of my parking tickets,

715
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,040
I'll tell you how to find
the Loch Ness Monster.

716
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,440
Oh, not even a smile.

717
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
He's been working on
that joke all morning.

718
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,240
Time well spent, lads.

719
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,240
Found El Adoua's London contacts,
have we?

720
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,800
All right, today,
we're in the haystack.

721
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,120
Pull up the watchlist.

722
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,320
I'll take A to E, you take F to J.

723
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,320
- Let's see who was is in the country.
- What about Yousef?

724
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,880
We're not looking for Yousef.

725
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,880
Oh!

726
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,800
It's just I found him.

727
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,720
So...

728
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,480
..here's Yousef leaving his flat.

729
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Wait for it.

730
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,440
White van.

731
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,880
Here he is again, leaving the gym
20 minutes prior to your meet.

732
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,760
Looks like the same
white van tailing him.

733
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,920
See.

734
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,480
And, here is six minutes
later on Nelson.

735
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,720
Plates on the van?

736
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,520
Unreadable. Reflectors.

737
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,400
Did he know to watch for tails?

738
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,560
Yeah.

739
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,800
Where did they go next?

740
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,360
I checked the surrounding feeds.
Both vehicles disappeared.

741
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,640
- I'll keep sifting.
- 400,000 cameras in London.

742
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,120
That's not sifting, that's drowning.

743
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,920
Check with Audi,
see if his GPS is still pinging.

744
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,600
I'll ask the guv to put
in for a warrant.

745
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,880
Nah, she won't want the bother.

746
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,800
Just get the VIN number and tell
them you're hunting for joyriders.

747
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,440
Good work.

748
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,600
Cheers.

749
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,080
Karrol Jada...

750
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,960
- SIGHS
- ..Gyay-da...

751
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,400
Giedzinski.

752
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,720
That'll be the one.

753
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,680
Are they dodge?

754
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,920
Not bad.

755
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,040
- What's that?
- Your creps.

756
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,520
Where d'you nab them?

757
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,760
Deptford market.

758
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,200
Got a mate who runs a stall,
Watney market.

759
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,760
Does fakes for a tenner.

760
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,360
You always wanted
to be a lawyer, then?

761
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,880
Why? Are you thinking
of joining the cause, lad?

762
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,200
Good to have options, innit?

763
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,640
Life's not an orchard.

764
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
Don't get to stroll through,
pick the fruit you want.

765
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,120
Nah, I could be a lawyer.

766
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,520
Seems legit.

767
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,800
So, you've got, like,
assistants and that?

768
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,600
Interns.

769
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,360
But they're not pratting about
getting themselves arrested.

770
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,760
What, you didn't fancy uni, then?

771
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,920
Circumstances, bruv.

772
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,760
Didn't matter what I fancied.

773
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,280
What keeps you busy now?

774
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,800
Domestic shipping.

775
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,960
Postman, then.

776
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,840
Nah, packing boxes.

777
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,240
Interns.

778
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,760
A bit like slave labour, innit?

779
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,680
The day I can afford real kicks
is the day I pay my interns.

780
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,480
Raza Shar.

781
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,320
NFA. Your case is dismissed.

782
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,560
We've been sat here all morning.
When did that happen?

783
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,040
About 30 seconds ago
when CPS phoned the clerk.

784
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,600
Go on, then.

785
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,760
Get out while you still can.

786
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,440
Freedom!

787
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,960
You look tired, mate.
Do you need a lift?

788
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,400
I ain't got nothing to say to you.

789
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,360
What, not even "thank you"?

790
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,320
Who do think got
your charges dropped?

791
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,960
Same twat that had me locked up
in the first place, seems like.

792
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,960
Same twat that ain't got shit
on me now, anyway.

793
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,640
Not on you, I don't.

794
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,760
Your mum, on the other hand -
overstayed her visa by about,

795
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,640
ooh, 16 years.

796
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,880
Jump in the car,
we'll talk about it.

797
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,600
What do you want with my mum?

798
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,600
So he does speak.

799
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,440
She's not your mum, is she?

800
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,160
Look, I've got some friends
at the Home Office.

801
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,120
They won't go anywhere near her,
long as I say.

802
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,160
You mean as long as I snitch?

803
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,960
You just have to report
to me once a week.

804
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,120
Keep me posted on people you talk
to, things that you hear.

805
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,760
Who am I talking to?

806
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,640
I work counter-terrorism.

807
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
I don't know any fucking
terrorists, bruv.

808
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,680
Not yet you don't,
but we'll get you there.

809
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,160
Look, your identity will be
protected

810
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,400
and there's perks to knowing
people like me.

811
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,960
Your dad's been released already,
I've taken care of that.

812
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,200
My dad?

813
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,160
How's that?

814
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,880
Bit of a card, isn't he, your dad?

815
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,840
Look, I really don't know
how I'm supposed to help you.

816
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,840
I've got to run a quick errand, so,
pardon the detour, yeah?

817
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,280
SIREN

818
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,200
What is this place?

819
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,560
Why are you bringing me here?

820
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,040
Have you heard about
that Rotterdam bombing?

821
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,320
17 dead, 63 injured.

822
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,640
Why do you think they do it?

823
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
To hurt people.

824
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,400
To scare people.

825
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,840
People don't feel safe, they panic.

826
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,880
Blame anyone
that doesn't look like them.

827
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,720
Then they start
building places like this.

828
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,880
Say it loud, say it clear.

829
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,560
Refugees are not welcome here.

830
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,200
GATE CLANKS, BUZZER SOUNDS

831
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,240
Afternoon, Neil.

832
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,160
How's the private sector?

833
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,240
Underworked, overpaid.

834
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,440
Always looking for new blood
if you fancy a pay rise.

835
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,000
You're all right, thank you.

836
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,760
How's everything with the lads?

837
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,960
Young 'un got into a fight
at Sunday league.

838
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,160
Bloody mess.

839
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,760
Line-up's ready for you.

840
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,920
Thank you.

841
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,480
Poor sods.

842
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,880
Lost a game of snakes and ladders,
now they're back on the bottom.

843
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,040
I'll grass for you.
You don't need to threaten me.

844
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,800
Relax, Raza.

845
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,560
Pick one.

846
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,320
- One what?
- Whichever man you choose gets to stay.

847
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,560
Stay?

848
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,720
Like stay.

849
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,480
How?

850
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,320
Well, just choose one.

851
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,800
- Why do want me to do it?
- Because we're working together now.

852
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,560
- This is fucked.
- Neil, no-one gets to ride free today.

853
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,280
No, no. OK, shit.

854
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,440
I'll do it.

855
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,320
How am I supposed to choose?

856
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,120
I don't know.

857
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,520
Nicest hat, friendliest face.

858
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,760
Him.

859
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,320
Which one?

860
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,680
Come and point him out to me.

861
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,240
This guy?

862
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,800
Stand up.

863
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah, stand up.

864
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,840
Come here.

865
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,640
You understand English?

866
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,320
Where are you from?

867
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,040
Afghanistan, boss.

868
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,520
What's your name?

869
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,080
Rostam Avshar, boss.

870
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,080
Welcome to England, Rostam.

871
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,600
Boss?

872
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,400
You remember this face.

873
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,720
This is the man that
changed your life.

874
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,360
Thank you.

875
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,880
Rostam, come with me.

876
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,520
VIBRATING

877
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,000
This is Yousef. You know what to do.

878
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,880
Yousef, Post Office.

879
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,600
I'm afraid we've dumped
that package of yours.

880
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,760
That does leave an outstanding
balance on your account.

881
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,040
You'll be hearing from us.

882
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,160
Hello.
How are my two favourite ladies?

883
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,440
- Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

884
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,760
No hugs for me, then?

885
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,280
You don't want paint
all over you, Daddy.

886
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,960
Hey, Ems, I thought
we'd settled on the duck egg.

887
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,760
Don't ask me.
I'm not in charge.

888
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,600
Come on, then.
I'll take over from here.

889
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,240
But, I'm not done yet.

890
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,680
Hey, it's late. Come on, Laurie.

891
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,960
You've got paint all over you.
Get cleaned up.

892
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,520
And I'll know if you haven't
brushed your teeth.

893
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,120
All right, all right.

894
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,000
- You look tired.
- Oh, thanks.

895
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,920
You still look a lot better than
the last guy that came to paint my walls.

896
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,240
Hello, stranger.
What have you been up to?

897
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,920
This and that. You?

898
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,800
This and that.

899
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,840
You're back.

900
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,400
I thought you'd moved
to bloody Shoreditch.

901
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,000
_

902
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,640
You don't just send a canary
straight down the mine.

903
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,480
You've got to put him
in a cage first.

904
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,240
He knew the risks.

905
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,640
No, he didn't.

906
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,080
They never do.

907
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,440
If they did, they wouldn't do it.

908
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,600
What happened to
"They're not your friends?"

909
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,680
They're not.

910
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,680
But you're theirs.

911
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
You know their biggest secret.

912
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,440
All they want to know is,
are you going to keep us safe?

913
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,000
You lie about anything else,
you don't lie about that.

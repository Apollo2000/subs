1
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,380
Oh!

2
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,610
Out of my way!

3
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,130
What's the matter with you people?

4
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,580
Out of my way!

5
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,450
Right, out of the way.

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,570
Oh, my God. Has anyone
called an ambulance?

7
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,130
On its way, Doc. Sorry
to get you out so early.

8
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,170
I'll give you a nerve block.
This will have to be dismantled.

9
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,210
No, Doc, you can't do that,
it's my brother's boat.

10
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,610
He needs the winch for
this morning's fishing.

11
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,370
Your fingers are lodged in
there, you could lose your hand.

12
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,050
- I could reverse the machinery.
- Don't touch anything.

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,900
Probably not that complicated.

14
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,690
I don't need a shot.

15
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,370
It's a local anaesthetic,

16
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,850
injected around the
nerve below your wrist.

17
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,940
It'll numb your fingers.

18
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,690
Hold very still. I don't want to pierce...

19
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,370
- .. your ulnar artery.
- Argh!

20
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,050
- Don't touch anything!
- Sorry. Sorry. My bad.

21
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,200
Imbecile!

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,610
Doc, is this a bad time
to ask you a question?

23
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,660
- Yes.
- Thought so.

24
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,050
No, no, we made it clear

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,450
that you had to give us one
month's notice, Janice.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,050
Sorry, I thought it'd be obvious

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,290
I wouldn't be working after tomorrow.

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,130
- You know, because of this.
- But I'm married and I work.

29
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,890
Yeah. I know.

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,290
It's just a very busy
period for me, Janice.

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,650
We've got parents' evening,

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,290
and now I need to find
alternative childcare for James.

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,770
Mel's opened that nursery. Heard
the places are going fast.

34
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,530
Might be good for him, get
him used to socialising,

35
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,970
being around folk, so he
doesn't end up like, erm...

36
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,770
- Like who?
- Hello.

37
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,490
Doc, just one second.

38
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,690
Joe, you can't be here! It's bad luck.

39
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,730
That doesn't count until tomorrow.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,490
- Where are you going?
- I'm not taking any risks.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,690
I'll wait outside till Joe's gone.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,410
How was the emergency?

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,970
Some stupid fisherman
caught his hand in a winch.

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,050
Don't worry. Me and the
Doc had it covered.

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,580
The old Dynamic Duo.

46
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,170
So, you'll be coming to the
pre-wedding party this evening?

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,570
Yeah, maybe.

48
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,810
Martin, can you switch
James into the buggy?

49
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,810
I need to grab those staff appraisal forms

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,700
and get off to work before I'm late.

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,330
So, Doc, what I was talking about.

52
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,770
- Arms up.
- It's Al.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,250
He's just not cutting it as best man.

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,540
I mean, he's good, but good isn't enough.

55
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,410
I thought, you know, return the favour?

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,220
Erm... no.

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,410
What's the matter with you?

58
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,970
Just been working out at the gym.

59
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,810
Getting in shape for the wedding.

60
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,540
Dug.

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,290
Oh. It took me half the
night to get these done.

62
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,810
- How much sleep did you get?
- No, I'm fine.

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,330
It's just the workload's
been a bit tough recently.

64
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,570
- Don't worry.
- At least this one's settled.

65
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,810
Fast learner, too.

66
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,970
You never mentioned he
was talking already.

67
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,850
What? He spoke?

68
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,050
Er... yes, I think he
did just say something.

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,690
No, no. I can't believe
I missed his first word.

70
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,890
What did he say?

71
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,930
I'm not sure. It sounded
like, er..."duck".

72
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,330
Sounded more like "dog" to me.

73
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,650
James, tell Mummy. What did you say?

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,780
Was it "dog" or was it "duck"?

75
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,940
James?

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,770
Dad.

77
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,930
- Oh, morning, boy.
- What are you doing so early?

78
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,210
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

79
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,810
Hm. So, are we gonna do
that thing where I ask you

80
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,370
what you're hiding in the shed

81
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,620
or are you just gonna
go ahead and show me?

82
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,130
- That is a lot of whisky.
- Yes. Yes.

83
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,970
You told Ruth that sales had been good.

84
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,210
I massaged the truth.

85
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,650
It inspires confidence in the investors.

86
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,570
I had a deal with a restaurant in Bridge.

87
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,210
20 bottles. It felt like
the start of something big.

88
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,890
It made sense to be prepared.

89
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,650
And judging by the look
of things, nobody...

90
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,810
nobody else has placed an order.

91
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,130
It's the economy.

92
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,410
Restaurateurs are too
scared to take a gamble

93
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,930
on an unknown brand.

94
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,930
I know I can turn it round.

95
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,210
But I just need you to do me a favour.

96
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,570
Don't tell Ruth, right?

97
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,620
I mean, have a little faith in me.

98
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,960
Oh.

99
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,690
Thanks for dropping it off here, Mike.

100
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,330
Thank you.

101
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,740
- Fingers crossed, eh?
- Let's hope so. Bye.

102
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,220
Oh.

103
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,300
Hello.

104
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,090
Sorry. Erm... short notice,
but I was wondering

105
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,090
if the Doctor had any appointments today.

106
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,850
Well, we've just had a cancellation.

107
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,090
- So if you're free now?
- Oh, yes.

108
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,010
Wonderful. The name's Rosie Edwards.

109
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,490
I'm not registered here yet.

110
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,930
It won't be a problem.

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,740
If you could just fill
out one of these forms.

112
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,450
So have you just moved
to the village, then?

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,490
Yeah. Half my stuff's still in storage.

114
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,170
I've not even had time to unpack
and it's straight to work.

115
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,210
You working with Rev Moore, then?

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,730
Er... no, instead of him.

117
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,810
So I got back from my holiday yesterday

118
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,050
and there are these
messages saying he's gone off

119
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,090
on some spiritual retreat and
I've got to fill in ASAP.

120
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,930
It's been a rush and a push, it has.

121
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,010
So, are you doing the
wedding tomorrow, then?

122
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,420
Yeah. It's my first one ever.

123
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,290
Yeah, maybe don't mention
that to the groom.

124
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,050
He's a bit on edge as it is.

125
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,770
Well, I am qualified.

126
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,860
You've not met Joe Penhale.
Just trust me on this.

127
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,290
- Oh!
- Careful.

128
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,850
Your depth perception's
altered. You'll get used to it.

129
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,250
Next patient. Go through.

130
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,580
What's all this? Tidy this up.
It looks like a jumble sale.

131
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,690
Hello, love.

132
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,010
Er, so...

133
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,970
I was in Australia for a holiday
and I had a few problems.

134
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,170
I was told I'd need to check in
with a GP when I got back here.

135
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,090
You had a deep vein thrombosis.

136
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,010
Apparently from the plane ride over.

137
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,010
I was only meant to be
there for two weeks.

138
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,170
The whole thing was a complete disaster

139
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,490
for a number of reasons.

140
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,740
Sleeve.

141
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,690
Ended up closer to a month,

142
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,570
stuck in hospital, juggling all that

143
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,930
trying to work out when I'm
starting my curateship here.

144
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,010
Your blood pressure's high.

145
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,880
Yeah. Tell me something I don't know.

146
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,130
Actually, I didn't know that.

147
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,650
You've also been prescribed Warfarin.

148
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,890
I'll need to monitor your
blood while you're taking that.

149
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,890
- Are you practising?
- Yes, of course.

150
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,890
I'm a certified medical practitioner.

151
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,540
No, I mean the Buddha
statue you have over there.

152
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,970
Yeah, I understand.

153
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,370
I've heard it's one of
the most popular ornaments

154
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,970
to keep in the home.

155
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,490
I suppose that says a lot
about who we are these days,

156
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,450
religion as a statement of interior design

157
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,050
rather than faith or belief.

158
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,540
Stop talking.

159
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,930
The er... doctor in Australia

160
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,250
said I'd need to be on
Warfarin for four months.

161
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,810
- That can't be right.
- No.

162
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,610
Well, that's a relief.

163
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,490
More like six. Your deep vein thrombosis

164
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,330
is caused by a blood clot
that's at risk of breaking loose

165
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,130
and travelling to your lungs,

166
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,980
causing a fatal pulmonary
embolism. It's very serious.

167
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,690
What are you doing?

168
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,970
Something to remind me to keep
calm and centred no matter what.

169
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,290
Back when I worked in the city,
I had a few problems before.

170
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,100
I had to learn some coping mechanism.

171
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,220
All right. Don't start doing it again.

172
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,180
And four bedrooms?

173
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,250
Well, if we could get you an attic.

174
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,610
- Anything's possible.
- Next patient?

175
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,010
Yeah. And the important question.

176
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,730
What sort of price range
would you be looking at?

177
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,690
Are you the patient?

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,990
Come through.

179
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,250
Can I... I'll have to call you back.

180
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,090
What time's a good time?

181
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,660
Erm... yeah, lovely. OK. Oh.

182
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,090
Here you go. Doctor's orders.

183
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,490
Oh. He's an odd one, isn't he?

184
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,970
He's got a strange idea of bedside manner.

185
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,890
The Doc is a very intelligent
and conscientious man.

186
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,650
We're blessed to have him. £8.60, please.

187
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,450
No, of course,

188
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,170
I... I didn't mean...

189
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,250
Oh, you've got, erm...

190
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,250
What? Oh, right.

191
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,130
Yeah. Matching collars.

192
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,940
Mine is for a genuine medical complaint.

193
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,220
No, of course. Sorry.

194
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,010
I'm the new curate.

195
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,460
I didn't realise we were getting a woman.

196
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,740
Thanks, then.

197
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,770
It's only his first word.
It's not a big deal, really.

198
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,210
I mean, yes, it's the moment
where you realise truly

199
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,010
that your child is their own person.

200
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,890
Miss. There's a worried
looking man in the playground.

201
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,570
- Where?
- Out of the way.

202
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,530
Be careful of the baby.
That's it. Careful. Careful.

203
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,370
- Stand clear.
- Martin. Is everything OK?

204
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,650
Yes, it's fine. It's Thursday.
We meet for lunch on Thursdays.

205
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,050
Sorry, I totally forgot,
I've just had so much on.

206
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,530
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.

207
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,330
I've been rota'd onto lunch duty today.

208
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,610
You'll have to go without me.

209
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,210
We'll do something later, though.

210
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,890
Yes, I can get some fish, if you like.

211
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,090
Actually, it's Joe and Janice's
pre-wedding party this evening

212
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,130
and I did sort of say we'd maybe go.

213
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,930
- Oh.
- You don't want to go, do you?

214
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,370
- I don't mind if you want to.
- I don't really.

215
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,570
Anyway, you hate those sorts of things.

216
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,450
They'll be disappointed if you don't go.

217
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,410
Right. So, sorry, now you
do want to go to a party?

218
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,090
I don't know. What do you want to do?

219
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,570
- Knew you'd start complaining.
- I'm not complaining.

220
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,530
- Joe expects us to be there.
- Right, so we are going?

221
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,250
- Yes, I...
- Good. I'll see you later.

222
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,570
I'll ring the babysitter. Bye.

223
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,090
And then I'll say,

224
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,450
"I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife"

225
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,130
and I'll join your hands.

226
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,010
Sorry, it's just you keeping saying "I",

227
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,210
but tomorrow, it'll be
a real vicar, right?

228
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,050
Well, no, it'll be me.

229
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,770
But you're not a real vicar.

230
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,780
I'm a curate.

231
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,330
Think of me as a vicar
with learner plates on.

232
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,450
But I thought we were getting a
proper person to do our wedding.

233
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,770
How many folks have you actually married?

234
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,810
Why don't we head over to the vestry

235
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,370
and talk about the two of you?

236
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,930
Because that's what
it's all about, isn't it?

237
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,650
So how long have you two been together?

238
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,730
- I'd say about seven.
- Eight.

239
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,170
Eight weeks.

240
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,810
Oh. So it's a...

241
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,090
it's a whirlwind romance, then?

242
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,090
It's a funny story.

243
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,570
We were out for fish and chips
one night and Joe just asked me.

244
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,890
I was waiting on my cod
and I said, "All right.

245
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,300
Why not?"

246
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,450
But you've discussed the future...

247
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,090
what marriage means to both of you,

248
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,770
whether you want children...

249
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,450
- No, thank you.
- As many as we can have.

250
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,570
I don't mean hundreds.

251
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,290
- Five or six.
- I work with children...

252
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,330
.. and it's screaming and crying

253
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,050
and stuff coming out of both ends.

254
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,210
It is healthy to have differences.

255
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,930
Can we have it put in the marriage vows

256
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,570
that we don't need to have children?

257
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,210
The important thing is that
you take this seriously.

258
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,770
Let marriage be held in honour among all.

259
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,010
Sorry, how many weddings
have you done before?

260
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,730
I'd rather we talk about you.

261
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,170
It is vital that you've
thought through this decision.

262
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,130
We've both been married before.

263
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,210
Once. Twice.

264
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,810
I'd say that's even more
reason that you need to be sure.

265
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,330
Do you have any references?

266
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,250
It's my first wedding, all right?

267
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,770
But I am very capable.

268
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,900
I can assure you of
that with all my heart.

269
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,130
Your nose is bleeding.

270
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,650
Hm?

271
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,410
Oh, sorry, er... it's er...

272
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,980
Ah.

273
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,810
Oh, dear, that's...

274
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,850
Oh it's just...

275
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,170
It's been a long week.

276
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,810
- So...
- Uh.

277
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,090
.. in your professional opinion,

278
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,450
me and Janice here, and be honest...

279
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,770
- Brutally honest.
- .. we've both had heartbreak...

280
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,580
and misfortune, so it's
really important to us.

281
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,100
Do you think we've got what it takes?

282
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,750
Very, very, very, very good.

283
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,080
Well done.

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,950
Dug.

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,950
I've finally got these staff
appraisal forms finished.

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,750
It's getting ridiculous, I
barely do any teaching nowadays,

287
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,080
it's all data analysis and record keeping.

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,950
- He spoke again, didn't he?
- Yes.

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,750
What did he say?

290
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,390
Erm... I think it was "duck". Maybe "dog".

291
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,430
That's twice I've missed it now.

292
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,310
- I'm sure it's not personal.
- I didn't think it was.

293
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,590
At least not until you mentioned it.

294
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,990
He's not even looking at me now.

295
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,030
He hasn't developed the cognitive capacity

296
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,030
to know when he's being discussed yet.

297
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,750
Do you think he likes me?

298
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,110
Who knows? I didn't like
my mother. Does it matter?

299
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,910
Of course it matters! And he's not you.

300
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,720
Well, I'm sure he's very fond of you.

301
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,190
Maybe you should think about
reducing your work load,

302
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,750
if it's causing you stress.

303
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,910
Thanks.

304
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,240
We should think about going.

305
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,990
Right! You lot, I want you in here now!

306
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,390
Start serving, Becky, and no
mucking about like last week.

307
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,870
I got my eye on you.

308
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,310
Right. Take a tray and
mingle. Go on, mingle.

309
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,150
Go on. Take a tray. Mingle.

310
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,830
Finished your best man speech yet?

311
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,070
Didn't have to. Joe decided
to write it himself.

312
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,950
It's 15 pages long plus footnotes.

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,630
Only one more day then you're free.

314
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,310
- Yeah.
- Vodka and Coke, thanks.

315
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,110
Really? Al?

316
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,280
Talk about low standards.

317
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,830
- Hm.
- This is whisky.

318
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
Straight whisky.

319
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,280
Dad. Dad!

320
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,630
Before you say something, Joe
is paying for all the alcohol,

321
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,910
but he hasn't been specific
about what alcohol.

322
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,240
Aside from our whisky, what
other drinks are available?

323
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,830
Please tell me there's at
least soft drinks, right?

324
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,400
Well, there's water. For the whisky.

325
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,040
You're unbelievable.

326
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,270
Al, why can't I get a
beer at my own party?

327
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,750
Yeah, it's just a mix up
with the supplier, mate.

328
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,350
You're best man. You're
supposed to be on top of things.

329
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,200
OK. Give me five or ten minutes
and I'll get it sorted, Joe.

330
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,750
It's a total disaster.

331
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,070
Oh, it's not that bad.

332
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,870
Morwenna, I'm a policeman,
I know this village,

333
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,630
these people, inside and out,
and I can tell you for a fact

334
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,230
that not one of them drinks whisky.

335
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,590
- Bert.
- Yes, my lover?

336
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,760
Same again, ta. Easy on the water.

337
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,710
Maybe he said "dog".

338
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,430
- It was impossible to tell.
- James is very fond of him.

339
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,950
Maybe we should think about,
I don't know, keeping him.

340
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,430
Him? What do you mean, the dog?

341
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,270
I know you didn't grow up with
pets, Martin, but I had a dog

342
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,910
when I was younger and I've got
a lot of good memories of it.

343
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,030
And he is always around.

344
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,670
So's Penhale but we
don't have to adopt him.

345
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh.

346
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,910
How's your hand?

347
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,630
Oh, it's fine, there's
no need to check it, Doc.

348
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,750
Do you realise that
drinking strong alcohol

349
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,990
whilst on painkillers is not only stupid

350
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,310
- but incredibly dangerous?
- It's not my fault.

351
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,430
- They're only serving whisky.
- Don't be ridiculous.

352
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,430
Take responsibility for your own
health. Here, you, take that.

353
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,830
Get me a glass of water and
a small glass of white wine.

354
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,590
Two whiskies. No, a glass of water

355
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,270
and a small glass of white wine.

356
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,620
Just take the drink and
stop being so fussy, yeah?

357
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,270
You're coughing over
everything! Wash all those off!

358
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,220
If you're not well enough to
come to work you should go home.

359
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,070
Reverend Moore isn't taking the ceremony?

360
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,750
He's on a spiritual retreat.

361
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
Sorry.

362
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,270
It's just that's what he always says

363
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,950
when he wants to nip away
for a fishing holiday.

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,470
I thought everybody knew that.

365
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,150
I hold a very senior
position in this church,

366
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,910
and no one has informed
me of these events.

367
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,010
Well, don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

368
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,310
Wonderful, isn't it?

369
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,790
First they got to vote,
then they got to drive.

370
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,270
Now they can even marry people.

371
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,080
That's proper progress, Sal.

372
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,910
They're only serving whisky. Is
that something to do with you?

373
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,150
Hello to you, too, Martin.

374
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,390
I have no idea what you're talking about.

375
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,750
This whole thing seems to be
run by your business associates.

376
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,730
Testing, testing.

377
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,510
Oh, God.

378
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,550
- That's funny.
- Get on with it, you plonker!

379
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,680
That's not funny.

380
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,990
Janice and I would like
to thank you all...

381
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,830
.. for coming tonight...

382
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,770
Give me that.

383
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,470
Sit there. There's a chair there.

384
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,390
- .. to celebrate our...
- Sit down.

385
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,630
- Breathe calmly, calmly.
- .. big day...

386
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,990
.. to mark...

387
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,710
- Just keep it down.
- Calm down.

388
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,310
- Doc?
- I'm with a patient!

389
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,030
Doc, it's fine. They're
just clearing their throats,

390
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,510
playing silly buggers.

391
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,190
Pay attention to the speech now.

392
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,270
I'm having a bloody heart attack!

393
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,790
No, she's not. She's not
having a heart attack.

394
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,750
Calm down. Just breathe.

395
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,270
She's not having a heart attack.

396
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,030
Agh, agh, agh...

397
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,910
Just keep your eyes on me, people.

398
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,830
- Eyes on me, people.
- Get off!

399
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,230
Sit down. Open your mouth.

400
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,350
Doc, please...

401
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,950
Morwenna, we need to get all
these people to the surgery.

402
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,430
- Surgery's closed, though.
- Well, go and open it, then.

403
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,910
- Stop eating peanuts.
- I'll have those.

404
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,630
Calm. Calmly. In through the
nose, out through the mouth.

405
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,270
When's the Doc gonna see me?

406
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,920
I told you, he's seeing
everybody one by one.

407
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,430
I could die. Would you be happy then, eh?

408
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,310
Would you?

409
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,950
I didn't ask to come back to work.

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,750
Listen, the Doctor said
that you are all stable now,

411
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,190
so just take a breath and
he will be with you ASAP.

412
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,190
Have you had any other symptoms?

413
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,790
Same as my mates, Doc.

414
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,030
Tell me about them.

415
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,670
Well, there's Chloe, she's
blonde, says it's natural,

416
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,470
- but hello, roots.
- Tell me about the symptoms.

417
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,750
Oh.

418
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,430
Bit of a sore throat,
chest pain, comes and goes,

419
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
hurts when I cough.

420
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,350
That last one, that was huge.

421
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,270
Can I get a sick note?

422
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,430
And this just started today?

423
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,470
Didn't you ask my mates the same question?

424
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,150
Yes, and now I'm asking you.

425
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,630
Started this morning. So sick note, yeah?

426
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,510
Otherwise Bert'll try and stiff us.

427
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,790
We did that oyster festival
for him the other day,

428
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,630
he's still not coughed up, plus
he got mad at us for, you know.

429
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,830
No, I don't know. What does that mean?

430
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,470
He's doing it to promote
his horrible whisky.

431
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,110
Couldn't make me drink it, but then he's,

432
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,790
"That's coming out of your wages."

433
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,110
"It's only one bottle,
mate." Tight-fisted git.

434
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,270
And you were all drinking
from the same bottle?

435
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,990
Yeah, but I'm still not paying for it.

436
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,670
Was everybody drinking from
that bottle working tonight?

437
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,120
Yeah. Who else you going get?

438
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,390
Slave wages, I said. Then he
said slaves didn't get wages.

439
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,150
What are you doing down there?

440
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,470
Quiet!

441
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,150
If you were working at the oyster festival

442
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,720
earlier this week, put
your hand in the air.

443
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,350
Keep your hand in the
air if you also shared

444
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,440
from a bottle of whisky with this girl.

445
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,790
Right.

446
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,630
It's my opinion you've all
contracted Bornholm disease.

447
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,670
It's spread by respiratory droplets,

448
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,960
infecting food and drink and bottles.

449
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,510
You can put your hands down now.

450
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,270
None of us care what we've got.

451
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,710
Are we gonna die, or what?

452
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,790
Well, you really should care, you know.

453
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,870
Because of your complete lack of hygiene,

454
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,910
you've infected one another with a virus.

455
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,070
Luckily for you, if it
is Bornholm disease,

456
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,950
it clears up in a week without treatment.

457
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,950
But you all need to stay at home
to avoid infecting anyone else.

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,790
- We're bridesmaids tomorrow.
- I am the photographer

459
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,350
- for the wedding, yeah?
- I really don't care.

460
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,390
God knows how many
people you infected today.

461
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,710
Now go home and stay indoors.

462
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,910
I'll be calling your parents to make sure

463
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,150
they don't let you out.

464
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,750
Great for them on their wedding day!

465
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,110
- Whatever!
- Ridiculous!

466
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,190
- What are you doing here?
- You told me to come here.

467
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,440
Well, go home, then.

468
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,590
- Kind of feels like a bad omen.
- No, it's not.

469
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,270
It's just an unexplained situation

470
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,030
where a group of people have collapsed

471
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,310
with symptoms similar to
that of a heart attack.

472
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,720
That's all. Don't worry.

473
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,960
Where did everybody go?

474
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,480
Gonna need you to step
up your game tomorrow.

475
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,390
So why are you trying to
force our whisky on people?

476
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,550
- Special promotion.
- Bert.

477
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,630
I'm fairly sure I'm not an idiot

478
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,110
so I'd appreciate your
not treating me like one.

479
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,710
You promised me I was buying
into a legitimate business.

480
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,070
It is legitimate.

481
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,030
Then you can provide me with
some current sales figures.

482
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,350
Of course I can.

483
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,830
May take a few days to
collate the figures, though.

484
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,280
No, Bert. Tomorrow.

485
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,840
James. Speak to Mummy.

486
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,800
Come on, James.

487
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,310
Speak to Mummy.

488
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,560
Say "duck".

489
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,750
Say "duck".

490
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,990
Duck.

491
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,470
No?

492
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,070
OK. James,

493
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,390
say "doggy".

494
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,990
A doggy. Say "doggy".

495
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,230
Dog. Woof, woof!

496
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,030
Woof! Dog.

497
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,350
Dog.

498
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,630
What on earth are you doing with that dog?

499
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,110
I just wanted to give James
a little... a little nudge.

500
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,430
Why? His developmental
process is perfectly normal.

501
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,080
Well, maybe we have different
ideas of what normal is.

502
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,950
Martin, we both had absentee parents.

503
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,750
Sometimes I worry we'll end
up repeating that pattern.

504
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,070
Why were you waving a dog?

505
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,230
Because Joe Penhale got
to hear his first word.

506
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,830
I just feel like I missed out.

507
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,470
I should get ready for work.

508
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,320
Banana. He's not had it yet.
Please will you give it to him?

509
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,070
You, out of here. Go on, shoo!

510
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
Shoo, shoo!

511
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,430
Martin, what happened
with those girls yesterday?

512
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,110
They'll get better. It
was Bornholm disease.

513
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,670
Of course, yes. An
enterovirus. Makes sense.

514
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,670
And how are things at home?

515
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,270
They're fine.

516
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,910
You sound uncertain.

517
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,310
- Please don't analyse me.
- I wasn't.

518
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,920
I was showing concern.

519
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,070
Louisa missed James's
first word and, erm...

520
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,040
Well, she's finding it, erm...

521
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,680
The post therapy period can be difficult.

522
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,830
People grow reliant on the process,

523
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,630
having problems to focus on.

524
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,750
It can be a period of transition,

525
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,160
adjusting her view of the
world and her place in it.

526
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,480
Right, well, that's something
to look forward to, isn't it?

527
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,550
Oh, no. No, no. Get away!

528
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,950
Go away! Disgusting.

529
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,870
Sorry, Doc, I'll just be a minute.

530
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,310
What the hell are you doing?

531
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,670
Sorry, Doc, I can't help
it, I got caught short.

532
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,230
Oh, no, no, no!

533
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,030
I don't think I'll make it inside, Doc.

534
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,310
- No, just go!
- Oh, thank you.

535
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,590
No, go inside!

536
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,520
Oh. Oh.

537
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,670
Ah. Wait. Wait there. Wait.

538
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,030
I really can't. Ah...

539
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,200
In that.

540
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
No, no, no, in the lavatory!

541
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,270
- Is he all right?
- He's an idiot.

542
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,950
It's a casserole.

543
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,720
Oh, thank you.

544
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,910
I'll be wanting the dish
back when you're done.

545
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,870
You didn't have to do this.

546
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,120
Well, as we're working together,
it's important we get along.

547
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,270
Just you here alone, then, is it?

548
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,470
Er... yeah.

549
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,750
Oh. Cos I remember the
estate agent, Mrs Trappett,

550
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,550
saying that a nice young
couple were moving in.

551
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,350
Did something happen, then?

552
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,070
I need to get on, I've
got a lot to unpack.

553
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,880
As you wish.

554
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,870
It's quite a big place, though,
isn't it, for just one?

555
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,560
- Thanks again.
- Mmhm.

556
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,160
Bye.

557
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,550
Sorry, Doc. I forgot to fill
the sample thingy the first time

558
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,670
and obviously had to wait
for the pipes to refill...

559
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,190
as it were.

560
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,910
On the examination table, please.

561
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,910
I've got to go get ready for my wedding.

562
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,550
You're clearly in great discomfort

563
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,070
and were urinating in my garden.

564
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,360
Get on the examination table.

565
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,200
Take off your belt, undo
the top of your trousers.

566
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,950
- Does this hurt?
- No.

567
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,510
I told you, Doc, you're
fussing about nothing,

568
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,790
I've just pushed myself too
hard at the gym, that's all.

569
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,440
- Does this hurt?
- Argh!

570
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,160
OK, let go. Let go.

571
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,950
How long have you had that pain?

572
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,750
A few days.

573
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,040
And how often are you passing water?

574
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,750
- Bit personal.
- I'm a doctor.

575
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,560
Every couple of hours. Sometimes more.

576
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,030
Is it...

577
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,680
Is it serious?

578
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,310
I'm gonna have to tell Janice
before I go down the aisle.

579
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,470
It's like when you buy a second-hand car.

580
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,790
If there's something wrong,
they have to tell you.

581
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,950
That's the law.

582
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,270
The dipstick shows there's
blood in your urine.

583
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,270
Oh, God.

584
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,230
It could indicate nephrolithiasis.

585
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,830
- That'd be my best guess.
- I can't believe it.

586
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,560
It's kidney stones.

587
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,190
Right.

588
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,910
Doc, couldn't you have just said that?

589
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,310
Because, frankly, necro...

590
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,390
- Nephrolithiasis.
- .. sounds terrifying.

591
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,910
You'll need surgery, or laser
treatment on the stones,

592
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,510
or you could pass them naturally.

593
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,790
I'll go for natural. Sounds
best. They're only stones.

594
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,230
I'll prescribe you some painkillers.

595
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,430
Actually, Doc, I've heard about
people getting addicted to them.

596
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,350
Couldn't I have something off the shelf?

597
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,910
No, it wouldn't be strong enough.

598
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,280
It can be incredibly painful.
And drink plenty of fluids.

599
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,150
What do you mean? No bridesmaids at all?

600
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,750
Doctor's orders.

601
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,790
So, who's gonna take photos?

602
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,950
Well, I can take them.

603
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,630
Don't worry.

604
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
OK, hold still.

605
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,030
So, what time are your parents arriving?

606
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,190
I sort of didn't tell them,

607
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,270
because I've been married twice
before and they keep saying

608
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,590
I don't think things through.

609
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,710
You have thought this
through, though, right?

610
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,280
Well... yeah.

611
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,310
It's just with everything
going wrong last night

612
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,600
and now the bridesmaids being cancelled...

613
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,670
.. it feels like a sign.

614
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,510
Well, anything can be a
sign, if you want it to be.

615
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,800
OK. You're done.

616
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,880
I do look amazing, though.

617
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,230
- Sorry...
- Oh!

618
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,470
.. if I upset you earlier.

619
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,870
No, you didn't. It's fine.

620
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,550
Good, because I know
weddings can be stressful.

621
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,910
Mm.

622
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,990
Oh, Reverend Moore is an old hand.

623
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,760
Now, he makes it look easy.

624
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,060
Watch it!

625
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,550
Does he not know we're
going to the wedding?

626
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,110
Of course he would.

627
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,230
Where are you going? I
told you to stay at home.

628
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,510
- We're going...
- What?

629
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,430
I'm the bleedin' photographer.

630
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,790
- We're bridesmaids.
- None of this matters.

631
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,390
You are all extremely infectious. Go home.

632
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,390
There's more of us than there is of you.

633
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,190
You can't stop us, Doc, can you?

634
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,590
I can report you to the
environmental health officer.

635
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,870
If your symptoms get
worse, contact the surgery.

636
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,220
Go home and stay there.
And I will be checking.

637
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,470
This is ridiculous!

638
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,910
I spent four hours doing
my hair, Doc. Thanks!

639
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,320
- What a joke!
- Better now?

640
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,640
Yes.

641
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,480
Good morning, ladies.

642
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,590
- Have you got the ring?
- Course I have.

643
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,630
Don't worry, everything's going to be...

644
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,760
Don't say it. You'll jinx it.

645
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,070
- Hello.
- Hello, there.

646
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,080
On the left.

647
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,430
So we've sold nothing
in the past three weeks

648
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,910
but have continued to produce stock?

649
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,190
Yes.

650
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,990
Which puts us on the edge
of collapse, doesn't it?

651
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,830
Maybe we should talk about
this after the wedding.

652
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,840
Oh, we will. Believe me.

653
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,630
You know, we've no idea
if it's been housetrained

654
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,790
and the chances are it's
riddled with disease.

655
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,030
Endless studies show
that children who grow up

656
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,230
around pets, like I did, have a
greater cognitive development.

657
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,630
And that's just a fact.

658
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,950
There are certain studies, yes.

659
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,270
I'm not entirely sure they're endless.

660
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,590
Is this why you've been unhappy recently?

661
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,630
- Because you want a dog?
- No.

662
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,070
I've not been unhappy, Martin.

663
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,920
Just cos you don't want a dog
doesn't mean James is the same.

664
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,110
Oh, you look nice, Joe.

665
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,670
Did you pick up those painkillers?

666
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,430
Doc, do me a favour. It's my wedding.

667
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,470
Take off the stethoscope
and try and enjoy yourself.

668
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,480
I'm not an idiot, you know.

669
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,390
After you.

670
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,120
Let's go through.

671
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,670
Are you OK?

672
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,630
Maybe it's just nerves.

673
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,880
And Joe is lovely and sweet.

674
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,360
It's just...

675
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,070
I don't know.

676
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,190
How did you decide about Al?

677
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,120
Well, I'm not marrying
Al, I'm just going out.

678
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,040
And we were friends for
a long time before that.

679
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,750
And he always dates the
Doc's receptionists

680
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,790
so I suppose it was a no-brainer.

681
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,950
Cheers, babe.

682
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,960
It's different for me.

683
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,350
I don't want to hurt Joe.

684
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,270
You're gonna hurt him a lot more

685
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,520
if you change your mind
in a few months' time.

686
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,990
I think I need to speak to him.

687
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,680
Mind your dress. You can
get a refund on that.

688
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,740
(Mrs T...)

689
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,790
- Hi.
- Hi. Erm, Joe, listen...

690
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,270
In the presence of God,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit...

691
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,710
Sorry, just one sec.

692
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,270
.. we have come together
to witness the marriage

693
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,470
of Joseph William Penhale

694
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,510
and Janice Alice Catherine Kate Bone,

695
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,670
and pray for God's blessing on them...

696
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,070
Sorry, is there any chance
you could sort of...

697
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,830
- Go faster. Yes, please.
- What?

698
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,710
.. and to shape their joy
and celebrate their love.

699
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,670
Marriage is a gift of God in creation...

700
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,310
Could you maybe fast forward a bit?

701
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,870
- Fast forward?
- No one's really interested

702
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,750
in all the God stuff, it's
the vows they came to hear,

703
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,190
so just skip on a bit,
get to the good stuff.

704
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,310
I'm going to perform
the ceremony properly.

705
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,190
It would be good to take a moment...

706
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,550
It doesn't matter, just keep on going.

707
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,590
Marriage is a gift of God in creation.

708
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,630
- You've said that already.
- It is given...

709
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,310
that as man and woman grow together

710
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,930
in love and trust...

711
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,120
- .. they shall be united.
- No. Sorry. Just one minute.

712
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,560
Don't worry, I think I know what it is.

713
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,390
- I need to go and tell him.
- Are you sure?

714
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,630
What's happening?

715
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,030
Janice is thinking of
calling off the wedding.

716
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,350
What? No.

717
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,270
No, you can't, because he'll blame me.

718
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,510
- I'll never hear the end of it.
- It's the best time.

719
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,910
- Get him nice and quiet.
- Try not to make it hurt

720
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,990
any more than it has to.

721
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,000
- Ow, ow!
- How are you getting on?

722
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,110
No. Doc, it really hurts.

723
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,590
You didn't get the painkillers, did you?

724
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,230
I didn't want to be all
smacked up on painkillers

725
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,590
- on my wedding day.
- Then you're an idiot.

726
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,700
I know that now, Doc.

727
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,350
So, erm...

728
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,630
normal service will be
resumed in a few minutes,

729
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,830
so just talk amongst yourselves.

730
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,630
Try not to strain.

731
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,550
Then stop looking at me.

732
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,750
Ohh!

733
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,550
- Right. I'm looking away now.
- Ow, ow!

734
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,610
Ohh!

735
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,390
Sorry about that.

736
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,230
Right. Normal service is resumed.

737
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,030
Let the wedding service commence.

738
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,950
- Mate...
- Trying to have a wedding here

739
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,030
in case you hadn't noticed. From the top.

740
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,070
- No.
- Good point.

741
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,730
No need to do the boring
bit. From the middle.

742
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,450
Joe...

743
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,350
- Al, seize the phone.
- I told you to stay at home!

744
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,950
- I'm the official photographer.
- Go home now and stay there!

745
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,910
Doc. Please. Trying to
have a wedding here.

746
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,230
- Maybe... we shouldn't.
- Look, I understand.

747
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,270
But you can't blame her, it's
her first wedding, after all.

748
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,310
- This is not my fault.
- No, sure, I'm just...

749
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,030
I imagine someone with
a bit more experience

750
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,550
would know how to make
things go a bit smoother.

751
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,950
It's you, making a
mockery of this ceremony.

752
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Marriage is serious.

753
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,390
Love is serious,

754
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,960
but you're treating it all like some joke.

755
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,550
We could just go to the vows if you want.

756
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,040
I want you to be quiet
and listen for once.

757
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,860
Neither of you have thought this through.

758
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,390
You are showing utter contempt
for the order of service,

759
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,350
and she, well, she's clearly
having second thoughts.

760
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,360
No, she's not.

761
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,680
Are you?

762
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,310
I'm sorry.

763
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,630
You could have both had
a serious discussion

764
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,750
about this beforehand, like I suggested.

765
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,910
But no, not you two.

766
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,670
No, it's better to wait
till the service is under way

767
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,310
before you examine your relationship!

768
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,040
You know, you're the kind
of people who wait until...

769
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,030
.. until someone has flown halfway round

770
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,670
the bloody world before
you tell them it's over.

771
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,710
That's a little bit unprofessional.

772
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,950
Something's the matter
with her. Miss Edwards?

773
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,640
And I thought I could cope.

774
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,190
I thought I could manage.

775
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,870
Miss Edwards, can I have a word?

776
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,790
No. No. They wanted a wedding.

777
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,630
They're gonna get a wedding.

778
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,510
They are getting married
whether they like it or not.

779
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,190
Now start playing. Start playing!

780
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,030
Back to your places, come on, come on!

781
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,110
Penhale, can you put pressure on that?

782
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Give me my hand back.

783
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,270
She's got no pulse.

784
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,070
Let me listen.

785
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,950
Right, she's stopped breathing.

786
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,430
- Defibrillator?
- Yeah, it's in the car.

787
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,190
- I'll get it, and your bag.
- Thank you.

788
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,350
- Get outside!
- Yes, come on. Everyone out.

789
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,560
- Just let me through.
- Sal, Sal, come on.

790
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,070
It looks like...

791
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,880
a myocardial infarction, Doc.

792
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,830
Oh, my. Oh.

793
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Got it.

794
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,710
Her heart's beating again, but
it's faint. Where's my bag?

795
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,790
- Here.
- There's a lot of blood, Doc.

796
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,990
Yes.

797
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,310
The Warfarin stopped it clotting properly.

798
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,270
- Leave that alone.
- On the case, Doc.

799
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,080
- I'm right by your side.
- Don't touch anything.

800
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,840
Right.

801
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,470
Press down. I'll give her
a vitamin K injection

802
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,310
to reverse the effects of the Warfarin.

803
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,670
I feel duty-bound to tell you, Doctor,

804
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,150
that the patient has been taking drugs.

805
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,670
I saw her popping pills earlier.

806
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,990
And also she called you odd.

807
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,470
Best do what the Doc says. Come on, Sal.

808
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,950
Come on.

809
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,320
Miss Edwards, what tablets
have you been taking?

810
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,000
Miss Edwards.

811
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,350
I just needed something to
get me through this month.

812
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,120
He already had a new girlfriend.

813
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,600
All that way to get my heart ripped out.

814
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,590
I was supposed to be married next month.

815
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes, but what have you taken?

816
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,670
I got them in Australia.

817
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,590
- Ven... Ven something.
- Venlafaxine?

818
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,990
Yes, supposed to help with
depression and anxiety and...

819
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,510
And when taken in
conjunction with Warfarin

820
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,630
can cause psychosis and slurred speech,

821
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,030
and an arrhythmic heart beat.

822
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,760
So, Doc, just to check,

823
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,920
will she be able to continue the wedding?

824
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,270
For the last time, go home!

825
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,150
Ruth, I know I've made a
little bit of a mess of things

826
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,350
and you probably want to pull
out of our business deal.

827
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,150
A partnership requires a
degree of trust and honesty,

828
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,390
both of which seem to be in short supply.

829
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,950
This is all I've got in my life.

830
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,110
Emotional blackmail won't help.

831
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,590
No, I mean, I will fight
to the last breath

832
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,390
to make this business work.

833
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,870
I know I'm not perfect, but I
believe that we have something.

834
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,600
I just need a little more time.

835
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,270
One month.

836
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,280
I was thinking more like six or seven.

837
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,600
One month. Right. No problem.

838
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,070
What? Hang on. What?

839
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,830
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

840
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,870
I didn't think I could cope.

841
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,350
But I know that's not true now.

842
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,270
But everything is a test, isn't it?

843
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,720
And that's how He works.

844
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,750
And if I can survive that policeman,

845
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,080
I can survive anything.

846
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,470
Blessed is the one...

847
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,790
- Right, off you go.
- .. who perseveres under trial.

848
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,430
James, Chapter One, Verse 12.

849
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,270
Well, at least Joe managed to
achieve something positive today

850
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,830
in a roundabout way.

851
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,270
- Do you think he'll be OK?
- Why?

852
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,600
From the looks of things, he's
just been jilted at the altar.

853
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,920
Hi.

854
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,200
We just want different things in life.

855
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,150
I want a family. Kids.

856
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,560
I know, five or six.

857
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,800
I feel like we rushed into this, Joe.

858
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,160
I'm so sorry, I really am.

859
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,840
It's fine. I'm good.

860
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,990
(Nighty night. Good boy.)

861
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,390
(Is he asleep?)

862
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,620
(Yeah, kind of.)

863
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,760
I think we should, erm... keep the dog.

864
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,630
For a trial period,

865
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,550
providing it's quarantined

866
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,550
and deloused and wormed and castrated.

867
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,550
Oh, that's wonderful.

868
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,280
But why?

869
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,670
- Because you asked me.
- But it's a dog, Martin.

870
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,150
It's a harbinger of
pestilence and disease.

871
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,350
Mm. But you've seemed frustrated lately

872
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,150
and er... I think it might help.

873
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,350
The problem isn't the
dog, Martin. It's my work.

874
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,750
It's... Oh, it's changed,
and it doesn't help

875
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,910
I keep thinking that I should
be around more for James.

876
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,310
So we don't need the dog, then?

877
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,430
No, no, we're having the dog.

878
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,390
On a trial period with strict parameters.

879
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,860
For a trial period with strict parameters.

880
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,840
Dog.

881
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,560
Martin, I think I know what
he's saying. He's saying "dog".

882
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,950
Did you say, "dog"?

883
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,550
Now say, "Mummy".

884
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,480
Say, "Mummy".

885
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,790
Are you cleaning yourself properly now?

886
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,550
How is your personal hygiene routine?

887
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,910
I am not a drug addict.

888
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,030
Which is exactly what
one of them would say.

889
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,910
- Sorry, am I early?
- Yes.

890
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,350
This is from your Dr. Ellingham.

891
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,630
- It hurts!
- It really does.

892
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,030
I have no idea what my
father saw in such a place.

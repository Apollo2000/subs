1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:02,157
Every afternoon,
I've been going to Luke's campus

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:04,499
to help him train for rugby tryouts.

3
00:00:04,534 --> 00:00:06,734
What do you say we practice
that lineout lift one last time?

4
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,202
- And...
- I got to go.

5
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:09,704
I don't want to be late
for women's studies.

6
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:11,205
That's what I call my lunch break.

7
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:14,108
All right. Good luck at tryouts.

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,576
<i>The other day,</i>

9
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:18,646
<i>something pretty interesting
caught my eye.</i>

10
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:22,717
modifications must be made

11
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:25,019
to standard microeconomic procedures

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,623
to apply supply and demand analysis.

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,027
First, we construct a utility function,

14
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,962
where Y equals income

15
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:37,131
and X equals the cost of services.

16
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:38,266
Well...

17
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:41,569
Next, we vary either X...

18
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,170
Pffffbbbbb.

19
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:45,673
What... What's on your mind?

20
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:48,309
Well, um, with all due respect,

21
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:51,045
you have a roomful
of aspiring Realtors here,

22
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:53,447
and I worry that you might
be turning them off

23
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:55,883
with all those numbers and formulas.

24
00:00:55,985 --> 00:00:58,519
It's actually a very exciting business.

25
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:01,522
It's about people
and... and emotional connections

26
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:03,524
and magnets with your face on them.

27
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,426
You think you can just walk in here

28
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:07,161
and start teaching this class?

29
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:08,596
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have...

30
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:10,631
No, I'm asking...
can you teach this class for me?

31
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,134
If I leave now, I won't have to
pay the all-day parking rate.

32
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:18,388
<i>10 minutes with the dean,</i>

33
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,889
who, it turns out, I'd sold a house to,

34
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,791
and I was official.

35
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:24,726
Imagine Phil Dunphy shaping minds

36
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:27,162
in the hallowed halls
of Sequoia Community College,

37
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,698
established 2016.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
As you can see from this graph,
it's not about X's and Y's.

39
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:40,142
It's about oohs and ahs.

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
Okay.

41
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,349
So, what does real estate equal?

42
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:50,752
80%...

43
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,754
eye contact.

44
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:02,862
<b>Synced and corrected by BLuk

45
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,302
All right. Your breakfast
is almost ready.

46
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:11,638
You're gonna need all your
energy for the courtroom today

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,073
in case you have to yell,
"I'm out of order?

48
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,875
You're out of order.
The whole damn system's out of order!"

49
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,210
Might not do that.

50
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:18,945
I think I'm winning, so big fan
of the system right now.

51
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,313
- Anyway, it can't hurt
- Cam.

52
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,949
to have some experienced eyes
take a look at this police work.

53
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:24,918
Sloppy. Sloppy, sloppy.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,787
Okay, I know you fancy yourself
some sort of detective.

55
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,657
You know, I was quite
the amateur sleuth as a boy,

56
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:32,225
a real-life Encyclopedia Brown.

57
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:33,727
They called me Thesaurus Jones.

58
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,895
What I really need right now is
just a few minutes of silence,

59
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:37,597
- just like...
- I would say my toughest case

60
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,233
was "The Case of the Missing Snowman."

61
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,435
You know, at first,
I thought he'd come to life,

62
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:43,903
- but turns out...
- Shh! My trial!

63
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:45,205
<i>Today marks the fourth day</i>

64
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,007
<i>of witness questioning
by the DA's office.</i>

65
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:49,042
- My God.
- Is that you?

66
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:50,176
I look like an elf that just walked

67
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:51,444
into his own surprise party.

68
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:52,979
No, it's like the time we tried
to microwave a squash.

69
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:55,649
I... Okay, this is my first big trial,

70
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:57,617
a-a chance to make a name for myself.

71
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,487
All anyone's gonna be talking
about is that awful picture!

72
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:02,055
Okay, this is a disaster.

73
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:04,491
Th... There's a place downtown
where all the lawyers go to drink.

74
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:05,759
It's called The Side Bar.

75
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,727
They put courtroom sketches on the wall

76
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,262
of everyone's first big trial.

77
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:10,397
Maybe nobody saw it.

78
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,932
Um...

79
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,435
Don't assume the worst.
It could just be an Amber Alert.

80
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,605
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>
<i>- Yo.</i>

81
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,473
Since it's our first day
with our new partners,

82
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,875
I thought maybe you could get to work

83
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:24,077
as close to on time as poss...

84
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,812
I will try my best.

85
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:28,415
Hi.

86
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:30,150
I'm sorry. Am I late?

87
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:31,384
No, no, no, no.

88
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,019
And we're not real time sticklers here.

89
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:34,621
We've found that team members
really excel

90
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:35,989
when they follow
their own energy rhythms.

91
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,357
Interesting, 'cause I've found

92
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,758
team members are happiest

93
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,694
when the company stays in business,

94
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:43,296
which means asses in chairs by 9:00.

95
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,466
Dad, could I just have
a quick... quick sec with you?

96
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,701
Sure.

97
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:50,503
Um... so, Dad, look,

98
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,806
the culture is just different here.

99
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,008
And you just can't
come in with a sledgehammer,

100
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,376
or it's gonna create tension.

101
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,211
You don't want to alienate people.

102
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:00,113
- So you want me to change who I am?
- No.

103
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:02,782
I just want you to hide who you are.

104
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,318
I mean, come on. Just a little bit.
Let's get rid of this.

105
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,686
Look at that. That's better already.

106
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,622
Who is this 50-something?

107
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:11,791
- Fine. I will be on my best behavior.
- Thanks, Dad.

108
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,496
- So sorry about that.
- Well, it's no problem.

109
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:18,231
Family time is so important.

110
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,500
That's why we offer 14 months
paid paternity leave.

111
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:21,801
Kay.

112
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,204
Let's see an update
on that Thinfinity model.

113
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,372
Ooh. Cool design.

114
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,241
- Who do I high-five for that?
- Everybody.

115
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,910
Our design meetings
are organized around burstiness,

116
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:32,912
which is a rapid-fire creative process

117
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:35,248
that really just unlocks
the unconscious.

118
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:38,384
Does anybody else find that distracting?

119
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,920
Actually, it's great
for left-brain stimulation.

120
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:41,956
I got winner!

121
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,456
We don't keep score.

122
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:45,358
- No?
- Watch out!

123
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,493
What the hell?!

124
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,027
You don't know about Zorbing?

125
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,529
It promotes mind/body balance.

126
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:51,664
It's kind of like
the German version of Flerming.

127
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:52,733
Okay, that's it.

128
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,534
Now, I'm about to introduce you squids

129
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:55,802
to a little thing called back-breaking,

130
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:59,638
soul-crushing hard work.

131
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,846
How many heart attacks have you
had here in the last five years?

132
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,915
Zero? Where am I?!

133
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,750
America loves closets,

134
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,052
and I'm here to build them, damn it!

135
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:12,457
And you get this back when I see
people pull up in the morning

136
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,091
crying in their cars.

137
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:17,795
Yeah.

138
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,568
Okay, must you?

139
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:24,370
You know what, we are gonna make sure

140
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:26,872
that sketch artist sees the best
possible version of you.

141
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,741
Let's get those apples a-shining!

142
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,209
Okay, okay, stop. Don't!

143
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,244
Okay, your face gets weird
when you make that "O" sound,

144
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,812
so avoid that.

145
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:34,881
A-Are you serious?

146
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,515
The defendant runs the Orange County

147
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,051
Oceanic and Ornithological Organization.

148
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:40,531
- That was hard to watch.
- Wha...

149
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,100
All rise.

150
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:43,601
Last looks.

151
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,137
Be seated.

152
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:49,707
Mr. Pritchett, you may resume
your questioning of the witness.

153
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,309
Okay.

154
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:53,277
Mitchell. Mitchell. He's here.

155
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:55,279
Only give him your best side.

156
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:57,081
Avoid the fluorescent lights, no O's,

157
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,316
and whatever you do, do not
stand next to the bailiff.

158
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,019
He is breathtaking!

159
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,287
My God.

160
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:03,589
Counselor?

161
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,791
Sorry, Your Honor. Um...

162
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,226
- Miss Carpenter...
- Bad side!

163
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:12,498
...do you recall seeing this man
on the night in question?

164
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,265
Yes, sir.

165
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:17,282
And is he,
to your knowledge, the C.E.O...

166
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,719
of the Orange County Oceanic
and Ornithological Organization?

167
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:22,220
Counselor, you're mumbling.

168
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:23,455
Can you repeat that, please?

169
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,523
Does he run the bird and water place?

170
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,260
- He does.
- And is he here today in this...

171
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,766
As I was saying... Little further.

172
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:38,738
...is he here today in this,
in this courtroom?

173
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,006
That's him.

174
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,041
Let the court note that I am pretty sure

175
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:45,111
that the witness has identified
the defendant.

176
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:53,328
Elbow patches?

177
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,531
Did you burn through
another blazer at Benihana's?

178
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,666
Actually, it is for my new position

179
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,535
teaching real estate at your school.

180
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:01,713
What are you talking about?

181
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:02,948
They offered me a job.

182
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,516
But hey, listen... listen to me.

183
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,184
Lifelong dreams aside,

184
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,686
I'm not taking this
unless you're on board.

185
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:08,887
I'm definitely not.

186
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,757
I get it.

187
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,425
Don't want your old Pops
cramping your style,

188
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:14,760
so I'm... I'm out.

189
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:15,994
It's just funny.

190
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:18,163
Can't remember the last time
I was this excited.

191
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,369
But it wouldn't...
wouldn't make any sense

192
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,637
unless you were excited, too.

193
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,140
Not even a little bit.

194
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,475
Right.

195
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,644
Those poor kids, though?
I have so much to offer.

196
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:28,912
For example,

197
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:32,516
which house styles are sold
by which cookie type?

198
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,618
French Revival...
French accent] macaroons.

199
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,019
English Tudor...

200
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,287
shortbread.

201
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:41,124
But...
we both know what you want,

202
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,642
so, I'll resign and go back

203
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:46,779
to trying to figure out
what to do with my final years.

204
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,946
Okay.

205
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,582
I need a place to stay
for a couple of days.

206
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,784
Can't go home, can't go to school,

207
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,052
don't want to talk about it.

208
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,286
Got it.

209
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:00,622
I knew that Alex wanted
to talk about it,

210
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,824
but I had a lot on my mind.

211
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,959
I had a rough morning with Joe.

212
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:07,662
Have a great first day.

213
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:09,798
Aren't you gonna walk me in?

214
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,767
No. In first grade, you have drop-off.

215
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:15,361
No one said anything about drop-off.

216
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,196
What if I can't find my cubby?

217
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:19,465
They don't have cubbies.
They have lockers here.

218
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:22,302
Wait. Wait a second.
Where's my lunchbox?

219
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,837
I signed you up
for the hot-lunch program.

220
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:27,440
What is this place?

221
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:29,505
Okay, I've been feeling some pressure

222
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:31,407
about what to do
after I graduate this year,

223
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,409
and my parents are constantly
asking me about it.

224
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,411
I thought that you were going to work.

225
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:39,214
So did I, but lately, I've been
questioning everything.

226
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:40,916
I even thought about becoming a fellow.

227
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,452
Ay, Alex, that's a big change.

228
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,587
But at least you get
to keep the same name.

229
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:47,222
I'm not even sure
it's what I really want.

230
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,424
Okay, you have to be very sure,

231
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:51,593
because I heard
it's even harder to reverse it.

232
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,184
Can we talk about anything else?
Where's Joe?

233
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:54,886
He started school today.

234
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:57,588
He was so panicky
when I dropped him off.

235
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:59,490
I don't know why. It's just first grade.

236
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:00,758
Just first grade?!

237
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:01,959
That's when the pressure starts!

238
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,028
Ay! You're freaking me out!

239
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:07,398
Alex is going to be a very nervous man.

240
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,102
E-excuse me, sketch man.

241
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:13,217
We'd like a word with you
about your little drawings.

242
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,972
- Yes.
- You don't remember me, do you?

243
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,042
It's... Um...

244
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,624
Well, obviously,
we have offended you somehow.

245
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,060
Were you the barista we had fired?

246
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,097
Here's a hint... I once stayed
in your upstairs rental.

247
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,036
Who consumes an entire welcome basket?

248
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,071
We usually reuse half this stuff.

249
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,673
All the Altoids. He was here one night.

250
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:34,808
He... He even ate
the horseradish mustard.

251
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:36,010
What did he put it on?

252
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,186
We purposely don't give crackers.

253
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,683
- Hey.
- Hey.

254
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,292
We are so sorry we offended you, but...

255
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:46,994
Ooh, too late.

256
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:48,128
I own you two.

257
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:50,464
And I haven't even gotten
to my best stuff yet.

258
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,166
I can go redder.

259
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:53,500
You wouldn't.

260
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:55,235
Just wait till I connect the brows.

261
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,671
Please. We have a child.

262
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,108
Fun... a reporter from CNN.

263
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:04,411
Looks like this pretty little
portrait's about to go national.

264
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,713
What... What are we gonna do?

265
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,264
Okay, is it just me, or does this sound

266
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,832
like a job for Thesaurus Jones?

267
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,701
- It's just you.
- No. Blackmail, Mitchell!

268
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,237
We just have to dig
something up on this guy.

269
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,473
Shouldn't be a problem, because
everyone's hiding something.

270
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,774
Everyone.

271
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:21,143
I feel like you're sitting
on one more...

272
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,678
- Everyone.
- Yep.

273
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,932
Shh! Shh! Shh!

274
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,768
<i>Just as I feared,
my dad had crushed the spirit</i>

275
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:33,937
<i>of everyone in that office.</i>

276
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,272
<i>I had to do something to prove</i>

277
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,274
<i>we weren't some stuffy killjoys.</i>

278
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:39,409
It was time to bust out Party Claire.

279
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,713
She'd retired after spring break '89.

280
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,382
And again in '92.

281
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:47,818
Hey, do you have a second?

282
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
If this is about
my respecting your process...

283
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,489
Actually, we want to thank you
for laying down the law before.

284
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:54,391
Because we have gone soft as a company,

285
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:55,992
we needed a couple grown-ups to come in

286
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:58,228
and put us back on track.
You know, thanks to you,

287
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,496
we've gotten rid
of all the distractions...

288
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:01,565
no more ping-pong tables, squirt guns.

289
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,567
The only thing we couldn't find
was that giant...

290
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,202
Break time, bitches!

291
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:08,538
It turns out this is a little...

292
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:10,006
My God! The Thinfinity!

293
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,141
I'm so sorry!

294
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:12,909
My God! I'm so sorry!

295
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,444
I...!

296
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:18,615
Sorry.

297
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:27,043
Sketch boy was unusually well-groomed

298
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,046
for somebody coming out
of a government-subsidized gym.

299
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,714
<i>Something wasn't right.</i>

300
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,450
<i>I was getting
that old Thesaurus Jones tingle.</i>

301
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,952
<i>I decided to do some sniffing around.</i>

302
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:39,689
<i>Sketch guy's face had a kind of glow</i>

303
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:42,525
<i>that can only be achieved with
expensive creams and unguents,</i>

304
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:45,628
<i>yet all I found were packets
of cut-rate all-purpose lotions.</i>

305
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:49,265
<i>According to my sources,
the gym had an executive level</i>

306
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,001
<i>that provides all manner
of fancy spa products,</i>

307
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,270
<i>but it's for judges and attorneys only.</i>

308
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:56,881
<i>I created a diversion</i>

309
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,450
<i>by convincing the security detail</i>

310
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,884
<i>there was a towel emergency...</i>

311
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,853
There's a towel emergency.

312
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,093
<i>...and hacked
into the gym's computer system.</i>

313
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,363
<i>Turns out Jonah's been accessing
the executive level</i>

314
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,199
<i>by swiping the ID of one Victor Graham,</i>

315
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,867
<i>a retired judge.</i>

316
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:19,960
Members of the jury,

317
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:22,329
the defendant, Mr. Kane,
would have you believe

318
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:24,998
that he was working
at the time of the crime.

319
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:26,333
Bald?!

320
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:29,203
...faced lies!

321
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,071
Counselor?

322
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,475
Because evidence would clearly suggest

323
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:37,010
that, um...

324
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:40,013
That while James Kane

325
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:44,157
does have an office on
his company's executive floor,

326
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,326
he was nowhere near it that night.

327
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:49,796
Nice try, executive-level Jim.

328
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,432
...Kane...

329
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:53,867
but we're onto you.

330
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:58,538
Ladies and gentlemen,
before you've retired, judge...

331
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:04,611
...for yourself
and draw a more accurate conclusion

332
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,447
than the one Mr. Kane
would have you believe...

333
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,070
Counselor, you're speaking weirdly.

334
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,640
I'm sure you will find
the defendant's alibi

335
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,074
to be thin.

336
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,944
Even thinner.

337
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:26,798
Good afternoon, young Realtors.

338
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,800
I have a very important announcement

339
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,169
to make after class,

340
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:32,838
but in the meantime,
if you would be so kind

341
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,773
as to open your books...

342
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,543
Boy. I can't do this.

343
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:41,647
Students, today is
our last day together.

344
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:43,715
Shh, shh.

345
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,508
I've treasured our time together.

346
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,611
Brett, I know we got off
to a rough start,

347
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:50,279
but once we broke down those walls,

348
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:51,780
I'm not sure who was teaching who.

349
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:56,051
Whitney, you're the toughest
single mother I know.

350
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,765
Lucy, you be good to your mom.

351
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,769
Bob, amazing how you battle
that dyslexia.

352
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,038
Maybe ease off on the anger
toward your parents, though.

353
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:05,740
They did you a solid
giving you that name.

354
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:07,508
We're gonna miss you, Mr. Nudphy.

355
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,911
It's... You... You...
You flipped it, but...

356
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,405
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

357
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:15,983
Location. Location. Location.

358
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,318
You memorized it.

359
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:22,223
Now, for the second and last time...

360
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,292
class dismissed.

361
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:28,305
Dad.

362
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,107
Luke?

363
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,742
How long have you been back there?

364
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,010
I pretty much saw the whole thing.

365
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,714
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

366
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:39,216
Don't forget your coffee mug.

367
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:40,384
O-

368
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,198
I'm sure this all worked out
for the best.

369
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,733
I'll, probably miss

370
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,502
a few spontaneous
Frisbee opportunities and...

371
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,638
apparently,
a tumbling exchange program...

372
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:54,674
well...
and an Amateur Inventors Association.

373
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,743
How much fun could it be
changing the world, anyway?

374
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:04,350
A Hall and Oates Magic Show."

375
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,373
- Dad, wait.
- Yes, Luke?

376
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,774
Don't forget your mug again.

377
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,376
Come on!

378
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,444
Can't you see I'm meant to be here?

379
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm sorry, but I've never
had a school to myself.

380
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,050
I was always Alex's dumb brother
or Manny's hot nephew.

381
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,020
Now I can finally be my own person.

382
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,621
I'm sorry. I get it.

383
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,490
I-I r... I-I really do.

384
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,025
I think I was just getting
a little overexcited.

385
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,993
I'll...

386
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,228
I'll see you at home.

387
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:35,292
Dunphy.

388
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,828
Glad I ran into you so I can
congratulate you personally.

389
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,697
- Wait. I made the team?
- First string.

390
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,766
I got to say, your form
on that lineout lift

391
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,501
was impeccable.

392
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:44,902
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

393
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,276
Hey, Dad. I made the team.

394
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:55,913
<i>That's amazing!
I knew you would. You're a natural.</i>

395
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,494
Well, I had a great teacher.

396
00:15:57,596 --> 00:15:58,729
<i>Aww!</i>

397
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,198
So, listen.

398
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:02,833
This is a big campus.

399
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:04,401
Maybe we could both be here

400
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,204
if we promise to stay
out of each other's way.

401
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,626
<i>Well, I'd hate to step on your toes.</i>

402
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:12,461
No, no, y-you wouldn't.

403
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,596
I would hate to stop you

404
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:14,964
from doing something you're so good at.

405
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,499
<i>I guess I could think about it.</i>

406
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,301
I mean, it's not like
I'd be there all the time.

407
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,338
I, have class and office hours,

408
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,774
and I have the 11:00 a.m.
to 2:00 p.m. slot

409
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:28,544
at the campus radio station
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

410
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,780
Hey, if you want to be my sidekick...

411
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,848
- Dad?
- You're right.

412
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,316
It's better if I do all the voices.

413
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:35,551
What's up?!

414
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:40,216
What's all this?

415
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:43,252
Well, you got me so nervous
about Joe's terrible day

416
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:45,788
that I put all this out
to cheer him up...

417
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:47,823
sundae, video game.

418
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,397
I even wrote him a little pep talk.

419
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,299
We're lucky to live
in the golden age of medicines.

420
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,101
Hey, Grandpa, I'm staying here
for a couple of days,

421
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,369
and I do not want to talk about it.

422
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,437
Cool.

423
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:58,839
That's Joe.

424
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,777
Hey, is my dad home?

425
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,379
Crap. What is my mom doing here?

426
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:06,914
Come with me.

427
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:08,315
I owe him an apology.

428
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,651
I made a huge scene at work.

429
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,787
Well, sometimes
the best way to say "I'm sorry"

430
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,089
is in an e-mail.

431
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:19,760
Why don't you write him
at JaysComputerMail@aol.com?

432
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:23,598
I plowed over a bunch
of people in a giant hamster ball.

433
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,100
And then I tried to impress the foodies

434
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,801
by ordering Indian for lunch.

435
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,270
And then I chewed some gum

436
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,838
to get rid of my coriander breath,

437
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,573
and I'm pretty sure some's in my hair.

438
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,408
And then I...

439
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,644
tripped and fell and skinned my knee,

440
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:37,446
and everybody saw my underwear.

441
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,615
Crushed it!

442
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,483
First days are easy when you're cool.

443
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:44,419
I do feel bad for Conner B.

444
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:47,155
He brought stinky egg salad for lunch.

445
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,758
He's gonna have to eat with the nurse.

446
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,126
- God!
- Ay.

447
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:53,395
Joe, why don't you go upstairs?

448
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,438
I just want to go back to my old office,

449
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,806
where I had friends.

450
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,341
I know.

451
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,609
Sometimes...

452
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,412
...you know, we all have bad days.

453
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:06,891
And...

454
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:11,529
And sometimes, we have to...
to deal with mean boys.

455
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:12,830
Boys are mean.

456
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:14,432
You're right, Gloria.

457
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:16,801
I am right?

458
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,270
You know what I love
about this family?

459
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:23,741
Mnh-mnh.
We're not quitters... especially you.

460
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:28,800
Remember how hard it was
for you to learn how to swim?

461
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:30,202
It was hard.

462
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:34,072
But now it's your favorite thing
in the world

463
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:37,676
because it reminds you
of how strong you are.

464
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:39,378
I mean, I like to swim...

465
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,346
Tomorrow can only be better.

466
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:44,216
But just in case, I'll come at lunch,

467
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,785
and I will kiss you through the fence.

468
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:50,051
How about I text you around 11:00

469
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,419
and let you know how I'm doing?

470
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:54,222
So, you want to tell me
why you're avoiding your mom?

471
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:56,824
I'm not avoiding her.
Hey, what's... what's all this?

472
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:59,594
Danger O'Shea memorabilia.
I'm a big collector.

473
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:01,930
- Who's Danger O'Shea?
- Legendary daredevil.

474
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:05,099
Got famous for jumping over
a school bus on his motorcycle.

475
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,523
Get over here! Talk to me.

476
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:08,225
Tell me why you're avoiding your mom.

477
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,526
Okay.

478
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:11,895
Well, I've been on
a science track my whole life,

479
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:14,531
which my parents love...
"Alex the scientist."

480
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,867
But... lately, I've been
having second thoughts.

481
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:20,936
I've always loved singing,
and... and I've been doing

482
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,637
some open-mic nights recently,

483
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:24,373
and it's been going really well.

484
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:26,508
I see where this is going. Sing for me.

485
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,443
What, like... right now?

486
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,811
Just sing.

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,074

00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,390
That was great.

489
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,192
Stick to science.

490
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:47,229
Wow. You really got a knack
for pep talks in this house.

491
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:49,364
I'm not saying it's impossible.

492
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:50,665
I'm saying play the odds.

493
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,868
For example, you take this O'Shea guy.

494
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:53,969
Good. We're back to him.

495
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:57,739
But he was smart.
He started a business, got established.

496
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:59,474
And when he couldn't kick
the daredevil dream,

497
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:00,742
he went for it.

498
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,511
And he was good... real good...

499
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,146
until that fateful day he tried to jump

500
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,015
over a motorcycle in a school bus.

501
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:09,418
Fortunately for him, unlike his act,

502
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,619
he had a safety net.

503
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:12,487
- His business.
- Jumped right back in.

504
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,989
Within a year, it was bigger than ever.

505
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:17,025
The point is, you've been on
the science track for 15 years.

506
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,594
See it through. Build a foundation.

507
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:22,864
If in a couple of years, you still
have the singing bug, go for it!

508
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,733
I guess you're right.

509
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,168
It would be pretty dumb of me

510
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,036
to give up on the career path I'm on.

511
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:30,405
I could make half a mil
my first year out of school.

512
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:32,140
Wow! What do they pay men?

513
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:37,546
So, Danger never did
another stunt again?

514
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:40,382
He still brings that maverick
spirit to everything he does,

515
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:42,350
which is why he got
to the top of his industry.

516
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:45,387
Some people think it's the greatest
stunt he ever pulled off.

517
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:49,057
Thanks for the talk...

518
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:50,659
Danger.

519
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:55,289
So, I won my case, and even better,

520
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,658
- this is going up at The Side Bar.
- Yeah.

521
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,260
And now maybe you'll have some respect

522
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,561
for my investigative skills.

523
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:03,197
It was a pretty simple case,
because, as I've said,

524
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,718
everyone has something to hide.

525
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,797
Everyone.

526
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,487
- You know...
- Everyone.

527
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:24,512

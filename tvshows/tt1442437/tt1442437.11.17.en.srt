1
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:04,781
Ah.

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:07,036
Listen to those birds.

3
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:08,445
Mm.

4
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:10,291
I love it out here.
It's so peaceful.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,809
We should have
done this months ago.

6
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:13,805
I'm gonna go for a run.

7
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,258
Okay. Let's just
make sure it's safe.

8
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:16,147
Okay.

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,619
Okay, now! Go now!

10
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:19,653
Four days ago,

11
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:22,373
Claire and I moved out here
to the driveway.

12
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,174
The house exceeded
maximum capacity

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,597
when Alex
moved back home.

14
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,813
She quit her fancy job

15
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,907
for something low-paying
and ethical!

16
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:29,937
Yay.

17
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:33,442
Between her, Luke, Dylan,
Haley, and the twins,

18
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:35,792
things have devolved
into total chaos.

19
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:37,824
Alex! Open up!

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,156
My hair is drying,
and I haven't put any product in yet.

21
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,341
Go use Dad's!

22
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:43,974
Ugh! Can I get like
two minutes to myself?!

23
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:45,693
Oh, my God!

24
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:46,589
Hey!

25
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,261
You woke up the babies,
you idiot!

26
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:49,701
Haley!

27
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,091
Great, now <i>he's</i> up.

28
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:53,131
Darn it, Luke.
That was my foot!

29
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,836
Who made macaroni and cheese
and left it out?

30
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,719
Sorry, Mrs. D.
That was me and Luke.

31
00:00:57,763 --> 00:00:58,970
But in our defense,
we were high

32
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:00,870
and got spooked by your German dishwasher.

33
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:03,206
Well, now the entire kitchen
is covered with ants,

34
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:04,085
and so am I.

35
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:05,191
God, I got to
take a shower.

36
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:06,962
Well, good luck with that.
No more hot water.

37
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:08,948
Yep! Gonna lose
a toenail.

38
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:10,852
There goes sandal season!

39
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:22,630

40
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:24,949
Oh.

41
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:25,795
Do you love it?

42
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:27,626
Oh, my God!
You've gotten so much done.

43
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:29,609
Well, I wanted to finish it
before the housewarming.

44
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:30,879
It looks so good.

45
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,058
Thank you!
I swear it's this place.

46
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,478
It... It makes me
better at things.

47
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,149
I... Yesterday,
I threw my T-shirt

48
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:38,239
at the laundry basket,
yelled, "Money!"

49
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,935
and it almost went in.

50
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:42,247
It's been a weird
and wonderful month.

51
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:43,525
We adopted a baby boy.

52
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:45,089
Yeah, and we moved
into a new home,

53
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:46,657
which we love so much,

54
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,962
we named our son
after our street.

55
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,833
- Rexford.
- Rex Tucker-Pritchett.

56
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,649
With a name like that,
he can be anything he wants...

57
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:55,247
a quarterback, a running back,
a middle linebacker.

58
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:56,527
Oh, he...
he's got big feet.

59
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:57,830
Maybe he could be
a kicker.

60
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,724
Why don't you believe
in him, Mitchell?

61
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,299
This is crazy!

62
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:04,884
We're out of everything!

63
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,137
Is that the last
of the cereal?

64
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,547
Oh, we haven't had
cereal in days.

65
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,274
This is formula
over croutons.

66
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,813
They're grrrrrross!

67
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,640
Ooh, coffee dust.

68
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:14,781
Ew!

69
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,631
Don't... Don't judge me!

70
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,291
You've been wearing
bathing suits for underwear

71
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:19,718
since the washing machine
broke.

72
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:21,211
I wish I had
a clean bathing suit.

73
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:23,811
I had to cut leg holes
into a shower cap.

74
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:25,419
Do I have coffee
in my teeth?

75
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:26,774
- Mm.
- Arvin wants to meet

76
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,816
before I sign the contract,
for some reason.

77
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:29,931
Ooh.

78
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:32,633
I bet I know
the reason why.

79
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,512
'Cause he wants
to get with you.

80
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,823
No, he does not.
He's about to be my boss.

81
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:39,109
Which is why he wants
to talk before you sign.

82
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,147
Nowadays, you get in trouble
for dating at work

83
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:44,143
unless it's a pre-existing
relationship.

84
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:45,930
I know this because
I had to go to an HR thing

85
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,299
thanks to some
smoking-hot janitor

86
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,135
who can't take
a compliment.

87
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,676
Married mother of two,
and you are insane.

88
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:52,212
Eh.

89
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:54,026
Arvin doesn't see me
that way.

90
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,402
I mean, d-does he,
do you think?

91
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:58,451
Yes!

92
00:02:58,487 --> 00:02:59,672
He gets all nervous

93
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,003
and yammery
when he's around you.

94
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,264
How do you still
not know you're a babe?

95
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,232
Well, I mean, you did call me
a frumpy nerd for 20 years.

96
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,364
Well, I didn't stop
because I got nicer.

97
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,359
Who ate all the formula
and croutons?

98
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,306
Where are Mom and Dad?
We need food.

99
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,534
Wait. What's that smell?

100
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:18,789
Phil!

101
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,847
Bacon?
They're gonna smell that.

102
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,256
Oh, my God!
I didn't think about that!

103
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,554
Quick! Eat it!

104
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:25,148
Ow! Worth it.

105
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:27,260
Ow! Worth it.

106
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,350
Hey! They have food!

107
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,227
And coffee.
Are you guys living in here?

108
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:34,093
Mom, I need to borrow
some underwear.

109
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,655
It's not my fault.
I tried to stop him.

110
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:40,347
Stop who?
What happened?

111
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:43,085
Ay, your hair!
Where is it?!

112
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,432
Dad took me
to his barber.

113
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:46,288
It was so cool!

114
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,707
Have you heard of
<i>Playboy?</i>

115
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:49,092
I'm going to kill him!

116
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,037
It gets worse.

117
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:52,305
He went rogue on Mitch and Cam's
housewarming gift.

118
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,174
So, he didn't buy
the coffee table book

119
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,325
about Los Angeles
through the decades?

120
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,123
Check this out!

121
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,852
- Oh, my God!
- See?

122
00:03:58,888 --> 00:03:59,799
You don't get
that reaction

123
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:01,079
from a picture
of a dusty guy

124
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,934
picking oranges
on Sunset Boulevard.

125
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,631
That's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

126
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,260
But I like my hair!

127
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,348
No, not you, sweetie.
You're perfect.

128
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,906
And no woman
will ever deserve you.

129
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,142
Hey, I don't know
if you journal,

130
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,718
but you might want to
dog-ear today's page

131
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,855
for your
future therapist.

132
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:19,287
Jay, you can't be buying
home décor things for gays.

133
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,227
Mitch and Cam are
going to hate this thing!

134
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:22,187
No, they won't.

135
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:23,302
The guys
are gonna love it.

136
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:25,112
- Just like Joe loves his haircut.
- Ay.

137
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,099
Everybody's gonna think
that he has lice.

138
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:28,294
I hope not.

139
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,241
Bad hygiene is
one of Miss September's

140
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,878
three biggest turn-offs.

141
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,317
Mitchell!

142
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,638
I love this house!

143
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:37,955
Do you love it?
Say you love it.

144
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,240
I do. I love it.

145
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:40,272
- I love the flow.
- Ah!

146
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,824
I love the lights.
I love the location.

147
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,073
There... There's even
a karaoke room in the basement.

148
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,017
So fun!

149
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:49,881
The last time I had
a hot Mike in my basement...

150
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:50,889
You know what?
I'm gonna wait till

151
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:51,869
there are more
people here.

152
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:52,594
Yeah.

153
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,937
Oh, oh,
the baby's awake.

154
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:55,126
Do... Do you want
to meet him?

155
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,728
I do. I can ask him
if he liked our gift.

156
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,610
We never heard.

157
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:01,443
Hello?

158
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,210
<i>Mr. Tucker.
It's Jim Alvarez.</i>

159
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,143
<i>Athletic Director from</i>

160
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,370
<i>the University of
North Central Missouri.</i>

161
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,430
Uh, yes, of course.
How... How can I help you?

162
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:11,496
<i>This is a bit
of an awkward call.</i>

163
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:12,905
<i>As you know,
you were the runner-up</i>

164
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,484
<i>for our
head coaching job.</i>

165
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:16,036
Uh, yes, yes,
and, uh, you know,

166
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,509
Coach Ashley is a-a great guy,
great choice.

167
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,321
No hard feelings.
I actually...

168
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:23,143
I sent him a bottle of
congratulatory scotch.

169
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,392
<i>Well, he drank it.</i>

170
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:25,384
<i>Then he did
a press conference</i>

171
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,892
<i>where he used
some colorful language</i>

172
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,478
<i>to address
a female reporter</i>

173
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,725
<i>and blamed some things
on the Jews.</i>

174
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:32,239
Oh, my.

175
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,340
<i>The point is, uh,</i>

176
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,755
<i>the job is yours,
if you still want it.</i>

177
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:37,576
S... I'm... I'm sorry.
W-What?

178
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:38,930
<i>I know this is
coming at you fast,</i>

179
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:41,201
<i>but I'll need an answer
by the end of the day,</i>

180
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,931
<i>so talk it over
with the mister</i>

181
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,971
<i>and, uh, let me know.</i>

182
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,948
Um, uh, yes.
O-Ok... Uh, yes.

183
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:48,206
Okay, thank... thank you
very... thank you very much.

184
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:53,574
<i>Look at him!
He's perfect!</i>

185
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,954
<i>I know.
I know. It's all perfect.</i>

186
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,922
<i>It's like the universe
gave me everything I wanted.</i>

187
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:12,437
Okay, family meeting.

188
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,839
Please. Sit down.
Dylan, please. Thank you.

189
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,878
Now, um,

190
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:18,212
this is gonna
sound harsh.

191
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,214
No... No parent

192
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,110
with half a heart
wants to say this,

193
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:23,350
so, Claire?

194
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,417
Fine. I have
no problem saying it.

195
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,521
There are too many people
living in this house.

196
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,755
It's disgusting!

197
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,288
I think there's
something alive

198
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,435
in the kitchen sink water.

199
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:33,587
It's just Sinky.

200
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,636
You didn't turn on
the garbage disposal, did you?

201
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,031
O-Okay.
W-We cannot live this way!

202
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,455
One of you
has to move out.

203
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:41,949
- What?! That's not fair!
- Are you serious?!

204
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,296
- Are you kidding me?! That's not okay!
- You can't just spring this on us!

205
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:44,306
- I mean, how could you do that?
- I-I just took

206
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:45,842
- a huge salary cut.
- It's so unfair!

207
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:46,957
So it is really
not a good time

208
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:48,422
- for me to move.
- Me neither.

209
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,310
I just took
a leave of absence from work

210
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,719
to spend more time
with my family.

211
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:54,608
Well, I have two babies
and a special needs husband.

212
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:56,412
It's true.
I have a medical condition

213
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:59,063
that requires a room big enough
for a giant mattress.

214
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:00,316
He sleep-wiggles.

215
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,486
Look, if one of you
doesn't volunteer,

216
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,701
your mother's gonna
have to pick someone.

217
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:06,983
Well, Haley's the oldest.
There's four of them.

218
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,519
And honestly,
it's only a matter of time

219
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:09,640
before she gets
pregnant again.

220
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,479
Especially since he's a wiggler.

221
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,255
Whoa!
<i>We</i> can say it.

222
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:16,395
Well, Alex is the one
that has the most education.

223
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,440
I shouldn't be
penalized for being smart.

224
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:19,977
I'm not running
for president.

225
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,532
What about you?
Didn't you apply to college?

226
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,704
Yeah, and I never
heard back from them.

227
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:24,694
College is rude.

228
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,414
Okay! You can figure this out
amongst the three of you

229
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,635
as you clean up
the house.

230
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,491
We need a name
by the end of the day.

231
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:31,843
Well, it's not
gonna be me.

232
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,662
I just can't imagine being
apart from my best friend.

233
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:36,658
Nice try, Luke.

234
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,206
Help me.
It's working.

235
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,482
Oh, come on.

236
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:43,883
Hey, Cam. Look!

237
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,771
Cam! Cam!

238
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,978
Oh, s... I'm sorry. My... My mind
was elsewhere.

239
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:50,515
Our neighbor
just dropped this off.

240
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,484
So sweet!
And... And guess what.

241
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,617
- She's a pediatrician.
- Ohh!

242
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:55,540
- I mean, how lucky is that?
- Ohh!

243
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:56,530
That's amazing!

244
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:57,656
Now you don't have to
ugly up the house

245
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,019
with baby-proofing.

246
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,209
Don't ever have kids.

247
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,869
There's champagne,
there's truffles,

248
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:03,698
- there's caviar.
- Ohh, city folk, huh?!

249
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,780
I mean, whatever happened
to a basket of apples

250
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,119
and a thoughtfully
misspelled note?!

251
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,526
I mean, huh?
It's like...

252
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:10,967
Alright, give us a tour,

253
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,755
- and make sure it includes the bar.
- Yes!

254
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,707
Okay, so let's start down
in the karaoke room,

255
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:16,350
and then we'll work
our way up to the master.

256
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:19,326
Oh, sounds like
my dream date!

257
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,899
Sorry, I'm a single father.
I never get out.

258
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,282
Is this still how we talk?

259
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,158
Okay. No. Uh, alright.
Right this way.

260
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:26,976
Okay, I hope the big earthquake
that we're long overdue for

261
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,848
doesn't hit
while you're down there!

262
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,471
You're being
so negative.

263
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:32,908
What is wrong with you?

264
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:33,898
Okay, look, I have
to tell someone,

265
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:36,435
but you cannot repeat it
to anyone, especially Mitchell!

266
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,083
Oh.

267
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,434
I just got offered

268
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,390
the football job that I wanted
in Missouri.

269
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:41,510
But you just moved in!

270
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:42,685
- I know.
- With a newborn!

271
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,564
- I know!
- And you were the one pushing for both!

272
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
I don't need a recap!
It's my crisis!

273
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:48,112
We're here!

274
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,711
Hey! Hey, guys!

275
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:51,807
Wow!
Joe, nice haircut!

276
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:52,961
- See?
- See?

277
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,137
- I miss his old hair.
- It's cute.

278
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:57,345
He looks like Tom Cruise
in "A Few Good Men."

279
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,707
I wouldn't mind cruising
a few good men.

280
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,410
Again, I'm sorry.

281
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,432
I spend all my time
at kids' birthday parties.

282
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:06,224
We're really probably better
than this now, right?

283
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,273
- Yeah.
- Anyways,

284
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:08,968
we brought you
a housewarming gift.

285
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,255
- Oh.
- Jay deserves all the credit.

286
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:13,193
- Close your eyes.
- Maybe never open them.

287
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,094
Ta-da!

288
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:20,400
He's an old-time barkeep.
Now, check it out.

289
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:22,644
He's a big guy,
like Cam,

290
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,528
and he's got red hair,
like you!

291
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,227
Dad!

292
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:27,865
This is exactly what
we needed... a little whimsy!

293
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,979
I love it!

294
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,573
No, you don't.
Other gays, tell him.

295
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,476
We're gonna have
so much fun with this guy.

296
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,167
We can throw
a-an Uncle Sam hat on him

297
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,890
for the 4th of July,
a pilgrim hat for Thanksgiving.

298
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,717
Or a rainbow wig
for... for Pride.

299
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:42,602
Well, it's a piece of art.

300
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:44,350
I don't think you want to
make it silly.

301
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:46,099
So, does this, uh, big fella
have a name?

302
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:46,977
Sure does.

303
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:49,667
Since he's a combo of
Cam and Mitch, he's Kitsch.

304
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:51,177
Oh, yeah!

305
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:53,859
Yes, he is!
Dad, it's perfect!

306
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:55,451
Great. Now Mitchell's
even happier.

307
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,247
I'm gonna die
in this house.

308
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:01,939
- Hi.
- Alex. Hi.

309
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,147
Come in. Have a seat.

310
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:05,536
So, um...

311
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,568
So, I guess I'll just
get right into it.

312
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:09,026
I-I didn't see
this coming

313
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:10,521
when I asked you
to work with me,

314
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,078
and I guess I'm sort of afraid...

315
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:14,359
...how you... how...
how you might react,

316
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,900
which, uh, explains why
I'm acting so awkwardly

317
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,996
and why this sentence
won't seem to end,

318
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,273
which is so delightful
when Hugh Grant does it,

319
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:22,327
but I just sound
like a raving...

320
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:24,184
- Let me stop you.
- Please do.

321
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,928
I think I know what
you're trying to say.

322
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:32,674
Uh, it appears there's some
romantic tension between us,

323
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,626
and you're afraid that
once I sign my contract,

324
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:36,214
we won't be able
to act on it.

325
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,363
Uh... actually,

326
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,690
I was... I was
just going to tell you

327
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:42,393
that our project has been
moved to Switzerland.

328
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:45,093
Damn it, Haley!

329
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,269
Well, then
why were you hemming and hawing

330
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:48,211
and bringing up Hugh Grant,

331
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,815
which takes every girl
right to rom-com?!

332
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,951
Well, I was afraid that you
wouldn't want to move so far.

333
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:52,871
And... And... And...

334
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,240
And you know,
I feel responsible

335
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:56,676
for you quitting
your job.

336
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:59,317
Forget what I said!
So, uh, Switzerland, huh?

337
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,243
Do they pay for housing?

338
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,806
Um, actually, yeah.

339
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:05,008
Perfect. Perfect. That solves
a big problem for me.

340
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,104
Yep. Count me in.
See ya at the airport.

341
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,364
- Oh, hold on!
- Ohh!

342
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,514
Um, it seems like
there's something

343
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,913
that we should
circle back to.

344
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,005
No, no, no.
I'm fine.

345
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,605
Alex, I've never
c-considered

346
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:15,493
a romantic relationship
with you.

347
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,506
Oh, great.
Let's relive it.

348
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,974
I mean,
I'm so much older.

349
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,349
I-I-I dated your sister.

350
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,269
All good reasons.
I'm at a meter, so I'm just...

351
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,948
But if it's something
that isn't completely

352
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,707
out of the realm
of possibility for you,

353
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,533
then I'd be lying
if I said

354
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,823
it was out of the realm
of possibility for me.

355
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:34,430
- Oh. Okay.
- So, let's go back.

356
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,118
You're saying that if we had
a pre-existing relationship,

357
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:40,150
or rather, a relationship
that existed in a quantum state,

358
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:41,736
like two entangled
particles...

359
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:43,483
You don't have to
dumb it down, but...

360
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,596
but, yes,

361
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,665
we'd be good to go,
legally speaking.

362
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:49,514
Huh.

363
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,548
Well, then, maybe
we should create evidence now

364
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:55,244
of a relationship that
may or may not happen later?

365
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,763
What kind of evidence?

366
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,605
I suppose we could
exchange saucy texts.

367
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,045
- Seems logical.
- Yeah?

368
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,605
Okay.

369
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:10,556
"You look
beautiful today"?

370
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:11,556
Is that too much?

371
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,613
No! No, no, no.

372
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,187
I... But... But maybe delete
mine, or just read it...

373
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:15,992
Oh, my God!

374
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,101
You're so much better
at this than I am!

375
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,468
Didn't have to send that.

376
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,324
Maybe we should take
a photo, you know?

377
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,846
Proof that
we were together?

378
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:24,937
Uh, maybe
a kiss on the cheek?

379
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:26,842
Yeah.
How provocative.

380
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,549
- Yeah!
- Okay.

381
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:29,994
Um, uh,

382
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,951
and one, two, three.

383
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:32,657
Mwah.

384
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:33,474
- Oh, God!
- Oh. Oh! Oh!

385
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,562
- Good God! I'm so sorry.
- Oh!

386
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:35,427
I-I-I thought my...
my lips and your cheek.

387
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,633
No, I-I thought
you meant your cheek.

388
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,520
- No!
- Wow! Oh! Okay.

389
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,778
- Well, that... that... We have it.
- Yeah.

390
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:41,223
- We have it, and that's super important.
- Well done, us!

391
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,108
Oh, good God.
Oh, just great.

392
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:46,917
- Hello, you two!
- Hi!

393
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:47,871
How about a little quiche?

394
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:49,582
Oh! How European.

395
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:51,259
Mwah. Mwah.

396
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,062
Oh, Ronaldo,
what's your secret?

397
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,772
Mm, Cam got offered
that coaching job in Missouri,

398
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,655
and Pepper got
his eighth face lift.

399
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,015
- What?!
- I know.

400
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:00,171
We don't
buy soup anymore

401
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:02,093
because he can't close his mouth
all the way.

402
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,048
Cam! You got the job!

403
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,857
- And you're moving.
- Damn it, Ronaldo.

404
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:08,333
Apparently, Pepper's not the only
one who can't keep his mouth closed.

405
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,457
Go. Serve your
little apps.

406
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,260
I can't believe this.

407
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,203
Okay, don't panic.
I'm... I'm gonna turn it down.

408
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:18,270
Oh, really? But it's what
you've always wanted.

409
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:19,903
I know,
but Mitchell, he's...

410
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,870
I've never seen him so happy.

411
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:22,852
And I can't ruin that.

412
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,808
I'm... I'm not even gonna
tell him I got the offer.

413
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:27,413
Well, look,
I-I am not a fan

414
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,660
of the idea
of you guys leaving,

415
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:29,909
but if you don't
tell Mitchell,

416
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:31,251
you're gonna end up
resenting him.

417
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,278
No, that's... that's
not how I'm built.

418
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,947
I make decisions,
move forward, don't look back.

419
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:36,951
No regrets.

420
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,284
Hey, everyone?

421
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,212
Um, I just want to
thank you all for coming

422
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:41,606
to see our new home

423
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,436
and meet our precious
new roommate, Rexford.

424
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:48,286
And, uh, I also want to thank
my wonderful husband, Cam,

425
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:50,362
who really led the charge
and made all of this possible.

426
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,694
I-I couldn't be
happier right now,

427
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,678
and it's all because of him.

428
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,499
Now, if I could just get him to
give up hogging the covers, huh?

429
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,523
'Cause I haven't given up
enough for you!

430
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,203
This is so embarrassing.

431
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,884
I just realized
Ronaldo was offering me quiche.

432
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:14,066
So, y-you were never gonna
tell me you got offered the job?

433
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:15,802
It's just that
you seemed so happy,

434
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:17,800
and I couldn't ask you
to give that up.

435
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,248
Cam, you've been wanting
to move closer

436
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,456
to your family for years,

437
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,713
and... and this is
your dream job.

438
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:23,631
No.

439
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,177
No. T-This is my chance
to be there for you.

440
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:27,298
Are you sure?

441
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:30,627
Look, I-I don't
care where we live,

442
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,336
as... as long as you're
there by my side.

443
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,160
Always.

444
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,856
- Aww! - Aww!
- Aww! - Aww!

445
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:39,087
Alright, now let's celebrate
with some champagne!

446
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:40,083
Yeah!

447
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:43,718
Mitchell. Mitchell.
That was beautiful.

448
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:44,841
Well, everyone was
looking at me.

449
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:46,692
What the
was I supposed to say?

450
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,827
How are you feeling?

451
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,468
Uh, it's gonna be weird without
them being here all the time.

452
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,625
Plus, they got
the new kid.

453
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,007
- Hmm.
- Poor guy's gonna grow up

454
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:01,219
with those
Missouri closets,

455
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,728
thinking that's normal.

456
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:03,702
It was sweet how Mitch

457
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,698
didn't have to think twice
about going.

458
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:06,494
Well, it's like he said,

459
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,340
it's his turn
to support Cam.

460
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,935
Almost the same thing
I'm trying to do for you,

461
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:12,434
except I'm pissing you off.

462
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,824
Because you won't do anything
the way that <i>I</i> would do it!

463
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,386
I don't see anyone else
complaining.

464
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,732
That's the worst part...
that nobody needs me.

465
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:22,797
It's 2020. I shouldn't be
losing jobs to an old white man.

466
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,294
When Manny gets homesick,

467
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,182
who do you think
he's gonna call?

468
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,252
When Joe has a nightmare,
who does he want?

469
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,481
And when I'm sitting here

470
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:34,145
already sad
about Mitchell leaving,

471
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,545
who do you think I want
to walk into this room?

472
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,473
- Me?
- Of course!

473
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,104
And I think I know
what's going on here.

474
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:42,704
You're feeling guilty
about working. Don't.

475
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,494
Do you think I ever
felt guilty working

476
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,158
while you held down
the fort here?

477
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,056
You sure didn't.

478
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,231
No, and now it's time

479
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,713
for you to go
out into the world

480
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,670
and crush it.

481
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,175
While <i>you</i> hold down
the fort

482
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,240
and look pretty?

483
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,232
Well, I'm not just
a sex object.

484
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:57,580
I have other gifts.

485
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,938
- That was a crazy day.
- Yeah.

486
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:04,851
I think I'm gonna be up
for a while tonight.

487
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:06,296
You want to buckle
yourself into bed

488
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,155
and I'll drive you
around till you fall asleep?

489
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:14,124
You know, I-I don't want to
sleep in the driveway.

490
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,480
I don't.
I want to sleep in our house,

491
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:18,708
with our kids...
all of them.

492
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:22,005
With what's going on
with Mitchell and Cam,

493
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,310
I just feel like we're losing
enough family as it is.

494
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:25,864
It's funny.

495
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,004
- I was feeling that, too.
- Mm.

496
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,024
- You came down so hard on them earlier.
- Mm.

497
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,059
I'll go give 'em
the good news.

498
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:32,204
Like hell you will!

499
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,550
- Hey! - Hi!
- Oh, good. You're home.

500
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,622
Yeah. Are your brother
and sister here?

501
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:38,960
I want to talk about
this whole living situation.

502
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:41,277
- Yeah.
- Actually, problem solved.

503
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:42,642
- What?
- I'm moving to Switzerland.

504
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,924
- What?
- They're transferring my research team there.

505
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,510
I get housing
and everything.

506
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,183
So you're good.

507
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,854
Like, hot chocolate
Switzerland?

508
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,543
Oh, hey!

509
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:51,564
Did you tell them
our news?

510
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,089
Uh, just mine.

511
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,756
Dylan and I
are moving out, too.

512
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:56,627
- Oh.
- Oh, but you don't have to!

513
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:58,483
Well, we want to.
You guys are right.

514
00:16:58,544 --> 00:16:59,946
It's time
for us to go.

515
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:00,769
We did the math,

516
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:02,665
and we realized
we had a million dollars.

517
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:04,617
Then we had Alex
check the math,

518
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:05,555
and turns out
we don't,

519
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,494
but we do have enough
for a cute apartment.

520
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,065
Now that they don't
test on animals,

521
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:12,284
I've made extra money
doing clinical trials at work.

522
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,161
The hours are long,
but the mazes are fun.

523
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:16,785
Sweet.
You're all here.

524
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,616
Everyone can relax.
I'll be the one who goes.

525
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:19,840
- Oh.
- Oh, no, no, Luke.

526
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:20,664
- It's okay.
- No, no, no, no.

527
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,028
I lied before.

528
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,319
I actually
did hear back

529
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:25,250
from
the University of Oregon.

530
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:26,384
I got in.

531
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:27,840
- Oh, honey!
- Amazing!

532
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:28,701
That's wonderful!

533
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:29,500
We're so proud of you!

534
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:32,224
- That's amazing, Luke!
- Yeah. Congrats.

535
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:36,802
Wait. You're...
You're all moving out?

536
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:38,239
Really? We are?

537
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,223
Yeah.

538
00:17:39,302 --> 00:17:40,277
Weird.

539
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,728
Oh! It's Arvin.

540
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,644
Sorry, I've got to
respond to it.

541
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,465
It's a work thing.

542
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,542
I've got to get ready.
I've got a date.

543
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,777
Oh, there they are.

544
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,600
Bet you're not
gonna miss that.

545
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:57,297
Oh! Luke, I'm in here!

546
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,192
What are you doing?!

547
00:17:58,228 --> 00:17:59,248
Oh, get out!

548
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,129
I <i>am</i> gonna miss this.

549
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:08,692
Me too.

550
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,617
Hey.
Everybody's gone.

551
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:15,376
Look.

552
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:17,968
I haven't called
the college yet.

553
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,439
I wanted to talk
to you first.

554
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:22,285
I know you were being
generous up there, and...

555
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:25,008
You know me.
I-I can be happy anywhere.

556
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:26,569
No, seriously.

557
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,262
After some time, I-I'll forget
all about this place.

558
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,606
We named our son
after the street.

559
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:33,956
So we'll just change
his name to the new street.

560
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,626
The coach's house
is at the intersection

561
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,521
of Route 13
and Burnt Corn Lane.

562
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:39,335
Dear God,
what are we doing?

563
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:41,153
I-I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna fit in.

564
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:44,016
W-What if no one likes me? What if I can't find a job?

565
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,328
Are there...
Are there lattes?

566
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:46,491
A-Are there
art house theaters?

567
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:47,225
Well, what if...
what if I never see

568
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,606
a black-and-white movie or...
or a black-and-white couple?

569
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:52,177
Hey. Where are we
on this move?

570
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:53,323
Well, that's what
Daddy and I

571
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,806
are talking about
right now, sweetie.

572
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:57,197
'Cause I have a major
project due on Tuesday,

573
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,749
and I'm not saying
I haven't started it,

574
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,466
but if you asked to see
what I've done so far,

575
00:19:00,502 --> 00:19:02,256
there wouldn't
be anything.

576
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,052
We're going.

577
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:06,106
A-Are you sure?

578
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:07,899
I-I'm gonna need
a little time to adjust,

579
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,120
but we...
we are going.

580
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:12,339
Are you okay with that?

581
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,356
Totally.
I'll reinvent myself.

582
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:15,450
I'm gonna
dye my hair blue

583
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:17,219
and carry around
an emotional support pig.

584
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,117
Aww! I kn... I know
just the pig!

585
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:20,323
Cam, well,
call the college.

586
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:21,744
Okay! I just want this
to be the right thing.

587
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,206
If... If this ends up
hurting the family,

588
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,799
- I would never forgive myself.
- No, no.

589
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,883
We're stronger than that, okay?
We're gonna be fine.

590
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,260
Yeah.

591
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,403
Not... Not now, Lily.

592
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,440
You guys are gonna end up
singing. Just get to it.

593
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:32,777
Excuse me, young lady.

594
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:35,232
We're... We're having a-a
serious conversation here, okay?

595
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:37,498
Do not reduce us to
a couple stereotypical...

596
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,532
♪ My love ♪

597
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:46,138
♪ There's only you
in my li-ife ♪

598
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:49,594
♪ The only thing
that's bright ♪

599
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,298
Now you.

600
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:52,509
Why do I always have to
sing the female part?

601
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,795
♪ My first love ♪

602
00:19:55,943 --> 00:20:00,187
♪ You're every breath
that I take ♪

603
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:01,737
I didn't think this through.

604
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:05,516
♪ You're every step
I make ♪

605
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,755
I do not like being
the first person at a party.

606
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,060
Uh, oh, actually,
you're the last one.

607
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,173
Yeah, Sal,
everybody's gone.

608
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,262
What?! Boo!

609
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,490
Gays used to be so fun,
before kids.

610
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,302
Come on!
Let's do shots!

611
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,877
You know this house is only
a block from my new place.

612
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:19,695
Well, it's not "mine,"

613
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:20,639
but I get to stay there
for free

614
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:23,332
'cause I let the guy who owns it
watch me on webcams.

615
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,463
Aah!

616
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:27,239
I'm gonna be coming over
all the time!

617
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:28,301
Yay!

618
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:32,302
And, um, Happy Face Emoji here
can babysit my dogs and kid.

619
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:34,651
And you guys cook, right?

620
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,253
Ahh, 'cause my gummy's
kicking in.

621
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,162
- Actually, I'm feeling better about the move already.
- Good.

622
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,267
Oh! Uh, Cam, our car's here.

623
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:43,983
Oh. So, this is really it?

624
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,144
We are gonna
miss you all so much.

625
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,224
And, here,
I want you to read this,

626
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,759
but not until
after I leave.

627
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,286
It's gonna make me cry,
isn't it,

628
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:53,832
you beautiful, corn-fed son of a bitch?

629
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,375
You guys are gonna visit,
right?

630
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:56,951
Of course.
And you all are gonna visit us.

631
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,207
It's just a couple
quick flights

632
00:20:58,243 --> 00:20:59,971
and a short Goober ride
from the airport.

633
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:01,906
- Did he just say...
- Wait, isn't Grandpa coming?

634
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:03,050
He said goodbye
last night.

635
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:04,649
- You know how he hates these things.
- Yeah.

636
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:06,409
I can't believe I'm losing
my old skating partner.

637
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,329
Well, whenever you look
at our old trophy,

638
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:10,605
just remember what a good team
we were, huh?

639
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:12,127
I said I wasn't
gonna cry.

640
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,162
And you're not.

641
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:14,705
Yeah.
It's called strength.

642
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,544
He came!

643
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,906
- Hey!
- I couldn't miss this.

644
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,433
My baby boy
is going away.

645
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:21,723
- Oh, Dad.
- Oh, Jay, don't hate me

646
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,316
because
your son's leaving.

647
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,708
<i>Both</i> my sons
are leaving.

648
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:27,952
- Aww.
- Oh, Jay! Jay!

649
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,900
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, get in here. Get in here. Get in here.

650
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:32,294
<i>A lot can happen
to a family over the years.</i>

651
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,828
- <i>New additions...</i>
- Hi.

652
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:34,889
Get that!

653
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,103
Manny, go!

654
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:37,139
<i>...new struggles.</i>

655
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:38,244
Give me a second.

656
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,715
<i>You don't always
mark the moments,</i>

657
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:41,994
<i>because you're too busy
taking care of life.</i>

658
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,275
<i>Best you can do sometimes</i>

659
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:45,423
<i>is remind yourself
to cherish every single...</i>

660
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,928
Oh.

661
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,322
There's a tornado warning
in Missouri.

662
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:49,988
Uh, our flight's delayed
two hours, so...

663
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:50,998
- Oh.
- Oh. - Oh.

664
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:53,508
Uh, yeah.

665
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,830
You guys remembered
my birthday!

666
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,862
Surprise.

667
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:03,017
It's nice we have
this extra time together,

668
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:04,855
thanks to that
lucky tornado.

669
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,295
It hit an elementary school,
Phil.

670
00:22:06,331 --> 00:22:07,506
Well, no kids
were there.

671
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,376
It's opening day
of squirrel-hunting season.

672
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:12,343
Jay, do you want to come
and join your family?

673
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:13,230
Jay!

674
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:15,545
He's been like this
a lot lately...

675
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:17,207
in his own world.

676
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:18,295
Well,
it's a tough time.

677
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:19,794
Mitch and Cam leaving,

678
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,047
Manny heading out
next week,

679
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:21,878
plus I'm missing
his birthday

680
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,606
for a tumbling congress
in the desert.

681
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:24,600
You've probably
heard of it.

682
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:25,940
Turning Man?

683
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:27,492
And don't forget
that Joe and I

684
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:29,682
are leaving to Colombia
for the whole summer.

685
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:31,116
How's that gonna be
for Jay?

686
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:31,913
Rough.

687
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:33,172
If you drive past my house

688
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,804
and see me sock-sliding
past the window

689
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,025
with a scotch in my hand,

690
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:37,528
that's just how
I deal with grief.

691
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,198
Not to, uh, rush this,

692
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,569
but we are very behind
on packing for our new place.

693
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,699
You know, we still need
to box up all the baby stuff,

694
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:45,330
our linens, our book.

695
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:46,482
Well, don't stress out
too much.

696
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:47,831
- The... The car is here.
- Okay.

697
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,462
- Oh.
- So

698
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:50,954
this is goodbye again.

699
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,914
Yeah.

700
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,616
It's gonna take a minute

701
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:54,431
to ramp back up
to all the emotion...

702
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:55,420
I'm there.

703
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:57,115
Get in here. Get in here.

704
00:22:57,274 --> 00:22:58,966
- Yes.
- Come on.

705
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:00,746
Sorry.
One second. One second.

706
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:02,342
- I need my arm.
- Oh.

707
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:03,031
Huh.

708
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,440
Flood warnings this time.

709
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:07,020
Oh, and a swarm of locusts has
been spotted in the flight path.

710
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:09,266
What part of the Old Testament
are we moving to?

711
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,406
Is it alive?

712
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:13,558
No.

713
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:15,382
Is it scissors?

714
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:16,481
Sure.

715
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:18,341
No, but you said
it was heavier than a piano!

716
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:20,298
I just want this to be over.

717
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,354
- Can we be done with games?
- Yes.

718
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,882
Yeah, we're done.

719
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,259
Your Earl Grey.

720
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:27,019
Oh, thank you.

721
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:28,358
Ugh!

722
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:29,640
Is there vinegar
in here?

723
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,848
Congratulations.
You're dead!

724
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,244
Never take a drink if you
haven't watched it be made.

725
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,373
Uh, he saw this special called
"You Cruise, You Lose,"

726
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:38,098
and he's convinced

727
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,938
something bad is going to
happen to me on my trip.

728
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:42,410
If this had been the real thing,
you'd be on a container ship

729
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:44,933
halfway to the slave markets
in Tripoli.

730
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:46,838
Oh, our car's a minute away.

731
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:47,615
- Okay.
- Alright.

732
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:50,459
Goodbyes Part 3.
And please, no hugs.

733
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,771
Lay off my linen suit.

734
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,660
It's already as wrinkled
as my favorite pig

735
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:55,007
when she lost
all that weight.

736
00:23:55,113 --> 00:23:57,311
Oh, c-can we take one
last picture by the staircase?

737
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:58,271
Oh, great idea.

738
00:23:58,307 --> 00:23:59,707
I just don't think
you have the time.

739
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:01,467
Alright, no gushiness.
You know the drill.

740
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:03,023
Love, kiss, hug,
"See ya at Thanksgiving."

741
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,251
- Okay.
- Love, kiss, hug, "See ya at Thanksgiving."

742
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,378
- Do not look back.
- Yeah, good idea.

743
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,853
You know, I don't think
I could take the sight

744
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:13,183
of their tear-streaked faces
pressed against the glass.

745
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,815
In many ways,
it's easier for us.

746
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:16,033
I mean, we're off
to a new adventure,

747
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:18,103
and they're stuck in the same
dull, mirthless...

748
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:20,438
Cheese!

749
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:22,672
You're taking a family picture
without us?!

750
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:27,945
Okay, well, you have made leaving a lot easier...

751
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,754
...because, clearly,
what this family needs

752
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,086
- is some time apart.
- Uh-huh.

753
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:32,366
Let's...

754
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:33,637
Uh-oh.

755
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,951
Did any of us really not think

756
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:35,974
that was gonna happen?

757
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,723
Hail this time.

758
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,830
Okay, Mitchell,
now that we have this moment,

759
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:41,949
I'm pretty sure
<i>you</i> have the skating trophy.

760
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:44,334
Um, I recently packed up
my entire house twice.

761
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,531
I think I would notice
my only <i>sports</i> trophy, Claire.

762
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,277
- Well, I haven't packed up my house at all...
- I don't have the trophy!

763
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:48,863
- ...and I know that I don't have it.
- Stop!

764
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:50,358
Neither of you has it.

765
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:52,963
You argued endlessly about
which room it was going into

766
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:53,960
until your mother
grabbed it

767
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:56,169
and donated it
back to the skating rink.

768
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:57,794
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

769
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,994
Okay, well, now our only option
is the 9:00 p.m.

770
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,778
Fortunately, it's a direct
flight into Kansas City

771
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:05,960
and then just a short hop
on HamTrak, so...

772
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:07,496
- Did you just say "Ham"...
- Fine.

773
00:25:07,532 --> 00:25:09,816
Everybody get on with their day.
We'll meet back here later.

774
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:11,778
- Okay.
- Well, we got to pack.

775
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:14,929
Oh, we love our new place,
by the way.

776
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:16,064
Thanks again
for putting in

777
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,599
a good word for us
with the owner.

778
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:19,072
Yeah, he just needed
some reassurance,

779
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,245
considering most of
Dylan's money

780
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,045
is tied up
in Dave & Buster's gift cards.

781
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:24,348
- Mm.
- Safer than banks.

782
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,253
So, just because
I'm curious...

783
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,174
Yeah, it's a livestock train,
but people ride it, too.

784
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:28,792
But don't worry,

785
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,516
we're in first class
with the show hogs.

786
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:36,249
Mitchell,
we skated our little hearts out

787
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,751
to "Hungry Like the Wolf"
for this thing.

788
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,716
I'm taking it.
Damn it, it's locked.

789
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:41,473
You brought me here
to steal?!

790
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:44,071
I can't go to jail.
I am a gay prosecutor.

791
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,517
There's no prison gangs
for that.

792
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:47,213
Relax.
Just keep an eye out.

793
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:48,910
W-What are you doing? You...
You know how to pick a lock?

794
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:50,573
Luke's always getting locked
into something.

795
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,718
Between that and trying to
break into Haley's diary,

796
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:54,010
I'm kind of a pro.

797
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:55,801
By the way, thanks for
getting her on birth control.

798
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:57,101
Oh, yeah,
what are uncles for?

799
00:25:57,137 --> 00:25:59,470
Oh, security.
Be cool.

800
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:01,166
Hi.

801
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:04,059
How many nights did we spend
in these exact same positions?

802
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,919
Me doing homework
by flashlight,

803
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,590
and you inventing new illnesses
to get out of P.E.

804
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:10,792
Oh, yeah!
Remember when I had frumbles?

805
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:13,884
How about when Luke
would have nightmares

806
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,262
and drag his sleeping bag
in here?

807
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,800
- Oh.
- We'd wait till he fell asleep,

808
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,560
light candles,
put on devil masks,

809
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:19,943
and wake him up.

810
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,105
He still can't form
long-term attachments.

811
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,881
Couldn't have been easy
having us as big sisters.

812
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,038
So...

813
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,501
maybe before
we all move out,

814
00:26:31,578 --> 00:26:33,919
we should mess with him
one last time, right?

815
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:34,836
Oh, yeah.

816
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:35,885
It was 2005,

817
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:37,920
and we desperately
wanted a dog.

818
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:39,564
So we made a video
to convince our parents

819
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,588
that we could be
responsible dog owners.

820
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:44,671
The dog, of course,
was played by a 6-year-old Luke.

821
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,382
He'd already had ringworm that summer,

822
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,657
so he had an entryway
into the role.

823
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,250
Luke!

824
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,443
Okay. Okay.
Get up here.

825
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:55,597
- Okay.
- Okay, alright.

826
00:26:57,101 --> 00:26:57,688
What was that?

827
00:26:57,724 --> 00:27:00,355
- Oh, my God! the Woofie tape!
- Oh, no! Oh!

828
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,537
You cracked it.
Mom's gonna go insane!

829
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:04,374
She watches it every year on Mother's Day!

830
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:06,450
- This is bad. This is bad. This is bad!
- Oh.

831
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,555
- What should we do?
- This probably won't work,

832
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:09,950
- but...
- Say it!

833
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,701
- We could re-create it with you as the dog again...
- Mm.

834
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:16,142
...as a sweet gesture to make up
for what <i>you've</i> done.

835
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:18,701
There.

836
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,427
Wait a minute.

837
00:27:21,512 --> 00:27:24,389
The Woofie ears
just happen to be here?

838
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:26,919
I must be
the luckiest bastard alive.

839
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:28,200
Let's do this.

840
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,458
- So, Missouri, huh?
- Yeah.

841
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:33,440
- You know, I'm... I'm actually feeling pretty good about it.
- Uh-huh.

842
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:35,636
There are a lot of really great
career opportunities there.

843
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:38,494
And with my experience,
I could become a judge.

844
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,560
And we're clear.
Hmm.

845
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:42,388
It's a pretty exciting time
for you, too, huh?

846
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,733
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? Big new job

847
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:45,747
at that storage-and-container
company...

848
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:46,950
- Yeah.
- ...kids moving out.

849
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:47,950
They're not.

850
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:48,871
But I thought
that they...

851
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:50,702
- They're not.
- Oh! Okay.

852
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:51,902
Haven't even started
the job yet,

853
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,150
and you're already
compartmentalizing.

854
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:54,638
And you're already judging.

855
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,834
This isn't working.

856
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,277
Hey, let's just forget it.
Come on.

857
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:59,374
Oh. Oh, my God.

858
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,624
The claw machine.

859
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,391
- Oh.
- Come on!

860
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:03,056
Remember how
we killed at that?

861
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:06,361
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You on the claw, me scouting from the side?

862
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:08,188
- Aww.
- Wait a minute.

863
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:09,281
- Give me a boost.
- What?

864
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:11,277
- Yeah, give me a boost.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

865
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,647
Okay, alright.
This is our chance.

866
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,994
Okay.
Now go down, down.

867
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:15,938
We got to go forward.

868
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:17,413
And d-down more.
Down more.

869
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:18,425
- Claw. Claw it.
- Claw. Clawing.

870
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:19,468
- Clawing, claw.
- Okay, don't get cocky.

871
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:21,001
That's how we lost
the Garfield bank.

872
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:22,249
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

873
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:23,511
- I got it! I got it! I got it!
- You almost have it.

874
00:28:23,547 --> 00:28:24,623
- Got it! I got it. I got it.
- You have it! Yes! That's us! Okay.

875
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,222
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

876
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:27,643
- Alright. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- We got it.

877
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,691
Okay, don't worry.
This time, we'll share it.

878
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:30,811
But I get it first.

879
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:33,154
Oh, my God. That was so fun!

880
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,106
Oh, I never do stuff like this with anybody but you.

881
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:38,164
Well, also because
I'm an adult with ethics.

882
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,124
We make a great team.

883
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,108
Oh, my God.
It just hit me.

884
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,701
This might be the last time
that we...

885
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:46,340
No, no, no. No, no.
We already said goodbye twice.

886
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,741
- Keep it light.
- It's just that some

887
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,267
of my best memories
are of you and me here.

888
00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:50,368
That... There, that's it.
I'm done.

889
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:53,600
Would you say...
you're hungry for more?

890
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:56,470
Hungry like...

891
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:01,325
- Ha!
- Ha!

892
00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:08,590
- This is more sexual than I remember it being.
- Yeah.

893
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,952
I'm starting to think
we won for the wrong reasons.

894
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,249
That's it.

895
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:19,284
We're finally
out of my hot sauce.

896
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,613
Jay, are you hungry?

897
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:23,304
Jay?

898
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:24,468
What's wrong with him?

899
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:27,027
Is everything gonna be okay,
Mommy?

900
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,027
You're scaring us.

901
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,412
Oh, it's okay, buddy.

902
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:31,670
Jay is just going through
something right...

903
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:32,684
Idiot!

904
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:34,258
I hope you like
dancing for coins

905
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,108
on the streets
of Calcutta.

906
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:38,647
I found more hot sauce
in the garage.

907
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:40,855
<i>Muy caliente.</i>

908
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:43,159
Oof!
I almost gave it away, there.

909
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:46,078
I got a big surprise for Gloria
in the works.

910
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,862
I'm learning Spanish.

911
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:50,084
Every chance I get,
I pop my earbuds in,

912
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:51,459
learn a few lessons.

913
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,563
Jay, do you want to come
and join your family?

914
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,254
Program's even got
a cool feature.

915
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,430
Any phrase I want to learn,
I just say it in English,

916
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,479
and it spits it right
back at me in <i>Español.</i>

917
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,211
I'm sorry, I mean "Spanish."

918
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:05,950
I go back and forth
without even noticing.

919
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:07,160
<i>Loco!</i>

920
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:10,113
Hey, you're sure
now's not a bad time

921
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:11,168
to borrow
your garment steamer?

922
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:13,495
Of course not.
And this thing's a marvel.

923
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:17,015
Who knew George Foreman had
one more in him after his grill?

924
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:18,636
- Phil.
- Hey.

925
00:30:18,722 --> 00:30:19,963
I'm so glad
that you're here.

926
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:20,859
Do you remember

927
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:22,859
that little problem
that I told you I had?

928
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:24,713
Everyone has dreams
like that.

929
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:27,250
The Japanese have a whole genre
of comic books about it.

930
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:28,783
No, no, no.
It's about Jay.

931
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,640
I don't know
if he's losing his hearing

932
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:32,979
or he's depressed
or what.

933
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:35,524
Probably he's ashamed
to talk to me, but...

934
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,502
But not to
his best friend.

935
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:38,429
Say no more.

936
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:39,238
I just need you to fill

937
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:40,918
a spaghetti pot with water
and boil it.

938
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:42,027
How is that gonna help?

939
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:43,455
Oh, it's a backup
for Cam's suit.

940
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,960
I lost all confidence
in George Foreman

941
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:47,903
after his teeth-whitening system
burned my gums.

942
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:50,298
Table for two, please.

943
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:52,948
Are you my waiter?

944
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,628
Hey, Jay.
How you doing?

945
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:58,999
This isn't
what I wanted.

946
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:00,913
I know you might
be feeling a little down

947
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,169
with everybody leaving,

948
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:03,897
but it's not the end
of the world, right?

949
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:05,594
I'm finished here.

950
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,826
Hey, don't you
talk like that.

951
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:10,567
Could I please
have a spoon?

952
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:13,113
Wh...

953
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:14,682
Whatever you need...

954
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:16,029
buddy.

955
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:20,671
- Ahh.
- Whoa!

956
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:21,977
- What?!
- What the hell are you doing?!

957
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,897
What?! I thought
that's what you wanted!

958
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,402
- What, to spoon with me?!
- Yes.

959
00:31:25,438 --> 00:31:27,544
Slightly out of character, yes,
but it's an emotional time!

960
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,984
Everything's changing!
I'm...

961
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,007
I was worried about you.

962
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:31,545
I'm fine, Phil.

963
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:33,465
And I'm changing, too.

964
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:36,441
I'm learning Spanish
to surprise Gloria!

965
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,490
Of course.

966
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:41,529
Well, then, having added

967
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,482
yet another
embarrassing incident

968
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:46,142
to our storied history,
I will slink out.

969
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,286
Hey.

970
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,577
Today can't be easy
for you either.

971
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:55,853
And I appreciate
you're worried about me, but...

972
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,113
maybe start thinking...

973
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,138
what you want
your next chapter to be.

974
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:03,133
Thanks, Jay.

975
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,068
Oh, uh, Gloria? Gloria?

976
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:11,960
I noticed your mascara
was still intact,

977
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,620
so I assume you haven't
had a chance to read my note.

978
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:17,103
- No, not yet.
- Oh, well, you know, it will be hard on both of us,

979
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,641
but there's... there's no time
like the present.

980
00:32:19,677 --> 00:32:20,988
Hmm.

981
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:26,393
Aww, Cam.

982
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,144
Oh, uh, G-Gloria,
maybe you didn't notice

983
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,762
that there's a second side
to my note.

984
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:30,684
And you know what?
Maybe it would help

985
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,953
if I played the music that I
used while I was composing it.

986
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:35,656
Oh, oh.

987
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:39,395
So nice.

988
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,904
What? Nice?

989
00:32:40,964 --> 00:32:42,788
It was the perfect
goodbye letter.

990
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,054
It's "The Notebook" meets
the first 10 minutes of "Up."

991
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,360
It was enough
to make you curse God

992
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,017
for giving you
the ability to love.

993
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:51,743
It was a poem
where every line started

994
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,515
with a letter
of my name.

995
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,063
Okay, alright, I...
I know what you're doing.

996
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,720
You're putting up walls
around your... your feelings,

997
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,064
because you're not
emotionally prepared

998
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,500
to let go of someone
you love so dearly.

999
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:04,832
Manny.

1000
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,592
Oh, yeah.
He's leaving, too.

1001
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:08,287
21 years.

1002
00:33:08,323 --> 00:33:09,445
Five careers.

1003
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:10,655
Two husbands.

1004
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:12,479
He was the only constant.

1005
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:14,991
I can't start crying to him
about this now,

1006
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:17,219
- because I might never stop.
- Yes.

1007
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,990
I don't want to put
all that on him.

1008
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:21,821
Yes, I know, but those feelings
have to go somewhere, Gloria.

1009
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,394
Why don't you do what I did...
put them in writing?

1010
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:26,627
That might work.

1011
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:27,618
Thank you, Cam.

1012
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:28,578
No.

1013
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:29,538
No, Gloria.

1014
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,074
Thank <i>you.</i>

1015
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,610
Thank you for allowing me

1016
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:35,822
to be your guide
to spiritual awakening

1017
00:33:35,858 --> 00:33:36,899
the last 12 years.

1018
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:39,330
It has been...
a true privilege.

1019
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,706
What are you
talking about?

1020
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,275
We've been alone
maybe like eight times.

1021
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,554
Shh.

1022
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,923
Soar.

1023
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,358
Hi, Mommy and Daddy.

1024
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:49,827
We know you don't think
that we can take care of a dog,

1025
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:52,226
but you haven't met
our dog, Woofie.

1026
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:53,881
- Woof!
- No barking, Woofie.

1027
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:54,723
But you just said to...

1028
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:55,650
Bad dog!

1029
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:56,483
Bad dog!

1030
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,211
- Ow!
- No!

1031
00:33:58,247 --> 00:33:59,627
And don't worry,
we'll always remember

1032
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,251
to feed him
and keep him healthy.

1033
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:02,458
Is there a pill
in here?

1034
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:04,035
So, you don't want
a shiny coat?

1035
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:05,834
And don't worry,
we'll make sure he gets along

1036
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:08,317
with other dogs.
See you in a few hours.

1037
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:09,506
Hours?

1038
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:10,562
- Come on.
- Oh.

1039
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:11,720
You guys are
probably worried

1040
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:13,416
he's going to get
the house all dirty.

1041
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:15,199
Well, we know how
to handle that.

1042
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:16,543
Wait.
How are we gonna do the...

1043
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:19,966
Ugh!

1044
00:34:20,002 --> 00:34:22,189
So, as you can see,
we can do this.

1045
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:23,935
We know a dog's
a lot of work,

1046
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:25,790
but we'll never have to
do it alone.

1047
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:28,927
Yeah, it will always be
the three of us.

1048
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:31,582
Always.

1049
00:34:31,618 --> 00:34:33,758
The end.

1050
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:41,299
You guys know you can call me
anytime, right?

1051
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:44,570
And it's easy to
visit Switzerland, so...

1052
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:46,350
And I can
still count on you

1053
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,287
- for relationship advice, right?
- Yeah.

1054
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:49,962
I don't want to become
one of those pathetic guys

1055
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:51,710
that lets women
manipulate them.

1056
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:53,855
We're gonna be fine.

1057
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,974
Sit.

1058
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,475
Stay.

1059
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:06,415
- Joe!
- Too late.

1060
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,880
I just sold your kidney
on the black market in Zanzibar.

1061
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:12,860
Joe, your brother's
trying to take a bath.

1062
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:15,165
Privacy, please.

1063
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,438
Oh, Mom!

1064
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:17,941
Mom, no.

1065
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:20,039
Thank you.

1066
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,287
I know that
you're the poet in the family,

1067
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:24,743
but I wrote you
a little something.

1068
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:32,295
Oh, Mom.

1069
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,002
<i>I'm</i> the lucky one.

1070
00:35:34,129 --> 00:35:36,410
I'm gonna miss you so much,
but I am so excited

1071
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:38,778
that you're going to have
adventures on your own.

1072
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:40,748
Have the best year,
Manny.

1073
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,010
I will.

1074
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:45,388
And I'm gonna miss you,
too.

1075
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:47,209
Come back in one piece.

1076
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,578
I promise.

1077
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,177
What?

1078
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:52,731
- Talk is cheap.
- Mom!

1079
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:54,072
What... How am I
supposed to get out?!

1080
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:56,247
You have everything you need
to figure it out.

1081
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,973
Slow down your heartbeat,
look at your surroundings.

1082
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:01,225
Uh, Mom, wait.
Mo... Mom!

1083
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:04,971
Wow.

1084
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,561
- This room.
- Yeah.

1085
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,530
You okay?

1086
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,393
It just got me thinking

1087
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:13,361
about the empty house
we first moved into.

1088
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:16,465
Couple of newlyweds
planning a cross-country trip,

1089
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:17,861
but I kept getting
morning sickness.

1090
00:36:17,897 --> 00:36:18,983
Yeah.

1091
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:21,643
- Six months later...
- Wah, wah, wah.

1092
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,531
You carried two boxes,
Dylan.

1093
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:25,662
I carried two humans.

1094
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,728
Yes, Poppy and George.
Who else?

1095
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:30,012
We got the hang of it pretty fast.

1096
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,467
Yeah, we were feeling
pretty smart for a while and...

1097
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:34,401
Guys, I'm on the phone
with the landlord in Geneva.

1098
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:36,643
The apartment he has is
4 1/2 by 11 meters.

1099
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,503
Quick, what does that
work out to in square footage?!

1100
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:39,750
Meters and yards...

1101
00:36:39,786 --> 00:36:41,031
Yeah, no, no.
I'm still here.

1102
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:42,567
- Bigger than... Are they bigger than?
- Well...

1103
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:44,106
- Oh, do you have this?
- That one's kind of ridiculous. I'll have to get back to you.

1104
00:36:44,142 --> 00:36:46,124
No, no, I was just following
the path of this fly.

1105
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:47,916
Ugh! I'll do it.
Okay, give me a second.

1106
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,245
Which one of you
has the steadiest hands?

1107
00:36:51,324 --> 00:36:52,223
Oh, Luke,

1108
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:54,058
we got a second key
the last time that happened.

1109
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:55,627
It's in the kitchen drawer.
Come on.

1110
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,173
So, that's
pretty much...

1111
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:04,944
25 years
of uninterrupted crazy.

1112
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,630
Then, when it ends...
it ends.

1113
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:10,467
Until our next chapter.

1114
00:37:10,557 --> 00:37:12,629
I'm just brainstorming here,
but, uh...

1115
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,472
maybe we take
a long-delayed RV trip

1116
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,471
across the United States,

1117
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:20,126
get selfies with all the
Major League baseball mascots.

1118
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:23,779
I must really love you,
'cause that sounds fun.

1119
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:33,075
They're really leaving.

1120
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:34,355
What do we do?

1121
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:39,430
What people have always done.

1122
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:41,857
Leave the porch light on.

1123
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:43,343
They come back.

1124
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:47,206
Everyone!

1125
00:37:47,242 --> 00:37:49,087
I would like to, um,
say a few words

1126
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:50,336
before our car comes.

1127
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:52,922
Two simple words, actually...
thank you...

1128
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,201
Aww, Cam.

1129
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:56,996
...for making me feel so welcome
in this family.

1130
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,625
- Of course. We love you.
- You are family.

1131
00:37:58,707 --> 00:38:00,591
A family that
taught me so much.

1132
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:02,514
From Jay,
I learned to get to the point.

1133
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,799
From little Joe, I learned...

1134
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:06,083
Cam, we only have a few minutes.
Why don't...

1135
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,574
Why don't we take
that family picture, huh?

1136
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,970
Yeah, let's do that.

1137
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:09,937
- Great idea.
- You got Rex?

1138
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:10,737
I got him.

1139
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:12,426
Hey.

1140
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,038
I know people tend

1141
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:15,734
to get mushy
in moments like this,

1142
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,378
but with you headed
around the world

1143
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:20,882
and me headed off
to college...

1144
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,892
We'll stay close.

1145
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,004
How come you never
wrote a poem for me?

1146
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,765
Don't you get it?

1147
00:38:26,801 --> 00:38:28,492
They were all for you.

1148
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,132
<i>Chaqueta.</i>

1149
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:35,120
<i>Sombrero.</i>

1150
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:38,855
What are you?

1151
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:40,268
I know you're masculine.

1152
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:41,760
What is wrong
with you?

1153
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:42,790
What are you
talking about?

1154
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:45,566
You're acting crazy,
and it's scaring me.

1155
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:48,399
You're too young
to be acting like an old man.

1156
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,303
I've been using this app,
you know,

1157
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,319
so I'll know
what's going on

1158
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,120
when I go with you to Colombia
this summer.

1159
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:04,612
You're coming?!

1160
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:06,477
You've been staring at my family
for 12 years.

1161
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,667
Least I can do is
stare at yours for one summer.

1162
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,544
You're wonderful.

1163
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:11,656
But no staring,

1164
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:14,151
and never, ever
take the same route twice.

1165
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:16,784
Ay, Jay,
you're gonna love it.

1166
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,892
Okay, everybody, squeeze in.

1167
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:20,254
Squeeze in for the picture.

1168
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:21,291
Okay.

1169
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,869
Yeah. Yep. Okay.

1170
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,501
Alright.

1171
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:26,588
Perfect. I got it!

1172
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,185
Okay.

1173
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:29,974
I kind of don't want to let go.

1174
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,638
Yeah.

1175
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:33,550
Yeah, me neither.

1176
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:36,628
I mean,
it's Mitch and Cam now, but...

1177
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:38,729
it's these three next.

1178
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:42,651
Who knows when we'll all be
together again.

1179
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:43,673
Why is this so hard?

1180
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,751
We've done this like
seven times already today.

1181
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,739
It's hard because not everybody gets to have what we have.

1182
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,705
Oh.

1183
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:54,646
Mitchell, I put the skating
trophy in your suitcase.

1184
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:55,639
- I want you to have it first...
- Ohh.

1185
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:57,494
...so that I know
you'll come back.

1186
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:01,352
Okay, um...
I'm gonna set an example

1187
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:03,368
and be the first one
to let go.

1188
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:07,650
It was awful.

1189
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,734
<i>Life is full of change...</i>

1190
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:16,053
<i>some big, some small.</i>

1191
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,664
<i>I learned a long time ago,
you can fight it...</i>

1192
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:20,577
Oh!

1193
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:22,489
<i>...or you can try
to make the best of it.</i>

1194
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:25,162
Ay! Ay! Ay!

1195
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,229
<i>And that's all a lot easier</i>

1196
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:30,702
- <i>if you've got people who love you...</i>
- Hey.

1197
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,429
<i>...helping you face whatever
life throws at you.</i>

1198
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:36,347
<i>At least, that's what
helps me sleep at night.</i>

1199
00:40:43,802 --> 00:40:48,802

1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:03,048
Hey, you guys.

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:05,250
I packed up some dishes
for the new house.

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,987
I even found your old sippy cup
for when the little one comes along.

4
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,054
- Aww.
- Thanks, Mr. D.

5
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:10,356
Thanks, Dad.

6
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:12,524
Is, uh, Mom still in there
making that judgy face?

7
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:14,560
Haley, you've known her for 25 years.

8
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:15,861
Just call it her face.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,230
Haley's pregnancy is
off to a rough start.

10
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:20,866
Nausea, moodiness, trouble sleeping...

11
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,334
Claire's got it all.

12
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:26,071
Me, I'm just trying to keep
the peace here in Hormone Town.

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,173
Oh, can you believe it, Claire?

14
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:29,475
Our little girl is growing up.

15
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:30,709
Yeah, it seems like just yesterday

16
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:32,211
we were carrying all
these boxes downstairs

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,912
after she got arrested
and kicked out of college.

18
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,014
Ah.

19
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,982
Yeah, I've been through a lot, too.

20
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,318
I've been a limo driver, a lead singer,

21
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:42,021
a ranch hand, a Dapper
Dan at Disneyland,

22
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:43,856
a t-shirt designer, a sign spinner

23
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:46,792
and now a nursing student
with a baby on the way.

24
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:48,260
It's all going according to plan.

25
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,963
- Oh.
- So, we're gonna take some stuff over.

26
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,765
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Let's get a, uh...

27
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:53,999
Let's get a mother/daughter picture.

28
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:54,967
Oh... Oh, honey, I don't...

29
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:56,669
We... we really don't have to.

30
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:57,903
No, no, no. It'll be cute.

31
00:00:57,972 --> 00:00:59,838
Uh, Dad, you're being
weird. No one wants this.

32
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,906
Hang on here.

33
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:02,226
Nope, that's my finger.

34
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:04,076
So many fun filters.

35
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:05,811
Just take the picture!

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

37
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,759
Claire, look at the positive.

38
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,261
One of our kids is finally moving out.

39
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,097
After her pregnancy test,
I've had enough positives.

40
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,199
Kind of reminds me of two
other unmarried, pregnant,

41
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:29,334
lovestruck kids who
moved in together about...

42
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,803
25 years ago.

43
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,770
It's not the same.

44
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:34,973
I don't know. Acid-wash their jeans
and put a dream catcher in Dylan's ear,

45
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:36,408
and it's exactly the same.

46
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,012
Honey, I had a dream last night
that they left the baby in an Uber,

47
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:43,749
and I had to shrink myself down to
commandeer a hummingbird to find it.

48
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,118
I'm just glad it wasn't
another Jake Tapper sex dream.

49
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,821
I'm mad. I'm scared they're
in over their heads...

50
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,889
Claire, it's happening.
They're having the baby.

51
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,991
The train's left the
station. Get on board.

52
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:54,526
Fine.

53
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:55,661
You're right.

54
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,796
You're right. I'll...
I'll try to be positive.

55
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:00,099
Good. I was gonna go pick up
a house-warming gift for them.

56
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:02,868
- Why don't you come with me?
- Oh, okay, let's do that.

57
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:06,839
Wait a second. How do you board a
train that's already left the station?

58
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,507
I don't know. Maybe you
could catch up to them

59
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,342
on a hummingbird with Jake Tapper.

60
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,579
Well, you're off the hook.

61
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:14,880
I'm flying to Branson solo,

62
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:17,015
and I guess I'll be
sitting next to a stranger

63
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,384
at The Osmond Brothers:
A Tribute to Hip Hop.

64
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:21,386
Well, I'll catch them
when they come to Compton,

65
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,387
but thank you.

66
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,058
Well, it's the least I could do
after what you did for my sister, Pam.

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,494
My sister, Pam, is coming
to pick up Cal to...

68
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:29,895
to take him back to Missouri.

69
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:32,364
She was supposed to be in
prison another three months,

70
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,566
but my wonderful husband,

71
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,169
Assistant D.A. Pritchett, wrote a letter

72
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,204
advocating for her early release.

73
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:41,073
It was nothing.

74
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:42,474
It actually was nothing.

75
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:43,742
I never wrote any letter.

76
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:46,411
It just... It didn't feel right.

77
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:49,181
Pam showed no remorse,
and her sentence was fair.

78
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:50,716
And... And then for some reason,

79
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,285
they decided to let
her out early anyway.

80
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:55,921
Fortunately, uh, parole
records are sealed,

81
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:58,056
so Pam and Cam will never know,

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,591
and I don't have to go to Branson

83
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,693
and hear the Osmonds ask if
they can get a "what-what."

84
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:03,295
That's her!

85
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:04,730
Cal, that's your mom!

86
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,566
She's back from her, um... trip?

87
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:08,767
Up the river.

88
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:12,404
Pam! There she is!

89
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,306
- Hey, y'all!
- Oh, it's so good to see you!

90
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:15,340
- Hi!
- Hi.

91
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:16,853
Momma!

92
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:19,278
There's my little chicken nugget!

93
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,680
Ooh, my goodness!

94
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:24,750
I missed you so much. How have you been?

95
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:26,185
They read to me every night.

96
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,153
Aw, don't worry, baby.

97
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,588
That's all over now.

98
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,790
Oh, almost forgot!

99
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:33,292
Look what Momma made you.

100
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,027
I'm gonna put it on my bike!

101
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,529
Oh, he's gonna put it on his bike!

102
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:40,032
Oh, Pam, it is so great that you're out.

103
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:41,733
It must've been so lonely in there.

104
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:44,436
Well, there was some companionship.

105
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:45,571
Good.

106
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:47,306
- I dabbled in lesbianism.
- Oh.

107
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,574
Didn't hate it.

108
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:50,909
But there was just too
much talking afterwards.

109
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:53,278
- Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna get you some iced tea.
- Yeah.

110
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,415
Again, I'm... I'm so sorry
that you can't stay upstairs.

111
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,450
- We have this new renter coming in, and...
- Cram it.

112
00:03:58,552 --> 00:03:59,952
I know you didn't send that letter.

113
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:01,053
What? H-How?

114
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:02,087
That don't matter.

115
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:04,056
All that matters is you're gonna pay.

116
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,226
Oh... In prison, they called me BOTOX,

117
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:09,728
because even though
all the ladies want me,

118
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,064
I will wreck your face.

119
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,636
Sherry, I-I don't know if I like these.

120
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:18,704
They're so short.

121
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:20,239
No, that's the style, boo.

122
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:22,074
I just don't know if I
have the ankles for this.

123
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:24,309
Yeah, those pants are
no good for Latin people.

124
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,778
They make you look like you're
trying to run across a river.

125
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,547
Well, I think you look great.

126
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:31,216
You should only wear pants
like that from now on.

127
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,651
Okay.

128
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:35,554
Manny, we should start
sending invitations

129
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:37,389
for your birthday party.

130
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:38,824
Oh, but I thought we were gonna go to

131
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:41,426
the Ojai Mime and Wine
Festival for your birthday?

132
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:44,496
Oh, yeah, maybe we
shouldn't do the party, Mom.

133
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:45,998
This is crazy.

134
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,300
Manny's terrified of mimes.

135
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:50,502
And he hates Central Valley wine.

136
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:52,971
Hey, great news.

137
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,707
My Sausage of the Month
arrived a day early.

138
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,209
You get to be here for the un-boxing.

139
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,911
I'm not gonna film it this time.

140
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,512
Kielbasa, yes!

141
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:02,014
They took my suggestion again.

142
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,782
I told you it's not a suggestion.

143
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:06,418
The web page is just
asking you to choose one.

144
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,819
Anyways, we have a problem.

145
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,521
Sherry is bossing Manny around.

146
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,057
Oof, that's a lot to take in.

147
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:14,993
Can you cook these up with
that special sauce you do?

148
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,228
You have to go and tell him

149
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:18,630
- that he needs to stand up for himself.
- Why me?

150
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,899
I-I don't think we should get
involved at all, but, I mean,

151
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,201
if it's a problem for
you, then you do it,

152
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:24,236
'cause I don't care.

153
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:25,370
I can't.

154
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,905
If I say something bad
about Manny's girlfriend,

155
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:28,640
he's not gonna listen,
because I am the mother

156
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,610
who thinks that nobody's good
enough for her little boy.

157
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,012
- Just let it go.
- I can't because she's not good enough

158
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:35,414
for my little boy.

159
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:36,515
I'm gonna take a pass.

160
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,516
Then I'm gonna take a
pass making your sausages

161
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:41,820
with my grandmother's spicy onion sauce.

162
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,288
Fine, I'll do it.

163
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:46,625
But all these demands don't
sound very second wife-y.

164
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:50,996
Hey, kid.

165
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:54,499
I need to talk to you about
you and your girlfriend.

166
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:55,968
It's a sensitive subject.

167
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:58,236
If this is about the sounds
coming from my room last night,

168
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,471
it wasn't what you think.

169
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,806
We were rearranging
the furniture, and then

170
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:02,574
we were congratulating each
other on how it turned out.

171
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,309
Sadly, I believe you.

172
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,012
I thought you liked your
furniture exactly like it was?

173
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:08,947
We fired two cleaning women over this.

174
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,016
I thought I did, too,
but it turns out I didn't.

175
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:13,151
Actually, that's what I don't
want to talk to you about.

176
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,354
Is it possible Sherry pushes you around?

177
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:16,488
What are you saying?

178
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,423
I don't know.

179
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:20,392
Be the man, you know.

180
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:21,660
Show some backbone.

181
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,229
- That is such a you thing to say.
- It really isn't.

182
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:26,298
It's such an old way of
looking at relationships.

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,766
Gender roles don't matter anymore.

184
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,034
Is that why you're wearing her pants?

185
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:30,602
Let me tell you something, Jay.

186
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:31,703
Just like long pants,

187
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,171
toxic machismo has gone out of style.

188
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,473
Yeah.

189
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,041
Yeah, masculinity's bad

190
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,110
till someone has to kill a spider.

191
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,249
Ta-da!

192
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,986
Welcome to 14 7/8 Fletcher Ave.

193
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:50,455
Wow. This is cozy, huh?

194
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:53,225
Well, it's a converted garage,
so I know it's a little bit small.

195
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,293
Oh, honey, it's only
small for a place to live.

196
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:56,995
Hey, we got you guys
a housewarming gift.

197
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,597
It's a decorative pineapple

198
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,199
because, uh, pineapples
are a symbol of good luck.

199
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,334
Thanks, Mr. D.

200
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,236
That's way better than our giant cherry.

201
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,871
That's just a symbol of a clean toilet.

202
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:06,905
Thanks, Dad.

203
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,375
You've very welcome. It's actually
from both of us, right, honey?

204
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:14,012
Right. Right, because I thought
you would want a lot of luck.

205
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:17,716
Mom, look. I know what you're thinking
but we're saving a ton of money.

206
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:19,284
Utilities are included,

207
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:20,685
we don't need a lot of furniture,

208
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,188
and it'll be easy to
keep track of the baby!

209
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,625
And they can, uh... they
can walk to the airport.

210
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,403
Which brings us back to the living room.

211
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:32,733
Wow. We got the whole
tour without even moving.

212
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,573
Tiny-homes are very trendy these days.

213
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,369
And, by the way, it's what I called

214
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,437
my short, black best
friend in high school.

215
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,039
So, where... where are you thinking of

216
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:42,074
- putting the baby's crib?
- Well, we were thinking about

217
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,509
putting it right there
under the skylight.

218
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:46,078
That way, the baby can look
up and reach for the stars.

219
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,880
Ohh, I love that.

220
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:50,116
And look how clean that glass is.

221
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:52,651
A little too clean.

222
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,553
It's... It's not a skylight.

223
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:55,821
There's a hole in your roof.

224
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:58,124
Cool, I always wanted to learn
how to install a skylight.

225
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,658
I guess today's the day.

226
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:01,894
Have you also always wanted
to move an electrical outlet

227
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:03,129
that's currently in the shower?

228
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:04,764
- Well, that can't be code.
- It's not.

229
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,565
I'm telling you exactly what's going on.

230
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:09,769
Oh, excuse me.

231
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,737
Haley, honey.

232
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,572
You can't raise a baby in here.

233
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,541
What happens if... if the baby's crying

234
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,309
- and you need to sleep?
- Thought of it.

235
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,211
We're gonna put up a sheet
to make it like a little room.

236
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:21,147
Oh, smart.

237
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,681
Tell me how this works.

238
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,451
Wahh, wahh, wahh. Could you hear me?

239
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,887
I know it's not perfect,
but we've got this.

240
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:29,555
We're a lot more grown
up than you think.

241
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:31,557
Haley, can I talk to you
for a second in the kitchen?

242
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,592
Yeah.

243
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:34,760
Uh, that was the doctor.

244
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:36,328
We're supposed to be there right now.

245
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:38,631
Oh, my God. The ultrasound...
I totally spaced!

246
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,533
We can't let my mom find out.

247
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,768
Um, let's just make up something
responsible and get out of here.

248
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,703
- Okay.
- Okay.

249
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:47,740
So, we need to go and get toothbrushes.

250
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,241
You should've put up a sheet.

251
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,709
We heard everything.

252
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:52,745
You missed your first
ultrasound appointment?

253
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,447
Well, we will if you keep lecturing me.

254
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,048
- Who's the doctor?
- We found her on Yelp.

255
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:57,450
- She has, like, four stars.
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:59,585
So does the sushi place
that gave Luke worms.

257
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:00,553
I'm coming with you.

258
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,589
I think I'm just gonna hang back
and commence Operation Skylight.

259
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:06,225
I parked in back. Let's go this way.

260
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:07,293
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

261
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:11,831
That is lucky! We just bought a broom.

262
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,800
Hey, there's my favorite sister-in-law.

263
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,469
I, uh... I got you a Popsicle,

264
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:18,437
and the stick has a joke on it.

265
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,573
Um, "How do you fix a broken gorilla?"

266
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:22,508
Mm, well, I guess we're
gonna find out soon.

267
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:24,944
Sticks are good for more than joking.

268
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:28,314
In prison, I learned how to fashion
all manner of sticks into knives.

269
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:31,016
You know, I love that you
had time for crafts in there.

270
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:33,452
I also learned if you don't
do what you say you're gonna,

271
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:34,487
you get hurt.

272
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:37,189
Um, I'm gonna go, uh, check on Cal.

273
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:38,858
No, no, no, I'll do
it. I want to soak up

274
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,259
as much time with him as I can

275
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:41,527
before you take him home.

276
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,695
Cal.

277
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:44,730
Cal, what is... Put that down!

278
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,965
Where did he get a cheeseburger?

279
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,075
I don't know.

280
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:51,003
Hey, look. I'm... I-I'm
sorry about the letter,

281
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:52,505
but it all worked out.

282
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,106
You still got out early.

283
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,910
Only because I volunteered
to help train police dogs.

284
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:00,746
It was horrible.

285
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,016
I'm stealing a TV!

286
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:06,354
I'm stealing a TV!

287
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:08,187
Get off of me!

288
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,155
I feel it!

289
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:11,790
What do you want from me?

290
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:13,459
- Miles.
- Uh, what?

291
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:16,195
I know all you fancy
people have rewards cards.

292
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,497
Being all cooped up has
given me the travel bug.

293
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:19,698
But I've been saving those.

294
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,967
I bought groceries at a
gas station for six months

295
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:23,035
to get triple points.

296
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:26,205
For... For Lily's birthday breakfast,
we gave her something called Pop Zarts.

297
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:29,708
I want them in my account by the
end of the day or I tell Cameron.

298
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:33,512
But I almost have enough for
two off-peak flights to Paris.

299
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:35,014
Ha, "monkey wrench."

300
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,749
Yeah, that's putting it mildly.

301
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:40,052
No, that's how you fix a
broken gorilla, you dummy.

302
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:41,387
Oh.

303
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,758
Oh, there you are. How did it go?

304
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,226
Not well.

305
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,328
He got all mad, called
me old-fashioned.

306
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,731
Me... the guy who bought Alex a
book on successful business ladies.

307
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,199
Sorry, I didn't understand that.

308
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:55,401
Please try again.

309
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:57,703
Why does that coffee
grinder keep talking to me?

310
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:59,338
Well, you kept your end of the bargain,

311
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,639
so I'm gonna make the sausages,

312
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,274
and we'll talk about
the second step later.

313
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:03,676
There's no second steps. I did it.

314
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:05,244
That's the last I want to hear about it.

315
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:06,679
Thanks a lot, Jay.

316
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,948
I should've ignored you,
but you got in my head.

317
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,584
About what? This is
first time I hear of this.

318
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,919
I started thinking maybe
she does boss me around

319
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,822
a little bit, so I confronted
her, things got heated,

320
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:18,757
and now she called a
car and she's leaving.

321
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:21,961
The best relationship I've ever
had, and I think it might be ending.

322
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,562
Last time I listen to you, Jay.

323
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:25,531
Don't worry, papi.
Those things have a way

324
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,933
- of working themselves out.
- Eh, what're ya gonna do?

325
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:30,169
Yeah, that's a good question.
What are you going to do?

326
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,370
I'm calling it.

327
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:32,538
I'm done.

328
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,906
Calling Brian Dunn.

329
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:35,641
No. No, no.

330
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:36,742
I owe him money.

331
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:39,511
Jay, you need to talk to Sherry
and tell her that it was your idea.

332
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,946
I've kept up my part of the bargain.

333
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:41,981
Now, don't go all Colombian

334
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,783
and tell me if I don't talk to Sherry
you're not making those sausages,

335
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,719
'cause I already took a second statin.

336
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:49,588
Sorry, for once, you're
not getting your way.

337
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:53,459
Hey, Sher, got a sec?

338
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,561
Uh, tough to say. Bartev
is two minutes away,

339
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,996
but his car is spinning, so...

340
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,530
I know you're upset with Manny.

341
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:59,765
That's on me.

342
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,300
I put some ideas in his head.

343
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:02,635
You know, I'm kind of a hero to him.

344
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,236
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

345
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:05,904
You know, I'm crazy about the kid,

346
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:07,973
and I just want to make sure
he's in a healthy relationship.

347
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,875
Gloria put you up to this, didn't she?

348
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,404
It's complicated.

349
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,445
You do see the irony of this, right?

350
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,247
She's so worried about
Manny getting bossed around,

351
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:17,149
yet she has no problem
bossing you around?

352
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,418
- No, no, that's crazy.
- Really?

353
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,086
Is this how you wanted
to spend your afternoon?

354
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:22,221
No, I hate this.

355
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,622
Man, I had a whole day planned.

356
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:26,625
Listen, I'm gonna let Manny
spiral for a few hours,

357
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:28,794
and then we're gonna go back upstairs
and move the furniture around.

358
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:29,862
Oh, God, it was that.

359
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:31,430
But you need to stand up for yourself.

360
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:33,098
You go back in there,
and you tell Gloria

361
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,633
that you're tired of
being told what to do.

362
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,402
- Let me think about it.
- Don't think.

363
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,237
- Just do it.
- Okay.

364
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,342
Oh! Oh.

365
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:46,045
Relax. It's nothing
I haven't seen before.

366
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,846
I was on the boys' wrestling team.

367
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:49,815
What do you want? I
transferred the miles.

368
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,451
I got 'em. Decided I don't
want to travel, though...

369
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:54,353
Converted them all into gift cards.

370
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,889
No, no, no, they say you're
not supposed to do that.

371
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:59,291
I decided I want something else.

372
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:00,693
I want to move in upstairs,

373
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,495
and I want a HEPA air
filter on account of I shed.

374
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:06,598
I told you it's rented. I
can't just cancel on them.

375
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:07,766
You sure about that?

376
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:12,037
Because when I don't get what I want,
I can make things real uncomfortable.

377
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,706
Oh, cold, cold!

378
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:14,873
What's going on?

379
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:15,841
Nothing.

380
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:17,209
Mitchell and I's just talking.

381
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:18,410
No, no, we weren't. I can't...

382
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,779
I can't take this anymore. I'm sorry.

383
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:23,682
- I never wrote the letter to the parole board.
- What?

384
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,951
I... I tried to lie, but
I just... I couldn't do it.

385
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:28,287
Yet you had no problem lying to me.

386
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:31,630
You just let my sister rot
in that horrific hell hole?

387
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:34,693
Oh, please, they have a Taco Tuesday!

388
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:38,208
- Uh, Cam, c-can we talk?
- Oh, hold up.

389
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:39,286
I'm just looking through
some pictures of me

390
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,554
helping out your family.

391
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:42,522
Here I am taking Jay and
Gloria to the airport,

392
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:45,592
and, oh, this is me, uh, helping
Alex move into her dorm room,

393
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:48,128
and who can forget when I
helped Phil with that magic trick

394
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:49,396
and let him make me disappear.

395
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:50,363
You're not in that picture.

396
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,265
That's how good I am at helping out.

397
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,068
Now let's take a look at some
pictures of you helping out my family.

398
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,336
Oh!

399
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:57,470
Cam, I tried to write the letter.

400
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,222
I... I really did,
but she broke the law,

401
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,574
and she got a fair sentence.

402
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,656
She did not deserve to get out early.

403
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,725
I-I couldn't bring
myself to lie about it.

404
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:06,860
Oh, give me a break.

405
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,988
I have heard you say the words,

406
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,723
"Nice perm, Manny."

407
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:11,925
You can get there.

408
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:13,526
I am an officer of the law.

409
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:15,728
- I took an oath.
- What about our oath?

410
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,097
To love, honor, and...

411
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:18,298
and lie for each other's family.

412
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,232
Oh, that's not part of it.

413
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:20,233
But it's implied.

414
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:22,635
Stop. Stop.

415
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,404
Mitchell's right.

416
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:26,673
I spent the day terrorizing him.

417
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,208
I'm a horrible person.

418
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,909
I should still be in jail.

419
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:32,011
Look what I took.

420
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,213
Is that my beard trimmer?

421
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,381
Works on other hairs.

422
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,218
I'm sorry.

423
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:42,222
I am a thief and a
liar and a manipulator.

424
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:45,125
I can't be trusted to rejoin society.

425
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:46,326
Hey, don't say that. You're...

426
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:47,861
You're gonna be fine.

427
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,496
What about little Cal?

428
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,097
He's doing so good here.

429
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,699
I'm just gonna ruin him.

430
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,002
I need supervision,
to be locked back up.

431
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,904
You guys know where I
can get a pickup truck

432
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:58,805
and a big ol' chain?

433
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,507
I'm gonna steal me a Redbox.

434
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,045
Pam, hey, you...

435
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,911
You don't have to go
back to prison, okay?

436
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,746
You can stay upstairs.

437
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:09,048
Do you mean it?

438
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:10,316
What about your renters?

439
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:12,051
We'll cancel, um,

440
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,586
and... and we'll help take care of Cal

441
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,422
until you can get back
on your feet, okay?

442
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,624
Family first.

443
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:18,658
Hey.

444
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:20,660
One for the book.

445
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,996
I'm gonna go get settled upstairs.

446
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:26,466
If it's okay, I'll come back
down for Cal after my tub.

447
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:27,867
Thank you both.

448
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,669
I won't forget this.

449
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:31,471
That was so sweet.

450
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,373
I'm glad Cal gets to stick around.

451
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:34,474
And now with Pam here,

452
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,576
she can feed the cat
while we go to Branson.

453
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:41,447
Dr. Singh, that is
some exquisite gel work,

454
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,116
and I say that as
a soon-to-be nurse

455
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,051
and someone who wears a
lot of product in his hair.

456
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,352
Thank you.

457
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:48,121
Haley, have you been taking
your prenatal vitamins?

458
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,722
I'll make sure she does from now on.

459
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,057
Calm down, Mom.

460
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:52,525
I can remember to take a pill every day.

461
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:53,726
Can you?

462
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:55,828
There's the heartbeat.

463
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,099
Oh, it... it sounds so
fast, is everything okay?

464
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,802
No, that's good. That's the
way a baby's heart should sound.

465
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,103
He's right.

466
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,272
It's the sound of a very healthy... oh!

467
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:07,540
What?

468
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,577
There's a second heartbeat.

469
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,779
A baby with two hearts?

470
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,647
I didn't know I was pregnant
when I ate that brownie!

471
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:17,250
- I didn't...
- No, H-Haley, breathe.

472
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,585
You're having twins.

473
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,087
That's impossible. It's a mistake.

474
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:23,089
It's not. I'm pretty good at this.

475
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:25,225
She's right. You can
see them right here.

476
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:27,160
I can't have twins.

477
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,128
That's twice as many
babies as we were expecting.

478
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:30,430
Yeah, they'll outnumber us.

479
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,698
How are they gonna fit in our place?

480
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,233
How are they gonna fit in my body?

481
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:35,068
One is always going to be awake.

482
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:36,636
I'll never sleep again.
And those double-strollers

483
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,305
are so wide, I can say goodbye
to ever shopping in a boutique.

484
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:40,907
- Haley, everything's gonna be okay.
- You don't know that.

485
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:42,775
- I do!
- I'm in way over my head, Mom, I...

486
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,876
But you're not alone.

487
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:45,178
Yeah, I'll be here.

488
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,580
Yeah, he'll be here, but
I meant me. I'll be here.

489
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:49,482
Yeah, but you kind of
haven't been lately.

490
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:52,252
I know, I know, and I'm
very sorry about that,

491
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,956
but as you're about to find out,
being a mom is very complicated.

492
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,459
Luckily, there are these
instincts that kick in,

493
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,327
especially when your kid's in trouble.

494
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,997
So if you're ever overwhelmed,

495
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:09,269
I am right over your shoulder
on the wings of a hummingbird.

496
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:10,903
Now I know where she got the brownie.

497
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,906
And I'll be right behind you
on that hummingbird, Mrs. D.

498
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,642
It's kind of a hummingbird for one.

499
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,647
Okay, Manny and his girlfriend are good.

500
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,814
Let's boil and broil.

501
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,417
Thank you, Jay. Two sausages coming up.

502
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:25,418
Two? What, am I in a boy band?

503
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,352
Make 'em all.

504
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,655
So, what did Sherry say exactly?

505
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:31,090
Not much. I, you know...
I did most of the talking.

506
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,559
Well, hopefully now she'll
stop being so controlling.

507
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:34,460
Yeah.

508
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,296
Funny, though.

509
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:37,730
What is?

510
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,165
Well, it's just that, you know,

511
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,034
you were worried about
Manny being pushed around,

512
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,635
and if you think about it,

513
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:44,804
you've been sort of
pushing me around all day.

514
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:46,205
What's the funny part?

515
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,273
No, it's just...

516
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:48,374
Where's this coming from?

517
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,809
Nothing, it's just
something I thought of.

518
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,811
No, you don't think of stuff.

519
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,346
- This is Sherry.
- No, it isn't.

520
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,881
But if it were, she'd have a point.

521
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,083
Oh, really? So you think
I'm very controlling?

522
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:59,185
Well, you're welcome
to choose the doctors,

523
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,287
pick the handymen,
make plans with friends,

524
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:03,022
cancel plans with friends.

525
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,557
Okay, okay, I get it.

526
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,491
No, no, no, no.

527
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,226
You do need to take more control.

528
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:09,128
Actually, from now on,

529
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:12,198
you should decide how
to cook your own sausage.

530
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,602
Fine, you don't think I can do it?

531
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:20,640
Coffee grinder, how do I
make Gloria's special sauce?

532
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:22,241
Now you're quiet?

533
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,211
Hey, Jay.

534
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,813
- You ready to go?
- Go where?

535
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:29,148
Gloria said you'd help me put in
a skylight at Haley's new place.

536
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,751
Oh, yeah, I empowered her to say that.

537
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:32,685
How's the move going?

538
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:34,187
So good. Really good.

539
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:35,388
Good, good, good, good.

540
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:36,489
- That's good.
- No, it's not.

541
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:38,024
It's a disaster. The place is too small.

542
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,493
Everything needs fixing. I'm
trying to stay calm, but...

543
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,629
There's a hole in the ceiling, Jay...

544
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,732
A hole in the ceiling.

545
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Rain is gonna fall on the crib.

546
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:49,035
What... What happens if a... an owl

547
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:50,703
picks up a-a pinecone and drops it?

548
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,172
- My grandchild's gonna get hit with a pinecone!
- Don't be silly.

549
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,575
What would an owl be
doing with a pinecone?

550
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,910
At the most, it would be
a mouse or a baby gopher.

551
00:18:57,979 --> 00:18:59,712
Dylan seems like he's
getting his life together,

552
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:01,781
but he's still a wild card at best.

553
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,549
I know exactly how you feel.

554
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,551
I guess you do. I was
your wild card, huh?

555
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:07,186
I didn't have a lot of faith.

556
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,955
Didn't you have feathers
hanging off your ear?

557
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:10,957
- It was a dream catcher.
- It was my nightmare.

558
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,159
I think I see what you're saying.

559
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,195
If I can become awesome, so can Dylan.

560
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:17,497
That's not what I'm saying.

561
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,098
Who the hell knows what's gonna happen?

562
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,500
Let me tell you something about life.

563
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:24,137
We all have this illusion
that we're in control.

564
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,606
I wanted to play pro football,
some guy takes my knee out.

565
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,074
I graduate from school,

566
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,809
I'm gonna drive my
motorcycle across the country,

567
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:31,844
and some suit pulls my draft number.

568
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:34,280
I worked my ass off to
send my daughter to college,

569
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,882
some juggler knocks her up.

570
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,583
Again, sir, I'm very sorry about that.

571
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,953
I put in the years, I build my business
so I don't have to answer to anyone,

572
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,023
and I still have to jump through
hoops to get a damn sausage.

573
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:45,958
You lost me there at that last part.

574
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,763
Look, all I'm saying is
things are always gonna change,

575
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:52,632
and you have to deal with it.

576
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,535
But the good news is,
five years from now

577
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:57,470
while you're playing with your grandkid,

578
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,338
you won't even remember today.

579
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,342
I hadn't thought about it like that.

580
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:04,844
Thanks, Jay.

581
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:11,984
Huh. Haley and Dylan are gonna
have to move back in with us.

582
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,020
That's okay. I can handle that.

583
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,891
She's having twins.

584
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:21,160
Let's get you a sausage.

585
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,386
Thank you.

586
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:35,478
It was a box of clothes
Pam asked her mom

587
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:38,438
to ship to her three days ago.

588
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,703
You faked that breakdown
so you could stay here.

589
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:43,998
Well done, Counselor.

590
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:45,981
See, this is why I couldn't
write that letter for you.

591
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:49,253
You have no remorse for
your lying, stealing ways,

592
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:50,841
but I... I am on to you,

593
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,539
and I am going to make you pay.

594
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,454
No, you ain't.

595
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:55,672
You tiny.

596
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:57,370
Hey, hey, are those our lamps?

597
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:58,327
Pam?

598
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,994

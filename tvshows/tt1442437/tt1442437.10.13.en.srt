1
00:00:01,019 --> 00:00:02,739
Welcome.
Most of you know me

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,542
as Acting Vice Principal
Tucker,

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,948
but today...

4
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:09,643
I am your guide
to the future...

5
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:11,198
the future...
the future.

6
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:13,268
Okay, so you didn't
take my note on the echo.

7
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:15,620
Mitchell, I can't take another
negative voice in my head.

8
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:17,909
I'm already freaking out
about Principal Brown.

9
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:20,510
I kind of have a bully
at school.

10
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:22,885
You gonna eat all that?

11
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,057
- I-I guess not.
- Okay.

12
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:26,752
Saw your plans
for the seminar tomorrow.

13
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:27,854
Oh, you like it?

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,823
Y-You know, I think the kids
will really benefit

15
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:31,372
from hearing
from four graduates

16
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,191
that have taken
such different paths.

17
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:35,785
I've got traditional college,
gap year...

18
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,457
- Wrong!
- We're pushing one path here... college.

19
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:40,402
Well, yeah, but college
isn't necessarily

20
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:41,839
the right path
for every...

21
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,207
Tucker, are you familiar
with the term "Golden Apple"?

22
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:45,706
I am.
I'm a little surprised

23
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,590
it's made its way into
the straight vernacular.

24
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:49,175
It's still illegal
in Alabama.

25
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,441
No, no, no, Golden Apple status
is awarded to schools

26
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:53,964
that reach a minimum
of 60% college acceptance.

27
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,105
If we dip below that,

28
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,628
I'm back to teaching
night school.

29
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:58,466
If you think
the lunch ladies are mean,

30
00:00:58,597 --> 00:00:59,903
you should meet
the dinner ladies.

31
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:01,635
Yeah, but what about
the students that...

32
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,683
Play ball,
Acting Vice Principal Tucker,

33
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:05,172
and you might
just find yourself...

34
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:06,996
- Vice principal?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,363
I just don't know
if I can preach something

36
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:11,816
that I don't believe.

37
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:13,292
- Ha! Play ball.
- Seems like a thing

38
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:14,755
no one was saying,
and now everyone is.

39
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,035
You know
what I'm doing right now?

40
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,503
I'm making 100 cupcakes

41
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:20,855
because the D.A. lost
his caterer for his kid's party

42
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,199
and asked
if I could help out.

43
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:25,019
But if it puts me, uh,
higher up on his radar,

44
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:26,755
then so be it.

45
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:27,871
I'm just saying

46
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,562
sometimes you need to
compromise

47
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,003
to... to get ahead.

48
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:32,457
Maybe it's our time
now.

49
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:33,754
Ooh, I like that.

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,863
Hey, world,

51
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:36,785
there's a new power couple
on the horizon.

52
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,269
- Yeah.
- Cam and Mitch.

53
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:39,371
Citch...

54
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:40,855
- No.
- No, that sounds weird.

55
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,535
- Mam...
- We'll find it.

59
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:59,707
Hey, Dad, our video conference
is about to start.

60
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:00,661
Can we make it fast?

61
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,425
I have that sales meeting
offsite.

62
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:04,753
Hence the power threads
and box of cigars.

63
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:06,792
Whoa!
Dad, it's 10:00 in the morning.

64
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,003
- Mm.
- Ohh!

65
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:09,160
I don't swallow it.

66
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,613
He smells it on my breath,
he lets his guard down.

67
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,449
In 20 minutes,
I'm taking him in a way

68
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,175
that would make
a prison guard blush.

69
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,844
It's the way
gentlemen do business.

70
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:20,339
Well, I am sorry to ruin
your Glengarry, Glenlivet fun,

71
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:21,785
but that meeting
got canceled.

72
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:23,605
What?
I was looking forward to it.

73
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,441
Nick took care of it
by Skype this morning.

74
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:27,464
Log on.
Our meeting's about to start.

75
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,253
Okay,
let's begin.

76
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:33,956
So, Nick,
where are we

77
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,942
with the interactive closet
with the voice prompts?

78
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,031
Here's a demo.

79
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,745
Went with a Christopher Walken
soundalike voice.

80
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,042
Forecast is...
chilly.

81
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,878
Put...
on some pants.

82
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,738
I think we all
fell in love with the idea

83
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,441
of calling it a Walken closet,

84
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:48,961
but this just isn't working.

85
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:51,845
Hey, Claire, I don't see your
dad on the video conference.

86
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,496
Damn it!
My computer's busted again.

87
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:56,738
Or your caps lock is on.

88
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,985
Can't we have this meeting
in the conference room?

89
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,746
You know, where we all
sit around a table,

90
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,455
there's a nice
breakfast spread?

91
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,003
I am tired of having to keep
cream cheese in my desk.

92
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:06,824
Dad, you know why
we do it this way.

93
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,238
We have people
working here.

94
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:09,676
We've got people
working from home.

95
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,777
We've got people working
all over the world.

96
00:03:11,902 --> 00:03:14,316
Tiffany is in Berlin
at KlausetSchvarg.

97
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,647
They still have
that conference?

98
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,332
I thought they shut that down
in the '80s

99
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,040
after we used that sweater hutch
to smuggle that dissident out

100
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,628
during East KlausetSchvarg.

101
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,355
You're good.
Just talk into the camera.

102
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:27,691
Hoo! Sorry about that.

103
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:28,723
<i>All right.</i>

104
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,483
<i>How about an update
on our 3-D printing?</i>

105
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,175
<i>I think
everybody knows Eduardo.</i>

106
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,183
Jay,
have you two met?

107
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:34,730
I can't see the camera!

108
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:36,566
Dad, you're, uh...

109
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:38,586
you're kind of smushed up
against it.

110
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:41,354
You might want to just
step back a skosh.

111
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:44,073
Using a 3-D printer
to manufacture our closets

112
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,399
will triple revenue.

113
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:46,850
I can't hear you!

114
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,639
Volume up, Dad.

115
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:51,667
In our first year alone...

116
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:53,315
What the hell?!

117
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:54,526
Dad, "undo." Just...

118
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,062
I know! I know!

119
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,411
Double-click.

120
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:00,214
♪ Happy birrrthday ♪

121
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,831
- ♪ Mr. Closet... ♪ - No!
- No! - No!

122
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:05,300
Have your stupid meeting!
I'm outta here!

123
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:08,488
Margaret, I'm going to the park
across the street.

124
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:09,623
I need a walk!

125
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,948
Aah!

126
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:14,807
Thank you so much
for helping out with Joe.

127
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:16,604
You don't think
it's too flashy?

128
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:18,902
What are you talking about?
You're taking a magic class.

129
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:20,432
You want to show them
you're serious.

130
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:23,432
It's abracadabra,
not abraca-drab-ra.

131
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,878
Ohh! Look at that!
An open casting call.

132
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:29,706
Excuse me,
what is this for?

133
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,659
We are looking for
real families

134
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:33,816
to be the new faces
of the Glen Valley Mall.

135
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,483
You guys are adorable.
Want to sign up?

136
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:36,784
Oh, we're not
a-a real...

137
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:38,198
Oh, we would love to!

138
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:41,284
What a cool and a spontaneous
thing to do!

139
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,511
I saw that poster last week.

140
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:46,167
It kind of reminded me
of a long time ago

141
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,948
when I used to do
a little modeling.

142
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,330
I guess I miss it.

143
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,315
I tricked Phil
into going to the mall

144
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,612
because I knew that
Jay wouldn't do it with me.

145
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:55,979
Oh, come on, guys.
This is gonna be so much fun.

146
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:57,065
I don't know.

147
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:59,784
This kid in my class
did a cough syrup commercial.

148
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:02,307
Now he's always going
to the teachers' lounge

149
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:03,471
to call his manager.

150
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,690
He's the worst.

151
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:06,487
And I teach
a real-estate class at 5:00.

152
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,871
I have to show up early
to limber up.

153
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,034
Um...

154
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,409
I think that this could help
a lot with Joe's self-esteem.

155
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:14,321
He's had a rough week.

156
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:17,425
You know how they treat kids
that are into magic.

157
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:19,160
Oh, you tell him
when he gets to high school,

158
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:20,260
that all changes.

159
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,175
I don't like lying to him.

160
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:23,792
Look, this isn't really my thing,

161
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,496
and I'm... I'm feeling
a little under the weather.

162
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:26,901
Don't... Don't I look
a little pale?

163
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:27,986
We will do it!

164
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:29,112
Great.

165
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:32,518
Our P.A. will set you up with
wardrobe for some test shots.

166
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:34,275
Hey, team.
Can I get you anything?

167
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,563
Uh, coffee? Water?
Still or sparkling?

168
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:38,245
Ooh, I-I'd take
a sparkling.

169
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:39,679
Talent wants sparkling.

170
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,315
Did you hear that, Phil?

171
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:42,886
They call us talent!

172
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:45,034
Let's not get carried away.
We're still reg...

173
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,362
I said sparkling.

174
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,018
Well, looks like
you're gonna get

175
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:52,494
a pretty solid turnout,
Tucker.

176
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,930
Now close the deal.

177
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,979
Hey, what is,
uh, "whanex"?

178
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:58,378
It's the way the kids say
"What's next?"

179
00:05:58,464 --> 00:05:59,651
If you want to reach them,

180
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,377
you have to learn
to speak their language.

181
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:02,970
Massive screw-up at the print shop.

182
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:05,026
I-I have no idea
how it happened!

183
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,095
Yeah, that's right.
The banner should read...

184
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:08,979
whanex.
Okay.

185
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:11,323
Yeah, whanex.
Uh-huh.

186
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,848
Welcome, students, to the first
annual "whanex" seminar.

187
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,551
Let's, uh, just jump right
into it and meet our panelists.

188
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:21,155
We have two bright, young people
who chose the college path

189
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,456
and two wayward souls

190
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,612
whose mistakes
we can only hope to learn from.

191
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,159
'Sup, Dolphins?

192
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:34,253
Nick, I'm so sorry
about my dad this morning.

193
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:35,340
- Hi.
- Please forget it.

194
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:36,575
- We've got a bigger problem.
- Hmm?

195
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,137
We have to find a new voice for
the virtual closet assistant.

196
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,129
We're thinking...
female.

197
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:43,121
Yeah, I was wondering
about that myself.

198
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,237
Hold on a second.

199
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,240
Claire has a great voice...
commanding but alluring.

200
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,809
Oh, come on.
I don't know about...

201
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:49,942
..alluring.

202
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:51,059
You're right.

203
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,545
You're right.
I can totally hear it.

204
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,910
Guys, guys...

205
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,410
..you're embarrassing me.

206
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:56,957
Where have you
been hiding this?

207
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,278
Within half an hour,

208
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,059
I had recorded all
the voice prompts

209
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,254
for the new smart-closet,

210
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,746
and they installed it
in the prototype right in the office.

211
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:07,097
Everyone seemed really happy,
but I don't get it.

212
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,214
I mean...

213
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,379
..a voice is just a voice.

214
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:14,480
Oh, good.
Dad, you're back.

215
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:18,129
Please step into our new
smart-closet prototype.

216
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:19,222
So you can yell at me

217
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,653
for bailing on the meeting
this morning?

218
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:22,024
Just... You'll see.

219
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:24,315
Oh.

220
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:26,293
May I help
choose an outfit for you?

221
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,636
'Cause I'm some old fossil

222
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:29,347
that still puts on a suit
to go to work?

223
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,551
- Let's start over.
- Why don't we?!

224
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:33,816
What level of comfort
are you looking for?

225
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:36,511
Same thing I've had
for the last 40 years...

226
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:38,105
A workplace
where you interact

227
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,941
with actual people
every once in a while,

228
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,371
like we're doing right now.

229
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,952
I used to love
sales calls.

230
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,430
Now we don't even
do them anymore.

231
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:45,953
I mean, put yourself
in myshoes.

232
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:47,293
Dress or casual?

233
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,965
Why do you sound like
Lauren Bacall?!

234
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:50,134
I don't understand.

235
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,611
Right, because now,
like everything,

236
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:53,439
my references are old
and out of step.

237
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:54,834
Why are you yelling?

238
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,395
If you don't get it by now,
you're never gonna get it!

239
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,715
Well, somebody'spanties
are in a bunch.

240
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,300
May I offer you
a different pair?

241
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:03,019
That's just weird.

242
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,757
Ooh! Very good.

243
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:11,457
I had an hour
to make 100 cupcakes

244
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:12,571
for my boss's son's party.

245
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:14,138
But it was all
gonna be worth it.

246
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:15,485
He was gonna be so grateful,

247
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,972
the next big promotion
would be mine.

248
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:19,881
You ungrateful monster!

249
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,386
Two sisters, two paths.

250
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,777
Graduation...

251
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,280
procreation.

252
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:27,158
The world on a string...

253
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:29,072
A baby and no ring.

254
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:32,145
Uh, you... you said
you were happy for me.

255
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,307
You said a baby would bring me
limitless joy.

256
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:35,464
And a limited bank account.

257
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,077
Now, Manny,
no one can doubt

258
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,900
the real-world value
of an art degree,

259
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,213
but talk a little bit
about the exciting social scene.

260
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,128
It's funny you ask.

261
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:43,711
I went to
a wine and cheese mixer

262
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:44,995
at the Dean's house
the other night.

263
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,486
He collects instruments
of indigenous people.

264
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:48,573
And by the time we killed

265
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,276
the last bit
of a chewy Zinfandel,

266
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:53,275
our jam sesh started to sound
more like a didgeri-don't.

267
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,226
Thank you.

268
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,596
Could I please
pipe in here?

269
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:58,728
Yes, please. Alex.

270
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:00,244
I genuinely appreciate

271
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,897
the opportunity
to come back here,

272
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:05,416
where I had the pleasure
of serving as co-valedictorian,

273
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,080
to offer a message of hope

274
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:11,260
to those oft-marginalized
overachievers out there.

275
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:15,494
I... see... you.

276
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,416
Well, I can't be the only one
with goose bumps in here.

277
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:19,775
Oh. Excuse me. Oh.

278
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,916
Yes, let's open it up
for questions.

279
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,331
Right here in the front row.
Go ahead.

280
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,643
I still don't get "whanex."

281
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,486
It sounds like my grandparents'
long-distance carrier in Oregon.

282
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:28,939
Okay, okay.

283
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:29,979
You know what?
I have to take this.

284
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:32,006
Uh, Luke, Haley,
talk a little bit about

285
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,852
how you still live at home
with your parents.

286
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,018
Hey, what's up?

287
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,502
I'm in the middle
of my thing.

288
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:38,604
Flip what I said before.

289
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,952
Start talking up
the dummies.

290
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,908
What?

291
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,815
<i>Um, I just got
a text from work.</i>

292
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:45,377
My boss gave that big case
to someone else!

293
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:46,799
<i>Meanwhile,
I'm still on the hook</i>

294
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,986
for these stupid cupcakes!

295
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:52,236
M-My heart is racing,
my... my hands are numb.

296
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:55,104
Plus, I-I think I have a case
of airborne diabetes!

297
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,775
Wait. Are you saying
I-I should...

298
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,018
Look, if those college
application numbers fall,

299
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:00,713
Principal Brown,
he gets fired.

300
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,088
Guess who's up next.
Principal Tucker.

301
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,104
I've never dared dream
of such a thing.

302
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,229
More money,

303
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,840
better parking space,

304
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,557
plus you get to pick
the prom theme.

305
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:13,346
I could finally make
my Enchanted Bayou a reality.

306
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,338
Okay, t-talk... talk soon.

307
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:16,909
What's great about art school

308
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:19,041
is that a lot of the faculty
work in the industry.

309
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:20,542
My film studies professor

310
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,895
has led tours
at every major studio.

311
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,684
All right,
thank you, Manny.

312
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,479
And for those of you
still awake,

313
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:28,354
I think what
we've learned here today is...

314
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,018
College, a dead end.

315
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,128
Okay, up next.

316
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,487
Philip, Gloria, and Joe.

317
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:39,503
Same setup.

318
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:40,869
Dad playing catch
with his son.

319
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:41,971
Mom laying out a picnic.

320
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,088
So, just real natural.

321
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:43,901
Like I'm not even here.

322
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:44,990
You got it.

323
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:49,487
Maybe not so sexy.

324
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:51,229
- My bad.
- He was talking to Mom.

325
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,551
You can just lay out the food
in a normal way.

326
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,900
Copy that.
No divas here.

327
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,569
Her head is doing
something weird.

328
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:00,699
Can we straighten that up?

329
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,876
Hang on, guys.

330
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,381
Why are they whispering?

331
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,061
You think I look
too young for you?

332
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,694
Why? Are my
crow's feet showing?

333
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,826
I knew makeup was going
too light on the concealer.

334
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:12,704
Guys, we're just
mixing and matching today,

335
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,811
so we're thinking about
swapping out one of you.

336
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,251
No, we're a team.

337
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:18,513
You get rid of one of us,
and you lose allof us.

338
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,178
- It's the kid.
- Okay.

339
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,412
I thought this was
supposed to be for Joe.

340
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,285
Well, obviously,
he's terrible at it,

341
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,881
so how is that gonna help him
with his self-esteem?

342
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,467
Hi, I'm Tyler.

343
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:31,365
Oh, this is not good.

344
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:32,673
Tyler, don't get too
comfortable.

345
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,202
I think we want to try
something different.

346
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:35,803
Hey, Sean,
could you step up here?

347
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,217
I'm so sorry, Phil.

348
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:38,811
No, we want to look
at two dads.

349
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,748
I can't play the kid.

350
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,062
Looks like you're out.
Here we go.

351
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:43,272
- Sean, was it?
- Yeah. Hey.

352
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:44,631
- How are you?
- Good.

353
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,436
Hmm. Not feeling
that chemistry.

354
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:48,483
Maybe we should kiss?

355
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,320
We could just wait for them
to tell us what to do.

356
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:52,912
Let's try Sean and a mom.

357
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:53,957
Move, Phil.

358
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,342
No, we meant Lydia.

359
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,820
All right, almost there.

360
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,812
Hey, Joe,
hop up here for me.

361
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:06,542
Yes!
That'sour family.

362
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:08,089
The new faces
of Glen Valley Mall.

363
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,394
Everyone else can go.
Thank you.

364
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,691
Nice working
with you guys.

365
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,706
I have an audition
across town.

366
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:17,368
- For what?
- Do they need grownups?

367
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:21,610
All right, we've heard
from our college-going sheep.

368
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:24,579
Now, Luke,
you wisely took a gap year,

369
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:27,859
got a job, made mad stacks,
and invested a little, correct?

370
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:28,954
Totally.

371
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,501
I own 300 microrubels,

372
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,610
a Russian cryptocurrency
I heard about on Facebook,

373
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,401
which currently,
you can only use

374
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,516
to buy a Chechen party drug
called Frankenstein.

375
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:39,040
Okay, Haley, uh...

376
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:41,852
hot boyfriend, job,
baby on the way...

377
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,148
You seem to have it all,

378
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:44,478
yet you took
a very different path

379
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,521
than your older sister,
Alex.

380
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:46,479
I'm younger!

381
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,734
Oh, wow. Okay.

382
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,523
I guess that's why they call
studying "the new smoking."

383
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:52,359
- No one says that.
- Can I add...

384
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,143
I'm sure you can, but it won't
help in the real world.

385
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:56,180
Anyway,
thank you all for coming.

386
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,229
Have a good afternoon.
Take care.

387
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,289
Cam, what the hell?

388
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,656
I learned a lot.

389
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:02,757
Tucker!

390
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,875
I wasn't picking up
a lot of Uber fares,

391
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:05,892
so I came back here early

392
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:07,673
and I heard the end
of your little presentation.

393
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:08,853
I know
what you're trying to do.

394
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,203
Hey, I just need to talk to him
for... for one second.

395
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,597
Hey, hey. Guess what.

396
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:15,289
I just dropped off the cupcakes
at my boss's house.

397
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:18,247
Turns out he... he didn't
give me the case I wanted

398
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,227
because he had
an even better one for me.

399
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,623
Really?
T-That's amazing.

400
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,900
And he didn't want me
to makecupcakes.

401
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,745
He just wanted me
to recommend a new caterer.

402
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,695
So we had
a big laugh about that.

403
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:30,711
But just goes to show,
don'tplay games.

404
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:32,181
Do your job,
and you'll be recognized.

405
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:33,271
Yeah, but you said...

406
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,398
No, ah! Forget what I said.

407
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:36,570
T-There's no one path
to success.

408
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,964
I mean, that'swhat you should
be telling these kids.

409
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,765
Yeah, that's what I was
going to tell these kids...

410
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,724
Damn it, Tucker!

411
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,641
I can't hold
my alpha power stance this long.

412
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,266
My calves
are starting to cramp.

413
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:48,117
- Okay, well, first of all...
- No, can it! Okay?

414
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,444
You thought
you could bury me

415
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,792
by killing
college applications,

416
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:51,977
didn't you? Hmm?

417
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:54,065
I will clean out my half
of the desk that I share.

418
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:55,328
Oh, no, it's...
I'm so sorry.

419
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:56,672
T-This is...
This is myfault.

420
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:58,898
I tried to play ball
at work.

421
00:13:58,984 --> 00:14:00,805
There was a lot
of unnecessary baking.

422
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:02,297
D... The point is,

423
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,781
I- I put these ideas
into his head, so...

424
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:05,741
Oh.

425
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,586
So you're so weak
and without conviction

426
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,939
that somebody suggests
some stupid idea to you

427
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,056
and without even thinking,

428
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,841
you just abandon
all your values

429
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,805
and fold like
a cheap Chinese fan, huh?

430
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,578
Yes, sir. I am a worm.

431
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:19,477
That is exactly
what I'm looking for.

432
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:20,859
No threat to me at all.

433
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,977
Well, congratulations, permanent
Vice Principal Tucker.

434
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:24,734
- Really?
- Yes.

435
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,914
Thank you!
I love you!

436
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,844
I love you, too.

437
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,150
Now, first order of business...
Fix what you did here.

438
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,195
You are gonna give me
a Golden Apple.

439
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:32,215
Hey, hey!

440
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,828
We are in
a committed relationship!

441
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,853
No, no, no. It's not the same thing
we saw at Pepper's bachelor party.

442
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:36,984
- It's not?
- No.

443
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,289
After fighting with everybody
all day,

444
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,808
I was starting to think maybe...
I was the jerk.

445
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,173
So I ended up back
at the old office,

446
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,562
you know,
trying to figure out

447
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,148
what it was about
going to work there

448
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,227
that I loved so much.

449
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,187
<i>Congratulations.</i>

450
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:57,477
<i>You've been hired at.</i>

451
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,976
<i>Pritchett's Closets,
Blinds, and Waterbeds.</i>

452
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:01,492
<i>I'm Jay Pritchett.</i>

453
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:02,719
<i>Welcome to the team.</i>

454
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:04,333
<i>You hear that?</i>

455
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:06,070
<i>They're cheering for you
already.</i>

456
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,016
<i>That's something
we value here... teamwork.</i>

457
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:11,152
<i>And whether you're in sales
or shipping</i>

458
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,694
<i>or one of those cute tomatoes
in the steno pool,</i>

459
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,077
<i>you're important,</i>

460
00:15:15,217 --> 00:15:16,780
<i>'cause we're family here.</i>

461
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:19,639
<i>Wait a minute!
Who's this new employee?</i>

462
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,624
<i>It's me...
Claire, Daddy.</i>

463
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,694
<i>Oh, right!
It's Claire!</i>

464
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:30,746
Nice hands.

465
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,538
Reminds me why our softball team
never won a game.

466
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,712
Look who they let out of
the fancy corporate office.

467
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:38,350
Hey, that wife of yours
get smart and leave you yet?

468
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,522
Eh, actually, she did.
It's been rough.

469
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,014
Oh.
I... We didn't know.

470
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,226
- Geez, I'm so sorry.
- Ah, you mutts,

471
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,163
I'm screwing with you!
Where's she going?

472
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,539
I knew my dad
was going through something,

473
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,583
and when I saw his car
at the old office,

474
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:54,367
I-I stopped by to check on him.

475
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,239
Are you feeling shy, Claire?

476
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:59,111
Uh... yeah,
I guess I am a little.

477
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:00,858
- Um...
- How old are you?

478
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,303
You're right.

479
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,788
Just come out and say it.

480
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:05,053
Um...

481
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:08,123
I'm worried that you're unhappy
we sold the company

482
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,335
and you're blaming it
on me.

483
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:10,506
You're making that face

484
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,131
like you have to go potty.

485
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,312
I'm anxious and...

486
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,077
How can you even
see my face?

487
00:16:16,163 --> 00:16:17,647
She's my daughter.

488
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,249
She thinks
she runs the place.

489
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:27,991
You said
he wouldn't do it.

490
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,592
You're damn right,
I did it.

491
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,194
Boss is still the best,
huh?

492
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:35,335
My dad was homesick.

493
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,939
That is
one photogenic butt, Jay.

494
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:41,186
Take it with you.
You can kiss it at home, too.

495
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:45,389
- Hey, guys. Hi.
- Hey!

496
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:46,231
Hi, Dad.

497
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:47,390
Hey, what are you
doing here?

498
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,467
I, uh, saw your car.

499
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:50,700
Look... uh...

500
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:52,819
I know you've been frustrated
at work lately.

501
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,215
Don't worry about that.

502
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:55,661
You're doing great,
though, huh?

503
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,686
Yeah, I kind of love it.

504
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:00,577
But it doesn't feel right
if you hate it.

505
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:03,107
Dad, we can bail
on the whole thing.

506
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,983
You know
what I need to bail on?

507
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:07,288
Being such a little peach.

508
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:08,553
- Hmm?
- What?

509
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:09,639
They bruise easily.

510
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:10,937
It could be an expression.
I don't know.

511
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,187
The point is, when I was here,
I reached out more.

512
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,398
I made videos
greeting people.

513
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,108
I built real relationships.

514
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:19,608
Those three guys...
I knew two of their names.

515
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,577
I think maybe I need to try
to be a little bit more like you

516
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:24,475
and give this new thing
a chance.

517
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,797
You know, they're not so bad
when you get past the...

518
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,710
The hipster beards
and the sweaty handshakes.

519
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,643
Tell me about
that printer guy, Eduardo.

520
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:33,481
What the hell
is 3-D printing anyway?

521
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:34,944
Look at you trying.

522
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,053
Oh, Dad!

523
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,608
Okay, 3-D printing is
when you take three lasers

524
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:40,920
and you can scan
any object you want.

525
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,875
You... You want to 3-D print
your butt, don't you?

526
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,441
We want them to like me,
don't we?

527
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:45,874
Ohh...

528
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,577
Okay, baby,
have fun at your play date.

529
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:49,952
I'll pick you up
in two hours.

530
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,241
Can you believe
I'm a model now?

531
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:55,014
Crazy world.

532
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,756
- See you, buddy.
- Bye, baby.

533
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,928
Bye, Mom!

534
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:00,286
Gosh, I'm so happy
for that kid.

535
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,683
Yeah, we keep saying that.

536
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,030
I feel, uh, silly
I got so invested in modeling

537
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,303
for some mall poster
no one's ever gonna see.

538
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,850
You want to feel better?

539
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:11,342
I'll show you something

540
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:13,928
that is gonna make me look
more pathetic than you do.

541
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:16,093
I think I said "silly,"
but, um...

542
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:17,483
yeah, okay.

543
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,772
That was me
20 years ago.

544
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:24,920
That's amazing.

545
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,738
But what are you
so upset about?

546
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:28,652
You're just as beautiful now
as you were then.

547
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:30,678
Aww. I know.

548
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:32,741
It's just that it was
a time in my life

549
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:38,155
where I was out there hustling,
modeling, driving a taxi,

550
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:41,441
selling bacon-wrapped hot dogs
outside a nightclub.

551
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,183
Seeing them taking it down

552
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,301
made me feel like
that version of me

553
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:47,949
is gone forever.

554
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,269
So that's why you wanted
to start modeling again.

555
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:53,884
I just miss being passionate
about something again.

556
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,207
The way that you feel passionate
about real estate.

557
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,621
- Mm.
- You always seem, like,

558
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:01,285
so alive, making new deals,
meeting new people.

559
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:04,590
Have you ever thought
about becoming a Realtor?

560
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,176
- Who hasn't?
- That's true.

561
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:09,902
I bought a book one time
to learn how to do it,

562
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,644
but you know how it is.

563
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,519
Sometimes in life,
you just get stuck.

564
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:17,058
I think you'd be great at it.
Really.

565
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,572
I'd buy anything
from you.

566
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,169
I'm thinking about getting
my chompers bleached,

567
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:21,559
and there's only
half of you up there.

568
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,269
- Really?
- Yeah.

569
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,979
It can be scary
to ask yourself what's next.

570
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,654
All the doubts
start to creep in.

571
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:32,605
Are people
going to like me?

572
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,340
Ooh, still hot.

573
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:35,511
Thank you!

574
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,722
I throw a tractor tire
around the backyard

575
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:39,202
a couple days a week.

576
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:42,582
Can I handle the challenge?

577
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,550
Dude.

578
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,730
You can ask these
questions forever,

579
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,455
or you can just
take the first step.

580
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:57,746
Here is your five-point
checklist for any open house.

581
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:59,246
Number one...

582
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,144
Sorry, professor.

583
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:09,261
Phil, honey.
What are you doing here?

584
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:10,778
Hey,
I thought I'd surprise you

585
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:11,847
and take you out to dinner.

586
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:12,840
Ooh!

587
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,910
Spontaneous.
You know I like that.

588
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:17,222
Well, um, let me just make sure
everybody's gone.

589
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:18,160
I'll grab my bag
and lock up.

590
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:19,292
Awesome.

591
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,597
May I help you
with your clothes?

592
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,863
Ooh.

593
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,386
I guess we are
the only ones here.

594
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:32,144
Perhaps we'll
start with the pants.

595
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,332
Wow.

596
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,285
Normally,
you like a little...

597
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,527
slow shirt unbuttoning,

598
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:40,818
but I guess we...
are cutting to the chase.

599
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:43,937
Dad, are you still looking
for a place

600
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:44,912
to leave that butt?

601
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:45,701
It's so gross.

602
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,818
There's nothing better
for office camaraderie

603
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,052
than a practical joke.

604
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:50,677
It lifts people's spirits.

605
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:51,810
Mm.

606
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:57,341
Well played.

607
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:58,904

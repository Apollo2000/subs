1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,294
Previously on Black Lightning...

2
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,655
Anissa came by with a
box of Alvin's research.

3
00:00:03,657 --> 00:00:05,256
I didn't have a chance
to look through it,

4
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:08,351
but I did come across some pretty
advanced biochemical formulas.

5
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:10,794
Dr. Lynn Stewart is highly capable.

6
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:13,464
And she's been doing
research that's off-limits.

7
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,200
It's either her or you.
You understand that?

8
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:18,770
If I kill Lady Eve without
the Shadow Board's permission,

9
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:20,872
I might as well bury myself with her.

10
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:22,473
Not necessarily.

11
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,546
Evelyn Stillwater-Ferguson
was killed by electrocution,

12
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:28,016
making Black Lightning
their prime suspect.

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,652
Latavious, that is enough!

14
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,648
You know my damn name!

15
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:42,195
Do you believe in the
Resurrection, Latavious?

16
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,356
Anissa?

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,343
You can't afford to lose your head.

18
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:54,572
That's when people get hurt.

19
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:57,142
Then train me. Show me how to do this.

20
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:58,183
You're clearly not ready.

21
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:01,080
Eventually, she will go back out
there, whether we like it or not.

22
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:03,109
Training her is the right thing to do.

23
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:06,352
And our search for Black Lightning

24
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:08,586
has expanded to include
another five officers.

25
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:11,921
Freeland PD won't rest until Lady
Eve's murderer is brought to justice.

26
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:14,293
She was a good woman, did a lot for us.

27
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,928
I told people when Black
Lightning came back,

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,331
all he's doing is beating
up on young black men.

29
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,343
Now he's out here killing black women?

30
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,609
What's next? Little kids and babies?

31
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,438
Why you think he
hiding behind that mask?

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,839
'Cause he know he trippin', man.

33
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:29,070
Like, I understand
fighting The Hundred...

34
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,464
but Lady Eve?

35
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,666
That's wrong, man.

36
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:34,013
I got you, old man.

37
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,171
Yeah.

38
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:38,373
Urban mix.

39
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:56,302
I don't see him as no damn hero.

40
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,938
He's worse than these
crooked-ass police in Freeland.

41
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,342
I feel like wherever he
was before he came back,

42
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:04,710
that's where he should've stayed.

43
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:11,517
Freeze.

44
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:12,852
Freeze?

45
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:17,857
He might be racist,
but he wasn't a threat.

46
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:21,109
And you probably broke his ankle
and maybe gave him a concussion.

47
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:22,295
The flag on the T-shirt.

48
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:23,563
No, I know why it happened.

49
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,570
You looked and you
assumed he was a threat,

50
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,934
so you didn't actually
see that he wasn't.

51
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:34,173
Look, our goal is to
stop crime and violence

52
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:38,309
with no harm to civilians, even if...

53
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:41,013
we don't appreciate their worldview.

54
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,115
You...

55
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,105
You can't be reactive,

56
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,976
going around smashing
whatever statues you feel like.

57
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,678
Picking fights with punks from Garfield.

58
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:56,875
No. You have to be in control.

59
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:57,984
Every minute.

60
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,921
I'm not perfect, nobody is.

61
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,783
All right, you ready?

62
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,218
Brace yourself.

63
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,252
Hold your breath.

64
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,456
This attempt at framing
me, you know what it proves?

65
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,824
I'm getting under someone's skin.

66
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm guessing it's about Green Light.

67
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,094
Mmm-hmm.

68
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,241
And we are getting close
to shutting it down.

69
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:23,502
And since the police
will be looking for me...

70
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,803
What... Hey.

71
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,304
You can't be startled.

72
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,562
Ever.

73
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:30,541
You have to see into the
shadows, look around corners,

74
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:35,215
because if you breathe
at the wrong time,

75
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,748
you die.

76
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,117
Got it?

77
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,852
Yeah, I got it.

78
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:46,158
All right, well, since the
police are looking for me,

79
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm sure with a shoot-to-kill mentality,

80
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,762
so we have to clear Black Lightning

81
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,107
before I can get back in the suit.

82
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:55,133
- Okay.
- Okay, first training mission,

83
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,136
we find whoever killed Lady Eve.

84
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,038
Now you listen to me,
do whatever I tell you,

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,073
and hopefully you will
learn a few things.

86
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,011
- You ready?
- Yep. Ready.

87
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,778
Urban crowd.

Hey, no, man, nobody
invited you up in our...

107
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,684
Oh.

108
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:57,963
What's up, boss?

109
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:01,186
We was just using the stage because...

110
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,036
Nobody was.

111
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,405
Ever since that shootout,
Tobias ain't been around,

112
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,308
- so we weren't sure if we was...
- That sounded good.

113
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,822
And that's what's up.

114
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,649
Where you been at, Lala?

115
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,353
They told us you wasn't coming back.

116
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,880
Who's "they"?

117
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:24,416
There were rumors.

118
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,662
"Rumors"?

119
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,684
Yeah, like, you were in jail or...

120
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:36,020
Or what?

121
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,380
That you were dead.

122
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:45,035
"Dead"?

123
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,382
Yeah, I think I was.

124
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,683
Damn.

125
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,415
Play that song again.

126
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,057

130

I regret not killing Black
Lightning the minute he returned.

131
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,395
It was the logical choice
based on what we knew.

132
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,294
And now Lady Eve is dead.

133
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:40,832
We can't be sure he killed her.

134
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,134
She and her bodyguards
were fried with electricity.

135
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,497
What other proof do you need?

136
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,804
Someone could have set him up.

137
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,606
- Who would do that?
- I don't know, I just...

138
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,492
I value your counsel,
Peter, and I usually

139
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:52,711
appreciate your measured approach,

140
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,212
not today.

141
00:06:54,214 --> 00:07:00,185
He was a nuisance, now he's a
danger to me, to you, to the ASA.

142
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,255
I've put a price on his black ass.

143
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,757
That's a mistake, Martin.

144
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,493
If we catch him, who knows how
he could advance our understanding

145
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,861
of enhanced human abilities?

146
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:10,962
We should just wait...

147
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,764
ASA's dissected enough metas.

148
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,433
One more isn't going to
help us create our own.

149
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,345
Lady Eve was the liaison
between us and The One Hundred.

150
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:21,139
She got Green Light on the streets
faster than anyone in the country.

151
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,895
Her murder sets the
Freeland experiment back.

152
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:25,631
Yes, that's true,

153
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:27,512
but there's no harm in making sure

154
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,645
that killing Black Lightning is the
right thing to do before we do it.

155
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,988
I don't like power I don't control.

156
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,623
When Black Lightning returned,

157
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,259
you said you would figure out
who he was and take care of him.

158
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,293
You didn't,

159
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,562
so I'm bringing ASA operatives into town

160
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,631
to kill him, plain and simple.

161
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,739
Give me any information you have
that will help them track him down.

162
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:51,836
- Martin...
- I'm sick of this neighborhood, Peter.

163
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,340
They don't take care of
it, the food is all fried.

164
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,409
The only thing the people here
are good for is experimentation.

165
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,144
They should be happy we're here.

166
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,047
Green Light will give their
lives purpose, direction.

167
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,247
We're doing God's work, Peter.

168
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,750
God's work.

169
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,960
Jennifer already eat?

170
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,896
No, I don't think so.

171
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,898
She's upstairs moping.

172
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,048
I told her that

173
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,101
until she finds an appropriate
after-school activity,

174
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:35,071
she'd have to do an unpaid
internship at my lab.

175
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:36,240
Ouch.

176
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,308
Well, I figured cleaning
up after the break-in

177
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,709
might drive her back to track.

178
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,178
Yeah, or teach her how
to pick up after herself.

179
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,713
I'd settle for that one.

180
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:44,915
Yeah.

181
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,000
How was training?

182
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:53,189
It's good.

183
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:57,027
It's okay that I asked, right?

184
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,664
And there's no code that
says a mother can't know

185
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,666
how her daughter's
doing with her powers.

186
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,946
No, no. Look, I know...

187
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,616
I know how hard this is for you.

188
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,471
A million times worse than watching
our kids learn how to ride bikes.

189
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,759
Scraped foreheads I can handle,

190
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:14,110
but the thought that she might not...

191
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:15,812
No. Uh-uh, uh-uh.

192
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:18,148
No catastrophic thoughts.

193
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,050
Hmm?

194
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,185
Besides, she is really
taking it seriously.

195
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,056
'Cause she wants an A or because
she thinks it's important?

196
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,226
Well, I think because she knows

197
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,062
I won't let her go out
with me if she doesn't.

198
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,894
Look, right now, I'm just trying to help

199
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:37,767
her understand that
she's not invincible,

200
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,111
so she doesn't hurt
herself or someone else.

201
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:44,706
You know Anissa's problem,
it's the same as it always is.

202
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,592
She reacts, usually
from an emotional place,

203
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,512
without thinking about the consequences.

204
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:51,681
- Do you remember in second grade...
- Hmm.

205
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,083
When she got suspended...

206
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,451
- Oh.
- For kicking her teacher

207
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,553
'cause she thought he
made her friend cry?

208
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,456
Yes. Oh, yes.

209
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:02,870
Yeah.

210
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,298
The stakes are different now.

211
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,101
How do you train someone
to be what they're not?

212
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:14,938
She has her mother's brains.

213
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,676
It won't take her long to realize
that if she wants to change the world,

214
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:21,444
she has to change herself.

215
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:32,255
Why can't Kam help us?

216
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,392
Because Kam has a PhD and better things

217
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:36,528
to do than clean up after the break-in.

218
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:40,232
Okay, well, you have a PhD and an MD.

219
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:43,202
That's true. Maybe I should
let you do it yourself.

220
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:44,407
That's not what I meant.

221
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,701
No, I know what you meant.

222
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,181
What you meant is this is boring

223
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:49,350
and you'd rather be
doing something else.

224
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,134
Right. That's... That's what I meant.

225
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:53,109
Look, just because you
dropped your activities

226
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,404
does not mean your father and I

227
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:57,653
are going to let you spend all your
free time texting with your friends.

228
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,084
So, what's up with Dad and Anissa?

229
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,865
- What do you mean?
- You haven't noticed?

230
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:08,291
They've been acting really
weird, at least around me.

231
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,803
They were mad at each other,
and wouldn't tell me why.

232
00:11:10,806 --> 00:11:13,038
And now it seems like they're 98 and

233
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,333
two, but sharing some kind of secret.

234
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:17,684
Something's going on.

235
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,069
Look, everything's fine.

236
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,638
Families go through stuff. It's normal.

237
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:26,282
Wait, did... did you see
any old papers in here?

238
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,484
No.

239
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,788
On yellow legal pages?
They were kinda crumpled.

240
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,649
Still no.

241
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,383
They're all gone.

242
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:35,718
What's gone?

243
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:37,520
Uh...

244
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:40,090
I have to pick something up.

245
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,891
You're free to go home.

246
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:43,993
Yes.

247
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:46,229
Oh, um...

248
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,631
Can I hang up posters
with Kiesha at the school?

249
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,196
Yeah, but then go home.

250
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,103
Um, it'll be sort of late.

251
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,605
- Okay.
- Okay.

252
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,217
Okay, what are you hoping to find?

253
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:09,819
I don't know.

254
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,422
But the police have already
cleaned up the crime scene,

255
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:15,091
and Gambi said the official
report is short on details,

256
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:16,493
so Lady Eve's body

257
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,390
is the only evidence we
have to look at right now.

258
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,130
Which doesn't mean this is a good idea.

259
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,146
Look, you said the building was empty

260
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,135
and you picked a route that would
keep us off camera surveillance, so...

261
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,537
I did say those things,
but I just meant in general.

262
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,053
I heard a rumor that there's a big

263
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:32,008
reward out for Black
Lightning's capture.

264
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,438
Oh, yes, this is the perfect time
to give me that bit of information.

265
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:37,443
Who's putting up the money?

266
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:39,449
I don't know.

267
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:42,185
We're at the janitor's closet. Now what?

268
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:45,155
The spot you want is just
ahead, below the vent.

269
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,860
Okay.

270
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,764
And this is where Gambi says
is the best place to break in.

271
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,966
All right.

272
00:12:58,103 --> 00:12:59,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

273
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:02,772
How much force do you need?

274
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,977
Uh... enough to get through the wall.

275
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,046
And how much is that?

276
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,650
I don't know.

277
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:17,353
Tap it with your finger.

278
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:21,368
Okay.

279
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:26,850
Okay.

280
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,798
Clearly, that wasn't it.

281
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:31,734
Whatever you think.

282
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:48,638
Okay, maybe I could've
used a little less.

283
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,186
You think?

284
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,908
Twins?

285
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,779
All right, let's see.

286
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,618
- A-ha!
- Yeah?

287
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,319
Looks like they'll pick her up tomorrow.

288
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,887
Good thing we came tonight.

289
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:28,424
Oh.

290
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:34,631
All right, Gambi, you seeing this?

291
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,400
Yeah, I got it.

292
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:38,701
Pick up her arm.

293
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,136
Her arm?

294
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,538
Gently.

295
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,741
Go on.

296
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:47,674
When you work with cadavers in school,

297
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,188
do you ever think about who they were?

298
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,113
No.

299
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:54,217
Yeah, well, she had a life, family.

300
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:57,654
You know, yesterday, she might
have been making a grocery list,

301
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:58,988
planning a family get-together,

302
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,375
and then someone killed her,
for whatever their reasons,

303
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,951
not caring about who would be left

304
00:15:02,954 --> 00:15:04,794
behind to mourn the loss of her passing.

305
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,367
And even if you do care,

306
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,203
people are gonna die just the same

307
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,533
if you don't learn to
modulate your powers.

308
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,902
More importantly, your
mother, Jennifer and myself

309
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:14,476
will mourn the loss if you get killed

310
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,706
- because you weren't vigilant.
- Jefferson.

311
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,775
So you need to stay
woke, and as always...

312
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,376
- Jefferson.
- What?

313
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,046
Oh... If she had been
killed by a lightning strike

314
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,881
or a Black Lightning strike,

315
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,450
Dad, there'd be a tree
pattern on her skin.

316
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:32,055
What she said. It's called
Lichtenberg scarring.

317
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,010
It's a fractal pattern that occurs

318
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:36,609
when electricity passes
through an insulating material.

319
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:40,863
This is more of a burn, like it
was caused by a high-voltage flash.

320
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,166
So this was caused by
some kind of a weapon?

321
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:44,300
I believe so.

322
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:45,702
Black Lightning's never killed anyone,

323
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:47,503
so I understand how the
coroner wouldn't know

324
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,305
what kind of wound
pattern he might create.

325
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:51,708
How much power would a
weapon like this take?

326
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,377
A billion joules.

327
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,314
Well, how would you do
that in something portable?

328
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,351
With nuclear power.

329
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,617
You can track radiation, right?

330
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,657
Which means we might be able to
find the weapon that killed her?

331
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,298
Yes.

332
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,767
Okay, we're done here.

333
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,823
Um...

334
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:17,166
All right, brains, not brawn.

335
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:19,436
Good job, Anissa. Let's go.

336
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:32,504
Hey.

337
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:33,635
We are closed.

338
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:34,965
Please. It's important.

339
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:36,601
I can't accept any samples.

340
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:39,613
Well, I'm here for a report on
something I dropped off a few days ago.

341
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,429
We had a break-in.

342
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:42,765
- What?
- Yeah.

343
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,198
Got some equipment stolen,
a whole bunch of samples.

344
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:46,668
They screwed up our computers.

345
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,238
Cops think it was junkies looking
for drugs and stuff to sell.

346
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,739
We just started notifying people,

347
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:53,975
but I might not have what you came for.

348
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:56,144
Can you check to see if
my sample was affected?

349
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,972
- Yeah.
- It's for Doctor Lynn Stewart.

350
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,036
It was a powder.

351
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,006
I asked you to do an
X-ray crystallography.

352
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:07,488
Yeah, it looks like your sample
was one of the ones taken,

353
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,992
and the results file was corrupted
when they trashed our computers.

354
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:12,226
You must have a backup.

355
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:14,519
Partitioned on the same
drive. I'm really sorry.

356
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:15,576
There must be a printout.

357
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,066
I always print a hard copy when
I'm double-checking my results.

358
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:20,868
These guys made a real
mess. It could take...

359
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,404
What?

360
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,773
We've had someone on maternity
leave for the last month.

361
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,408
I'm really behind.

362
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,978
Maybe there's a copy in
the "to-be-filed" folder.

363
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,512
Oh, could you check? Please.

364
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:33,247
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

365
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:39,121
You know, I'm not one to judge a
person's extracurricular activities,

366
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,190
but I don't know how you ended
up with student government.

367
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,625
Whoever controls the money
controls the school, so...

368
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,427
Oh, so, this is a power play?

369
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:49,285
Yeah. Just like your mama
making you work in her lab.

370
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:51,599
Nah, she's just worried
I won't get into Harvard

371
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,762
if I'm sitting around texting you.

372
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:55,737
- Oh, That's cute.
- Ah, thank you.

373
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,338
Wait, you're applying to Harvard?

374
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,691
Not the point.

375
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:00,972
Okay.

376
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,643
Send it to me.

377
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:03,845
Okay.

378
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,047
Ooh.

379
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:10,304
Hey, what you doing?

380
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:13,053
I'm gonna put one up here
so nobody takes it down.

381
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,389
No, Kiesha, that's dumb.

382
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,590
Get down before you kill yourself.

383
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:17,301
Getting kidnapped made you so emo.

384
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,726
Getting kidnapped didn't make
me emo. You're making me emo.

385
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:20,995
Kiesha, I'm serious.

386
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,330
Oh, my God.

387
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,308
That's really unsafe,
you need to get down.

388
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:29,149
I'm serious.

389
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:31,722
Kiesha, please.

390
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:32,974
Kiesha!

391
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,408
Okay, I'm fine.

392
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:54,529
Damn, girl, you dropped your phone.

393
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,734
Yeah, scared you were
gonna break your neck.

394
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,970
Ah, no. Hey, now you got
an excuse to get a new one.

395
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm thinking maybe I
should change my slogan.

396
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:08,810
"I bounce, so our class
money won't have to."

397
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:36,504
So, now that you're
back, what's your plan?

398
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,408
I don't know yet.

399
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,044
The man without a plan.

400
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:45,880
You know word on the street
is you're dead, right?

401
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:48,316
And that one's trying to take your spot.

402
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:51,052
Ain't nobody can take my spot.

403
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,954
Dead or alive.

404
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:04,139
I can't believe you letting
these dudes drive you home.

405
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,869
You do understand they'll
know where you live, right?

406
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,370
They cool.

407
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,973
How can you know that for sure?

408
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:14,041
You killed me for putting
a camera in your face.

409
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:17,245
I told you to take your ass home.

410
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:19,614
So when they come for you,
you going to kill them, too?

411
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:21,082
I don't know yet.

412
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:22,449
I might.

413
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:24,819
But they won't come for me.

414
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:27,672
Nah. I don't think you should wait.

415
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:29,241
I don't trust them.

416
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:31,592
Especially that one.

417
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:34,128
You definitely should
kill him right now.

418
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,463
Kill my dude?

419
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:36,831
Yeah.

420
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:41,068
He's driving the car. You want to crash?

421
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:45,406
LaWanda, you crazy.

422
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,608
I'm good.

423
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,977
I'm just saying, people turn.

424
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:51,479
I said I'm good.

425
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,983
Everything cool, Lala?

426
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:02,747
Yeah.

427
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,271
So, this satellite tracks radiation?

428
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,274
- Yes.
- Everywhere in the world?

429
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:14,926
The two of you continuing this
investigation is a bad idea,

430
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,571
even if you're not dressed as
Black Lightning and Thunder.

431
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:19,373
We have to clear Black Lightning's name.

432
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,708
- Yes.
- I agree,

433
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,976
but please, let me do it.

434
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:24,445
If you get caught digging
into Lady Eve's murder,

435
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:27,281
someone could put two and two
together and realize who you are.

436
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,983
Then I will make sure
that doesn't happen.

437
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:30,585
Yes, let's go then.

438
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:33,654
Yo, wait. Wait. When you power up,
are you susceptible to radiation?

439
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,969
I don't know.

440
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:38,129
- Chemicals?
- I don't know.

441
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,465
Okay, what about water?

442
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,594
Are you like a witch? Do
you sink or can you swim?

443
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,698
- I don't know.
- You don't know a lot.

444
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,368
What are you waiting for?

445
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:50,404
You, to come to your senses.

446
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:56,517
Wait, that's Lady Eve being killed.

447
00:21:58,406 --> 00:22:01,790
Oh, that's Hampton Woods.
What are they doing out there?

448
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,985
I don't know. But please,
let me go check it out.

449
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:05,720
You're not putting me in any danger.

450
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:07,922
There's no bounty on me, and
I can take care of myself.

451
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:10,113
No, I need to train Anissa, Gambi.

452
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:11,926
Besides, I can take care of myself, too.

453
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,562
So, unless you can tell me a
reason why this is more dangerous

454
00:22:14,564 --> 00:22:16,998
than all the other crazy things
you let me do over the years...

455
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,399
I'm just trying to help you.

456
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,935
Which I appreciate, but I can handle it.

457
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:27,141
You're just so damn stubborn, Jefferson.

458
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:28,342
Gambi!

459
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:18,176
Dad, you know how I
feel about the woods.

460
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,856
No. Black people die in the woods.

461
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:24,326
Yes, in horror movies,

462
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:27,329
but only after the monster
kills the white nerd.

463
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:30,298
And we don't have one of
those with us, so you're good.

464
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,559
Okay.

465
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:33,609
Wait, hold on.

466
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,105
- Hey, Lynn.
- Hi.

467
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:42,794
I found something disturbing,
I guess is the right word.

468
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,996
Are you okay?

469
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,203
I'm fine.

470
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,285
That sample Anissa brought over
from your father's investigation,

471
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:51,273
I analyzed it, and it's a vaccine.

472
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:52,842
A vaccine?

473
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:54,311
- For what?
- I'm not sure.

474
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,780
But what I am sure about is
the components of the vaccine

475
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:59,750
are the same active
ingredients in Green Light.

476
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:03,420
Wait, the sample Anissa
found was from 1986.

477
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:06,523
Are you saying someone's been
working on Green Light for 30 years?

478
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:07,824
It looks like it.

479
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:14,064
Okay, well, if we figure
out who produced the vaccine,

480
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,333
then maybe we can find
out who's behind all this.

481
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:17,247
Well, I tried,

482
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,918
but I've struck out with my pool
of doctors and health officials.

483
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,838
Thirty years is a long time ago.

484
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,807
You know what, talk to Gambi.

485
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,676
He's been in Freeland almost as long.

486
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:29,346
He may not know anything, but he'll
know someone who knows something.

487
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,437
- And, Lynn?
- Yeah?

488
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,017
Please be careful.

489
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:36,286
Of course.

490
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:53,470
♪ Come, Thou fount
Of every blessing ♪

491
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:58,809
♪ Tune my heart To sing Thy grace ♪

492
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:04,448
♪ Streams of mercy
Never ceasing... ♪

493
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,882
Mr. Gambi?

494
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:08,852
Mrs. Johnson.

495
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:10,253
How was your daughter's wedding?

496
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,222
Oh, she was beautiful.

497
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:13,757
And so was I, thanks to you.

498
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,262
Is there anything I can do for you?

499
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:23,233
It's a beautiful song.

500
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:27,571
♪ I'm fixed upon it ♪

501
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:30,240
♪ Mount of Thy redeeming love ♪

502
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,575
That it is.

503
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,946
Although it's never been
one that's made me cry.

504
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,682
Do you believe it's true?

505
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:42,118
That the good Lord delivers
us from our troubles?

506
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:43,186
Yes.

507
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:44,388
I do.

508
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,057
He expects us to do our part,

509
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,257
but I believe He's there to
help us over the finish line,

510
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,630
though sometimes, what we want

511
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:57,601
and what we need are not the same thing.

512
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,539
I see the wisdom in that.

513
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,976
You will be in my prayers, Mr. Gambi.

514
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:07,818
You will be in my prayers.

515
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:10,106
Thank you, Mrs. Johnson.

516
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:14,251
♪ Rescue me from danger ♪

517
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:19,589
♪ Interposed His precious blood ♪

518
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:21,758
So, once you realized you had powers,

519
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,132
how long until you decided
to become Black Lightning?

520
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:26,395
Uh, I did a few things here and there,

521
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:30,434
but it took me a while before
I committed and got the suit.

522
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:32,179
Why'd you stop all those years?

523
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:35,504
That's complicated.

524
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:36,540
Mom, right?

525
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,559
That's between me and her.

526
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,110
- Which is a "yes."
- Yeah.

527
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,332
But an "ask your mother" yes.

528
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:43,947
So, who trained you?

529
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:45,934
- Gambi. Fighting and tactics.
- Oh.

530
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,695
Even before I knew I had powers.

531
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:49,317
And why is so he mad at you right now?

532
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,621
No, no. He's not mad. He's worried.

533
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:54,424
That's how he gets when I
don't do what he wants me to.

534
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:56,793
Sarcastic Italian, that's
how he shows his love.

535
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,132
Wait, hold on. It should
be right around here.

536
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:03,734
Right there.

537
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,328
I guess we can be
grateful for the second

538
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:21,920
rule of high-profile assassinations.

539
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,388
Always kill the killer.

540
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,967
Okay. What now?

541
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:34,068
I call Henderson.

542
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,069
This is evidence.

543
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,004
Black Lightning doesn't get exonerated

544
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:40,608
unless Freeland PD conducts an
investigation and clears him.

545
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,218
Whoa, you call him on that?

546
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:46,047
I mean, was carrying a tin can
attached to a string too bulky?

547
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:50,239
This is current technology.

548
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:51,919
Okay.

549
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,287
Let me see that.

550
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,218
Yo, Henderson.

551
00:27:57,221 --> 00:27:59,494
You got a pencil and paper?

552
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:06,033
Hampton Woods,
coordinates 33, 47, 84, 43.

553
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,404
You'll find a shallow grave, a body,

554
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:12,940
and the weapon that
actually killed Lady Eve.

555
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:16,177
Heyo, tell the morgue to hold the
body so you can match the wound.

556
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,038
You're welcome.

557
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,906
I know you didn't say thank you.

558
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:22,116
It's implied in your
loud-ass questions.

559
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,955
Does he know you're Black Lightning?

560
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,507
No. That would put him
in an impossible position.

561
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,594
Yeah, because of that lame cell phone.

562
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:45,072
Okay.

563
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:38,796
I'll be right there.

564
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,663
Gambi, it's Lynn.

565
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,295
Take your time.

566
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:44,665
I was hoping you could
help me with something.

567
00:29:56,273 --> 00:29:58,145
I, uh...

568
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:01,449
I hope your help
involves the silk damask

569
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,819
because my supplier accidentally
left me two bolts of it.

570
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:06,355
I'm afraid not.

571
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:09,456
Yeah. Well, then let's pray purple
suits come back into fashion.

572
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,359
What do you need?

573
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:16,230
Well, I've been doing some analysis
of a vaccine from 30 years ago.

574
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,566
That's a long time ago.
Why the interest now?

575
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,203
Well, I just got the sample.

576
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:22,175
It was in a box of research for a series

577
00:30:22,178 --> 00:30:23,906
of articles that Alvin was writing.

578
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,624
Alvin Pierce?

579
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,879
Yeah.

580
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:34,649
Turns out that the vaccine's
related to Green Light.

581
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:36,951
But I want to know where it came from.

582
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,382
Problem is, it's so old,

583
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:41,084
there's no information about the
drug company that developed it.

584
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,355
Do you remember a doctor
or a clinic director

585
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,234
who was working in the
community back then?

586
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:46,249
No.

587
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:48,095
Well, a vaccine has to
be government-approved.

588
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,563
Did you have any contacts that maybe

589
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:51,432
- might be able to answer...
- Lynn.

590
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:55,636
I can't talk about this.

591
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:04,111
Thirty years ago.

592
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:08,983
You moved here around the time
the vaccine came to Freeland.

593
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,721
You never talk about
your life before Freeland.

594
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:16,824
- No.
- You never wanted to share anything.

595
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:20,794
We assumed you had your reasons.

596
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,797
- I did.
- Gambi,

597
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:26,648
Jefferson trusts you.

598
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,469
I know.

599
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:33,052
I think...

600
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,378
I think it's time for me
to have a talk with him.

601
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:44,452
Excuse me, Lynn.

602
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:53,260
Okay, I've finally realized the
most important part of a stakeout.

603
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,763
Go to the bathroom first?

604
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:57,732
Uh, that would have helped a lot more

605
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:01,235
than all of your "you're
going to die" talk.

606
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:06,903
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

607
00:32:06,906 --> 00:32:08,977
Dad. There's somebody over there.

608
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:14,081
Wait, wait, wait. That's not right.

609
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:15,717
What's not?

610
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,198
Well, Henderson would have sent

611
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,153
uniformed officers to secure the scene,

612
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:23,050
a crime scene unit, not a
lone person in street clothes.

613
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:24,819
Okay, well, then who is he?

614
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,038
Freeland PD is full of dirty cops.

615
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:31,632
So, I'm guessing someone must've

616
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:34,235
intercepted Henderson's
dispatch and sent him first.

617
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,254
All right, stay here.

618
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:39,673
- Stay here? Dad, I should go with you.
- No, no. Stay here.

619
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:41,809
- I'm just going to see what he's doing.
- I...

620
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:44,044
I can disable him from
a distance if I have to.

621
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,479
Stay here.

622
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:10,624
Wait.

623
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,279
- Dad!
- I told you...

624
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:33,327
Dad, I could tell he didn't know
that those weapons were dangerous.

625
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:37,898
Whoever sent him, they
thought he was expendable.

626
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,300
He just didn't know.

627
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:53,636
I spent all this time

628
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:56,706
telling her she had to
anticipate danger or she'd die,

629
00:33:56,708 --> 00:34:00,176
and then I failed to anticipate
danger and almost get myself killed.

630
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:04,513
She has to understand her powers,
and I can help her with that.

631
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:05,942
Mmm.

632
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:08,150
But I was trying to change her.

633
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:12,121
Her understanding of people,
her desire to protect.

634
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:16,659
No, no, no. I have to be very
careful not to screw that.

635
00:34:16,661 --> 00:34:19,059
Not just because she saved my life.

636
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:20,963
She saved my life.

637
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:25,635
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

638
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:29,238
I'm... rambling. Endorphins.

639
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:34,844
Are you waiting for Jennifer?

640
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:37,747
No.

641
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:42,852
You got your sad eyes.

642
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,887
What's going on?

643
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:48,858
I went to see Gambi, like you suggested,

644
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,487
to see if he could help me
find the source of that vaccine.

645
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,689
Yeah.

646
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:57,273
It turns out, he knows
more than I thought.

647
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:01,322
What do you mean?

648
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:05,942
Jefferson, you need to talk to Gambi.

649
00:35:05,944 --> 00:35:09,211
Ask him the questions we've never asked.

650
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,256
To find out who he is...
and where he came from.

651
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,800
What did he tell you?

652
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:21,958
Just... go talk to Gambi.

653
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:39,241
I have so many questions.

654
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:41,077
If I was dead, then how did I die?

655
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:51,146
How did I come back?

656
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:58,227
Why did I come back?

657
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:04,900
I know, baby. I know.

658
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:09,861
But it's all going to be okay.

659
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:11,133
Lynn said I needed to talk to you.

660
00:37:18,243 --> 00:37:22,489
I was just... trying to protect you.

661
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,747
Protect me from what?

662
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:26,215
All these years...

663
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:30,086
I've kept secrets from you.

664
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:32,822
I had to.

665
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:38,227
But now the only way to protect
you is to tell you the truth,

666
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:39,898
tell you everything.

667
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:41,634
What are you talking about?

668
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:46,869
My real name is Peter Esposito.

669
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,839
Thirty years ago, I came to Freeland

670
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:53,375
as an agent for a government
organization called the ASA.

671
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:55,544
They were conducting an
experiment in Freeland,

672
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,781
giving the people a
vaccine to make them passive

673
00:37:58,784 --> 00:38:00,583
and keep them docile

674
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:03,219
in what was a very
politically-explosive environment.

675
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:08,239
But their vaccine inadvertently
created metahumans.

676
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,825
People with special powers.

677
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:13,062
And it was my job to find them.

678
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:18,434
But when I realized that the ASA's
vaccine was killing children...

679
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,016
I leaked the information...

680
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:27,226
to your father...

681
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:30,954
and his investigation got him killed.

682
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,201
Murdered.

683
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:41,910
My father... was murdered.

684
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:43,718
Yes, he was.

685
00:38:46,164 --> 00:38:50,032
And you turned me into Black Lightning?

686
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:51,233
No.

687
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,337
I know it doesn't make
what I've done better,

688
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:57,606
but I had nothing to
do with that experiment.

689
00:38:57,608 --> 00:39:00,762
As soon as I realized
that you had powers,

690
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:02,278
Alvin's kid,

691
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:05,145
I knew I could never let them get you.

692
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:11,293
And so all these years, I've tried
to protect you the best I could.

693
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:13,722
- But now...
- But now, what?

694
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,359
I can't anymore.

695
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,497
Martin Proctor...

696
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,973
the head of the ASA for this area,

697
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:28,270
is looking for you,
and I can't stop him.

698
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:33,531
If you use your powers or you go
out in the suit, he will find you,

699
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:35,446
and they will kill you.

700
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:42,518
And they will find Anissa...
and they will kill her, too.

701
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,402
I'm sorry, Jefferson, but you
have to stop being Black Lightning.

702
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:47,004
Stay away from me.

703
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:51,794
Stay away from me.

704
00:39:52,697 --> 00:39:54,430
Stay away from my family.

705
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:03,362
Must be here.

706
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,275
Ah, Jen, whatever it is,
I don't have time for it.

707
00:40:13,217 --> 00:40:14,383
Are you pregnant?

708
00:40:15,486 --> 00:40:19,135
No. No, but something weird
is definitely going on.

709
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:20,470
Okay.

710
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,426
What? You broke your phone?

711
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:26,362
No, Anissa, look at the edges.

712
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:27,881
I did that.

713
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,033
With my hands.

714
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:39,729

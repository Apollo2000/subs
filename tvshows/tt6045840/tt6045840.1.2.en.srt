the sink in my bathroom?

You what?

00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:46,452
Yeah. The other night.

So I get up to pee,

and I have some kind of... panic attack.

318
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:57,530
So, I grabbed the sink to
brace myself, and it just...

I don't know, it just crumbled
in my hands, like it was nothing.

1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,877
Previously on Black Lightning...

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,140
The purpose of Black
Lightning was to kill Tobias

3
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:09,078
for literally shoving my father's
articles down his throat until he died.

4
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:11,163
Uncle Gambi discovered the
bodies of a bunch of kids

5
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,366
who disappeared 30 years ago.

6
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,192
He thought they were
dead, but they're alive,

7
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:16,194
and they're kept in some
kind of suspended state.

8
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:28,939
He's dead, you idiot!

9
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:31,243
What about "alive"
didn't you understand?

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,746
Dad. Dad, wake up.

11
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,385
I'm gonna cloak this place against

12
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:43,121
all surveillance,
satellite, you name it.

13
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:44,664
You just need to stay inside.

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,960
_

15
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:51,997
I wish I could come to
work with you every day.

16
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,532
I bet.

17
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:56,134
But as soon as these fools
stop tearing up the city

18
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:59,731
and your school reopens,
you're going back to class.

19
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:03,341
"The future belongs to those
who prepare for it today."

20
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,539
Malcolm X.

21
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,514
Hey, go wait in the car, son.

22
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,416
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,549
All you were supposed to do

24
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:20,223
was blow the whistle on human
experimentation in Freeland.

25
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:22,894
Instead, you exposed
corruption, Al. You named names.

26
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,029
- Good!
- No, no!

27
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:25,263
Tobias Whale's been indicted.

28
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,965
His corrupt ass needs to get indicted.

29
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,733
You're playing with fire here, man.

30
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:32,037
The last thing you need to be doing
right now is pushing for another story.

31
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,806
But my editor killed it. But
you know that already, don't you?

32
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:38,343
Take my advice and leave this
alone. Think about your son.

33
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:40,278
I am thinking about my son.

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,981
I had Jefferson take that damn
vaccine, and it was tainted.

35
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:45,150
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

36
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:47,085
There's no reason to get
yourself killed over it.

37
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,325
No! There's no reason for
you to get yourself killed.

38
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:52,791
All the reason I need in the world
is sitting in that car over there.

39
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,457
More violence on day three of the riots

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,281
after the shooting of unarmed
Andre Carter by Freeland police.

41
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:52,017
Residents are advised to stay home.

42
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,352
I've owned this store for over 20 years.

43
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,421
Now, I don't condone riots,

44
00:02:56,423 --> 00:03:00,585
but they didn't have to shoot that
boy like that. He was running away.

45
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:12,764
I got one.

46
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:15,040
Need a little help out here!

47
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,310
Stop resisting!

48
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,476
Fever of 105 and irregular heartbeat.

49
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,512
Is this normal after defibrillation?

50
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:20,839
- Or did I...
- You saved his life.

51
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:21,940
That's what you did.

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,046
What's going on?

53
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,583
He's got a short circuit in his powers.

54
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:32,884
It's compromising his nervous system.

55
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:34,352
Okay, okay. Well, we need
to get him to the hospital.

56
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,221
We can't. The ASA is looking for us.

57
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,590
So is Lady Eve's old cartel, and
not to mention The One Hundred.

58
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:41,493
He'll make it. I know he will.

59
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,953

60
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,598
Hey.

61
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:11,774
Are you all right?

62
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:13,544
Sure.

63
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,340
I'm a freak from a family of freaks,

64
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:19,843
and my dad's got one foot
in the grave. I'm fine.

65
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,511
Well...

66
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,014
when you say it like that.

67
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,817
All right, not funny. Sorry.

68
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,588
Who were those people with Khalil?

69
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,125
Are they like us? Meta-humans?

70
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,060
Not exactly.

71
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:40,302
Meta-humans have organic powers,

72
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,299
which means they come from within.

73
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,566
Theirs are artificial.

74
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:45,835
That albino man, he's their leader.

75
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,871
His name is Tobias Whale.

76
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:51,775
He takes a kind of a serum
which is like a super steroid.

77
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:55,278
It makes him age slower
and get stronger over time.

78
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,081
At this point, he's got
the strength of three men.

79
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,449
My guess

80
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:01,489
is he's the one who
turned your ex-boyfriend.

81
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:02,724
Why?

82
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,554
It's what he does.

83
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:09,292
That man has a gift for seeing the
worst in people and bringing it out.

84
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,863
That spooky-looking woman
with him, she's called Syonide.

85
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,966
She was found in a dumpster
when she was an infant,

86
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,232
with her umbilical cord
wrapped around her neck.

87
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,430
Oh, my God!

88
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:22,154
Tobias pulled her out of an orphanage
when she was eight years old.

89
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,207
She was malnourished and abused.

90
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:26,643
He clothed her and he fed her.

91
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:30,036
And he trained her
to become an assassin.

92
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,274
When she was fully grown,

93
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:34,443
he had carbon-fiber body
armor implanted under her skin.

94
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:39,422
And if she wasn't crazy before that
procedure, the pain did the rest.

95
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:43,259
What did they do to Khalil?

96
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:45,795
I'm not altogether sure.

97
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,365
But it looks like he's gotten an implant

98
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,467
with a synthetic liquid metal.

99
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,369
It's bracing his spine,

100
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,070
but it's also causing Khalil's body

101
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,539
to produce a neurotoxin
like a snake's venom.

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,289
It causes instant paralysis,

103
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:02,961
so they weaponized him by giving
him darts as a delivery method.

104
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,931
They made him into a weapon, but...

105
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,366
he's not like that.

106
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,588
Yes, he is.

107
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,557
That young man had a
choice, and he made it.

108
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,028
He is with Tobias Whale,
the worst of the worst.

109
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,738
Sweetheart, whatever you may remember,

110
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:24,633
he is not your Khalil anymore.

111
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:31,906
If you wanna stay out here for
a while, okay. I'm going back in.

112
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,123
Mr. Tobias, I'm sorry.

113
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,260
I know you said not to
kill Black Lightning. I...

114
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,762
I... I... I couldn't help it.

115
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,232
So this is what, an apology?

116
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,568
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,263
Sy, what do you think?

118
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,606
Should we accept Painkiller's apology?

119
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:08,111
Good question. I have one too.

120
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,815
Can you put a dart in me before
I shoot you full of holes?

121
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,783
I know the answer to that one.

122
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,689
Have a seat.

123
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:25,929
"I am unlike other men.

124
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:29,466
The laws of convention and
morality do not apply to me."

125
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,404
That's Napoleon. And he
was a weak-ass Frenchman.

126
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,758
You're Painkiller.

127
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,995
Never apologize.

128
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,480
So you killed Black Lightning
when Proctor wanted him alive?

129
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,286
I'm not mad.

130
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:48,435
Martin Proctor was down with Lady Eve.

131
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:51,287
I always knew sooner
or later he had to go.

132
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:55,265
Just gonna have to
be sooner, that's all.

133
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:57,427
Real soon.

134
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,181
Okay. Who's got 'em?

135
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,968
We don't have them, sir.

136
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,541
The only lead we could find to Tobias
is a street thug who works for him.

137
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,024
Goes by the name of Lala.

138
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,146
Really? That's it?

139
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,782
A black drug dealer with a rap sheet?

140
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:22,852
That's a rare find. This
the best you all could do?

141
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,529
At the moment, sir.

142
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,891
And the warehouse called.

143
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,058
Putting the pods there
taxed the power grid.

144
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,226
There's been a brownout.

145
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:32,564
The backup generator
kicked in after 60 seconds,

146
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,734
but the pods from
stage-one are failing.

147
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:38,560
Actually, the pods are okay,
but the subjects inside are...

148
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:40,003
How long?

149
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,296
Ten hours.

150
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,475
Unless we can get a DNA
sample from a meta-human

151
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:47,911
with stable DNA to
rewrite the bad DNA from.

152
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:50,613
In ten hours, I could
be back to square one?

153
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:54,232
We'll still have the four stage-two
subjects, sir. As of now, they're stable.

154
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:56,753
Four? Four subjects?

155
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:58,855
Forget an army, that's not
enough for a study group.

156
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,796
Everybody, stop working!

157
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,547
I know you all think I'm a hard-ass.

158
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:28,566
I'm a hard-ass because
this is a hard world.

159
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:34,130
And now, we've got people running
around with superhuman powers.

160
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,928
They are bioweapons, and we have to
have more of 'em than anyone else.

161
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,114
It is up to us to make damn sure

162
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,958
that if the American
flag gets any redder,

163
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,755
it's with the blood of
our enemies, and not ours.

164
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:52,029
Find Black Lightning's body
and this meta-human girl.

165
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:54,649
We're confiscating the DNA we need.

166
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:58,867
And let's find this Lala,
see if he knows anything.

167
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,853
Let's make America great again.

168
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,659
Failure is not an option.

169
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:17,000
So you've known Dad the
whole time he's had powers?

170
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:19,375
I knew about his powers before he did.

171
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,216
You see, kids from the first
experiment who got powers

172
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:25,782
usually had a flare before
their powers actually manifested.

173
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,944
What was Dad's?

174
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:29,846
Oh, he... he had two.

175
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:34,771
First, he instinctively
shocked a couple of riot cops

176
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:36,586
who were trying to whale on him.

177
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:37,954
Then he got up and ran away,

178
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,757
straight into an electrical
fence that should've killed him,

179
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,294
but he absorbed the energy
without even meaning to.

180
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:46,229
So why didn't you tell him what he was?

181
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:49,297
Well, it wouldn't have done him any
good to know until it was a reality.

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,841
It actually took him 15
years to fully manifest.

183
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,685
And that's when he decided
to become Black Lightning?

184
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:57,521
No.

185
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:00,643
He made that choice when he saw
that Freeland was losing hope,

186
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,266
and he knew he could provide it.

187
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,959
Okay, we are literally walking down
memory lane, and this isn't helping us.

188
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:09,263
I need to go out there and find
Martin Proctor before he finds us.

189
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,591
Anissa, we are safe here.

190
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:13,482
This whole property is
shielded against surveillance.

191
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:15,552
And right now there are
satellites looking for us,

192
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:18,003
listening stations trying to
pick up our communications,

193
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:20,068
maybe even drones we can't see.

194
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:23,966
Sweetheart, you are
the strongest among us.

195
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:26,870
The best place for you
is right here with us.

196
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:31,708
Come on.

197
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,680
Yesterday, I felt this
coldness in my stomach,

198
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,867
and I'd never felt it before.

199
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:55,765
And somehow I knew it was death.

200
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:04,040
And now I realize it was the
exact moment that you flatlined.

201
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,782
We have a connection.

202
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:17,399
I need you to find that connection

203
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,125
and follow it back to me.

204
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,061
Please.

205
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,269
Please.

206
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,143
Lala.

207
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,985
I know you're thinking,

208
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,499
"Why is this funny-looking
Negro always messing with me?"

209
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:48,251
I love it though.

210
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:50,646
Something about your
velour tracksuit-wearing ass

211
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,588
I just like dragging.

212
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,624
Anyway...

213
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:02,999
Now, that's what they mean
when they say "levelin' up."

214
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,543
Ah!

215
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:16,312
- You hit like a bitch.
- Mmm.

216
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:19,110
The Devil deals the cards.

217
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:26,455
That's a corny-ass line too.

218
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,124
But it's effective.

219
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,462
I took your life in order to
make my purpose your purpose.

220
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,974
I spent a cool mil on
your reanimation program.

221
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,169
It's time for you to pay that back.

222
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:46,809
Is LaWanda... and Will alive too?

223
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:47,927
No.

224
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,012
Just side effects of the reanimation.

225
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:54,771
Eventually everyone you killed is
gonna come back to haunt your black ass.

226
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:58,721
Tattooin' themselves on your
body until there's no skin left.

227
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:02,458
"Tattoo-man."

228
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:06,360
It's time to get back to work.

229
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,985
Suspended, Jefferson?

230
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:23,973
Haven't I told you that education is
the power they can't take away from you?

231
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:25,509
He started it.

232
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:27,645
Oh, but you finished it, right?

233
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:28,746
Except you didn't.

234
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:30,211
Sit down.

235
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:33,416
Because you got suspended, and he
didn't, 'cause you broke his nose.

236
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,880
You think that's the end of it
from him or one of his friends?

237
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,275
I'm not scared of them.

238
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,791
An eye-for-an-eye mentality
doesn't solve anything, son.

239
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,682
Just makes the whole world blind.

240
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:45,830
So, what I'm supposed to do?

241
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,496
Just let him hit me and not do nothing?

242
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:53,470
Listen, whose life is this?

243
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:54,438
Mine's.

244
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,085
And what're you gonna do with it?

245
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,555
- Live it by any means necessary.
- Mmm-mmm.

246
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,416
Speak up, son. What are
you gonna do with it?

247
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,005
Live it by any means necessary.

248
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:04,407
Exactly.

249
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,918
I love you, son.

250
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,087
Love you too, Dad.

251
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:12,599
I gotta get back to work.

252
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:15,059
- Read the Constitution.
- The whole thing?

253
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,393
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:18,796
Oh, you're not gonna sit around
here all day and watch TV.

255
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:20,798
I'll quiz you at dinner.

256
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:31,127
Jeff?

257
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,588
- Jeff.
- What happened?

258
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,112
His nervous system is shutting down.

259
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:36,174
Mom...

260
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:37,414
Is he gonna be okay?

261
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:47,258
I told them not to bring me here.

262
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:50,761
I'm sure you did.

263
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,797
Where's Tobias Whale?

264
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:57,935
I wanna tell you, but...

265
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,476
But I can't.

266
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:07,770
Then why ask to speak to me?
You're wasting my time, boy.

267
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,514
Cuffs hurt. They too tight.

268
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:13,498
Don't try to tell me you
people aren't used to those.

269
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:15,334
Where's Tobias Whale?

270
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:31,902
This idiot's got det cord in his mouth!

271
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,407
A bomb mule.

272
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:38,175
Albino son of a bitch is smart.

273
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:40,844
He knew we could find Lala but
not him, so he booby-trapped him.

274
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:43,247
Focus on Gambi and the meta-humans.

275
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:44,432
That has the clock on it.

276
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:46,635
We'll kill Tobias Whale when we're done.

277
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:53,489
- Oh, my God.
- How bad is it?

278
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:55,957
His vitals are dropping through
the floor. We're losing him.

279
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,393
Daddy.

280
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:58,929
Jeff?

281
00:17:58,931 --> 00:17:59,997
Jeff.

282
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:07,471
Jefferson!

283
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,220
Dad?

284
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:26,590
Come on, sit down.

285
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,175
When Tobias came...

286
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:51,448
I should've... I should've helped you.

287
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:56,135
You did help me, by
doing what you were told.

288
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,765
Oh, but I always wanted to tell you...

289
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:06,156
I'm so sorry.

290
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,032
There's nothing to be sorry for, son.

291
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:10,701
Black Lightning?

292
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:15,239
All the violence?

293
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,308
Peace ain't always peaceful, son.

294
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:22,854
All the blood, broken
bones, pain you suffered...

295
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,683
only you'll ever know it was worth it.

296
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:31,822
Was it worth it for you?

297
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,125
Your death?

298
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:40,531
I don't know.

299
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,652
What I do know... is that
I'm proud of you, son.

300
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:52,843
And I apologize for leaving you.

301
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:01,585
I love you, Dad.

302
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,523
I love you too, son.

303
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,828
But you can't stay here.

304
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,132
Go handle your business.

305
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,118
Everybody, he's awake!

306
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:13,381
Daddy!

307
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,726
It's about time.

308
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:17,060
Dad, how do you feel?

309
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,429
Take it easy, Jeff. Take it easy.

310
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:38,594
My powers...

311
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:41,952
I can't feel them.

312
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:45,622
My powers are gone.

313
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:58,547
We did a search of power company files,

314
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,724
looking for a surge in energy output
right after the attack on Garfield.

315
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:03,657
Got a hit. It was Freeland.

316
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,944
Let me see it.

317
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:11,568
I can't. It, uh... it won't come up.

318
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,005
That's because it's cloaked from
satellite imaging. That has to be it.

319
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,074
We are a go! Full tactical!

320
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:18,341
Yes, sir!

321
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:21,278
I've got your ass now, Peter.

322
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:10,327
So, Lala never came out
of the ASA headquarters.

323
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:13,013
We can't tell if he exploded, either.

324
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,645
But some heavy tactical
is rolling out of there.

325
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:20,370
Find out where they're going.

326
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:38,054
Your vital signs are back to normal.

327
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:40,891
Will I get my powers back?

328
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:42,602
I don't know.

329
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:44,727
What happens when you
drain a car battery?

330
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:48,797
Well, it gets to a point where
it no longer holds a charge.

331
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:52,029
My perimeter sensors are lighting up.

332
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:53,565
They've found us.

333
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,541
Damn.

334
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,211
Anissa and Gambi can't
do this by themselves.

335
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:24,256
Go, go, go!

336
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,732
We're looking at 20 crack
operatives, combat spread.

337
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:29,568
They're gonna breach attack from
the front and back simultaneously.

338
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,803
Okay, so how do we stop 'em?

339
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:31,915
We can't.

340
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:34,943
These guys are every bit as good as
Delta Force and SEALs, maybe better.

341
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:37,881
And they're gonna be equipped with
special weapons to deal with Thunder.

342
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:39,783
Our best option is to retreat.

343
00:24:39,785 --> 00:24:42,430
Oh, Uncle Gambi, I'm not running away.

344
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,687
Then your mom, dad, and sister will die.

345
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,456
Okay, this is too much.

346
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,058
- Jen. Jen.
- I'm telling you, this is too much.

347
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,626
- Jen, we're good.
- Did you hear what he just said?

348
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:50,860
- All right. Listen to me!
- I don't wanna die!

349
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:52,062
Jen, listen!

350
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:53,204
Listen!

351
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:56,634
I'm gonna go out the front and
I'll engage them before they hit us.

352
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:59,345
At the same time, Anissa,

353
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:01,438
you make a hole in that wall.

354
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:05,875
I'll lay down suppressive fire.
You thunderclap left and right.

355
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:07,314
That'll shock them
enough to give your mom,

356
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:08,979
sis, and dad time to make for the woods.

357
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:10,696
- Got it.
- Okay.

358
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:13,582
I'm in their comms, so we're
gonna know what they're up to.

359
00:25:13,585 --> 00:25:14,884
Bravo team set.

360
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,186
We are go. Wait for command...

361
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:17,520
- Okay.
- Jen, Jen...

362
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:19,089
Listen, listen. There's
an emergency tunnel

363
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:22,092
under a forked tree ten yards
into the brush. All right?

364
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,526
There's a palm reader

365
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:25,929
on the manhole that'll open for
any of you, but not for them.

366
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:29,432
At the end of the tunnel, there's a
road where the van will be waiting.

367
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:31,579
Okay? Is everybody ready?

368
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:32,736
We're ready.

369
00:25:32,738 --> 00:25:34,070
All right.

370
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:38,314
Can you light this thing
up without me powering it?

371
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:39,743
Sure.

372
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,211
Okay, new plan.

373
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:43,103
I go out the front and draw their fire.

374
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:46,489
Anissa takes them out, you
lead my family to the tunnel.

375
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:50,219
Wait. But without your powers, how
can you do that and make it back?

376
00:25:50,222 --> 00:25:51,521
The suit's bulletproof.

377
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,123
But your head's not.

378
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:57,994
It's gonna be okay.

379
00:25:57,996 --> 00:25:59,296
Jeff...

380
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:07,871
Be careful.

381
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:09,306
Take care of them.

382
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:10,640
I got you.

383
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,583
This is suicide, Jeff.

384
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:23,087
Light me up, old man.

385
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,000
Jen...

386
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:41,334
- Jen. Jennifer!
- Mom, don't get close.

387
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:43,006
Jen!

388
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:44,774
Jennifer?

389
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,146
Jen!

390
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:54,984
Dad!

391
00:26:57,676 --> 00:27:00,056
No, Jennifer, that's
enough! You're trembling!

392
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:01,925
No! More.

393
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,198
Jennifer!

394
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:10,403
Jen, you good?

395
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:11,901
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What?

396
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:13,336
I'm fine. I'm okay. I
just need to sit down.

397
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,338
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Be
careful. Take your time.

398
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,773
I'm okay. I just need to sit down.

399
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:19,075
- Be careful. Careful, careful.
- Okay.

400
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:20,176
Are you okay?

401
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,745
Yeah, I'm fine.

402
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:24,668
She's okay.

403
00:27:27,452 --> 00:27:28,518
I'm okay, Mom.

404
00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:39,362
Now, you are making a habit
of saving my life, young lady.

405
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,472
Well, this is... this is what we do.

406
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:47,841
Jeff.

407
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:55,210
Even if you win, the ASA
isn't gonna disappear.

408
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:57,680
If they think there's some
kind of meta-human arms race,

409
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,661
they are gonna keep coming after you.

410
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:02,318
Your best option would be to take off,

411
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,366
make a life somewhere with your family.

412
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,168
Whoa, and turn our back on the people?

413
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,595
On Freeland?

414
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,692
Let them make us leave?

415
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:11,461
Nuh-uh, they don't know us.

416
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,033
I'll help in any way I can.

417
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:21,779
So that's it, then.

418
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,315
High-low tactics.

419
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,051
Let's do this.

420
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:34,595
This is team leader Alpha.
All fire teams in position.

421
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:36,595
You are go, team leader.

422
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:40,510
Visual's dark, I'm moving up.

423
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:42,279
Advancing.

424
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:44,848
Got eyes on location.

425
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,143
Team leader Alpha.

426
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,858
We are not prepped for Black
Lightning. Request permission to abort.

427
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:21,040
Denied!

428
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:23,786
They came out of the house to
protect whatever or whoever's in it.

429
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:26,295
Take out Thunder and get in there.

430
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,301
- Buy me some leverage.
- Copy that.

431
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:29,503
What are you doing?

432
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,769
They're coming after us.

433
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:34,743
Give me one of those.

434
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:36,500
Give it to me.

435
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,251
What?

436
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:43,239
I grew up hunting with my dad.

437
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:46,376
Now let's end this, 'cause
I want my damn life back!

438
00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:49,446
Talk to me.

439
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:52,281
Major firefight in North Freeland.

440
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:54,148
- A military team...
- Mmm.

441
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:56,584
Up against Black Lightning and Thunder.

442
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,456
That black son of a bitch
keeps rising from the dead.

443
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,324
But this time, it's good for me.

444
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,260
Proctor's best are all committed.

445
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:05,862
Our best are right here.
Let's bring the party to him.

446
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,855
Sir, multiple shots
fired, multiple perps.

447
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,470
We got a war going
down in North Freeland.

448
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:19,276
Scramble SWAT. I want everybody
with a badge in the car.

449
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,933
Fall back! Fall back!

450
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:02,422
Meta-human known as
Thunder has been packaged.

451
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:03,725
Reel her in.

452
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:16,321
Bravo team ready for breach.

453
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,643
Mom!

454
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:19,417
Damn it!

455
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:24,456
Uh, sir, Freeland PD is on an
intercept with our firefight.

456
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,857
Three minutes out.

457
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,227
You're not helping, Klovic!

458
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:30,728
Damn it!

459
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,864
Abort! Abort assault!

460
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:35,434
Secure the stage-two
pods for relocation.

461
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:37,469
Send the operatives'
coordinates to the warehouse

462
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:41,139
where they will secure the stage-two
pods and provide escort for relocation.

463
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:42,340
Where, sir?

464
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:44,409
Above your clearance, Klovic!

465
00:32:44,411 --> 00:32:46,010
I'll advise on site.

466
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:54,119
Breach mode, everybody! Breach mode!

467
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:30,588
Sir! I'm hailing all of our agents,

468
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,956
but getting nothing but dead air.

469
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,116
Burn the hard drives.

470
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,218
With me.

471
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:46,304
Go, go, go, go, go!

472
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,019
Sir...

473
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:05,490
Proctor. Proctor! Proctor!

474
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:18,542
Where's tactical?

475
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,732
Um...

476
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,167
They couldn't make it.

477
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,107
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

478
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,142
You're not going anywhere.

479
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:34,946
So...

480
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:39,099
Family affair?

481
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,921
I knew it was you.

482
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:47,492
Yeah, and that's gonna be a problem.

483
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:49,129
I am a federal agent.

484
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:53,097
You will bring the weight of the United
States government down on your heads.

485
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:55,770
That's bull.

486
00:35:55,773 --> 00:35:58,201
I suspected when you didn't
call in reinforcements

487
00:35:58,204 --> 00:35:59,837
after your Green Light lab was destroyed

488
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,308
that this was a... rogue operation,

489
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,777
which means we're not
up against the ASA.

490
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:08,246
We're just up against you.

491
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:12,705
Thank political correctness.
It's ruining the country.

492
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:15,987
The first Freeland experiment
killed a lot of kids!

493
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:18,122
And you thought it was a
good idea to do a sequel?

494
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:21,025
They would've wound up on
welfare or in prison, anyway.

495
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:22,460
Wow.

496
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:29,741
Jennifer!

497
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:40,243
Oh, man! That was
beautiful, little girl.

498
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:42,313
- Is that right? You want some more?
- Jennifer.

499
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:46,184
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Listen to me for one second.

500
00:36:46,186 --> 00:36:48,753
Most of them are dying.

501
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:50,379
I can fix 'em.

502
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:54,125
You wanna save your
people? Let's make a deal.

503
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:58,629
All I need is a sample of
stable meta-human genetics.

504
00:36:58,631 --> 00:36:59,723
Yours.

505
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:02,866
You want to save Freeland. I
want to make America great again.

506
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:04,335
The ASA will back me up,

507
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:09,107
especially when I give
'em the 411 on the Pierces.

508
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:12,455
I'll get a blank check and
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

509
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:16,914
So, either we deal or I come back
and kill each and every one of you.

510
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,549
You're a monster.

511
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:20,752
That's funny coming from you, Peter.

512
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:22,120
You're right.

513
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:29,826
I am a monster.

514
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:32,245
And he is not gonna hurt any more kids.

515
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:36,857
You all take care of the pods,
I'll take care of the trash.

516
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,441
None of them are stable.

517
00:37:44,444 --> 00:37:46,110
Okay, how do we get them out the pods?

518
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,713
If you open the pods, they will die.
They're too unstable from all the...

519
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:50,848
How do we get them out?

520
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,251
I... The briefcase.

521
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:54,719
I need the briefcase.

522
00:37:58,124 --> 00:37:59,624
Never mind.

523
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:01,845
I know someone that can help them.

524
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:04,856
People are always calling
black folk paranoid.

525
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,955
We always paranoid until
the truth comes out.

526
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:10,501
They had them children for 30
years, and that wasn't enough?

527
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:14,587
- They came back to get more?
- Damn. Bye, Felicia.

528
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:19,076
This all ended with Black Lightning
and Thunder, not the police.

529
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,145
That should tell you
something right there, right?

530
00:38:21,147 --> 00:38:23,400
The government put crack in the ghettos,

531
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:26,567
they gave heroin to the white
folks in the rural areas,

532
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,482
then they came back and
put Green Light in Freeland.

533
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:33,498
And I know 'cause my son got caught
up in taking that Green Light.

534
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:36,661
They gonna put something
else somewhere else.

535
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:39,341
This is their MO. Ain't nothing new.

536
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:42,233
The people of Freeland have
a right to a full explanation

537
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:43,835
of what happened in this city.

538
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:47,205
Hard questions are being
asked of the US government.

539
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:48,873
And, in the meantime,

540
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:52,811
although we do not condone
acts of vigilantism,

541
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:58,282
the people of Freeland and this
department owe a great debt of thanks

542
00:38:58,284 --> 00:39:02,977
to so-called Black
Lightning and Thunder.

543
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:35,152
They call us heroes, but
the real heroes are you,

544
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:38,689
the people who, despite the
everyday struggles of life,

545
00:39:38,691 --> 00:39:41,592
continue to find hope,
meaning, and purpose

546
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:43,694
in what can be a challenging world.

547
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:06,717
We've been given a gift,
a blessing from God,

548
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:10,895
and we intend to use it to
protect this city and its people.

549
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:16,928
From our man in the coroner's office...

550
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,529
Hmm.

551
00:40:18,531 --> 00:40:19,864
Proctor's thumbs.

552
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:39,884
You...

553
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:43,854
Shut up!

554
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:46,440
You better hope this works.

555
00:41:08,781 --> 00:41:10,348
Mmm.

556
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,071
Well, damn!

557
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:18,235
Thank the man.

558
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:19,522
No!

559
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,540
Sy, baby,

560
00:41:26,543 --> 00:41:29,423
you're looking at the king of Freeland.

561
00:41:29,426 --> 00:41:31,435
Long live the king.

562
00:41:31,437 --> 00:41:33,104
First order of business,

563
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:35,992
ripping the damn light
out of Black Lightning.

564
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:39,859

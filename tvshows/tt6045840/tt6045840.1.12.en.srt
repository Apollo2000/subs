1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,127
Previously on Black Lightning...

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:06,800
Black Lightning's the reason
you're lying here paralyzed.

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:09,804
If you'd like, I can show
you how to kill your pain.

4
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:12,273
- Maybe we should take a break.
- Until what?

5
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:13,351
I walk?

6
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:14,664
You slippin', Lala.

7
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,683
You walking around here
talking to yourself.

8
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,286
Man, we all see you.

9
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,023
Anybody else think I
ain't built for this?

10
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:24,167
Uncle Gambi discovered the
bodies of a bunch of kids

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,469
who disappeared 30 years ago.

12
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:27,161
He thought they were
dead, but they're alive,

13
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:28,963
and they're kept in some
kind of suspended state.

14
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:30,968
No, they were here.

15
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:34,562
Some large objects were
dragged out the door.

16
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:36,312
Are they all stable after the move?

17
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:39,328
Thank you for my latest addition.

18
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,911
I don't wanna have powers.
I don't wanna save the world.

19
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,687
You're just like Dad.

20
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,376
You gotta be kidding me.

21
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:51,048
Tobias!

22
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,265
Tori!

23
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:56,508
Stay with me.

24
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,180
We're glad to have you back, Mr. Whale.

25
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:45,690
How are you feeling?

26
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:50,433
Recovered from your injuries,
I see. They were pretty bad.

27
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:53,052
Black Lightning really
tried to barbecue you, huh?

28
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,429
You people.

29
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:59,612
I appreciate the excellent
medical care you provided.

30
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:04,011
You're important to us, especially
now that Lady Eve is gone.

31
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,472
Her death is a tragedy to everyone.

32
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,007
Yes.

33
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:11,878
And now there's a vacancy.

34
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:15,885
How much do you know
about her operations?

35
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:18,089
Well, let's just say she
helped the citizens of Freeland

36
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:21,420
find happiness by muting the
pain of their deprivation.

37
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:24,724
Is that what drug
dealers tell themselves?

38
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,881
You and I have never
worked together directly,

39
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:32,364
so being cautious with
my words seemed wise.

40
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:38,871
Years ago, in a very

41
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:43,342
racially and
politically-charged environment,

42
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,211
we developed a chemical
we hoped would make

43
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:48,214
the citizens of Freeland docile,

44
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:52,862
so we could, for lack of a
better word, control them.

45
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,187
It didn't work.

46
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,261
Instead, it gave some of
them meta-human abilities.

47
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:06,364
- A side effect with strategic implications.
- Hmm.

48
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,167
Yeah. Meaning in a dangerous situation,

49
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,870
a few local folks fight and die,

50
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:14,840
saving the lives of
some fancy white boys.

51
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:17,343
Only, it turns out,

52
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:21,881
all our subjects began dying
before they were fully operational.

53
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:24,684
Some flaw in the syrup.

54
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:28,087
We kept working at it and...

55
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:29,522
You created Green Light.

56
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,237
The users I saw had super
strength, high pain tolerance,

57
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,939
no flight instinct.

58
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,898
And if that doesn't say Marine...

59
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:43,011
Our yields are higher now than
they were with the vaccine,

60
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,271
but the survival rate is no better.

61
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:49,875
So I need you to find Black Lightning.

62
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:52,612
Excuse me?

63
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:56,983
I have come to believe he
is a product of the vaccine.

64
00:03:56,985 --> 00:04:00,418
And yet, he lives,

65
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:01,581
has lived.

66
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,191
I need him for research purposes,

67
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:07,928
before all of my subjects
die and the experiment fails.

68
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:13,032
So bring him to me.

69
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:16,881
- Alive.
- Hmm.

70
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:20,473
And you're going to need some help.

71
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:25,711
I finished the project you were
working on before you got hurt.

72
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,394
Hello, Khalil.

73
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:43,529
Mr. Whale.

74
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:58,665
Alive, Mr. Whale!

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,249
I need Black Lightning alive!

76
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:09,534
- Hey. Yeah.
- Jeff?

77
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,223
I need your help.

78
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:12,458
Everything okay?

79
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,779
- Yeah. Just come over, please.
- Okay.

80
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,175
Hello?

81
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:28,240
Everything... okay?

82
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,542
Yeah.

83
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:34,613
I just came out of the
shower, and there was a spider.

84
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:39,051
Ah.

85
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,353
A spider?

86
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:44,123
Yeah. Somewhere.

87
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:12,644
Mmm.

88
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,522
Damn.

89
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:18,557
I like it when you do that.

90
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,292
Yeah?

91
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:21,394
Yeah.

92
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:32,287

93
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,220
What happened?

94
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:46,185
After everything we've been
through these last few months,

95
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:49,553
you returning to the suit,

96
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:53,325
Anissa's powers, Jennifer's powers,

97
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,728
Gambi's confession...

98
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,659
Is this supposed to be sexy?

99
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:01,967
'Cause, if so, I have some notes.

100
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:06,573
No. I... I realized that if my issue

101
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,761
with Black Lightning was the stress,

102
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:11,276
everything that's happened
should have sent me running

103
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,712
as far away from you as possible.

104
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,552
I feel closer to you than ever.

105
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:21,153
Hmm.

106
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:27,567
Who'd have thought I just needed to
make things worse to get you back?

107
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:31,630
I love you.

108
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,475
I've loved you a long time.

109
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,405
Ignoring that seems stupid.

110
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:42,475
I love you, too.

111
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,112
- But...
- Oh.

112
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,849
No, uh...

113
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:53,253
I don't think we should
say anything to the girls.

114
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,854
They're dealing with so much.

115
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:59,158
I want us to be sure
before we tell them.

116
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,512
We just keep it a secret.

117
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,782
Like we're having an affair.

118
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:14,455
I'm in.

119
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,987
Dwayne.

120
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,522
Mr. Whale.

121
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:35,006
I just wanted to thank
you for savin' my life.

122
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:37,663
Mmm.

123
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:40,099
In the chaos of the night,

124
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,368
you were brave enough
to pull me to safety.

125
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:43,968
And I can appreciate that.

126
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,404
You're welcome, sir.

127
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:50,381
But you left my sister.

128
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:56,682
And left Tori to die.

129
00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:59,818
If I went back, they
would've gotten you, too.

130
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,853
Look, and...

131
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:03,956
You left her to die.

132
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:15,990
You're so impulsive.

133
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:26,772
It feels good to be back.

134
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:36,655
Khalil?

135
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:43,128
You're...

136
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,296
Walking.

137
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,132
Yeah, I know.

138
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:48,858
It's amazing.

139
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,037
A miracle, actually.

140
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,050
- Really happy for you.
- Ah.

141
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,545
It seems like you have
yourself a new look.

142
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:05,584
So, uh, I guess this means you'll
be coming back to school soon, right?

143
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,451
Nah, man.

144
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:11,223
Nah, snakes treated me like dirt
when I was in that chair, so...

145
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,692
I don't think so.

146
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,326
Okay, look. I know
you've had a hard time,

147
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:20,366
but that doesn't mean you
should abandon your education.

148
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:22,635
Man, are you, uh...

149
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:26,073
You're really gonna do the
whole education pitch right now?

150
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,229
Really?

151
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:30,909
Good talk, Mr. P.

152
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,878
- I hope you change your mind.
- I won't.

153
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,803
Look, let me ask you something.

154
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:36,139
Um...

155
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:41,086
What kind of procedure
got you back on your feet?

156
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,856
Why you wanna know?

157
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:48,594
Well, because while I'm very
happy that you're walking,

158
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:53,659
we both know that someone pulled
the strings to make that happen.

159
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:56,635
And I wanna make sure you're
not being taken advantage of.

160
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:07,946
Man, you really are in
your own little world, huh?

161
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:11,769
I'm walking, bruh.

162
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,019
How is that takin' advantage of me?

163
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,722
And you know what? Stop.

164
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:20,325
Stop with that surrogate daddy act.

165
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:22,687
You don't care about me.

166
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,448
I was just another little,
poor kid from Freeland

167
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,500
for you to parade around
in front of everybody

168
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:30,536
to make you and Garfield look good.

169
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,805
- That is so not true.
- Yes, it is!

170
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:38,243
As soon as my black ass
couldn't run no more,

171
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:42,347
where were you?

172
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,373
You wouldn't even let
your daughter near me.

173
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:55,615
Where is the future, Mr. P?

174
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,272
It's right here.

175
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,513
- Walking?
- Yes.

176
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:12,184
With no kind of assistance.
No cane, no braces.

177
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:14,786
I've read about implants
in rats with severed spines,

178
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:17,956
but I thought we were a long way
from putting those in a human being,

179
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,725
let alone a poor teenager from Feland.

180
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:22,360
It's a billion-dollar technology, right?

181
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:23,995
At least.

182
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:26,198
It stinks of Proctor and the ASA.

183
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,168
Just another experiment being
run on some young black kid.

184
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,838
I found one more in
the newspaper archive.

185
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:36,341
Okay, that's a total of 42 kids missing.

186
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,076
Plus Neema.

187
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:40,745
Wait, you only saw
three dozen pods, right?

188
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:43,582
Does that mean seven are dead?

189
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,618
I have no way to know that, Jefferson.

190
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,453
It can't be easy keeping them stable,

191
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,021
especially if they have to move them.

192
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:52,123
We need to find these
kids before the ASA

193
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,292
- decides to relocate them again.
- Yeah.

194
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:58,196
Catching Proctor is the best
way for us to shut this down.

195
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:02,500
Well, if we're right about Khalil,

196
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:04,102
he might lead me to Proctor.

197
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:06,520
- I mean, he might not know enough not to.
- Hmm.

198
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:08,871
And I've got one more
lead to follow up on.

199
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,908
Hidalgo, the weapons maker.

200
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:12,444
What? The guy who lied to you?

201
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:15,614
My mistake. I won't make it again.

202
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:19,251
Now, Proctor won't have given
up on finding Black Lightning.

203
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:22,621
And even if he thinks you're not
him, I bet he thinks you know him.

204
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,489
He'll be watching.

205
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:27,887
And he'll be looking for Thunder,
too, Anissa, so be careful.

206
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,929
Oh, Gambi?

207
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,528
- Proctor'll be looking for you, too.
- Yeah.

208
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:37,435
But this old man's not
gonna save the world,

209
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:40,739
so if he catches me,
it's not as big a deal.

210
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:47,918
Having enhanced abilities
doesn't have to change anything.

211
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,281
Oh, really?

212
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:51,483
So I should join a team
but not try too hard,

213
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:54,219
because the competition
might set me on fire.

214
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:56,778
Okay, maybe not a team.

215
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,329
Well, what about Debate?

216
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,525
'Cause nothing is more
calming than alternative views

217
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,762
on abortion and social services.

218
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:06,426
Well, there's always needlepoint.

219
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,433
Hey, you're right. I can make a
pillow that says, "My parents had sex,

220
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:11,670
and all I got was superpowers."

221
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:14,012
- It's not funny.
- It's a little bit funny.

222
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,475
Look, we just need to figure out
how to help you to control them.

223
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:20,379
And if it makes you feel any
better, I have made a little progress

224
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,537
in isolating the gene
that I think is responsible

225
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,397
for your enhanced abilities.

226
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,433
Suppressing it is the first step.

227
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,723
Thank God I was born
to such a smart woman

228
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,558
and not some slacker who would just...

229
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,760
try and make me feel
better by making me a cake.

230
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,496
Do you want me to bake you a cake?

231
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,715
Yes, please. Chocolate
with cream cheese frosting.

232
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,916
Chocolate it is.

233
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:48,856
Mrs. Payne.

234
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:51,508
- Mr. Jefferson. How are you?
- I'm good.

235
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:53,311
I'm good. Is Khalil home?

236
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,410
No. He's in California.

237
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,416
What?

238
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,319
I saw him this morning.

239
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:03,744
Oh.

240
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:05,113
I didn't know.

241
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:07,558
How was he?

242
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,016
Walking.

243
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,287
Come in.

244
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:18,176
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,305
Uh, do you mind me
asking how it happened?

246
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:23,074
The spinal implant?

247
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:24,776
Uh, yeah. Yes.

248
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:28,611
A hospital administrator came by.

249
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:32,650
He said Khalil was chosen,
uh, for a pilot program.

250
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:35,408
Do you remember his name?

251
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,023
A Mr. Martin.

252
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,340
He said there was a risk of infection,

253
00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:43,926
and I couldn't be with Khalil
while he was being treated.

254
00:15:44,996 --> 00:15:47,798
And that I should stay in Freeland.

255
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:50,556
I didn't want my boy to go by himself,

256
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,470
but our doctor signed off and I...

257
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:55,006
- Khalil wanted to.
- Yeah.

258
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:59,978
He hasn't talked to me
since he's been there.

259
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,251
And now he's back?

260
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,517
Well, I think the injury was
a lot for him to deal with.

261
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:08,895
But he never would've gotten
through it without you.

262
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:13,512
Can I have Mr. Martin's number?

263
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,153
Of course. I'll get it.

264
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:33,545
Hey, Tommy. Come on in.

265
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,848
That's far enough.

266
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:38,239
I like this.

267
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:41,151
It's got a retro feel you don't
usually get in a high-capacity weapon.

268
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,676
I'm impressed you got in.

269
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,626
I had to beef up the security
system after our last meeting.

270
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,359
All right, so you're smart
enough to know I'd be back,

271
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,983
but you're not smart enough
to know how to stop me.

272
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:51,119
Look, I didn't lie to you last time.

273
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,197
True. But you didn't tell
me what I wanted to know.

274
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,473
I still can't.

275
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:56,133
So, if you want to
kill me, just kill me.

276
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:58,301
Talking about it doesn't make it easier.

277
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,507
I'm not gonna kill you, Tommy.

278
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,243
But I am gonna put a
target on your back,

279
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:08,114
so every person you've ever
double-crossed can find you.

280
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:09,751
I'll let one of them torture you in ways

281
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:11,282
I just don't have the
stomach for anymore.

282
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:12,715
Come on, Gambi.

283
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:15,586
Honestly, I don't know who bought
the weapon that killed Lady Eve.

284
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,637
I want Proctor.

285
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,073
Don't play dumb.

286
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:22,727
You work for the government all the
time. I wanna know how to find him.

287
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:24,729
You want to get to him
before he gets to you?

288
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:26,631
I heard you were on the outs.

289
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:30,001
You got 48 hours.

290
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,202
Move.

291
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,520
The music helps me study, I swear.

292
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,725
I saw Khalil today.

293
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:57,055
And he's walking again.

294
00:17:58,406 --> 00:17:59,405
What?

295
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:01,132
Dad, the doctors said
it wasn't possible.

296
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:02,467
Yeah, I know.

297
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,670
Oh, my God.

298
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,702
Oh, my God, I gotta
find him and talk to him.

299
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,305
No. No, no, no.

300
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:09,541
No. You need to stay away.

301
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:13,044
From Khalil? Why?

302
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:15,513
He is not the same person.

303
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:19,771
Dad, look. I understand you're mad
because of the way he treated me.

304
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:22,475
No, no, no. He looks different.

305
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,344
He acts different.

306
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,463
And I think he's gotten
himself involved with...

307
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:34,165
With people who are
looking for kids like you.

308
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:35,739
Why do you think that?

309
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:39,545
The medical technology he's gotten,

310
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:41,978
it's not easy to come by.

311
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:44,184
- Does it matter?
- Yes. It matters.

312
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:46,598
Dad, I get what you're sayin',
but Khalil wouldn't hurt me.

313
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:48,668
Okay, look. This is
not just about Khalil.

314
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:50,181
It's about the decisions he's made

315
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:54,219
and the people he is
possibly involved with.

316
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,503
Stay away.

317
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:09,075
I can't wait until Mom
figures out how to fix me.

318
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,777
I'm sick of this powers' drama.

319
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,332
Your mother... what?

320
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:22,447
She's isolating this
meta-gene so she can stop it.

321
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,951
I can finally be me again.

322
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:39,549
Khalil?

323
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,832
Are you trying to isolate
Jennifer's meta-gene?

324
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:57,382
I've done some preliminary research
to understand what's happening.

325
00:19:57,385 --> 00:20:00,332
So you could suppress the mutation?

326
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:02,452
She's conflicted about her powers.

327
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:04,889
I don't see any reason not
to explore all the options.

328
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,524
It's who she is!

329
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,306
Jeff, I'm not the enemy.

330
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,056
You're trying to change her

331
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:12,103
and treating her like she's sick.

332
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,235
Okay, so is Anissa sick?

333
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:15,360
Am I?

334
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:16,900
No. That's not what I...

335
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:19,978
I mean, how could you do
this without talking to me?

336
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:27,381
You know, I think it's really good

337
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,148
that we didn't tell the girls
that we're getting back together.

338
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:01,135
You know, I've been
waiting about an hour...

339
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:02,703
thinking that you'd come home.

340
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,439
Girl, where've you been?

341
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:09,089
We've actually been
staying someplace else.

342
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:13,714
Vermin.

343
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,951
Gross.

344
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:19,153
Well, look. I wanted you to be first...

345
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,557
to see that I'm finally walking again.

346
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,459
Oh, my God!

347
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:28,550
This is crazy.

348
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,266
I'm... I'm happy for you.

349
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:39,205
Look. I've been feelin' really bad

350
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,609
about the way things ended between us.

351
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,412
Yeah. Me, too.

352
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:47,363
J, I know it's not an excuse,

353
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:52,472
but when I couldn't walk or run
no more, I didn't know who I was.

354
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:56,357
But look...

355
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:03,836
Cool, isn't it?

356
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,563
I mean... And look, I'm the
first person to ever get this.

357
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,471
Wow.

358
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:12,306
- Really the first?
- Yeah.

359
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:14,975
You know, it hurt like
hell in the beginning.

360
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:18,914
I mean, it felt like my
legs were, like, electrified.

361
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,246
You weren't scared?

362
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:23,050
Like, yeah. I mean, at the beginning.

363
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:25,252
I mean, I had doctors poking at me,

364
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:26,820
making all these scrunched up faces.

365
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:29,657
Hell, I didn't know if it
was working or not. But...

366
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,493
But it worked.

367
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:34,370
It worked, man. It really did.

368
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,465
And the dreads, was
this part of the deal?

369
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:42,636
Oh. Nah. Nah, they gave me some pills

370
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:46,907
uh, to help with the regeneration.

371
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:51,111
And, uh, it just made
my hair grow really fast.

372
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:53,180
I figured I'd just do something new.

373
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:56,283
Well, um...

374
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:58,519
it looks very mature.

375
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:05,902
Um...

376
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,731
So, how'd they pick
you for the procedure?

377
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:14,435
Uh...

378
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,058
Does that really matter?

379
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,658
Oh, I don't know.

380
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,094
It might.

381
00:23:29,418 --> 00:23:30,651
Oh.

382
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:34,021
Okay.

383
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:36,290
I get it.

384
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,092
Now this is coming from your pops, huh?

385
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:39,860
Oh. No. Hey, Khalil.

386
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:41,695
Damn it, man.

387
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:45,165
J, I came here first to see
if we could get back together

388
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,134
now that I got everything straight.

389
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:49,203
But all I'm getting is shade from you

390
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:51,238
about who did what and why.

391
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:55,269
Forget it.

392
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:57,105
You know what?

393
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:58,672
I'm better without your ass anyway.

394
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,080
Khalil.

395
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:11,358
Okay, look, why the hell would
I wanna go back to Garfield High?

396
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,962
I know you got a lot of feelings
about Garfield, but this is business,

397
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:18,097
and you need to put your
feelings aside for the moment.

398
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,602
Our job is to catch Black Lightning.

399
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:26,006
Not kill him, catch him.

400
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:29,410
Okay, but why Garfield?

401
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:32,175
Think, Khalil.

402
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,973
What does Black Lightning do?

403
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,753
- Beats people's asses.
- Hmm.

404
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:41,308
Whose asses?

405
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:43,190
Bad guys' asses.

406
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,925
Okay, and why?

407
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:46,928
To stop them...

408
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,435
To stop them from hurting people.

409
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:57,604
Exactly.

410
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,339
So danger at Garfield,

411
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:02,743
the crown jewel of
Freeland, is like catnip.

412
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:06,486
You're gonna go in there and
draw Black Lightning out. Got it?

413
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,949
Got it.

414
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:13,367
There's a part of you, I know,
that wants his old life back.

415
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,183
I even heard you tried to
get your old girlfriend back.

416
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,034
But you made a deal, son.

417
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:24,098
Legs for loyalty.

418
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,784
So, Garfield,

419
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:28,620
that girl...

420
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,872
They belong to the past now.

421
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,442
I want you to remember
what they did to you.

422
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:39,480
Hold on to that anger,
then go do what I need.

423
00:25:41,684 --> 00:25:43,250
All right, yeah.

424
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,270
What was that?

425
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
Yes, sir.

426
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:53,861
Screw up...

427
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,998
and I'll rip that spinal implant
out and shove it down your throat.

428
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:15,048
Would you buy drugs from him?

429
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:21,455
No.

430
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:23,775
Me either,

431
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,794
which means you can't
put him on the corner,

432
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,698
which means you one man down.

433
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:37,538
No disrespect, Lala, but he
should've kept his damn mouth shut.

434
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:45,279
Okay.

435
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,769
Maybe moving him to a less lucrative

436
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,940
spot would have delivered the message.

437
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:00,862
I get to beat people up.

438
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:04,901
But when you do it,

439
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,628
it destroys the morale.

440
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,740
And it endangers loyalty.

441
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,376
And that's...

442
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,045
What?

443
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:20,514
The Devil deals the cards.

444
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,977
Endangers loyal what?

445
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,633
Hey, Lala, you all right?

446
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,436
Endangers loyalty, how?

447
00:27:52,982 --> 00:27:56,083
Peter, it's Thomas. I've
got what we discussed.

448
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,019
Use the door this time.

449
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:02,456
And when we're done, I'd
like to never see you again.

450
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:25,052
Does the force of the closure indicate
that you're ready for your exam?

451
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:27,454
No. That's just enough precalc.

452
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:31,841
I swear, I hate to sound like
a cliche, but it's useless.

453
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,778
So tell me about this
procedure you're developing.

454
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,291
Did you tell your father
I was tryin' to fix you?

455
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:43,436
- Isn't that what you're tryin' to do?
- No.

456
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:45,772
Because there's nothing wrong with you.

457
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:50,176
I just wanna understand what's
happening and give you the options.

458
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,079
The procedures and the treatments
I've been talking about,

459
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,181
they're all theory and hypothesis.

460
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:58,096
There's no telling how long it
would take to develop them or

461
00:28:58,099 --> 00:28:59,855
even if they'd be safe.

462
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:02,568
Mom, you can stop frosting.

463
00:29:03,581 --> 00:29:05,225
Could you please just cut me a piece?

464
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:07,527
'Cause all my options are horrible.

465
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,030
Okay.

466
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:13,233
So, our conversation
earlier got me thinking.

467
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,206
These pods need a lot of electricity.

468
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:17,937
And if this isn't the first time
the ASA's tried to move them,

469
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:20,540
we might be able to track the
electrical spikes in the facilities

470
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:21,975
where they'd been and then left,

471
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:23,810
which means we might
be able to find them.

472
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:27,772
So it turns out, Marcus Roberts,

473
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:30,761
who graduated at Garfield a
year ahead of me, works at FGE.

474
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:33,752
I called him up, said I
was into energy efficiency

475
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,822
and new economic development, and he...

476
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:37,323
Didn't he have a crush on you?

477
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:41,542
Dad! I did not flirt with him, okay?

478
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:43,972
Look, he's just interested in
helping the community, guys.

479
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:45,008
Okay.

480
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,700
Anyway. So he found
these up and down spikes

481
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,401
at various locations until
about three years ago.

482
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,973
And then, nothing.

483
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:57,226
That coincides with the development
of high-output mobile solar power.

484
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,213
Could be they realized that being
on the grid was a vulnerability.

485
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,149
I got a call from Hidalgo. He
must know Proctor's location.

486
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:06,753
I'll show you guys how to search the
satellites for rooftop solar panels.

487
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,448
And then I'll go find

488
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:10,409
that guy.

489
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,628
Wait, uh, turn that up.

490
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:14,059
All units in the vicinity,
the facility is under assault.

491
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,197
This is a tactical operation,
and SWAT is en route.

492
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:21,241
Do not attempt to enter the
building. Repeat, do not.

493
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,088
Exams are starting.

494
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,101
Everyone will be in their
classrooms. I need to go.

495
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:28,975
Black Lightning hasn't been totally
cleared in Lady Eve's murder yet.

496
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:30,378
You'll still be a police target.

497
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:33,095
But I'm not gonna lay in the shadows
and watch my students get attacked.

498
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,981
Anissa, if you want...

499
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:37,751
Gambi, tap into the cameras,
see what you can find.

500
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,263
I never could stand your ass.

501
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,156
What're you doing, Khalil?

502
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,274
Hey, hey, stop! Stop.

503
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:39,005
- I'm just getting started.
- This is not you.

504
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,812
This is not the Khalil
I was friends with.

505
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:41,846
Please, you don't have to do this.

506
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:43,104
Jennifer, this is me.

507
00:31:43,107 --> 00:31:45,650
And, yes, I do have to do this.

508
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,520
Now, look. I won't hurt her,
but you need to get out of here.

509
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,757
Girl, did I stutter? I said go!

510
00:31:55,595 --> 00:31:57,674
Come on, slow down. Let's go, let's go.

511
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:59,979
Exit the classroom. Slow down.

512
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:02,633
Come on. I know, I know. Just go.

513
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,705
Get these kids outta here.

514
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:11,275
- Hey.
- That way.

515
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:12,844
- Wait.
- Go.

516
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:17,081
I'm blind inside the school,
but I'm working on it.

517
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,383
And SWAT's about five
minutes from coming in.

518
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:20,752
We should split up.

519
00:32:21,254 --> 00:32:23,187
Come on. Go, go, go.

520
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:25,289
Slow down.

521
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:41,906
Go.

522
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:42,233
Oh, yeah.

523
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:47,610
I thought you'd run off after
I kicked your ass at the club.

524
00:33:47,613 --> 00:33:51,475
It's gonna take more than a clown
in a shiny suit to take me down.

525
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,394
Is that all you've got?

526
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:04,255
You think I'd come unprepared?

527
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:06,224
I've waited a long time for this.

528
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:09,060
Looks like he's wearing
some kind of undersuit.

529
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:13,418
You gonna have to fight me like
a man. Not a little lightning bug.

530
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:14,820
Don't do it, Jeff.

531
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:17,567
Tactically, hand-to-hand
combat makes no sense.

532
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:27,137
Anissa, your dad needs your
help. Get over there, quick.

533
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:57,601
Like I said,

534
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:59,380
I didn't come unprepared.

535
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:00,816
Zap the kid hard.

536
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:03,352
It'll short-out his implant.
He'll be paralyzed again.

537
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:06,676
Look, Jeff, I know how you feel about
the kid, but this is not the time.

538
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,348
SWAT's about to come in, the
bullets are gonna start flying.

539
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:19,256
What was that?

540
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:21,726
What was that?

541
00:36:38,144 --> 00:36:41,045
Now! Move. Now!

542
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,752
I'm not looking to go backwards.

543
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:49,520
I pray that's true.

544
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,624
'Cause I don't ever wanna
see you like that again, ever.

545
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:55,292
What happened, Dad?

546
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:01,355
Jeff?

547
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:06,769
We took this super-negro out.

548
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:11,243
Oh, no!

549
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:14,078
He's dead, you idiot.

550
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,714
What about "alive"
didn't you understand?

551
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:23,187
Not so hot, now, huh?

552
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:29,460
At least I can finally
see who this clown is.

553
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,013
Go, go.

554
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,784
All right, come on,
Dad. We gotta get up.

555
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:55,052
Dad.

556
00:37:57,256 --> 00:38:03,884
Dad. Dad, wake up.

557
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:05,629
No, Dad, wake up!

558
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,699
Dad, wake up.

559
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:14,032
Do something! Dad, wake up!

560
00:38:17,477 --> 00:38:19,343
What was that?

561
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:20,544
It was Jennifer.

562
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:23,087
Whatever Jennifer did,
tell her to do it again.

563
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,248
Hard.

564
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,716
Come on, Jen. One more time.

565
00:38:25,718 --> 00:38:27,718
Shock him. Shock him one more time.

566
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:39,997
Oh, thank God.

567
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,967
You did it, Jen. He's back.

568
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:58,769
Anissa, take your dad through
there to the back room.

569
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:02,307
Lynn, let me have your
phone. Jen, you too.

570
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,948
- Watch out, watch out.
- Listen.

571
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:05,207
There's a hammer under the sink in there

572
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,723
I wa you to use it to smash these phones

573
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:08,314
and then run them under the water. Okay?

574
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:10,264
The ASA can track us
through those phones.

575
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:11,347
Put him down gently.

576
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:13,730
Where are the medical supplies?

577
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:15,866
- They're in the closet.
- Okay.

578
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:20,370
I'm gonna cloak this place against all
surveillance, satellite, you name it.

579
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:23,941
We're safe inside the house for
now. We just need to stay inside.

580
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:26,677
- All right, phones are toast.
- All right, cool. What's next?

581
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:29,012
Just help me get your father
out of this suit, right now.

582
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:36,386
Dead?

583
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:39,156
Some of the students heard
someone say he was dead.

584
00:39:39,158 --> 00:39:42,359
Another student claimed to
have seen the other meta,

585
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:45,295
Thunder, carrying his
body from the school.

586
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:56,039
Find Black Lightning's body.

587
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,842
Bring me Thunder, dead or alive.

588
00:39:58,844 --> 00:40:04,114
I don't care if you have to
burn down Freeland to do it.

589
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:07,518
This experiment...

590
00:40:10,523 --> 00:40:13,657
cannot fail!

591
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:43,954
Latavious.

592
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:47,948
Now do you believe in the Resurrection?

593
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,862
I will blow your head off, you mother...

594
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:54,765
The Devil deals the cards.

595
00:40:57,691 --> 00:40:59,712
Sit your ass down.

596
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:06,527
I really hate loose ends,

597
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,855
so I wanna thank you for taking
care of the weapons maker.

598
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,449
You're welcome.

599
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:18,255
We killed Lady Eve to get a seat.

600
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,376
Now we just have to take care of Proctor
and we'll own the whole damn table.

601
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,577
So, Latavious...

602
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,464
shall we begin?

603
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:34,977
Yes, sir.

604
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:39,747

1
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:06,464
You have to stop.

2
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:09,484
I can't keep letting you put
yourself, or me through this.

3
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,546
I promise, no more.

4
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:14,594
So it's been nine years since

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,590
I've even come close to using my powers.

6
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:18,692
Do you remember why you
became Black Lightning?

7
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:20,937
You wanted to give the people hope.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,370
Look, somebody has to do something,

9
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,903
because all of this
policing and marching

10
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,162
and praying, it hasn't changed anything.

11
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:37,577
It is time that people
know that Black Lightning...

12
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:40,718
is back.

13
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:44,962
Previously on Black Lightning...

14
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:48,220
The sink just crumbled in
my hands like it was nothing.

15
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:51,725
Lynn and I are making
room for a reconciliation.

16
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:53,627
I need to take things slow, Jeff.

17
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,429
- The One Hundred got my little girl.
- LaWanda White.

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,931
I want my daughter.

19
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:05,792
It is time that people know
that Black Lightning is back.

20
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:17,083
Sister LaWanda was one of us.

21
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,688
A friend...

22
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:25,715
a mother...

23
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:32,165
and she most certainly...
was a woman of God.

24
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:33,400
That's right!

25
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:36,336
Sister LaWanda fought the good fight,

26
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,121
and now she's gone.

27
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,577
And all Sister LaWanda did
was try to save her child.

28
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,412
Where's Anissa?

29
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:58,515
And The One Hundred
tried to send a message

30
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:00,512
by killing her!

31
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,956
They wanted us to stay
down, to stay scared,

32
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,560
to have the little bit
of life they gave us.

33
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,909
Well, I'm standing here
tonight to tell you,

34
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:12,552
that we're gonna send The
One Hundred back a message...

35
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:14,255
That's right. That's right.

36
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,892
By following Sister LaWanda's example.

37
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:23,820
So I need 100 God-fearing
people to march with me.

38
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:29,949
I said I need 100 God-fearing
people to march with me!

39
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:34,254
So that we can take back our community,

40
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,734
so that our kids can live free
of the drugs, and the violence,

41
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:41,033
and all the damage that
goes from living in a place

42
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:43,236
that nobody gives a damn about!

43
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:47,720
Stand up!

44
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:50,883
March with me.

45
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:53,219
Stand up if you wanna march with me.

46
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:54,989
Stand up if you wanna march with...

47
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,315
Damn it!

48
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:23,756
It's my breathing.

49
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:25,645
Okay.

50
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:30,223
Look, Reverend, I don't support
paying The One Hundred for anything,

51
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,326
but I get that's where we are right now.

52
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:33,980
And I know the police have to do a lot

53
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,015
- to get the community...
- Amen. Amen. Amen.

54
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:37,450
Amen, brother.

55
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:39,405
You see,

56
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,940
we wouldn't have to pay for protection

57
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:43,818
if half the police
department didn't have

58
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,692
their hands in The
One Hundred's pockets.

59
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:48,372
Well, I'm not in The
One Hundred's pockets,

60
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,542
and good work is being done.

61
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:52,244
Now we may not get there in the moment,

62
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:54,247
but we will get there in the end.

63
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:57,270
See, we gonna put our trust
in the power of the Almighty,

64
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,133
because we damn sure
can't put our trust in you.

65
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:01,569
You got that?

66
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:04,973
Come on, that... that's not
true, Jeremiah, and you know it.

67
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:07,016
What, those crooked cops

68
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,688
send you down here like the overseer?

69
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:12,521
Put the slaves in check, huh?

70
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:17,891
While you up in the pulpit
with a $25,000 watch on,

71
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:21,325
wiping your forehead
with a silk handkerchief,

72
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:25,598
I'm scraping young black
men's bodies off the concrete.

73
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,435
- The street is my pulpit.
- Billy. Okay.

74
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:32,582
I wear work shoes.

75
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:36,693
What kind of shoes you wear, Reverend?

76
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,415
All right.

77
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,324
Well, I'm not gonna call off my protest.

78
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:27,894
And, quite frankly, I'm surprised
that you, as a parent and an educator,

79
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:30,086
would... would try to stop me.

80
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:34,724
I want to save you
from yourself, Jeremiah.

81
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,871
Though I have no reason to
believe you'll listen to me.

82
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:40,320
Freeland has always listened to you.

83
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:46,331
When you raced, now from
your perch at Garfield...

84
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,753
they used to call you Black Jesus.

85
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:51,196
Yeah, well, maybe they listened to me

86
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,699
because they believe in what I'm saying.

87
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:55,401
No. We listened because
you were one of us.

88
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:59,526
You were out in those
streets fighting with us.

89
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,407
Now it seems like the only ones you

90
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,320
care about are the ones in your school,

91
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,657
or the ones in your home.

92
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,133
That's not true, Jeremiah.

93
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,602
Never has been.

94
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:11,638
Freeland is my home too, man.

95
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,972
Really?

96
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,941
I fight the best way I know how.

97
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,438
Look, man,

98
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,361
I know you and Henderson think I'm

99
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:22,557
marching for my own glory, but I'm not.

100
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,454
I'm tired, man.

101
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:32,792
If it ain't the police
killing us, we killing us.

102
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,628
And it's time for me...

103
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:41,258
It's time for us to take our lives back,

104
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,474
even if it means we have
to be willing to die.

105
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:46,306
You understand?

106
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:48,133
LaWanda didn't want to die.

107
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:51,001
Yeah. But she knew it was possible.

108
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:54,214
Yet she persisted.

109
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,822
Because Black Lightning gave her hope.

110
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:00,102
- Black Lightning?
- Yeah.

111
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,092
See, Black Lightning made her
believe she could save her daughter.

112
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:09,196
Yeah, but she failed, Jeremiah.

113
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,618
They killed her.

114
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:14,934
Yeah. It's no accident that he
came back after all these years.

115
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:16,922
That's God's work.

116
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:20,618
You see, that gives me hope.

117
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:24,544
That with Black Lightning's
help, and with God's help,

118
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,046
we can save this community.

119
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,449
Okay, what if you're wrong, Reverend?

120
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:30,651
Hmm?

121
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,180
What if you're wrong
about Black Lightning?

122
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,582
I'm not.

123
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,316
And what I believe is that he
is the answer to our prayers.

124
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:58,313

125
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,761
Heroes inspire people.

126
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:05,262
The reverend is no exception.

127
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:08,025
Yeah, I don't wanna inspire
people to get themselves killed.

128
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:11,684
Watching hundreds of people
over multiple city blocks.

129
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:14,017
Uh, what if I'm not ready?

130
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,696
You'll be ready.

131
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:19,008
I've been able to decrease the
resistance within the suit's circuitry,

132
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,311
which will allow for a smoother
transfer of power to you.

133
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:23,646
Also, with this arm,

134
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:26,375
you should be able to create a
thinner stream of electricity.

135
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:27,765
Why would I do that?

136
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,933
You'll be dealing with a large crowd.

137
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,958
You'll want a targeted strike
with less collateral damage.

138
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:35,661
Also, lower voltage requirement,
reduced power drain...

139
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:38,061
Yeah. Okay, okay. Let's just test it.

140
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:40,196
Okay. Here we go.

141
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:46,375
A thinner stream.

142
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,022
Again.

143
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,251
Come on, Jefferson.

144
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:04,320
Focus. Again.

145
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,411
Again.

146
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,350
My grandmother always told me that

147
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:09,485
if you don't write a thank you note,

148
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,788
it's as if the good
thing never happened.

149
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,887
This is mine,

150
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,095
for all you lost over Lala's stupidity.

151
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:26,102
Unless you want me to throw
that bag at Black Lightning,

152
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,471
doesn't really solve your real problem.

153
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,148
Black Lightning is dead.

154
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,905
I killed him my damn self.

155
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,381
Tobias, are you a church-going man?

156
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:42,192
No disrespect, Lady Eve,

157
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:45,755
but my life hasn't exactly
led me down a spiritual path.

158
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:48,291
Well, I'm going to tell you

159
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:52,462
that the Good Book
helps folks stay in line.

160
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:58,184
And then here comes Black Lightning,

161
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:01,070
and they think they don't have to.

162
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,843
Take Reverend Holt, for instance.

163
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,044
He's planning a march.

164
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,146
A march.

165
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:12,749
He's gonna leadleverybody
to the promised land

166
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:17,153
and take away our protection
money when he gets there.

167
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:20,757
He can't be that stupid.

168
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,427
Well,

169
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:29,165
another pastor realized
the risk in that proposal

170
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:32,258
and was smart enough to let me know.

171
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,607
I thank you for passing that on.

172
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,842
Mmm.

173
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:42,178
What I expect

174
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,248
is for you and that girl
with death in her eyes,

175
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,929
to take care of it.

176
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,640
I don't mind people believing in God.

177
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:56,929
They just can't believe that
they can take back these streets.

178
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:00,630
Amen, Lady Eve.

179
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,429
And then we can check
into the hotel at 2:00.

180
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:18,981
Yo, did you tell your
parents where you were going?

181
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:23,419
Oh, I haven't yet. But I will.

182
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,304
You have condoms, right?

183
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,391
Yeah.

184
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:30,092
You sure?

185
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,661
Right.

186
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,794
- You good?
- Yeah.

187
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,367
I'm good. Uh, it's just...

188
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,838
Just what?

189
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,406
I know you haven't changed your mind?

190
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:46,304
What? No. No. No, no, no, no. I, uh...

191
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,880
J, I lied.

192
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,317
What you mean you lied?

193
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,586
I'm a...

194
00:13:57,155 --> 00:13:58,487
I haven't done it before.

195
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,690
Look, I...

196
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,792
I was afraid to tell you. I mean...

197
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:05,628
I wanted you to think that I
knew what I was doing, but...

198
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,698
Damn it, I was just trying to have swag.

199
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,267
Next thing I know, lies were
coming out of my mouth, and...

200
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,337
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,117
Really, I am. I'm... I'm really sorry.

202
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,177
So...

203
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,646
A fine-ass virgin tells the truth

204
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,625
and risks remaining a virgin?

205
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:31,053
Khalil, my virgin self couldn't
find you sexier right now.

206
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:35,157
Stop.

207
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,567
Hey.

208
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,637
I'm sorry. Do you need
me to get out of your way?

209
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,183
It's kind of like I've moved in.

210
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:02,752
No. Not at all.

211
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,187
Can I help you find anything?

212
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,765
No, I'm, uh...

213
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:10,906
I'm just doing some
research on genetic mutation.

214
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,576
You doing it for school?

215
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:15,831
No.

216
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:19,361
Somebody sick?

217
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,611
I hope not.

218
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:26,242
Well, I hope not too.

219
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,364
Anissa.

220
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,780
Grace.

221
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:45,187
What are you reading?

222
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,130
The Outsiders.

223
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,532
It's not my thing.

224
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,669
You know, if you're reading
about genetic mutations for fun,

225
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:56,539
maybe it should be.

226
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,674
I mean, this is nerd bait.

227
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:02,378
Young folks with outsized
powers traveling the world,

228
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:04,614
knocking bad guys on their asses.

229
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,898
And then there are the costumes.

230
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,914
Ooh, I do love a costume.

231
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,856
Well, I tend bar at the
Ruby-Red Lipstick bar,

232
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,392
and we do cosplay
party on Friday nights.

233
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:18,515
You dress up as any superhero you want.

234
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,859
Supergirl. Looker, if
vampires are more your thing.

235
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:26,102
I don't really have a thing.

236
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:28,671
Not yet.

237
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,440
You should come to the party.

238
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:34,443
I would really like you to.

239
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:36,312
Okay.

240
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,183
Only one squad car can work the march.

241
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,242
What?

242
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:45,008
That's almost guaranteeing that
somebody is gonna get killed.

243
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,690
- Where'd these orders come from?
- No one will say.

244
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,925
I asked my commander,
and then the chief,

245
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,361
and eventually I tapped out
at the deputy mayor's office

246
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,397
when she wouldn't return my phone call.

247
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,875
Somebody's setting him up.

248
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:58,424
Jeff, you got to talk
to him. Try to convince

249
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:00,970
him to cancel, reschedule,
take a vacation...

250
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,671
No, I tried after you walked out.

251
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:05,541
He won't do it. He's...
he's been inspired.

252
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:06,910
About what?

253
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:09,645
Black Lightning.

254
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:13,115
Black Lightning.

255
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:16,121
Like I don't have enough damn problems.

256
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:18,354
He's gonna get us all killed.

257
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,593
I hope not.

258
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:28,672
Here's your parade route.

259
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:35,071
Okay, now, if Henderson can't change
the parade route, maybe we can.

260
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:37,773
You know, pick something
that minimizes the chaos,

261
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:41,851
makes it easier for Black
Lightning to protect the marchers.

262
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,713
Hasn't the paperwork already been sent

263
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,927
to the good reverend and the
people that set up the parade route?

264
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:48,284
Yes.

265
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:50,619
So, even if I break into the
PD's computers and alter it,

266
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:52,922
there's no guarantee
everyone gets the message.

267
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:56,914
No, I know. I was thinking of something
a bit more old-school than that.

268
00:17:57,914 --> 00:18:01,508
What? Shriners on lawn mowers
to lead people the other way?

269
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:02,977
Close.

270
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,149
I was thinking more like a handsome
Italian gentleman in coveralls.

271
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,440
Whenever you call me handsome,
I almost always end up dirty.

272
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:13,943
Well, then you won't be
disappointed by my plan.

273
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,039
Hmm. Anissa's not just
late, she's not coming.

274
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,446
I'm not surprised.

275
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,979
I haven't seen much of her lately.

276
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,381
Well, we raised her to be
a strong, independent woman,

277
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:30,550
and it looks like we succeeded.

278
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:33,236
Family dinners will be
an intermittent priority.

279
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:37,390
Mmm-hmm. Jennifer's only two
years away from going to college.

280
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,594
- She'll stop coming, too.
- That she will.

281
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm wondering...

282
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:51,543
when she doesn't want
to eat with us either...

283
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:56,280
will you still show
up to dinner with me?

284
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,106
You know what I want?

285
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,016
I wanna stop worrying about you.

286
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,017
Too many nights of seeing
you broken and bleeding, Jeff.

287
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,382
Are we gonna do that right now?

288
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:13,907
Mmm. Anissa's not coming.

289
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,476
Family dinner is optional?

290
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:17,059
Uh, not for you.

291
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:18,626
You're still our little girl.

292
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,867
Well, Anissa not coming sucks.

293
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,602
Language.

294
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:26,506
Sorry. This turn of
events is dispiriting,

295
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,920
as I wished for her
support during this repast.

296
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:34,347
What do you need support for?

297
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,584
I've decided I'm ready to have sex.

298
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:46,059
What did she say?

299
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:50,519
We are happy that you came to us

300
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,568
like we've always encouraged you to.

301
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,371
So happy.

302
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,522
And glad that you felt comfortable.

303
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,292
You are so young.

304
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:05,211
How old were you guys?

305
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,285
Never mind.

306
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:17,682
Your mother and I loved
each other very much.

307
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,124
Mmm-hmm.

308
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:20,443
Wait.

309
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:24,264
Are you saying the first time you
both had sex was with each other?

310
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:25,764
No...

311
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,535
We think it's very important that you

312
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:31,871
have sex with the right person.

313
00:20:31,874 --> 00:20:35,217
Okay. Noted.

314
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,862
So, um, Saturday's the day.

315
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:39,240
I'll be out in the afternoon,

316
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,098
but I'll be home by curfew.

317
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:51,467
I don't think either one of them
said more than, "Pass the salt"

318
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,737
for the rest of the meal.

319
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,130
It was a little cruel to
spring it during family dinner.

320
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,067
Well, my plan was for you to be there,

321
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:02,402
to help 'em through it. But...

322
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,971
- My bad. I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

323
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:08,568
Church, family dinner...
Suddenly you're a ghost.

324
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,216
You're okay though, right?

325
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:21,287
- Nothing bad is happening?
- I am fine.

326
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:24,134
Good.

327
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:26,159
Then that means you can
go to the march with me.

328
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,861
Because I've never been to one,
and you're the pro, Harriet.

329
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:32,665
Mmm... I don't think I wanna
go to the reverend's march.

330
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:37,236
The girl with the marching shoes
and the frequent-marchers card

331
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:39,339
doesn't wanna go to the march?

332
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:42,842
What's going on with you?

333
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,553
I'm just tired of walking around with a

334
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,897
sign, trying to change people's hearts.

335
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,608
I wanna do more.

336
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:56,503
Fine, well, don't
think of it as marching.

337
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,891
Think of it as being with your sister.

338
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:02,195
Something you've forgotten how to do.

339
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,134
Okay.

340
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,504
I'll go with you.

341
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:12,839
Good.

342
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,943
Now, let's talk about birth control.

343
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:19,012
This has been a long night.

344
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:20,546
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

345
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:27,620
Hey.

346
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:28,923
Hey.

347
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,458
I thought we should discuss
our epic fail last night.

348
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:36,451
- My mind went blank.
- I know.

349
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:38,754
And then it was downhill from there.

350
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:42,435
I'm glad that we flamed out together.

351
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:45,943
I always tell people you're
the unflappable parent.

352
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,773
Well, I made an
appointment with Dr. Bass.

353
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:50,910
I think it's easier if one
of us follows up with her.

354
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,145
Yeah.

355
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:55,615
Are you sure we're not
being too liberal here?

356
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:59,256
I mean, my father would say
this is some white-folks mess.

357
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:02,854
The girl told us that she
is having sex on Saturday.

358
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:04,857
Like it was nothing.
If I had done that...

359
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:07,560
And that is why I will
follow up with Dr. Bass,

360
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:09,162
because you are flapping.

361
00:23:10,131 --> 00:23:13,199
Look, we asked her to
come to us, and she did.

362
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:15,635
At least she's not sneaking
off and getting pregnant.

363
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,170
Mmm. Mmm.

364
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:18,304
Don't worry.

365
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:19,686
I got you.

366
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:29,983
What is on your mind, Lynn Stewart?

367
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:34,419
You know, I was thinking since you're

368
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:36,723
going back to being Black Lightning,

369
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:40,126
maybe I should take a bigger
role in the girls' lives.

370
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:42,828
Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:46,058
I mean, if Jennifer leaves
Freeland and goes to college,

372
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:48,034
you won't regret the extra time.

373
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:50,403
I wonder if she should move in with me?

374
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,705
Move?

375
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,743
No.

376
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:58,411
What if you get hurt, Jeff?

377
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,061
What if she sees you beaten up?

378
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,730
What is that gonna
do to our little girl?

379
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,951
I don't wanna talk about this.

380
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:05,041
Jeff, I'm her mother. I have a right.

381
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,443
No.

382
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:13,179
I'll let you know when we see Dr. Bass.

383
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:35,982
Khalil.

384
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:39,418
Hey, Mr. Pierce.

385
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,636
Oh, I shaved a tenth off my split today.

386
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,873
I think it was that new
weight routine you suggested.

387
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:46,463
Oh, great to hear it.

388
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:51,639
You know that my, uh, concern for
you extends beyond the track, right?

389
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:54,361
Uh, yeah. Yes, sir, of course.

390
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:55,842
Good. Good.

391
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,193
How do you shower?

392
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:00,540
Uh, um...

393
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:06,479
Uh... Mr. P, I...

394
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:08,428
You know, you got your bar of soap...

395
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,953
Well... well, I wash,

396
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,589
use shampoo...

397
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:18,457
rinse...

398
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,737
Okay.

399
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,196
Then when you get out of the shower...

400
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,248
Okay.

401
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:31,504
Well, I don't have a mat so I
step on to my towel to dry my feet.

402
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:35,962
So,

403
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:38,744
feet,

404
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:41,147
legs,

405
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,563
etcetera.

406
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:46,339
Yeah. Yeah, that...
that sounds about right.

407
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:47,474
Hmm.

408
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,641
So the young man

409
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:53,492
who wants to have sex with my daughter,

410
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:57,375
who spends much of his
time in locker rooms,

411
00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:02,068
dries his fungus-covered feet
before he dries his important parts?

412
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,480
Sir, I...

413
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:07,272
No, no. I'm asking you, do you
wanna give my daughter athlete's foot

414
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:11,544
in places where athlete's
feet should not be?

415
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:13,206
I don't think so.

416
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,728
"I don't think so"?

417
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:16,909
Son, the answer is "no."

418
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,828
And if you don't know that, then maybe

419
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:23,175
you and Jennifer need to slow down.

420
00:27:01,296 --> 00:27:02,995
Ooh, okay.

421
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:13,472
So, Miss Black Lives Matter is
cheating on me with an Asian?

422
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:15,274
- Hey! Watch it!
- Come on. Come on.

423
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:17,070
I'm not cheating.

424
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:20,008
Unless dancing in
spandex means anything.

425
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:22,014
- You look like an Instagram ho.
- You did not...

426
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:25,151
No, I think you two should
talk about this outside.

427
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,787
You gonna be okay?

428
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:39,727
Yeah, I'm good.

429
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:10,077
The serial number's been removed

430
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,746
so you can toss it at the scene.

431
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:16,002
Though I suggest do not leave it
covered with your fingerprints.

432
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:18,671
Okay.

433
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,404
Is there a problem?

434
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:32,284
You seem reluctant to pick it up.

435
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:34,442
I'm not wearing gloves.

436
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,526
You agreed to do this.

437
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:47,099
Said you wanted to move
up in the organization.

438
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,801
Maybe take Lala's place, right?

439
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,403
Yes.

440
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:51,771
Then I need you to send a message.

441
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:57,410
These are my streets. And
nobody messes with my streets.

442
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,211
Stop bleeding on my desk.

443
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,287
Thank you.

444
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,518
Another day and another young man

445
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,688
has been shot and killed
on the streets of Freeland.

446
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,924
His name, Jamal Allen Brown.

447
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:22,060
And so far, police have not
made any arrests. Residents...

448
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:24,236
How'd it go?

449
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,864
She took her key back.

450
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,101
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,870
No. She was right. We were done.

452
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:34,203
I just...

453
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:38,810
So much has been changing in my life

454
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:43,549
that I was just holding on to
something that wasn't working,

455
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,989
just so I had something to hold on to.

456
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,956
Today, I felt invincible,
you know? And now, I just...

457
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,755
Back to reality.

458
00:29:54,073 --> 00:29:56,622
We're all just playing
at being superheroes.

459
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,001
It'd be nice, though.

460
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:05,244
Superpowers.

461
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:06,680
A way to make the world a better

462
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:09,051
place, you know, really change things,

463
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:10,965
fight the bad guys,

464
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:13,035
save the good guys.

465
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:17,822
Saving the world would
be lonely, I think.

466
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:20,485
You have to keep your identity secret,

467
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,658
even from the people you love.

468
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:25,490
Right. Because they'd worry.

469
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,659
Yeah.

470
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,798
Oh, damn, look at the
time. Okay, I, uh...

471
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,335
I've gotta go get out of this
spandex because I promised my sister

472
00:30:36,337 --> 00:30:37,911
I would go to this march with her.

473
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:40,192
All right, good night,
Miss Black Lives Matter.

474
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:42,319
Goodnight, Grace.

475
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:44,942
Our detour sent the march down here,

476
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:47,779
and this is the highest
point on our new route.

477
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:49,715
You'll be able to see
almost the entire march.

478
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,783
Now, if they just wanna kill Holt,

479
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,585
it'll likely be a single gunman,

480
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:56,688
waiting to take him out
at his most public moment.

481
00:30:58,392 --> 00:30:59,958
But that's not what I'd do.

482
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:04,630
I hate it when you play the
most-not-likely-scenario game.

483
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:07,466
The One Hundred doesn't wanna
be in the martyr-making business.

484
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:09,268
They wanna be in the fear business.

485
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:10,804
So, kill marchers.

486
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:11,911
Exactly.

487
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:14,115
If you put poison in aspirin,
people stop buying aspirin.

488
00:31:14,117 --> 00:31:15,841
If you make it deadly to protest...

489
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:18,684
People will live with their misery
rather thr dying trying to change it.

490
00:31:22,238 --> 00:31:24,356
It's not easy to kill
someone in cold blood.

491
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,473
Your gunman is gonna look nervous.

492
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:29,888
A little bit like you look now.

493
00:31:32,678 --> 00:31:34,111
No, I'm not nervous.

494
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,340
I'm just hoping that
God was listening as

495
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,136
hard as I was when the
reverend was talking.

496
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:42,423
I guess we'll see.

497
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:43,935
Yeah.

498
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:45,471
I'll get the suit ready.

499
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:53,786

Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

Damn it. Lynn and the
girls are down there.

502
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:39,262
There's nothing you can do
about it now. Stay focused.

It's Dr. Lynn Stewart.

518
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:07,012
I need to look at your wound, okay?

519
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:08,247
It may hurt a bit.

520
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:11,250
You need to go.

521
00:35:13,754 --> 00:35:16,679
You're gonna be okay. It's okay.

522
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,752
Hey, hey, hang in there. I'm right here.

523
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,481
Please, you have to sit in the rooms.

524
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,658
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be
okay. Just... It's gonna be okay.

525
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,677
Jen, come on, let's sit down.

526
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,980
Did you hear anything?

527
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:59,263
Well, I just asked them
for some tissues, I'm sorry.

528
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:10,045
He's gonna be okay, right?

529
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,982
I, um... I don't know.

530
00:36:16,325 --> 00:36:19,760
Well, they said... that
Rev. Holt was gonna be okay.

531
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,286
Yeah, they did.

532
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:28,335
Well, maybe... Maybe
Khalil will be okay too.

533
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,677
It could be. I certainly hope so.

534
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,740
Come here. Come here.

535
00:36:42,442 --> 00:36:45,927
It's okay, okay? You'll be good.

536
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:50,000
At least two are injure

537
00:36:50,003 --> 00:36:52,018
but witnesses say Black Lightning

538
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,880
prevented an even larger
tragedy from occurring.

539
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:57,530
Man, my partner was like,
"Man, you must be high."

540
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,867
I'm like, "No, my dude, I
seen it with my own eyes."

541
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,202
It was like, he had
his hands up like this.

542
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:04,872
It was crazy. He saved us all.

543
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:08,221
Well, despite public
support, uh, the police

544
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,945
department are not
happy with his efforts.

545
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:12,983
Earlier I spoke to Inspector Henderson

546
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:14,490
from the Freeland Police Department.

547
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:19,286
He's a vigilante. And violence and
murders are up since he came back.

548
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:22,356
Whether he is the cause, or the target,

549
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:26,668
Black Lightning is not making things
better for the citizens of Freeland...

550
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:29,797
When I heard those bullets,

551
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:31,398
I thought that was it.

552
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,662
I'm glad that you and
the girls are okay.

553
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,244
If I had known you were thinking

554
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:40,874
about coming, I would have warned you.

555
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,576
It was a last-minute thing.

556
00:37:42,578 --> 00:37:44,511
Jennifer told me she was meeting Anissa,

557
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:47,114
and I thought it would be
some quality family time.

558
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,356
I'm sorry.

559
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:59,800
No, it's not your fault. I...
I should have said something.

560
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:03,664
No, I... I mean for suggesting
Jennifer come live with me.

561
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,615
I lashed out.

562
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:09,487
It sounds crazy but the bullets
gave me some perspective.

563
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,123
Danger is everywhere.

564
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,469
I'm sorry.

565
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,311
I really am.

566
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,558
Hey, I guess, deep down, I always knew

567
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,994
that Black Lightning
would eventually win.

568
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:38,246
It doesn't mean I have to
accept my defeat gracefully.

569
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:45,917
You know, even if we don't
live under the same roof,

570
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:50,503
you three are my
priority, suit or no suit.

571
00:38:55,872 --> 00:38:58,173
You're a good man, Jefferson Pierce.

572
00:39:25,122 --> 00:39:26,622
Sorry, Jefferson.

573
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:38,732
So what's going on with you?

574
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,807
Huh?

575
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,797
Dad says you're never home.

576
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,093
You don't call. You
skipped family dinner.

577
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,482
Do you remember when you
told us you were a lesbian?

578
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:01,474
Silent for about a minute,

579
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:04,485
and then hugs.

580
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,740
You know, a mother's love is
a very powerful thing, Anissa.

581
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:14,685
Mmm-hmm.

582
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:17,089
I sense something's
weighing heavy on you.

583
00:40:19,235 --> 00:40:21,002
Nothing you could do, or say would

584
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:23,270
ever make me stop loving you, ever.

585
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,758
Your silence worries me more than

586
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,550
anything you could probably say.

587
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:40,756
Chenoa and I broke up.

588
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:45,029
I'm sorry to hear that, baby.

589
00:40:47,163 --> 00:40:50,430
But you were not into that
girl the way she was into you.

590
00:40:52,523 --> 00:40:55,791
So when you're ready to tell
me what's really going on,

591
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,921
I'm here for you.

592
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:01,981
Okay?

593
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,778
Yeah, Mom.

594
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:12,486
Um, the bullet hit his spine.

595
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:16,081
Khalil might not walk again.

596
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:19,399
Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry.

597
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:21,945
Mmm.

598
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:23,330
I'm so sorry.

599
00:41:23,332 --> 00:41:25,465
I don't give a damn what the police say.

600
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:29,369
Black Lightning is out here in
these streets with these young folks,

601
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:32,057
trying to stop them
from killing each other.

602
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,007
Black Lightning's like an angel,

603
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:37,703
a costumed answer to all our prayers.

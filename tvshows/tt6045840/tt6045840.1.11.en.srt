00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,460
Thirty years ago, I came to Freeland

as an agent for a government
organization called the ASA.

<i>I helped them find young
people with abilities.</i>

<i>But when I realized that the ASA's
vaccine was killing children,</i>

The head of the thу ASA for this
area, is looking for you.

14

If you use your powers,

Yes.

Internal temperature fluctuations
are affecting vital signs.

How are you going to fix it?

27
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:22,587
I think it's a result of
moving on back-to-back days.

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,457
But now that we're powered
up in this location,

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,166
a consistent pod temperature should
return the subject to a stable reading.

1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,262
THE WORLD IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SIDES:
ONE ABUNDANT, THE OTHER SCARCE.

2
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,391
A SELECTION PROCESS LIES BETWEEN THEM.

3
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,938
AT THE AGE OF 20,
EACH PERSON HAS ONE CHANCE.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,983
THE CHOSEN ONES NEVER RETURN.
THEY ARE THE 3%.

5
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,364
YEAR 104 OF THE PROCESS

6
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>Good morning, Michele.</i>

7
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,403
<i>The gates to the Selection Process</i>
<i>are open.</i>

8
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:14,741
<i>The estimated time of your walk is:</i>
<i>47 minutes.</i>

9
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,716
Go, honey.

10
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:41,476
I slept for maybe two hours.
I was too anxious.

11
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,062
I doubt anyone slept last night.

12
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,155
Take care, okay?

13
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,372
THE CAUSE
EVERYONE IS WORTHY

14
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:11,548
"Envy and resentment
have led to the rise of groups--"

15
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,924
<i>Don't dwell on that.</i>

16
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,468
My dear Nair,

17
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,387
you can say that
because you are 4,000 miles away

18
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,139
in the safety of the Offshore.

19
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,643
These terrorists are right
at our doorstep.

20
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,038
Are you going to pass? Look at her!

21
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,624
You know... You know I almost made it?

22
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,834
I lasted three days!

23
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,213
Good luck to you!

24
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,259
You're screwed!
You won't last a day in there!

25
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,473
This is as far as you can come, okay?

26
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,185
Now you go home, okay?

27
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,849
SUBEQUATORIAL AMAZON

28
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,173
With the faith of the Founding Couple!

29
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,383
With the commitment
of the Founding Couple!

30
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,345
With the strength
of the Founding Couple! Amen!

31
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,551
What should I do with these?

32
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,809
<i>Please do not forget your box numbers.</i>

33
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,603
Numbers? Fuck the numbers!

34
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,272
I'm never wearing these rags again.

35
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,682
Three percent.

36
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,562
Only three percent of you

37
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,940
will form the select group of heroes
heading to the Offshore...

38
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,362
where the Founding Couple
created the perfect world.

39
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,656
Where there is no injustice.

40
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,743
<i>Everyone gets the same chance,</i>
<i>and then, the place they deserve...</i>

00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,078
SUPERIOR COUNCIL
OFFSHORE

42
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,664
<i>...the Offshore or Inland.</i>

43
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:17,752
Or as some may say,
"their side" or "our side."

44
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,630
This Process ensures
that only the best of us

45
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,549
will enjoy life on the Offshore.

46
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,260
But not everyone understands this.

47
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:30,849
As you know, envy and resentment
have fueled groups,

48
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,185
<i>who in the name of a false</i>
<i>and hypocritical equality</i>

49
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,190
<i>and with populist ideas, aim to destroy</i>
<i>everything we have achieved.</i>

50
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,902
But they have always failed
and will continue to fail.

51
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,825
And so, welcome, everyone.

52
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,077
Welcome, Michele.

53
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,706
I hope that you will do
your very best, Joana.

54
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,626
And that you will trust the Process, Alex.

55
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,004
Because all these years
of sacrifice, Fernando,

56
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,173
could be rewarded right here.

57
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,261
Remember, you each create your own merit.

58
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,722
No matter what happens...

59
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,933
you deserve this.

60
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,689
Now would be a good time
to express our gratitude, don't you think?

61
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,066
Repeat after me:

62
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,777
We are grateful for the chance...

63
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,196
We are grateful for the chance...

64
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,158
-...for a better way of life.
-...for a better way of life.

65
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,911
Thank you very much.

66
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,913
Thank you very much.

67
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,211
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

68
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,019
CHAPTER 01
CUBES

69
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:46,109
<i>Candidates, please proceed</i>
<i>to the interview rooms. Thank you.</i>

70
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,364
-Need some help? I can push you.
-No, I'm good, thanks.

71
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,993
-It's all good, I can help--
-Buddy, I said I don't need it.

72
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,203
Let them see I can get around by myself.

73
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,707
Sorry, man.
I didn't mean to get in your way.

74
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,923
There's a lot of people.

75
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,217
At this rate,
by the time we get to the Offshore,

76
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,136
we'll all be 30 or 40.

77
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,642
Congratulations on your speech.

78
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,316
You don't work here.

79
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,234
My name is Aline.

80
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,196
I was sent to evaluate
the Process this year.

81
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,407
I don't think I got that memo.

82
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,035
It was a last-minute decision.

83
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:41,498
It's a routine analysis of the tests
and changes made over the past few years.

84
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,625
So, I am your memo.

85
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,881
Okay. But first I need to confirm
your identity, all right?

86
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,551
Of course. If you didn't,
that would have to go in my report.

87
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,554
Okay.

88
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,516
It'll be a pleasure having you around.

89
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,110
Why didn't you warn me
someone was coming to evaluate me?

90
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:15,406
<i>You were so focused on your speech,</i>
<i>I didn't want to distract you.</i>

91
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,537
<i>Besides, you and I have more important</i>
<i>issues to discuss, Ezequiel.</i>

92
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,248
<i>This year's Process is very important.</i>

93
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,959
No more important than any other year.

94
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,962
-Nothing's changed.
-<i>Of course it has, Ezequiel.</i>

95
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,964
-How?
<i>-Are you blind?</i>

96
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,844
<i>For the first time in a hundred years,</i>
<i>someone was murdered here, on our side.</i>

97
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,429
-Tell me what that has--
<i>-Don't start again.</i>

98
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,725
Nair, please tell me what this has to do
with me and with my Process.

99
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,519
<i>You're the Process Leader,</i>

100
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,397
<i>responsible for everyone</i>
<i>who comes to the Offshore.</i>

101
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,775
He proved to be perfectly suitable
while he was here--

102
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,987
<i>I'm not the one you need to convince.</i>
<i>I'm just warning you,</i>

103
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,949
<i>there are those who want to blame you</i>
<i>for the first homicide in our history.</i>

104
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,828
<i>It's given Councilor Matheus</i>
<i>and his followers leverage.</i>

105
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,871
Matheus, of course.

106
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,998
<i>He wants his people</i>
<i>to take over the Process.</i>

107
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,625
<i>He wants a lighter Process,</i>
<i>a weaker Process.</i>

108
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,877
<i>To do things his way.</i>

109
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,587
This is my Process.

110
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,297
Only I can lead it.

111
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:19,220
Look, I have enough to worry about
at the moment, Nair. I'm sorry.

112
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,194
-Hi, how are you? My name is--
-Alex.

113
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,241
Before we begin, are you aware
we have no inclusion policies for--

114
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,200
Yes, I am.

115
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,411
You believe you can make it
through the Process?

116
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,620
Absolutely.

117
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,789
I'm going to ask a sensitive question.

118
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,583
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

119
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,630
Since the last time
I had enough water to waste.

120
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,217
Can we go out sometime?

121
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,470
I'd like to get to know you better
outside of these walls.

122
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,142
If all A's are B's,
but not all B's are C's,

123
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,395
is it possible to have an A
that's also a C?

124
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,563
Five seconds, okay?

125
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,571
I feel like I am one of...
I'm sure that I'm one of the best...

126
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,407
Listen, Carolina... take a breath.

127
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,535
I'll give you another chance
to pull yourself together.

128
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,540
I am... I'm sure I'm part
of the three percent of...

129
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,000
of people...

130
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,169
Elimination reason number two.

131
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,673
What? Eliminated now? I didn't know
I could be eliminated now--

132
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,467
Carolina, look at yourself.

133
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,220
If you don't believe you're worthy
of passing, how can I?

134
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,980
And what is your biggest weakness?

135
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,275
I care too much about people?

136
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,784
Just kidding.
But that's a good answer, right?

137
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,122
It's a place where each of us can grow

138
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,958
and reach our full potential.

139
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,754
-But it's also about helping others and--
-Enough. You answered the question.

140
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,255
May I just add another point?

141
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,883
I wanted to say it's about
thinking of the community and--

142
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,094
Have you seen this before?

143
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,306
It's graffitied everywhere.

144
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,809
And how do you feel about
the ideas of the Cause?

145
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,937
They're just a bunch of losers
who couldn't pass

146
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,022
and now they want to ruin everything.

147
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,941
Do you know anyone
who made it through?

148
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,903
-Luis, my boyfriend.
-Let go of me!

149
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,947
He wasn't understanding me!
I need to go back!

150
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,241
-Last year?
-Yes.

151
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,243
So you want to pass to be cured?

152
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,079
I have other ambitions and goals
as well as that one.

153
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,997
So, you want to pass to see him again.

154
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,416
-A romantic reunion?
-No.

155
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,542
-No?
-No.

156
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,003
He give you that necklace? If you're
not a romantic, why do you wear it?

157
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,840
-It's a souvenir.
-A souvenir!

158
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,884
Did your father raise you
to have faith in the Process?

159
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,719
Yes. He's a pastor.

160
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,472
You are one of the worst candidates
I've ever interviewed.

161
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,895
Maybe you're just the worst interviewer
there is.

162
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,022
Who do you think you are?

163
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,192
Don't you realize we have candidates
begging to not be eliminated?

164
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,279
I doubt the Offshore
is interested in beggars.

165
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,170
-But why?
-Enough. You're eliminated.

166
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,130
You're losing one of the best candidates.

167
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,258
You talked for 20 minutes
without saying anything original.

168
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,926
-Please--
-Memorized bullshit.

169
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,846
Please, one more chance.
I've dreamed of this my entire life.

170
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:16,058
I swear I'll shut up. Is that it?
Is it because I talk too much?

171
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,810
I won't say another word, I swear!

172
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,771
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
Don't eliminate me!

173
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,691
Instructions on how to overcome
the trauma of elimination

174
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,319
will be given to you
while you return your uniform.

175
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,281
-Please!
-Please, leave.

176
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,742
-Please!
-Another candidate needs this seat.

177
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:37,914
No! This is my seat! My seat! Let me go!
I'm not leaving! This is my dream!

178
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,624
I have to get to the Offshore!

179
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,920
Let me go! Please!
I swear, I swear, I'm good!

180
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:48,758
You are losing the best candidate!
I am the best! I am!

181
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,803
How do you picture the Offshore?

182
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,723
I imagine... I'll be happy.

183
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,475
I'll be with my family.

184
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,394
Relaxed. Safe. Fulfilled.

185
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,021
Now, how do I picture it?

186
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,900
If it's full of trees,
cars that can fly, I really don't know.

187
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,486
But I know I'm going to be surprised.

188
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,407
And don't you feel bad, Fernando?
For being a burden on your father?

189
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,870
I'm not a burden. It's the opposite.
He believes in me, in my abilities.

190
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,247
How touching.

191
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,291
Tell me something.
How do you know he actually made it?

192
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,418
He made it.

193
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,172
Sometimes, candidates don't return
due to unforeseen circumstances.

194
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,632
Unfortunate accidents.

195
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,842
You look very calm.

196
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,263
There's nothing to be afraid of.
My family has done well in the Process.

197
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,724
I have uncles, cousins... my parents.

198
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,770
Do you really believe
that gives you an advantage?

199
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,899
I am here to judge you,
not your family history.

200
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,194
I know.

201
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,738
That's not what I meant.

202
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,866
-Do you think your father loves you?
-Yes.

203
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,577
-Do you love him?
-Of course I do.

204
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,328
So, tell me three things about him.

205
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,288
He...

206
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,873
He...

207
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,710
I don't know off the top of my head.

208
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,714
Tell me something you admire him for,
something you've learned from him.

209
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,756
He...

210
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,551
He...

211
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,973
You told me that you love him.

212
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,935
You want to pass because your father's
been telling you to pass

213
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,813
-since you were a kid.
-No, I want to pass to end my pain

214
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,898
so he doesn't waste all his time on me.

215
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,736
Look, if you keep saying the same thing,
I'll eliminate you right now.

216
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,322
Why do you really want to pass?

217
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,657
So I won't have a life like his.

218
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,914
APPROVED

219
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,587
-What's his name again?
-Luis. Luis Ferreira.

220
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,839
Let's find out
if he really made it through.

221
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,468
Do you really want to know?

222
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,015
No. No, I don't care.
That's not why I want to pass.

223
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,684
So, I guess that necklace
doesn't mean anything, huh?

224
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,691
If you take too long, I'll question
your honesty and eliminate you.

225
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,126
Are you gonna cry?

226
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,927
You can move on to the next round.

227
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,805
APPROVED

228
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,014
You did the right thing.

229
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:44,850
He's dead.

230
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,168
Cássia, what about the son of a bitch
that was caught?

231
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,505
It's confirmed. He's with the Cause.
Going by the name Jorge.

232
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,341
Caught him alive, no collateral damage.

233
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,635
-Is that him?
-Yes.

234
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,764
-Has the interrogation started?
-Yes.

235
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,560
He told us one of this year's candidates
is a mole for the Cause.

236
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,816
He hasn't given us a name yet,
but it's just a matter of time.

237
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,069
If there is a mole among them,
I need to know as soon as possible.

238
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,912
They captured Jorge alive.

239
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,083
Those pigs are one step ahead of us.

240
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,338
The question is,
with Jorge now in their hands,

241
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,132
what can he reveal about the moles?

242
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,842
-Does he know names?
-No.

243
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,846
He knew I had sent someone.
He didn't have a name.

244
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,223
Maybe a few details.

245
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,475
-Why did he know any details at all?
-Calm down.

246
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,019
This puts the whole operation at risk.

247
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,355
Calm down.
We have to find out what he knew.

248
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,190
I know how to run my team.

249
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,943
And I know Jorge.
He's devoted to the Cause.

250
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,569
He would never betray us!

251
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:05,866
Take it easy. It's not about betrayal.
No one can withstand their torture.

252
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,746
We have to assume that whatever he knows,
the Process now knows.

253
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,922
<i>Hey, Cássia. Any news?</i>

254
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,340
He's still resisting.

255
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,553
He hasn't revealed the name of the mole,
but it's just a matter of time.

256
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,722
He's softening up.

257
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,900
This is bullshit! It's all bullshit!

258
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,862
Motherfuckers, there are
much worse candidates than me!

259
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,495
I feel bad for them.

260
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,331
Eliminated candidates, that way.

261
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,544
-Eliminated? That way.
-Hold on...

262
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,092
Yeah, but... there's nothing we can do.

263
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,013
It might be fair, but it's still sad.

264
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,524
Stand back!

265
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,568
Get back!

266
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,287
Dr. Gisele will take care
of the candidate.

267
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,873
Right now
we need everyone to remain calm.

268
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,501
If you need anything,
need to talk, counseling,

269
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,503
we are here to help you.

270
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,882
Don't let this interfere
with the most important day of your lives.

271
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,717
Keep going with your tests.

272
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,386
The Process continues this way. Follow me.

273
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,387
Okay.

274
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,362
Let's go.
It's hard, but we have to move on.

275
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:17,873
<i>Candidates, please report</i>
<i>to the registry scanner.</i>

276
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,055
Naughty boy. Aren't you ashamed?

277
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,434
-What?
-Your fake registration.

278
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,647
When they do it,
they only use three stitches.

279
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,026
I don't know what you're talking about.

280
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,364
Let's see what the scanner says.

281
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,667
WELCOME

282
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,245
This next test is very simple.

283
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,832
It evaluates your spatial logic,
geometric reasoning

284
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,501
and basic motor skills.

285
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:29,797
Using these pieces,
each of you will have three minutes

286
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,132
to assemble as many cubes as possible.

287
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,301
We expect a minimum of nine cubes.

288
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,054
Any less and you will be eliminated.

289
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:43,769
And when the table turns red,
it means your time is up.

290
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,063
One, two, three, begin.

291
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,660
Thanks.

292
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,163
What's her deal?
Trying to be politically correct?

293
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,666
Doesn't she know
it's every man for himself?

294
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:23,183
Damn it! I've asked them to fix this crap
a thousand times.

295
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,228
There we go.

296
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,354
That's my cube! What the fuck?

297
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,815
Time's up!
Whoever has nine cubes passes.

298
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,776
Didn't you see him steal my cube?

299
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,654
Time's up. Eight cubes.
Sorry, you're eliminated.

300
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,198
-Thanks for participating.
-Motherfucker!

301
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,327
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Take him.

302
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,079
No! Let me go!

303
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,957
Ezequiel, that kid stole the cube.

304
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,546
Nine, you passed.

305
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,425
Sorry, you've been eliminated.

306
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,264
Only eight cubes. Eliminated.

307
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:48,936
Eliminated.

308
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,322
Nine cubes? You passed.

309
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,827
Eight plus a cube made of cubes. Nine.

310
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,580
You passed as well.

311
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,585
Eliminated.

312
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,297
Nine.

313
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,509
Eleven?

314
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,061
Excuse me.

315
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,815
You have to understand,
while each test has an obvious goal,

316
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,651
what's really important
is what's behind them.

317
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,695
But you may not get that yet.

318
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,614
I'm not here to judge, Ezequiel.
I'm just recording the facts.

319
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,408
She will never understand, Ezequiel.

320
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,114
-Delicious.
-It's too sweet.

321
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:31,038
So, you... I heard...
I heard some of the girls talking.

322
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,914
They said you're an Álvares.

323
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,544
-Your family always passes.
-Yeah.

324
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,005
So? What's the secret?

325
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,216
Congeniality, of course.

326
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,140
I want to thank you, really.
What you did--

327
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,101
Forget it. It was nothing.

328
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,361
Look who's here.

329
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,321
That's him.

330
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,783
Is that him?

331
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,951
That's so messed up.

332
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,329
I don't understand
how the Process let him pass.

333
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,790
I don't get the criteria.

334
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,833
Look at him... Cheater.

335
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,966
Go on. Keep talking about me.
Go ahead. I don't care.

336
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,596
I'm impressed how everyone here
is so honest, so fair.

337
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,808
I just don't understand why
none of you did anything.

338
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,977
Why didn't anyone try to stop me
or help the other guy?

339
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,147
The ones in the room.
Why didn't you do anything?

340
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,193
Do you know why? Do you? Anyone?

341
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,989
I know. Because everyone is here
to make it through. Everyone.

342
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,575
And everyone will do
whatever it takes to pass.

343
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:57,541
I only did what everyone here
will do sooner or later. That's all.

344
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,835
And most importantly:

345
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,880
If you keep thinking
you're better than me...

346
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,717
then you'll lose. And you'll lose to me.

347
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,430
And you'll lose to everyone here
who really gets what's at stake.

348
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,472
For real.

349
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,602
What about you, big guy?
What do you say?

350
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,940
-Why don't you shut up?
-No, I want your opinion.

351
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,485
Are you saying you'd just
keep your head down

352
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,988
and accept elimination
without a word?

353
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,114
Would you do that?

354
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,158
Would you be that stupid?

355
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,659
Take your hands off me, cheater.

356
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,626
Take that, you son of a bitch!

357
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,379
Say something now, motherfucker!

358
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,714
Come on, loser!

359
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,424
Come on!

360
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,345
Come on! Come on!

361
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,057
That's enough! Stop! Leave the guy alone!

362
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,017
Let him go.

363
00:32:58,852 --> 00:32:59,769
Let's go.

364
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,218
You don't fool me.

365
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,220
I know you got beat up on purpose.

366
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,645
It worked. Now you have
a bunch of idiots on your side.

367
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,866
Actually, having a friend in the Process
isn't such a bad idea.

368
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,955
Me? Why me?

369
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,832
Because if you betray me...

370
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,460
I'll tell them your registration is fake.

371
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,515
I know you're very busy,

372
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,851
but if I wait until you have free time,
we'll never get a chance to talk.

373
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,939
I'm waiting for someone,
but in the meantime, go ahead.

374
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:31,111
Tell me, how would you evaluate
your performance over the last five years?

375
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,614
My productivity rates
have reached record levels.

376
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,993
What about adaptation?
Community well-being?

377
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,287
Your candidates haven't done well
in that area.

378
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,915
They didn't score well when compared
to productivity rates.

379
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,167
Which, once again,
have reached record levels.

380
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:50,005
Are you familiar with the concept
in which selected candidates

381
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,882
adopt the personality
of the Process Leader?

382
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,970
Sounds like the typical psychobabble
of Councilor Matheus.

383
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,680
Have you met?

384
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,354
How have you been feeling?

385
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,857
I'm great. What a question.
Why do you ask?

386
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,360
I'm just wondering
if you ever think about your wife.

387
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,404
-What?
-Julia.

388
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,532
I never met her,
but I heard what happened.

389
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,994
And even from afar,
it sounded painful. Even--

390
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,497
-I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
-Come in.

391
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,915
Aline was on her way out.

392
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,461
Actually, I would love to sit in
on your meeting, if you don't mind.

393
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,254
Please.

394
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,299
I was waiting for you.

395
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,680
I called you here to talk about
the candidate who committed suicide.

396
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,943
I did his interview, his evaluation,

397
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,613
and he definitely showed no--

398
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,615
Denise, I'm not questioning your judgment.

399
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,660
On the contrary, I'm worried about you.

400
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,663
I'm fine.

401
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,754
Agent Denise, sadly, suicide
is not uncommon among candidates.

402
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,548
They do it out of shame.

403
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,093
Because they are weak.

404
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,971
-It's pathetic.
-Pathetic.

405
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:27,227
But it takes a toll.
And there's no shame in admitting that.

406
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,981
We can't ignore our feelings...

407
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,609
or we'll never find happiness.

408
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:46,579
Of course, the suicide of a young man
with no merits is a tragedy.

409
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,081
But you...

410
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,459
you're a person of merit.

411
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,671
That's why it's always good...

412
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,597
Stop, Ezequiel!

413
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,669
I do that every day to remind myself
that what we do

414
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,755
is a matter of life and death.

415
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,301
I understand. Perfectly.

416
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,637
Do you see things more clearly?

417
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,586
Ezequiel, I would like to thank you.

418
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,048
Everything I've learned here
in such a short time

419
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,675
is beyond anything
I would've learned somewhere else.

420
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,511
Thank you.

421
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,901
Ezequiel, we have a lead.

422
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,986
<i>I want the mole's name.</i>

423
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,613
It's one of two candidates.

424
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,747
Michele? Bruna? Come with me, please.

425
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,475
Thank you, Bernardo.

426
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,143
This way.

427
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,282
-What's that?
-Close your eyes.

428
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,002
Here. Duck your head.

429
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,400
-I don't know what's happening.
-Me neither.

430
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,152
Look, I know what this is about.

431
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,781
You heard me complaining about the guy
who cheated in the test.

432
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,368
I won't criticize the Process anymore.
I've learned my lesson.

433
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,645
Have you two met before?

434
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,939
-Yes, we--
-We--

435
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,984
-We live on the same block.
-Where do you live?

436
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,696
I live on 7th Street,
block 35, apartment 42.

437
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,116
Same block, apartment 12.

438
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:57,038
We received some information
that a mole working for the Cause

439
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,248
lives on that same street,
on the same block.

440
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,292
How do you know that?

441
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:08,549
The fact is, we know that
one of you sitting here is the mole.

442
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,009
I just don't know which one.

443
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,053
So, I have three minutes to find out

444
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,014
who is with the Cause
and who is innocent.

445
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:18,309
And if I can't figure it out,
the recommended step

446
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,728
is that I kill both of you.

447
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,313
-Ma'am--
-There must be a mistake.

448
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,107
I don't know anyone in the Cause.

449
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,733
-Me neither.
-We know each other.

450
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,610
I swear to you--

451
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,946
Sit down! Stay back, please.

452
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,076
-This is a test.
-No, unfortunately, it's not.

453
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,422
I'm innocent!
I'm-- I am not with the Cause!

454
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,716
-I don't know anyone in the Cause!
-Me neither.

455
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,427
-I am not with the Cause.
-Neither am I.

456
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,178
-Are you accusing me?
-Of course not!

457
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,973
But she said it's one of us
and I'm saying it's not me.

458
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,017
-It's not me, either!
-Bruna, you know me.

459
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,729
-You know I'm not with the Cause!
-I can't sit here listening to excuses.

460
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,148
I need a confession, do you understand?

461
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,819
-Bruna, please...
-It's not me.

462
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:17,702
Whoever is with the Cause
and believes that they're a savior...

463
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:22,540
this is your chance to do something useful
for society and save someone's life.

464
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,503
Because you will die anyway
and take an innocent person with you.

465
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,734
Bruna, please...

466
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,986
if you are with the Cause, save my life.

467
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,780
I'm not with the Cause, Michele.

468
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,823
-I'm not.
-Then they have the wrong information.

469
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:56,866
Of course they do!

470
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,702
What are we going to do,
for God's sake?

471
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,538
-This isn't happening--
-We're gonna die.

472
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,373
We're already dead.

473
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,250
What are we gonna do?

474
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,128
Listen...

475
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,089
we have one way out.

476
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,632
We have to attack this woman.

477
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,302
-We have to attack her.
-We can't attack her. She's armed.

478
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,429
If we get her gun, she'll--

479
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,347
She won't.

480
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,390
It's you and me.

481
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,352
Two against one.

482
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:30,817
Bruna, when she comes back,
we'll take her gun.

483
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,236
We're gonna run away
from the Process.

484
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,445
We're gonna run away.

485
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,825
Bruna, we can't die now.
I don't wanna die.

486
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,369
Look at me.

487
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,372
Trust me, okay?

488
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,836
I'll give you a signal
and we'll attack her.

489
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,512
Your time is up.

490
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,724
Who's going to confess?

491
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,232
<i>Why do you want to make it through?</i>

492
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,318
I have a lot to offer the Offshore.

493
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,571
If I have enough merit,
you will see it in me.

494
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,207
Your boyfriend gave you this.

495
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,209
What boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend.

496
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,170
I know.

497
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,172
It's for the interviewer.

498
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,633
You have to say exactly
what the Process wants to hear.

499
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,111
It was Ezequiel.

500
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,823
-Ezequiel killed my brother.
-Don't think about that.

501
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,452
You won't get anywhere near Ezequiel.

502
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,164
And if you do, run. Stay away from him.

503
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,221
I'm sorry you had to see that.
Move aside.

504
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:31,979
Get up.

505
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,899
Get over there.

506
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,277
I think I can trust you.

507
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,155
I got this.

508
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,035
That's what my brother used to say.

509
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,956
Whenever I asked him for anything,
he'd say, "I got this."

510
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,462
You really loved him.

511
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,008
He was five years older than me and...

512
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,095
when our parents died...

513
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,684
Revenge isn't about killing Ezequiel.

514
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,521
It's destroying their entire world.

515
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:19,443
You have to act as if you blindly believe
in the Process.

516
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,572
Act completely naive.
Tell me... can you cry?

517
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,866
Yes.

518
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,827
That will be useful.

519
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:31,998
Are you gonna cry?

520
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:36,544
<i>The key is to hold back your tears.</i>
<i>Fight them back.</i>

521
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,379
That's what gets to them.

522
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,173
I got this.

523
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,178
Michele, what just happened
has to stay between us.

524
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:51,100
A mole for the Cause is not the concern
of the other candidates.

525
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,692
Where were you?

526
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,364
Michele, what happened?

527
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,227

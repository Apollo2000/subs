1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:03,337
You want to evaporate
every kernel of existence

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,794
because the Winchesters
won't do what you say.

3
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:09,218
Jack's powerless.

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,550
And Billie wants us dead.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,010
That's Chuck's Death Book?

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,722
Only Billie can read it.

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,014
Stop killing my people!

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,183
I didn't hurt your friends.

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,529
You killed me, Dean.

10
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:21,770
It was Chuck all along.

11
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,567
Everybody's gonna die, Cass, everybody.

12
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,442
Why does this sound like a goodbye?

13

14
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:29,838
Everyone's gone.

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,298
You see anybody on the way here?

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,008
No.

17
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,971
I couldn't save anybody.

18
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,806
Billie.

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,100
It wasn't Billie. It was Chuck.

20
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,144
- What?
- Where's Cass?

21
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,274
Dean?

22
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,822
He saved me.

23
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,991
Billie was coming after us,

24
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,745
and Cass summoned the Empty.

25
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,331
It took her.

26
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,500
And it took him.

27
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,298
Cass is gone.

28
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,975
This can't be happening.

29
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,435
It is, Sam.

30
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,729
I think everyone's gone.

31
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,449
Hey, it's Jody.

32
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,636
I can't get to the phone
right now, so leave a message.

33
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,621
Jack, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,046
Hey. You know who it is.

35
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,882
You know what to do. Catch you later.

37
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,176
Hey.

38
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,929
♪ I am lonely ♪

39
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,100
It brings a whole new meaning
to the term "sudden death".

40
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,519
Dean, do you think we're it?

41
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,104
All that's left?

42
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,190
♪ We never had... ♪

43
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,567
Yeah.

44
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,155
You, me, Jack.

45
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,830
Cass?

46
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,861
Hey.

47
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,823
So, um, what now?

48
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,662
I did this.

49
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,231
We could have just given
Chuck what he wanted,

50
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:53,333
you know, his grand finale.

51
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,669
But I resisted. I pulled the thread.

52
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,630
I thought we could beat
this game, do it better.

53
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,718
We tried to rewrite him, and
the whole world paid the price.

54
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,263
- Sam, we can...
- We can what?

55
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,431
There's nothing left, Dean.

56
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,516
No one left to save.

57
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,744
Everybody's gone.

58
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:11,871
You can't just give up.

59
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:13,520
What other choice do we have?

60
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,203
Think he'll show?

61
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,584
He better.

62
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,796
Hey, guys.

63
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,549
Enjoying a little alone time?

64
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,554
Alright, Chuck. You win.

65
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,889
Well... sure.

66
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,641
I always do.

67
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,311
Me being me.

68
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,895
Is that it or...

69
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,439
We'll give you what you want.

70
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,734
That's right. The whole
Cain-and-Abel thing.

71
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,819
Us dead. Whatever.

72
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,279
I'll kill Sam. Sam will kill me.

73
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,573
We'll kill each other. Okay? You pick.

74
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:10,074
But, first, you got to put
everything back the way it was.

75
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:13,445
The people, the birds, Cass.

76
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:16,541
You got to bring him back.

77
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,501
We're surrendering.

78
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,130
We're giving up.

79
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,259
Yeah, no.

80
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,470
I mean, I appreciate the white flag,

81
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,306
but, frankly, it's too little, too late.

82
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,516
I'm kind of enjoying this story now.

83
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,768
You can't.

84
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,687
Oh, no, see, I'm the almighty.

85
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,522
I really can.

86
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,274
I mean, picture it.

87
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,817
The two of you...

88
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,819
And your little lapdog Jack...

89
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,364
Rotting on a lifeless planet,

90
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,074
knowing it's this way

91
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,580
because you wouldn't take a knee.

92
00:06:55,123 --> 00:07:01,294
Eternal shame,
suffering, and loneliness.

93
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,671
Whew!

94
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,714
That's deep.

95
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,801
That's sophisticated.

96
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,302
That's a page-turner.

97
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,211
Dean?

98
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:42,629
Hey.

99
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,175
Look out.

100
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:48,427
You okay?

101
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:51,847
I feel terrific.

102
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,322
Guys, I'm...

103
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,491
feeling something weird.

104
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,452
Yeah, me, too, pal.

105
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:14,703
We need aspirin.

106
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,538
I'm sensing a presence.

107
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,542
There's something out
there... besides us.

108
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:23,388
Something like people?

109
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,266
I don't know.

110
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,645
How are you sensing anything?

111
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,301
I thought you were all powered down.

112
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:32,137
I'm not sure.

113
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,014
But I feel it.

114
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

115
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:01,208
Look at you. Hey.

116
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,503
Wow.

117
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,880
How did Chuck miss you?

118
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:09,925
Whoever thought finding a
dog would feel like a miracle?

119
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:11,968
Come on, Miracle. Come here.

120
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,929
Sammy.

121
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:15,555
Check it out.

122
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:17,140
You found a dog?

123
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,017
Yeah.

124
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,769
I guess Chuck didn't get everything.

125
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,605
I mean, maybe there's
people he missed, you know?

126
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,899
Look, either way, this
guy's coming home with us.

127
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,651
You're gonna let a
dog sit in the Impala?

128
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,903
Relax. I'm not giving him shotgun.

129
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:32,280
Unless you're cool with that.

130
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:33,406
I'll get Jack.

131
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,908
Don't worry about him.
He'll warm up to you.

132
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,995
Maybe we'll let you sleep in his room.

133
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,040
Here we go. Good boy.

134
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:45,126
Hey. Come here.

135
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:47,337
You know, believe it or not,

136
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,723
you're the best thing that's
happened in the last few days.

137
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:51,508
Yeah, you are. Good boy.

138
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:14,865
Unbelievable.

139
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:17,659
Can't even save a friggin' dog.

140
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:20,120
Yeah, maybe that's the point.

141
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:22,289
No one left to help.

142
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,832
No one but us.

143
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,769
You sure about this, Jack?

144
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:47,063
Whatever you're picking
up on is in there?

145
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:50,984
In there or very nearby.

146
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:54,195
Guys, I have no idea
what we're walking into.

147
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,607
So...

148
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:32,660
you survived.

149
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:36,279
Michael.

150
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,331
When the rapture first
began, I took refuge here.

151
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,043
It is St. Michael's,
you may have noticed.

152
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,836
Are you hiding out from your dad?

153
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:54,714
I'm sure he's aware I
took your side against him.

154
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,716
I've avoided using any powers

155
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,797
that might attract his attention.

156
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,516
And Adam?

157
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,977
Gone.

158
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,354
I'm sorry to say.

159
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:11,606
Exterminated by my father,

160
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,233
like everyone else.

161
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,026
Poor bastard never caught a break.

162
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:17,070
How did the three of you manage?

163
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,781
Apparently, your old
man has a sense of humor.

164
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,199
He thought it would be hilarious

165
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:24,577
to watch the three of
us on an empty planet.

166
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:30,208
What, are you, uh... doing some reading?

167
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,461
I never spent much time on Earth.

168
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:38,383
I was... curious about the
perception of God and Heaven.

169
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:39,634
And?

170
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:42,220
Amazingly, the believers loved him.

171
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:45,098
They have for thousands of years.

172
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,797
I guess my efforts were more
effective than I'd hoped.

173
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:50,770
Y-Your efforts?

174
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:53,273
When God left Heaven, I
was certain of his return.

175
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,358
So I made sure all of the angels

176
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,904
and prophets burnished
his image on Earth.

177
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:04,034
The all-knowing,
all-seeing, all-caring God.

178
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,329
Daddy's boy.

179
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,541
And now?

180
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,585
After seeing what Chuck's done?

181
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:17,589
We reached out to you.

182
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:19,591
You ignored us.

183
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:21,092
That was then.

184
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:25,764
This is now.

185
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,766
Tell me what you need me to do.

186
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,190
Alright, Michael.

187
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:38,693
Here's the book we've
been telling you about.

188
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,448
That's one of Death's books.

189
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,785
Yeah, but this one is about God.

190
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:48,453
And how to kill him.

191
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:50,497
As far as we know,
only Death can open it.

192
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:52,165
But, um...

193
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:56,127
we're hoping, uh... maybe you can, too.

194
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,945
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,293
So, where does this leave us?

196
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,797
We need that book open,
and we're out of options.

197
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,341
Where's it leave us?

198
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,968
Screwed.

199
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,097
I'm sure Chuck's ready to make a move.

200
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,063
What?

201
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,690
Cass?

202
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,650
Dean. I'm here.

203
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,445
I'm hurt. Can you let me in?

204
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,999
Wassup?

205
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,463
Wow! Way to treat a pal.

206
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,215
No, you're not our "pal".

207
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,550
Okay, be honest with me, please.

208
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,846
Would you have let me in
if I said it was really me?

209
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,180
You're dead.

210
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,599
Uh... yeah, not so much.

211
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,557
Um, after pop nutted out

212
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,271
and murdered pretty much
everyone in the world,

213
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,191
the Empty booted me with orders to find

214
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,278
the missing God Book
and use it on Chuck.

215
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,405
Uh, normally, I'm not very
good at following orders,

216
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,032
as you guys know, but, uh,

217
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,534
you do not want to mess
with the Empty, man.

218
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,662
Total "B", especially after

219
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,039
Jack blew up all over
her, and she killed Death.

220
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,792
I mean,
guys, never a dull moment.

221
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,752
But that's the past.

222
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,463
What's up?!

223
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,423
We're a team again, guys.

224
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,758
Oh, that is not happening.

225
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,801
Mm.

226
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,136
Yeah.

227
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,554
Alright, team.

228
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,181
I don't want to bring
ants to your picnic,

229
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,267
but that ain't gonna cut it.

230
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,643
Okay, think about it.

231
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,232
If the Empty pulled me off the bench,

232
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:25,190
it's 'cause the Winchester
charm ain't enough, right?

233
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,235
And I did anticipate a
little bit of pushback,

234
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,947
so I did bring a token of good faith.

235
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,490
Voilà.

236
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,204
Who is she?

237
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,832
Oh, this is Betty.
Betty... Betty, say hi.

238
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,251
No, no, no. Say hi to the boys.

239
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,837
Just getting it straight.

240
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,756
Oh, did I mention Betty is a reaper?

241
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,217
I'm doing a fly-by, right? Okay.

242
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,762
I'll say that again. Betty is a reaper.

243
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,097
Yes, we heard you.

244
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,682
So what?

245
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,225
Watch.

246
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,816
Wow!

247
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,900
Really?!

248
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,527
Great.

249
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,863
Oh, no, this is...
This is the first reaper

250
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,948
to check out since Billie, right?

251
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,870
So... wait for it.

252
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,789
Wait for it.

253
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,584
Ohhh...

254
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,210
And...

255
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,629
Meet the new Death.

256
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,367
- Wow.
- You okay?

257
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,659
Yeah.

258
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,537
Wow. Look at that.

259
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,915
I mean, she's got the whole
Death starter kit going

260
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,416
with the decoder ring.

261
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,793
Isn't that awesome?

262
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,337
And that, whatever that is. Yeah.

263
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,798
I'm good, right?

264
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,384
So, do you have it?

265
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,971
The book. Hand over the book.

266
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,181
- Wow. Slower than they look.
- Yeah.

267
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,227
Okay, the end of God
is in the special book,

268
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:29,439
and if you give Betty the
book, Betty can read it.

269
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,192
Understand?

270
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,288
Uh... not a group project.

271
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,549
Wow.

272
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,759
Look at you, bro.

273
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,970
The almost-mighty.

274
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,350
Hmm. I cheated.

275
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,021
Are you seriously thinking
about trusting him?

276
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,899
Uh, I wouldn't exactly say "trust".

277
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,609
Mikey, Mikey, come on, man.

278
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,902
I get the bitterness.

279
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,279
For all you did for the old man,

280
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,014
you got no better from him than me.

281
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:21,618
The son voted Most Likely
to Suck, and that sucks.

282
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:24,108
I did what I did because it
was the right thing to do,

283
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:25,245
not to get his love.

284
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,663
Alright, well, that's a good thing,

285
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,248
'cause the man had no love to give...

286
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,334
Not to you, not to
me, not to... humanity.

287
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,380
You see that now, right?

288
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,009
Asshats.

289
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,013
I have opened the book.

290
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,805
- And?
- And it's in here...

291
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,351
all that you want.

292
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,978
I know how God ends.

293
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,939
Wait a second. You're sure about this?

294
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,107
Of course I'm sure. I'm Death.

295
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,653
You've been Death for an hour.

296
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,489
"Behold, in the end,

297
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,537
there is the ending of he
who created the beginning."

298
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,474
Fascinating.

299
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:06,370
"And, thus, it will be..."

300
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,840
Yeah, this is what Pop
wanted to get his hands on.

301
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,426
Hmm. Did I say that out loud?

302
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,185
Yeah, Pop was the one who
let me out of the Empty.

303
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,391
I'm sort of the new favorite now.

304
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,892
What did Dad say about you?

305
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,435
Oh, yeah.

306
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,189
"Mikey's a cuck."

307
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,899
You're a cuck.

308
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,276
Nope.

309
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,030
D'oh!

310
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,120
Wow, you are really getting
rusty at this, buddy.

311
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,329
Bye.

312
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,503
So... buddy...

313
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,588
you're gonna have to
make a decision now.

314
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,936
Uh, dump the losers

315
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:04,107
and join Gramps and
me on the winning team.

316
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,015
Of course, this is the only way

317
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,725
you're getting out of here alive,

318
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,644
'cause you're not strong
enough to fight me now, so...

319
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,856
What do you say, kid? What do you say?

320
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,983
Come on.

321
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,281
Somebody's behind me?

322
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,494
You don't learn.

323
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,507
Thanks for the blade.

324
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,151
How you doing? You okay?

325
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:14,610
Yeah, a bit winded.

326
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:18,573
I haven't been in a battle
like that for several centuries.

327
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:21,910
Yeah, well...

328
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:23,453
...glad you were here.

329
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,330
Chuck's getting desperate.

330
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:27,707
He knows something's up.

331
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:30,126
Wouldn't take the chance
of showing up himself.

332
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:31,628
Yes.

333
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,172
He sent Lucifer.

334
00:22:34,174 --> 00:22:37,008
Brought him back from the dead.

335
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,718
He didn't even reach out to me.

336
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,164
- Did you want him to?
- Of course not.

337
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,103
I mean, he clearly knows the
God Book could be lethal to him.

338
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,773
But it's actually fairly
useless without Death to read it.

339
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:55,404
Yeah, well... at least it's open.

340
00:22:56,863 --> 00:22:58,321
Sam thought that he recognized

341
00:22:58,323 --> 00:22:59,656
some of the symbols in the writing,

342
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:02,450
thought they might be
some form of Enochian.

343
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:04,703
So he's gonna use the
Book of the Damned,

344
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:06,621
see if he can figure out the end.

345
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:09,833
And by that, I mean... the end.

346
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,643
How's, uh, Sam doing? Any progress?

347
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:31,313
I hope so. He's been
in there a long time.

348
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:34,858
Oh. Why don't you ask him yourself.

349
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,568
Sorry. It's slow going.

350
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,570
But I think I was able
to piece it together.

351
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:39,821
"It"?

352
00:23:39,823 --> 00:23:41,740
The spell. There's a spell.

353
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:45,452
It has to be done at
a particular place...

354
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:48,747
at an exact angle from the sun.

355
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:51,291
But it will release an unstoppable force

356
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:55,045
that will find Chuck...

357
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,671
and finish him.

358
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,852
Let's light it up.

359
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,870
Wait. What happened? What's wrong?

360
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,351
Father.

361
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:54,562
Son.

362
00:24:54,564 --> 00:24:58,900
And, listen, I appreciate
the heads-up about all this.

363
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:01,486
It's always been my
destiny to serve you.

364
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:02,862
Yeah.

365
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:06,408
The thing is, it's kind
of late in the game.

366
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,910
You did side with the Winchesters.

367
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:11,538
- I can't forgive that.
- Father, no.

368
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,293
That was a lapse of judgment,
I admit, but I swear I...

369
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:16,126
Save it!

370
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:42,819
And you two.

371
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:45,697
You know, eternal suffering
sounds good on paper,

372
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:50,410
but as a viewing experience,
it's just kind of... eh.

373
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:52,328
So we're done.

374
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,583
I'm canceling your show.

375
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:57,500
Alright.

376
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:00,089
Well... one for the road.

377
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,091
Cute.

378
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,646
Eh, what the heck.

379
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:20,275
I can get my hands dirty.

380
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,374
Fellas, give it up now.

381
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:51,930
Come on, guys.

382
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,973
Just stay down.

383
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:02,982
That's enough, guys.

384
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:04,943
Guys, come on.

385
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,656
Just stay down.

386
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:15,119
Fellas, give it up.

387
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:29,300
That's enough, guys.

388
00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:30,677
Guys, come on.

389
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,220
That's enough.

390
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:40,853
Why are you smiling?

391
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:43,648
Because.

392
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,441
You lose.

393
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,580
Hey, Jack.

394
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:05,855
What... What did you do?

395
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:07,567
We won.

396
00:29:09,652 --> 00:29:11,902
So this is how it ends.

397
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:13,905
My book.

398
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:15,904
See for yourself.

399
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:29,420
There's nothing there.

400
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:30,963
Oh, there is.

401
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,548
But only Death can read it.

402
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,592
That's right.

403
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,344
So we had to come up with a plan "B".

404
00:29:36,346 --> 00:29:38,054
That wasn't too hard, though,

405
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:41,683
when we realized that Michael
really is a daddy's boy.

406
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:44,162
Oh, yeah. "Mikey's a cuck."

407
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:45,645
See, he didn't take it too well

408
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:48,189
when he found out that
you asked Lucifer for help.

409
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:51,317
Oh, he was desperate to
be the favorite again.

410
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:55,125
Since we couldn't read the book,

411
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,657
we had to come up with a
story about finding the spell,

412
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,244
which we knew Michael
would feed straight to you.

413
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:03,705
All that prep work we did

414
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:06,082
to turn Jack here into a cosmic bomb?

415
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:09,001
Oh.

416
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:13,256
Well, it turned him
into sort of a-a power vacuum.

417
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,842
He's been sucking up bits
of power all over the place.

418
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:18,136
So when the two
heavyweights... Your boys...

419
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:21,305
Showed up to duke it out, ohh.

420
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:25,768
That charged him right up.

421
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,189
See, we knew Michael would
warn you and you'd show up here.

422
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,859
And you did. And you
killed your own son.

423
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:34,769
And you beat the crap out of us.

424
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:38,239
Releasing all kinds of power.

425
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:40,158
God power.

426
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,659
Jack absorbed it all.

427
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:44,078
- It made him...
- Well, it made him unstoppable.

428
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:57,761
This... This... This is
why you're my favorites.

429
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:01,053
You know, for the first time,

430
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:03,765
I have no idea what happens next.

431
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:06,186
Is this where you kill me?

432
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:12,148
I mean, I could never think
of an ending where I lose.

433
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,361
But this, after everything
that I've done to you...

434
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:21,866
to die at the hands of Sam Winchester...

435
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:27,244
Of Dean Winchester,

436
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,956
the ultimate killer...

437
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:36,086
It's kind of glorious.

438
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:47,847
Sorry, Chuck.

439
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,426
What?

440
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,584
What?

441
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,449
See, that's not who I am.

442
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:05,076
That's not who we are.

443
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:06,744
What kind of an ending is this?

444
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,451
His power.

445
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,247
You sure it won't come back?

446
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,878
It's not his power anymore.

447
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:21,801
Then I think it's the ending
where you're just like us

448
00:32:21,803 --> 00:32:25,429
and like all the other
humans you forgot about.

449
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,100
It's the ending where you grow old,

450
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:32,645
you get sick, and you just die.

451
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,561
And no one cares.

452
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:37,441
And no one remembers you.

453
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:39,861
You're just forgotten.

454
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,496
Guys...

455
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:53,666
Guys... wait.

456
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:59,422
Guys...

457
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:01,090
Guys!

458
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:03,593
No, wait. G-Guys...

459
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:05,761
Guys, wait!

460
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:08,412
Guys, wait!

461
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:10,141
Guys, wait!

462
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:11,976
Wait, wait, wait!

463
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:13,019
Please wait!

464
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:14,114
Guys!

465
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:56,023
Alright, kid, you really
think you can pull this off?

466
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,884
In other news, yes, it's
that time of year again.

467
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:25,803
You guessed it.

468
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:02,840
Thank you so much.

469
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:17,062
Way to go.

470
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,856
I mean it.

471
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:20,691
Way to go.

472
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:24,653
So... does this mean you're the new...

473
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,114
I mean, what do we call you?

474
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:28,603
Who cares what we call him?

475
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:31,368
Look, all that matters
is he got us back online.

476
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,871
Hey, what happened
to Amara when Chuck...

477
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:35,873
She's with me.

478
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:38,542
We're in harmony.

479
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:40,836
You gonna come back
with us to the bunker?

480
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,710
What do you mean? Of course he's
gonna come back to the bunker.

481
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:44,423
He's the man with the
plan. He's top dog.

482
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,671
He can do whatever
he wants now. Come on.

483
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:48,311
You know what? We'll
spruce the place up.

484
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,330
We'll get some recliners.

485
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:51,096
We'll get you one of
those big-screen TVs.

486
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:53,642
Dean, I'm not coming back home.

487
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,061
In a way... I'm already there.

488
00:35:58,064 --> 00:35:59,313
Where?

489
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:01,106
Everywhere.

490
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:05,110
So you are him.

491
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,950
I'm me.

492
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,953
But I know what you mean.

493
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,041
What if we want to see you?

494
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,918
You know, or have a beer or whatever?

495
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,586
I'm around.

496
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:25,923
I'll be in every drop of falling rain,

497
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:30,094
every speck of dust that the wind blows,

498
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:35,307
and in the sand, in
the rocks, and the sea.

499
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:37,867
It's a hell of a time to bail.

500
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,686
You got a lot of people counting on you,

501
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,438
people with questions.
They're gonna need answers.

502
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,690
And those answers will
be in each of them.

503
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:48,821
Maybe not today, but... someday.

504
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:59,373
People don't need to pray
to me or to sacrifice to me.

505
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:02,907
They just need to know that
I'm already a part of them

506
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,879
and to trust in that.

507
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:10,217
I won't be hands on.

508
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,761
Chuck put himself in the story.

509
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,513
That was his mistake.

510
00:37:14,515 --> 00:37:19,810
But I learned from you

511
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:24,398
and my mother and Castiel that...

512
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,403
when people have to be their best...

513
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:30,571
they can be.

514
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,251
And that's what to believe in.

515
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:48,630
Well...

516
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:51,508
I'm really as close as this.

517
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,600
Goodbye.

518
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:21,163
See ya, Jack.

519
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,973
It's pretty quiet.

520
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:42,853
Mm-hmm.

521
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:49,091
To everyone that we lost along the way.

522
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:05,874
You know, with Chuck not
writing our story anymore,

523
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,542
we get to write our own.

524
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:14,591
You know, just you and me going
wherever the story takes us.

525
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:19,805
Just us.

526
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:22,218
Finally free.

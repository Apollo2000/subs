1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:01,501
We're surrendering.

2
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:02,752
We'll kill each other.

3
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,337
I'm kind of enjoying
this story now.

4
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,506
The two of you...
Rotting on a lifeless planet.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:09,968
Why are you smiling?

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,010
You lose.

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,514
What did you do?

8
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,558
Your boys...
Showed up to duke it out,

9
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,310
turned Jack
into a power vacuum.

10
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,603
And you killed your own son.

11
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,897
Releasing
all kinds of God power.

12
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,107
What do we call you?

13
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,275
I'm me.

14
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,360
People won't need
to pray to me

15
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,571
or to sacrifice to me.

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,367
With Chuck not
writing our story anymore,

17
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,535
we get to write our own.

18
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,745
Finally free.

20
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,856
Ohhhh!

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,316
Hey, buddy.

22
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,735
Good morning.
Ohhh!

23
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,137
Mmm.

24
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,807
It's hot.

25
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,183
Hot bread!

26
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,201
There you go.
Good boy.

27
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,212
Nothing weird
coming over the wire.

28
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,923
Social media looks clean.

29
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,883
You got anything?

30
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,055
Dean?

31
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,808
I got something.

32
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,544
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

33
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,047
Oh, I don't
have a choice.

34
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,967
This is my destiny.

35
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,891
It's just so beautiful.

36
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,142
Are you crying?

37
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,352
What? No.

38
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,396
Crying.
I'm...

39
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,984
I'm gonna go get some, uh...
Pie.

40
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,778
I'm gonna get
some damn pie.

41
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,120
Excuse me. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

42
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,788
Hey.

43
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,708
Ah!

44
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,418
What? What's wrong?

45
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,669
Nothing. I'm fine.

46
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,878
No, come on.
I know that face.

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,172
That's, uh...
That Sad Sam face.

48
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,092
I'm not Sad Sam.

49
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,012
I'm just...

50
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,514
I'm thinking about Cass,
you know?

51
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,765
Jack.

52
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,434
If they could be here.

53
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,311
Yeah.

54
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,939
Yeah, no.
I think about 'em, too.

55
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,442
You know what?
That pain's not gonna go away.

56
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,901
Right?

57
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,945
But if we don't
keep living,

58
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,866
then all that sacrifice
is gonna be for nothing.

59
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,411
So quit being a friggin' Eeyore,
huh?

60
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,705
Come on.

61
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,206
Get into this.

62
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,584
Yeah, you're right.

63
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,386
I have wanted to do that
for a very long time.

64
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,808
Oh, you're right.
Feel better.

65
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,023
Okay, Brady.
Your move.

66
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,942
Okay.

67
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,402
Come on, kids.
Upstairs.

68
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,987
Bath time.

69
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,842
Lyle?

70
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,302
Probably just some kids.

71
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,720
It's...

72
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,976
Run!

73
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,435
Singer and Kripke.
FBI.

74
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,936
Feds do
home invasions now?

75
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,771
Oh, yeah.
We're full service.

76
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,231
Something weird
over the wire.

77
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,108
One of the bodies...
Its blood was drained?

78
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,194
Oh, yeah.
Throat torn out, the whole nine.

79
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,862
Some kind of cannibal crap.

80
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,197
And the kids?

81
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,824
Taken.

82
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,367
What about the mom?
They left her,

83
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,827
but they ripped out her tongue.

84
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,163
Any idea what these guys
look like?

85
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,206
Kinda.

86
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,751
She drew this.

87
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,836
Hey, sarge?
You got a second?

88
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,004
Excuse me.

89
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,797
Sure.
Thanks for your time.

90
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,468
I recognize that face.

91
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,136
Yeah, me too.

92
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,684
Alright.
Let's see.

93
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,896
I think it was in '86.

94
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,564
Dad was working
a string of kidnappings

95
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,441
along Route 77.
77.

96
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,692
So, uh...

97
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,195
Akron, Canton,
East Sparta.

98
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,949
He didn't find much,
but the witness did draw this.

99
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,162
Kids were taken.

100
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,735
The adults that weren't drained
had their...

101
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,957
Had their tongues
ripped out.

102
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,626
Yeah.

103
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,839
You know what this is?

104
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,883
Mimes.

105
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,927
Evil mimes.

106
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,012
Yeah, or vampires.

107
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,889
Vamp-mimes.

108
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,266
Son of a bitch.

109
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,268
Alright.

110
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,396
Well, if this is the same nest
and if the pattern holds,

111
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,231
then they'll target
Canton next.

112
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,941
Okay.
It says here that, uh...

113
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,639
they target families that
are living outside of town,

114
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,111
that are isolated,

115
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,613
kids usually between the ages
of 5 and 10.

116
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,448
Okay.

117
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,618
So, who in Canton
fits that bill?

118
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,031
Hey!

119
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,633
Hey.

120
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,884
Hey there, sleepy.

121
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,637
What'd you hit me with?

122
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,973
Oh, it speaks.

123
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,684
Not a mime.
Still evil, though.

124
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,647
It was a bullet...
Soaked in dead man's blood.

125
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,941
So, let's talk kids, hmm?

126
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,153
Those two that you grabbed
a couple nights ago...

127
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,821
Where are they?

128
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,368
Yeah, you really
should tell him.

129
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,205
And if I do, what?

130
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,414
You let me go?

131
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,083
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no. No.

132
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,753
This isn't a you-walk-out-
of-here kind of a situation.

133
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,213
But, see,
if you tell us quick,

134
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,507
you get this.

135
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,635
But if you take your time,
you get, uh...

136
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,929
you get that.

137
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,640
Yeah, I'll...
I'll take that itty-bitty one.

138
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,184
That's a bad choice.

139
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,061
You see, this...
This is quick.

140
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,270
It's clean.

141
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,147
You know,
no muss, no fuss.

142
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,526
You blink,
and you're dead.

143
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,361
But a blade
this small...

144
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,071
I'm gonna have to keep
sawing and sawing

145
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,781
to get your head off,

146
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,282
and you'll feel it.

147
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,159
Every muscle, tendon,

148
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,744
every inch.

149
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,539
It could take hours.

150
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,168
Oh, and if those
kids are dead,

151
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,045
he's gonna use a spoon.

152
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,385
They...

153
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,470
They're not dead.

154
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,389
They're with the nest.

155
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,185
We...
take a harvest.

156
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,062
Every few years,

157
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,773
grab a couple kids,

158
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,859
raise them up,

159
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,402
feed them right,

160
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,571
juice them.

161
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,740
We don't do fast food.

162
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,617
Yeah. Alright.

163
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,870
Where are they?

164
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,019
This the place?

165
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,479
Dark, creepy,

166
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,522
something out of
Wes Craven's erotic fantasy?

167
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,025
Yeah.
It's 100% the place.

168
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,236
Alright.

169
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,670
Come on, one time.

170
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,047
No.

171
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,715
Why not?

172
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,800
No.

173
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,468
But we could...

174
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,433
Go with the machete.

175
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,310
Hey, boys.
Okay. Come on.

176
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,187
Stay behind us.
We're gonna keep you safe.

177
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,564
Come on.

178
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,822
Go. Go. Go.

179
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,115
Run!

180
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,246
Okay.

181
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,279
Well, I know you.

182
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,782
Jenny.

183
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,749
Son of a bitch.

184
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,250
Hey, Dean.

185
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,633
Well, look at you.

186
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,263
You know, we tried to kill
each other back in the day.

187
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,515
Yeah.

188
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,643
This is so weird.

189
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,341
It's like running into somebody
in high school, you know?

190
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,188
Somebody you
don't want to see.

191
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,856
Well, you look good.

192
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,316
You do.

193
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,236
I mean, a little dead,
but, uh, good.

194
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,612
Thanks.

195
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,072
So, what, are you,
like, the, uh...

196
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,407
The big boss or something?

197
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,658
No.

198
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,326
I just called dibs.

199
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,795
Alright.

200
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,505
Let's go find
those kids,

201
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,965
get them outta here.

202
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,133
Sam...

203
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,471
I don't... Mm.

204
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,139
I don't think
I'm going anywhere.

205
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,390
What?

206
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,225
What are you
talking about?

207
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,936
There's something in my...
Something in my back.

208
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,732
It feels like
it's right through me.

209
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,074
Oh, God.

210
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,119
Alright. Um...

211
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,829
Hold on. Okay.
Uh, I got you.

212
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,207
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't... Don't... Don't move me.

213
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,792
Don't move me.

214
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,073
It feels like this thing's
holding me together right now.

215
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,342
Just give me...
Just give me a minute.

216
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,635
Yeah.

217
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,220
Um... alright.

218
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,043
I'll call for help.
I'll get the first-aid kit.

219
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,973
Sam, Sam! Sam...

220
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,103
Stay wi...
Stay with me.

221
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,941
Can you stay with me,
please?

222
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,400
Okay.

223
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,069
Yeah.

224
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,154
Okay.

225
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,657
Okay.

226
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,202
Uh... right.

227
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,662
Alright.
Listen to me.

228
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,748
Um...

229
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,708
You get those boys

230
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,169
and you get them some place safe,
alright?

231
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,507
Dean...

232
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,176
are gonna get them
somewhere safe.

233
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,221
No.

234
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,061
You knew it was always
gonna end like this for me.

235
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,189
It was supposed
to end like this, right?

236
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,401
I mean, look at us.

237
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,902
Saving people,
hunting things...

238
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,529
It's what we do. No, no.
Stop, okay?

239
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,906
Just... Just stop.

240
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,575
It's okay.

241
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,494
It's okay.
It's good.

242
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,745
It's good.

243
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,417
We had one hell
of a ride, man.

244
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,424
I will find a way, okay?
I-I will find another way.

245
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,718
No, man. No.

246
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,928
No. No, no, no, no.
No bringing me back, okay?

247
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,973
You know...
You know that always ends bad.

248
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,475
Dean...

249
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,729
Okay.
P-Please.

250
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,649
I'm fading pretty...
I'm fading pretty quick, so...

251
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,139
there's a few things
that I need you to hear.

252
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,195
Come here.

253
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,071
Let me look at you.

254
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,828
Yeah, there he is.

255
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,792
I'm so proud of you, Sam.

256
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,339
You know that?

257
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,466
I've always
looked up to you.

258
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:25,766
Man, when we were kids,
you were so damn smar... smart.

259
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,643
You never...

260
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,311
You never took
any of dad's crap.

261
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,396
I never knew
how you did that.

262
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,402
And you're stronger
than me.

263
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,279
You always have been.

264
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,452
Hey, did I ever tell you...
Did I ever tell you

265
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,412
that night that, uh...

266
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,289
that I ca...

267
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,001
That I came for you
when you were at school?

268
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,504
You know, when dad

269
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,049
hadn't come back
from his hunting trip?

270
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,176
Yeah, um...
Uh, the Woman in White.

271
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,220
The Woman in White.
That's right.

272
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:10,185
I must have stood
outside your dorm for hours...

273
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,354
because I didn't...
I didn't know what...

274
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,898
What you would say.

275
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,567
I thought you'd tell me
to... to get lost

276
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,821
or get dead.

277
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,784
And I don't know what
I would've done...

278
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,786
if I didn't have you.

279
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,291
'Cause I was so scared.

280
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,084
I was scared,

281
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,407
'cause when it all
came down to it,

282
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,422
it was always you and me.

283
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,507
It's always been you...

284
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,092
and me.

285
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,100
Then don't leave me.

286
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,477
Don't leave me.

287
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,108
I can't do this alone.

288
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,569
Yes, you can.

289
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,700
Well, I don't want to.

290
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,121
Hey.

291
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,998
I'm not leaving you.

292
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,295
I'm gonna be with you...

293
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,130
Right here...

294
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,591
every day.

295
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,760
Every day you're out there
and you're Li...

296
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,678
And you're living

297
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,555
and you're fighting,
'cause you...

298
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,557
You always keep fighting.

299
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,434
You hear me?

300
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,522
I'll be there
every step.

301
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,361
I love you so much.

302
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,491
My baby brother.

303
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,166
Oh, man.

304
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,503
Well, I did not think
this would be the day.

305
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,257
But it is.

306
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,926
It is, and that's...

307
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,552
Man...

308
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,472
that's okay.

309
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,643
I need you to...
I need you to promise me.

310
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:19,106
I need you to...
To... to tell me...

311
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,566
that it's okay.

312
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,485
I need you to tell me
that it's okay.

313
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,611
No.
Look at me.

314
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,863
Look at me.

315
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,283
I need... I need...

316
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,120
I need you
to tell me that it's okay.

317
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,414
I need you to tell me...

318
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,125
Tell me it's okay.

319
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,216
Dean...

320
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,889
it's okay.

321
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,689
You can go now.

322
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,078
Goodbye, Sam.

323
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,706
Goodbye.

324
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:49,959
Yeah.

325
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,836
Yeah, I know.

326
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,263
Yeah, me too.

327
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,681
Hello?

328
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,308
Um, hi.
Agent Bon Jovi?

329
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,354
Uh, this is...

330
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,772
Agent Bon Jovi.

331
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,858
Uh, okay.
Well, look.

332
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,484
I-I know this is
gonna sound nuts,

333
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,027
but I'm down in Austin,

334
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,821
and we've had
a few bodies turn up

335
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,656
minus their hearts.

336
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,867
Um, and a friend of mine,
Donna Hanscum...

337
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,494
She said you were
the guy to call.

338
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,584
Um, Agent...
you there?

339
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,043
Yeah, I'm here.

340
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,885
I'm on my way.

341
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,798
Well, at least
I made it to Heaven.

342
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,258
Yep.

343
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,973
What memory
is this?

344
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,768
It ain't, ya idjit.

345
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,645
Yeah, it is,

346
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,606
'cause the last I heard,
you...

347
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,941
you were
in Heaven's lock-up.

348
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,279
Was.

349
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,781
Now I'm not.

350
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,785
That kid of yours,
before he went... wherever,

351
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,204
made some changes here.

352
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:17,125
Busted my ass out.

353
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,293
And then he...

354
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:22,630
Well, he set
some things right.

355
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,967
Tore down all the walls
up here.

356
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:31,180
Heaven ain't just reliving
your golden oldies anymore.

357
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,142
It's what it always
should have been.

358
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,603
Everyone happy.

359
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,522
Everyone together.

360
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,150
Rufus lives about 5 miles
that way...

361
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,402
With Aretha.

362
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:48,239
Thought she'd have
better taste.

363
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,159
And your mom and dad...

364
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,786
they got a place
over yonder.

365
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,293
It ain't just Heaven,
Dean.

366
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,796
It's the Heaven
deserve.

367
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,590
And we've been
waiting for you.

368
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,895
So, Jack did all that?

369
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,146
Well...

370
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,648
Cass helped.

371
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,659
It's a big, new world
out there.

372
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,952
You'll see.

373
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,379
Oh, wow.

374
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,967
This tastes like the first drink
I ever shared with my dad.

375
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,719
Quality stuff?

376
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,845
No, it's crap.

377
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,850
But it was fantastic.

378
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,063
Just like this.

379
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,528
Perfect.

380
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,904
He'll be along.

381
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,619
Time up here, it's...
it's different.

382
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,669
You got everything
you could ever want...

383
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:29,215
or need or... dream.

384
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,802
So, I guess
the question is...

385
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,013
what are you
gonna do now, Dean?

386
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,903
I think I'll go
for a drive.

387
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,073
Have fun.

388
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,269
Hey, baby.

389
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,865
There'll be peace.

390
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,200
Ah!
I love this song.

391
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,953
Whoo!

392
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,971
Dad.

393
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,017
It's okay.

394
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,978
You can go now.

395
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,894
Hey, Sammy.

396
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,736
Dean.

397
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,637
Thank you, the fans.

398
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,015
Through blood, sweat,
laughter, and tears,

399
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,642
you've kept us on
for 15 years.

400
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,340
There's no way
we would have ever been here

401
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,314
without you and your support
and your love,

402
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,940
so thank you.

403
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,486
We will remain forever grateful
for the opportunity

404
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,322
and the honor to play
these characters for so long,

405
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,200
and we felt you guys
here with us all the time.

406
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:38,037
So thank you.

407
00:41:49,173 --> 00:00:00,488
And cut.

408
00:00:01,305 --> 00:01:01,361

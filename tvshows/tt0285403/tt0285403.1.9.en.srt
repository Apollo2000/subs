4
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,455
- How's it goin'?
- l have no idea who you are.

5
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,999
What's up, dude?

6
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,712
<i>Wait a second. He's dating Carla.</i>

7
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,215
<i>This is not good.</i>

8
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,220
First, l already told her
l got a girlfriend.

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,473
Second, you just put
your bare lips on my ear.

10
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,017
- How's it going? l'm...
- JD, l know.

11
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,020
He won't stop talking about you.
l'm Jennifer.

12
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:07,651
Do you really spend every day
saving children's lives?

13
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,695
Tell the nice lady.

14
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,656
l do what l can.

15
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,243
lt's on! lt's on.

16
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>- lt's on!
- Oh, yeah.</i>

17
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>I know two things about bars.</i>

18
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,127
<i>One, they're packed
Thanksgiving week.</i>

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>Two, put a beer in my hand
and I'm Mr Smooth.</i>

20
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,925
l was laughing so hard,
milk was coming out of my nose.

21
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,763
l once tripped over an lV
and blood shot over everyone.

22
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,311
A little got on my nose.

23
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,938
Every damn day, saving those children.

24
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,817
Who wants margaritas?!
Dude, less blood, more fruity drinks.

25
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,194
Right.

26
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,447
<i>Turk hasn't changed a bit since college.</i>

27
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,408
<i>He's the same goof ball
who tells me how to be cooler.</i>

28
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,910
Dude.

29
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,998
- This girl's hot. So don't blow it.
- Why do you say that?

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,002
Because you're like a 24-hour
convenience store. You never close.

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,713
That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.

32
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,971
Don't worry about it, l feel good
tonight, know what l'm saying?

33
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,223
Good.

34
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,892
Except for this stabbing pain
in my side.

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,687
Up all night with a high fever,
cramping and crying.

36
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,272
- Dude!
- My bad.

37
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:32,319
Not crying, punching the wall all manly
and angry like, you know what l mean?

38
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,488
See ya later, buddy.

39
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,742
Poor Bambi. Don't worry.
Carla will take care of you.

40
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,496
- Make sure he's admitted right away.
- All right.

41
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,834
<i>On the bright side, it'll be interesting
to see what it's like to be a patient.</i>

42
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,211
You know people die here?

43
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,047
You're a good friend.

44
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,133
l do what l can.
Can l have your stuff?

45
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,027
So did you talk to any girls last night?

46
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,446
l'm an attractive man,
we both know this.

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,991
lt's a burden
you're gonna have to live with.

48
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,034
One of many.

49
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,538
JD talked some girl up.

50
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,999
Really? Are you gonna call her?

51
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,588
Not right away.

52
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,215
Showtime.
Clear out so l can check him out.

53
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:40,888
You're examining me? l don't want you
to see my unmentionables.

54
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,681
l've seen underwear before.

55
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,059
l use the word unmentionables
for my genitals as well.

56
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,189
68-year-old male
with respiratory distress...

57
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,690
Save your breath.

58
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,360
Hello, Dad.

59
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:59,114
Never thought you'd call me that again,
after l left.

60
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,161
- Dr Cox!
- Relax, Carla.

61
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,538
The man l'm smothering
isn't my father.

62
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,999
Dr Benson used to be
Chief of Medicine here.

63
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,376
Hi, how are you?

64
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,343
Still have that great rapport
with the nurses?

65
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:24,097
Carla totally gets me. That's why l've
systematically tried to drive her away.

66
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,350
Ever see that therapist l recommended?

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,810
Not yet, no.

68
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,441
Shortness of breath? Dizziness?
Problems urinating?

69
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:38,278
No. No...
ls it a problem if it whistles?

70
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:42,324
You're making this so much easier.
Are you sexually active?

71
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,493
lt's active.

72
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:48,163
l'll write ''rare dry spell''
in the margin.

73
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,958
OK, time for the physical.

74
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,464
Cold hands.

75
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,258
Suck it up!

76
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,265
<i>Elliot's exam was reminiscent of when my
older brother beat the crap out of me.</i>

77
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,725
God!

78
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,937
See, it wasn't so bad. All done.

79
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,024
l'm puking every hour
and my fever's high,

80
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,569
but you're sure it's OK
for me to be out of bed?

81
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,364
l don't know. Dr Benson was my mentor.
Don't do that annoying thing.

82
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,616
- What annoying thing?
- When you talk.

83
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,742
Come on.

84
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,704
- Does that not drive you crazy?
- You get used to it.

85
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:32,749
l know you're excited with the gown on
but at no time are you to curtsy.

86
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,919
<i>He can say what he wants.
but he's showing me off.</i>

87
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,171
Dr Benson.

88
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:41,383
Just give us a second, will ya, big guy?
Did you hear about her?

89
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,469
<i>Watching Dr Cox,
I realised we never really stop</i>

90
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,931
<i>craving the attention
of people we look up to.</i>

91
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,233
Any questions?

92
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,569
Good.

93
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,740
- He seemed nice.
- Careful, Newbie.

94
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,202
l'm hearing it now.
lt is kind of annoying when l talk.

95
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,372
<i>In a lot of relationships, you regress
to the person you were when you met.</i>

96
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,875
So Elliot's exam was that bad?

97
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,252
- Dude, she violated me.
- ln a good way?

98
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,004
What's the deal?

99
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,964
l think l broke my ass!

100
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,300
You're telling everyone l violated you.

101
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:28,138
Not everyone, just the people
that work here. And my parents.

102
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,557
Was there something wrong
with my exam?

103
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,769
<i>So there it is. The classic trap.
Two choices.</i>

104
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,439
<i>Either wuss out
or tell the truth.</i>

105
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,399
You're kinda rough.

106
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,986
You're rough and
you're a little businesslike.

107
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,197
- You're cold.
- You mean my hands?

108
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,867
Yeah, those too. l just think
you could be more comforting.

109
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,496
<i>I could tell she appreciated
how hard it was for me to say that.</i>

110
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,374
Do you know how annoying
you are when you talk?

111
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,917
<i>Maybe not.</i>

112
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,632
- l was watching that.
- lt's broken.

113
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,514
Dr Cox. Did you get my memo
reminding senior staff

114
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,183
that lab coats
must be worn at all times?

115
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:17,396
You know, l did get it, Bob,
and at first l just threw it away,

116
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,607
but then l decided that
wasn't a grand enough gesture.

117
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,277
So l made a replica of you
out of straw

118
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,072
and then l put my lab coat on it
with your memo in the pocket,

119
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,241
then invited the neighbourhood kids

120
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,077
to light it on fire
and whack it with sticks.

121
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,790
So, l have been looking
at Dr Benson's chart.

122
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,042
His chest x-ray was normal,

123
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:44,047
his vitals are stable,
so let's discharge him.

124
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,341
Now hold the phone there, skipper.

125
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:51,680
Dr Benson should be able to stay here
until he feels he's ready to go.

126
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:55,267
Give me a break, he was
only Chief of Medicine for ten years.

127
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,230
Well, l haven't had my coffee yet,
so l'm finding it hard coming up with

128
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,775
a more colourful way to say
''Who gives a crap?''

129
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,488
Actually, that wasn't half bad.

130
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,493
Our next patient
is a 26-year-old male

131
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:17,873
who has presented vomiting,
abdominal cramps and fever.

132
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,792
<i>I never realised how hard
rounds are on the patient.</i>

133
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,961
<i>It feels like you're on display.</i>

134
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,798
Still, Rodin's masterpiece
makes us wonder,

135
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,010
why didn't he spend
a little less time thinking

136
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,429
and a little more time at the gym?

137
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,682
l do cardio.

138
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,686
Which most likely indicates what,
Dr Reid?

139
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,022
He has a simple case
of appendicitis.

140
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,316
How would you proceed,
Dr Dorian?

141
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,987
l would give me that news in private,
no matter how angry l was at me.

142
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,949
Sounds like there's a
fascinating back story here.

143
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,660
Turf him to surgery. Moving on.

144
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,373
Watch it, Bambi. You don't want
a 1 00lb white girl mad at you.

145
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,167
You'll flinch every time
you hear a Range Rover.

146
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,295
l can't believe l have to
spend all Thanksgiving here.

147
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,632
- Tell me that wouldn't kill you.
- Not really.

148
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,635
Do they celebrate Thanksgiving
in your homeland?

149
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,848
- You mean Chicago?
- You have a Chicago?

150
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,975
Be nice to me. l'm getting surgery.

151
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,812
- Dr Wen is the attending.
- Who's the intern doing the work?

152
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:26,900
<i>I get to cut you open
I get to cut you open</i>

153
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,575
Go, girl!

154
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,493
Go get it.

155
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,540
<i>Good God.</i>

156
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,376
Mr Davis,
you won't be home for Thanksgiving

157
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,004
but you'll be eating leftovers
by Saturday.

158
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,339
Great. And doctor, thank you so much.

159
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,425
You're welcome.

160
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,680
We've gotten to know each other
over the last week, haven't we?

161
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,056
l'd say so.

162
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,100
You found me comforting?

163
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,019
God, no.

164
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,854
l'm pretty good with people.

165
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,856
- You're horrible.
- l'm warm.

166
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,109
You're very cold. l mean, your hands...

167
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,362
- lt's like you're a yeti.
- l have bad circulation.

168
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,948
l do this all day and it doesn't help.

169
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:19,161
Listen, sweetie, you're
a very efficient, competent doctor.

170
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,831
But your exams...
Do you examine everyone like that

171
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:26,126
or just people you feel
have wronged you in some way?

172
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,129
- l appreciate your opinion.
- lt's not an opinion.

173
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,548
You see those guys right there?

174
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,010
They're pretending to be asleep
so you won't manhandle them.

175
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,305
- They are not.
- Dude, what are you doing?

176
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,974
Too frank, right?

177
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:45,395
l know. lt's probably why my mom
pushed me down the stairs.

178
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,233
She is fat, though. And boring.

179
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,027
BP's 60 over palp.
ls he having a heart attack?

180
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,489
lt's hypotension and
electrical alternance on the monitor.

181
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,491
This is tamponade.

182
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:02,162
Viral infections can cause pericarditis
and a rapid accumulation of fluid.

183
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,332
lt looks like a heart attack
but don't let it fool you.

184
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,543
BP's stabilizing.

185
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:11,046
- What have we got?
- Don't worry. We're fine here.

186
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,050
<i>It's a universal feeling to want
to be there for a good friend.</i>

187
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,929
<i>So from now on, I'm going to stop
seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.</i>

188
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,347
Dr Turk, if you will?

189
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,059
We'll mark for the incision
right about here.

190
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,646
<i>After all, he's a highly trained,
competent young doctor.</i>

191
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,273
Dude!

192
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:34,069
l'm about to bust a mad
sliz-ice in your insides!

193
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:40,117
Sir, l'd prefer if someone other
than Dr Turk performed the surgery.

194
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,785
Fair enough.

195
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,956
Dr Cotter will perform
the procedure tomorrow morning.

196
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,800
<i>The best thing about friends is how
quickly things like this blow over.</i>

197
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,971
- You understand, right?
- Whatever, man.

198
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,558
You want some salsa
for that chip on your shoulder?

199
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:09,104
l can't believe you. l would never ever
do something like this to you.

200
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:12,316
- You're like school in July.
- What do you mean?

201
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,901
No class.

202
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,869
You're not supposed
to scare me like that, sir.

203
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,372
lt was just a prank.
Admittedly, l took it too far.

204
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,292
Well, l still laughed, but...

205
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,378
l felt a little guilty
l wasn't here administering...

206
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,882
l just came to check on
my favourite patient.

207
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,176
l must have the wrong room.

208
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,553
- How are you, Dave?
- l'm doing great, Bob.

209
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,055
l owe you one.

210
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,141
Hey, doc, you should
go ahead and get some rest.

211
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,060
l'll be out of your hair soon.

212
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:53,815
Just a sec, skipper. You'll stay here
until you decide you're ready to leave.

213
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,862
For God's sake, you were the Chief
of Medicine here for over ten years.

214
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,781
Am l right?

215
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,787
That was what l said this morning.

216
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,997
Yeah, it sounded familiar.

217
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,547
- What?
- l was wondering

218
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,383
how you comb your hair
so the horns don't show?

219
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,552
l wonder what bothers you the most?

220
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,763
ls it that l saved his life
and he likes me as a person?

221
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,307
l bet it's how much
he respects me as a doctor.

222
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,686
How does that taste?
Bitter? Hard to get down?

223
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,278
- Here you go.
- Great.

224
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,573
Carla, everyone likes you so much,
it makes me wonder...

225
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,118
- Why patients think you're a cold fish?
- My God, you noticed?

226
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,205
- Honey, they told me.
- Great. lf anyone needs me,

227
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,041
l'll be in the supply closet
eating sugar packets.

228
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,043
Look, Elliot...

229
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,591
l'm not the kind of person who likes
telling people what to do, but...

230
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:04,636
Here's what to do. Here's what l think.
Here's what your problem is.

231
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,097
Don't think of your patients
as strangers.

232
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,517
l'm dating Turk, l get it.
Sometimes he is a big kid.

233
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:14,563
But when it comes to work, he's
as capable and mature as anyone.

234
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,149
Take those out.

235
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,151
Baby, l was being a walrus.

236
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:23,614
JD's not only your friend
but a patient too, and he's scared.

237
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:28,160
Kelso is pushing your buttons.
Every now and then let something go.

238
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:32,247
Turk's not that mature. He spent
all yesterday being a walrus.

239
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,666
He had straws and stuff...

240
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,086
The only thing
JD's scared of is sharks.

241
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,341
And he has a weird thing with pennies.
He's not scared about this.

242
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:47,554
Kelso's not just some harmless
guy pushing my buttons, Carla.

243
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,972
He's a pod person.

244
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,600
- You're wrong.
- You're so wrong.

245
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,811
<i>Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong</i>

246
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,859
<i>You're wrong.</i>

247
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,533
l think you're right. l don't know
how to connect with patients.

248
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:12,246
Start by touching them, holding
their hand, or stroking their hair,

249
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,540
or give them
a reassuring pat on the arm.

250
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:18,293
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. You'll be great.

251
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,215
Darn right.

252
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,885
There you go, sir.

253
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,892
l'm sorry. lt's my watch, l'll get it.

254
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,490
l'm so sorry. Let me...

255
00:15:55,831 --> 00:16:01,211
Dave, at Sacred Heart we don't
treat symptoms, we treat people.

256
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,590
- There's something on your back.
- What does this one say?

257
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,634
''Never stop kicking me.''

258
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:12,097
And on the other side
is my discharge form.

259
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:16,727
Bob, you tried to discharge me
an hour before l almost died?

260
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,228
Well...

261
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,816
How very clever.

262
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,235
What? lt wasn't me. ln fact...

263
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,906
l think you put it there
yourself to get more attention.

264
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,205
lt was me. l put it there.

265
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,505
Hey, buddy. OK,
forget about everything that's going on.

266
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:48,467
We know that you're bummed out
about missing Thanksgiving so...

267
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,094
we decided to bring it to you.

268
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,723
Wow, guys, thanks.
Where's the food?

269
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,940
Who wants the unmentionables?

270
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,945
Bambi? Your fever's spiking.

271
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:12,366
They're worried your appendix might
burst so we're going into surgery now.

272
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,659
Who's on call?

273
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,620
Dr Turk, let's get started.

274
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:28,006
<i>Most doctors don't believe in
the out-of-body experience thing,</i>

275
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,300
<i>and I don't know
if it was real or a dream,</i>

276
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:34,012
<i>but I swear I was up there
watching Turk operate on me.</i>

277
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,307
<i>And I have to say,
he's an amazing surgeon.</i>

278
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,104
Dude, could you not look over
my shoulder while l'm doing this?

279
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,022
lt's a little unnerving.

280
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,861
You've got a little fever.
Probably atelectasis from lying in bed.

281
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,822
- l'm really uncomfortable.
- l'm so sorry.

282
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,993
- You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- l'm done with all that.

283
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,788
lf it makes you feel better,
l hate this touchy-feely culture.

284
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:00,998
Thank you.

285
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,542
That whole ''kiss hello'' thing.

286
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,420
l don't want anyone touching me
unless we have sex.

287
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,714
Even then l don't want them
to overdo it.

288
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,884
- Where in Connecticut are you from?
- Greenwich. You?

289
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:15,596
Darien.
l'm really burning up here.

290
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,518
God, that's fantastic.
lt's like an ice pack.

291
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,895
Yeah.

292
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:28,483
l'm sorry to hear about your mom.
Are you at least close with your dad?

293
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:32,529
You see this right here?
That's his work.

294
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,365
Pretty good for a man
in a wheelchair.

295
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,660
Doc, l'm sorry you gotta be here
on Thanksgiving night.

296
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:42,623
My wife can't cook anyway, she's 22.
What are you doing?

297
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:46,335
Forget about me. What's your wife
look like? Any pictures?

298
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,587
Not of this one.

299
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,298
You know, being back at this old place,

300
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,718
you know the thing l have found
to be the most disappointing?

301
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,053
l think l can guess.

302
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,263
You.

303
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:03,602
Probably because you do things
like show up the Chief of Medicine,

304
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:07,272
when anybody who's been in a room
with Bob Kelso for two minutes

305
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:08,857
knows how big an ass he is.

306
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:13,737
- Go easy, l just thought...
- You don't think, Perry.

307
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,448
You're such a talented doctor.

308
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:21,703
lf you played the game you'd be in
a position to change things around here.

309
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,624
But you're too stubborn for that,
aren't you?

310
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,087
All right, kid.

311
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,714
Gin. Your deal.

312
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,565
Hi. l just need to
check on your incision.

313
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,859
- Turk, l was an idiot.
- lt's OK, man.

314
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:56,196
No, seriously, man. l want you to know,
if l ever need surgery again,

315
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,781
l want you inside of me.

316
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,992
l want to be the one inside of you.

317
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,582
Look, JD, l get it.

318
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:12,421
To me you'll always be that geeky kid
with the Pat Benatar t-shirt.

319
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,047
Dude, she rocks.

320
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,969
l want you to know
how serious l am about what l do.

321
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,346
Did you stitch your initials into me?

322
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,185
That's not important. lt's still
Thanksgiving for 20 more minutes.

323
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,814
Now, you can have ginger ale

324
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,442
and a cracker.

325
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,030
l forgot. Your change. Two pennies.

326
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,949
Get those pennies away from me.

327
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,452
Happy Thanksgiving, man.

328
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,537
<i>I guess what they say is true.</i>

329
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,624
<i>The people you work with
really do become your family.</i>

330
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,001
<i>Like your brother.</i>

331
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,546
<i>And your sister-in-law.</i>

332
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,883
<i>Or that cousin
you have funny feelings for.</i>

333
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:03,388
<i>And the crazy, angry uncle everyone
sort of hopes isn't coming this year.</i>

334
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,101
Dr Cox.

335
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,315
lf you want, you can
come down here and hang out...

336
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,442
Nobody talk.

337
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,070
Just drink.

338
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,282
<i>Uncomfortable silences
and alcohol.</i>

339
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,118
<i>Just like Thanksgiving at home.</i>

340
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,247
Drink!

341
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:37,047
- There was the Nina...
- Shut up!

342
00:21:38,305 --> 00:22:38,766

<i>When you're crazy about someone,</i>

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>even waking up isn't so bad any more.</i>

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,345
Good morning.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,432
<i>The air feels crisper,
the sun seems brighter.</i>

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,685
<i>Even your morning breath smells good.</i>

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,731
- You taste like old eggs.
- l'm so sorry.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,359
l love old eggs.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:33,659
You are so different
from the guys l usually go out with.

9
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,704
- How so?
- For starters,

10
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,748
l'm still wearing pants.

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,751
That is because l respect you.

12
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,294
Yeah?

13
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,548
And also, this triple knot,
l couldn't get out.

14
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,259
Thanks for being so patient with me.

15
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,803
l hope you don't think l'm a big tease.

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,598
l just love sleeping
in the same bed with you.

17
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,934
l've never slept better.

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,650
Me neither.

19
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,987
l'll go ahead and say it.
l hope we never have sex.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,284
What would you say if l told you
that l feel ready right now?

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,459
- Whatever.
- Then l think tonight...

22
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,087
Tonight is good,
but now also good.

23
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,923
Now works. Sure.

24
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,264
Now, that's what l'm talking about.

25
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,684
- Get out!
- 7.1 5, ya'll. Gotta go to work.

<i>Since Alex is a social worker,
she's here a lot.</i>

28
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,291
<i>For some guys, that would be
distracting, but I'm staying focused.</i>

29
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,877
You're on my foot.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,671
l'm so sorry.

31
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,134
Please step on my foot.
l'm just waiting for an excuse.

32
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:18,680
- Not today.
- Really? Why not?

33
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,853
l get it. Nice pull.
You slept with her yet?

34
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,317
What? l am not discussing that with you.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,736
- That's a no.
- Listen, Jolly Green.

36
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,656
People's personal lives are just that,
personal.

37
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,866
That's a definite no.

38
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,955
Good to see you again, Mr Barnes.
We'll be with you in a moment.

39
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,999
Put him in bed six.

40
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,962
Laverne, are you
in fact part golden retriever?

41
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,630
Keep it holy now.

42
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:56,426
Because every time l toss this guy,
you bring him right back to me.

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,720
All right, Will & Grace. Breakdown.

44
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,682
With his elevated lipase,
l'd say pancreatitis.

45
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,684
Grace, you wanna finish?

46
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,645
- Start with a Demerol drip...
- The throbbing's back.

47
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,982
Admitted for substance abuse
three times in the past year.

48
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,527
- But he said he quit.
- The addict said he quit?

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,654
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

50
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,866
- That changes everything.
- l believe in Mr Barnes.

51
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,994
Just because you have
a new girlfriend doesn't mean

52
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,289
that the world has suddenly
turned into a giant green M&M.

53
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,583
The Red Sox still suck, they do.

54
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,962
Barbie here still can't decide
what to do with those annoying bangs,

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,632
and addicts everywhere
will still lie to get a fix.

56
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:40,429
Now, you've got to wake up, sweetheart.
You're gonna be late for school...

57
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,764
You wet the bed.

58
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:46,560
Why can't l have a normal child
without these problems?

59
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,439
My mom says they frame my face.

60
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,483
They don't.

61
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,113
Wait, please wait, wait

62
00:03:58,197 --> 00:03:59,489
Go, bus.

63
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,658
Go. Go.

64
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,214
She didn't see you, Bob.
Just stay perfectly still.

65
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,841
Dr Kelso!

66
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:27,226
- Can l get a ride to the hospital?
- Of course, dear. Glad to do it.

67
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,321
Dr Cox and l have been friends for
a long time. You should get to know him.

68
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,494
- Do l have to?
- Yeah, you have to.

69
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,748
ln case you were wondering,

70
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:55,254
it says, ''if you can read this,
you're standing too close''.

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,341
l wasn't trying to look.

72
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,970
Let's see if you can tinkle
when someone's staring at you.

73
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,811
Go ahead and take your time.
l have all day.

74
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,271
Come on.

75
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,774
l've been Mr Barnes' caseworker
for a long time.

76
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,485
He just needs
everyone to cut him some slack.

77
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,405
Here, let me get this door for you.

78
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,409
l mean,
people just don't understand addiction.

79
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,453
Why are we in the on-call room?

80
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,293
Have you ever fooled around in here?

81
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,962
Lots of times.

82
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,507
- Never with anyone, but...
- Would you like to change that?

83
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,676
Yes, please.

84
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,729
Elliot.

85
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,524
Can you come back in two minutes?

86
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,276
Or 80 minutes?

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,113
The nurses did a check.
There's 50 Percocet missing.

88
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,491
We should split up into teams
and search every room.

89
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,994
We'll take this one.

90
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,245
Fine.

91
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,626
They're gonna go right to Mr Barnes.
l'm gonna check on him.

92
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,047
- Alex?
- What?

93
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,467
- l don't like it when you leave.
- Come here.

94
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,598
Tonight we'll pick up
right where we left off.

95
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,187
20 bucks says it never happens.

96
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,525
What, you're offended?

97
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,196
- Bob, how are you?
- Fine, Allan.

98
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,576
Today, l think l'll try a double
half-caf multi-foam latte mochaccino

99
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,663
with a shot of vanilla
and a sprinkle of nutmeg.

100
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,374
- Black coffee?
- Bingo-bango.

101
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,712
These people actually like you.

102
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,881
Maybe you should just order.

103
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:06,093
l'll have an espresso, please, and...

104
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,179
What kind of scones do you have?

105
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,893
Do you mind, lady? l am in a rush.

106
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,272
My goodness, l'm so sorry.

107
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,651
What am l doing, thinking l can take an
extra six seconds to pick my breakfast?

108
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,863
l have to call my mom, tell her
she did a lousy job raising me.

109
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,031
Thank you so much.

110
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:33,370
l think what she means is,
she doesn't give a crappuccino.

111
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,835
This is on me.
God help me, l love spunk.

112
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,675
How you doing?

113
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,054
How are you?
Can l buy you a beer?

114
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:55,893
This is a men's room. There's absolutely
no talking in here. Ever.

115
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,229
lt's just so freaky.
We're on the same pee schedule.

116
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,524
No, we're not.

117
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,132
<i>This is not good.</i>

118
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:31,053
Why assume Mr Barnes stole it?
There's lots of people on that ward.

119
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,638
Good point.

120
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,682
Three of them are in comas,
two can't walk, one's a nun.

121
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,434
Also a valid point.

122
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,772
Elliot, l'm sure Mr Barnes
didn't take the drugs.

123
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,900
He has been in rehab
for over six months.

124
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,319
There's no reason to be so judgmental.

125
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,949
l am not judgmental. lf l were,
l'd tell you your shoes are ugly.

126
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,202
Do not stoop to her level.

127
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,996
Your bangs make you
look like a chipmunk.

128
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,791
lt's a frame! Why can nobody see that?

129
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,585
Can we get back to the matter at hand?

130
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,171
Fine. So who do you think's right?

131
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,130
Yeah.

132
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,424
<i>Crap.</i>

133
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:17,057
For the love of Oprah,
why would you come to Paediatrics?

134
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,144
l can't go unless you're around.
You're my little pee buddy!

135
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,773
What do you say we cut to the chase?

136
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:29,194
You're dating Carla, the one person
in this hospital l can remotely stand

137
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,824
and she wants us to get all kissy-faced
with each other. l get it. l do.

138
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,827
But every single time
l shake my magic eight ball

139
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,329
and ask it
''Are we gonna be best friends?''

140
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,248
- Do you know what it says?
- No.

141
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,625
Outlook is buh-leak.

142
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,086
Dr Cox, you really can't
trust those things.

143
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,257
When l was 9, l asked mine if l should
open it and drink the fluid inside.

144
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,926
l puked blue for three days.

145
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,430
Just a real cute story.
Here's what you're gonna do.

146
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,184
Go back to Carla.
Don't obsess about why she's with you.

147
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,396
Just tell her we went to a ballgame
and we borrowed each other's sweaters.

148
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,859
- N-kay, little buddy?
- What a...

149
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,571
l don't think we should stand for it.

150
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:16,450
Dr Kelso can't just decide we're not
allowed to switch shifts any more.

151
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,286
<i>l was supposed to see
my nephew tonight in Pippin.</i>

152
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,830
- Who's he playing?
- Pippin.

153
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,667
Bob Kelso is a bad man.

154
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:30,631
l don't know. We never think about
how hard it is to always be the bad guy.

155
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,467
l want him to die.

156
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,220
- Hello, sweetness.
- Ladies.

157
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,599
Carla, l was thinking about what
you said about your mother's birthday.

158
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:45,729
l don't want her spending it alone,
so l've arranged for you to swap shifts.

159
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,690
- Dr Kelso...
- Don't mention it.

160
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,944
Should l pick you up tomorrow
at the same place?

161
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,948
Great.
Goodbye, all you smiling faces.

162
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,999
- Who'd you side with? Elliot or Alex?
- Neither. l pretended l was paged.

163
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,628
When they said they didn't hear it,
l called them liars and ran.

164
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,965
- They both have a point.
- Stick to the booty principle.

165
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,884
- What's that?
- Who do you want to sleep with?

166
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,679
- Alex.
- Then she might be right.

167
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,102
<i>I'm not sure about Turk's advice.
Sometimes he oversimplifies things.</i>

168
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,521
<i>Especially when it comes to booty.</i>

169
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:32,484
What would you say if l told you
l feel ready right now?

170
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,613
l agree with Alex.
l've been thinking about it a lot.

171
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:41,451
l think she's right about Mr Barnes.
We can't just jump to conclusions.

172
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,996
l am so surprised.

173
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,623
Tell me something.

174
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,626
- What do you think about Alex?
- No way!

175
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,963
l'm saying nothing about a girl
you're sleeping with.

176
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,507
He's not sleeping with her.

177
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:59,052
No ramifications, nothing.
Tell me what you...

178
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,347
l don't like or trust her.
l'm afraid she's gonna hurt you.

179
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,559
- You're jealous.
- Shut up.

180
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,353
Shut up because you're so jealous of her

181
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,689
that you don't even care
that l'm happy.

182
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,817
Do you honestly believe
that's what's going on here?

183
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:19,364
<i>Do not under any circumstances
say what you're thinking.</i>

184
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,117
l'm sorry,
but you had your chance with me.

185
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,335
<i>Why don't I ever listen to me?</i>

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,053
<i>Don't worry about yesterday.</i>

187
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,805
<i>Elliot's not the type
that holds a grudge.</i>

188
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,351
<i>Then again...</i>

189
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,233
You should tell your neighbour you will
hang your hammock wherever you please,

190
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,818
and if she doesn't like it,
she can move.

191
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,904
That's what l like about you, Carla.

192
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,407
You don't give a rat's ass
what anybody thinks.

193
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:07,204
- Morning, Dr Kelso.
- Nurses.

194
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,706
Get up!

195
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,003
l want to apologise
for not showing up last night.

196
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,465
l got home and totally passed out.

197
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:23,136
l wasn't even sure
we had a definite plan, so...

198
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,685
l'm sorry l couldn't make it.

199
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,319
She seemed sorry. l am too.

200
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,782
Someone called for a surgical consult?

201
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,951
You're Dr Turk?

202
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,328
Of course you are. Note to self.

203
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:52,291
You've got to start writing down
the names of people that annoy you.

204
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,210
Yeah. What's up?

205
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:59,256
Two-vessel disease.
He hasn't been on medical management...

206
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,259
<i>When an attending calls
a lowly intern for a consult,</i>

207
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,221
<i>it's an unwritten law the intern
should agree with whatever he says.</i>

208
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,432
Don't you agree?

209
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,644
Actually, sir,
l recommend bypass surgery.

210
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,856
That's my pager.

211
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,733
You're wrong.

212
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,902
He's so wrong.

213
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,030
You make me so angry, l...

214
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,825
l have to pee.

215
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,746
Me, too.

216
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,374
<i>Look at her.
She's not even gonna say hi to me.</i>

217
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,961
<i>Fine, I won't say hi to her. Ever.</i>

218
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,006
<i>I can't believe how stubborn she is.</i>

219
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,092
<i>I am the wrong man to play chicken with.</i>

220
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,387
<i>She'll blink... any second now.</i>

221
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,350
She is so stubborn.

222
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,727
Laverne, could you hand me some gauze?

223
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,607
Maybe Dr Kelso can pick you up
and take you to the gauze store.

224
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,651
- All right now, listen.
- Carla.

225
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:06,073
This paperwork has your signature on it
and it is totally sub-par.

226
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:10,077
l won't stand
for this kind of shoddy work.

227
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,207
Let me help you.

228
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,800
You went and got an intern to agree
with you so the guy doesn't get surgery?

229
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,971
- You caught me.
- A bypass is the right call.

230
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,597
Considering the risks...

231
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,100
He's a diabetic
with two-vessel disease...

232
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,019
Antianginals
could be equally effective.

233
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,522
- Either treatment could work?
- Sure.

234
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,567
So what are we arguing about?

235
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,694
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, sweetie.

236
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:48,448
<i>It was just then they realised
what was really going on.</i>

237
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,578
<i>Dr Cox was in love
with Turk's girlfriend.</i>

238
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,080
- Either of you want a sandwich?
- l'm all set.

239
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,714
So, every tox screening came back
negative on Mr Barnes.

240
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,675
- He didn't take anything.
- So?

241
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,719
So, you were wrong.

242
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,639
lt's not about that any more, is it?

243
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,185
<i>When you can't make things right
with one of your best friends,</i>

244
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,353
<i>nothing can make you feel better.</i>

245
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:22,191
l'm finally off.
Do you wanna get outta here?

246
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,235
Hello?

247
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,362
So, are we doing this or what?

248
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,325
Dr Kelso.

249
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,245
- Yes, what is it?
- l wanted to thank you.

250
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,498
For what you did.

251
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,584
When you yelled at me
in front of the other nurses.

252
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,003
- l appreciate it.
- Young lady,

253
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,547
l yelled at you because that paperwork

254
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:49,092
looked like it had been done
by a drunk four-year-old.

255
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,387
Listen, Carla,
l have a family who loves me,

256
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:57,059
a handful of close friends and
a wonderful hobby shop in my basement.

257
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:01,104
l don't spend much time worrying
about people's feelings around here.

258
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,649
l just do whatever makes me happy.

259
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,946
So...
can l still get a ride tomorrow?

260
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,491
l don't know
if l've forgiven you yet for hiding.

261
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,372
But you could always skip
the bus tomorrow morning

262
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,624
and take your chances.

263
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,049
We're both men.
One of us more than the other.

264
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,468
- But that's OK.
- What do you want?

265
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,596
l'm not gonna do anything
to mess up you and Carla.

266
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,016
l won't tell her how you feel.
lt's not my place.

267
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,144
But the minute you screw this thing up,

268
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:45,566
and you will screw it up,
l'll be waiting.

269
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,861
lf you're gonna wait,
l'd bring a book,

270
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,154
cos it's gonna be a while.

271
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,283
- You going in?
- l'm right behind you.

272
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:05,544
<i>Remember when the new Star Wars
movie came out and it was built up,</i>

273
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,005
but it really wasn't that great in bed?

274
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,591
Relax. The first one's a freebie,

275
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,926
so you can get your form back.

276
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,681
l'm gonna change.

277
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,945
l already brushed eight times but l'm
gonna take some mints out of your purse.

278
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,494
See, all l did was lose the pants,

279
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:42,664
but l think it gives me
a completely different look.

280
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:46,752
- These are Percocet.
- JD.

281
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,047
You never came over last night
cos you passed out.

282
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,675
Yep, l should go.

283
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:59,181
<i>The speech sounds the same
no matter whose mouth it comes out of.</i>

284
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,892
<i>Even someone you thought
you could really like.</i>

285
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,061
You don't understand, OK?

286
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,147
My job comes with a lot of stress.

287
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,942
lt's not like l have a serious problem.

288
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,906
<i>We ended up talking
for a while after that.</i>

289
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,285
<i>I gave her some names
of people that could help her.</i>

290
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,958
<i>But she never got back to me.</i>

291
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,589
<i>After that, things got back to normal.</i>

292
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:37,302
- You owe me 20 bucks.
- No, but l never even made...

293
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,513
20 bucks.

294
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:22,639
All right, l should've done this
a long time ago, so here goes.

295
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,770
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have
accused you of being jealous.

296
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:32,774
You were just looking out for me.
You were right about Alex.

297
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,194
You never did sleep with her, did you?

298
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,864
Nah. But why does that matter?

299
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,454
Because l was jealous.

300
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,632
Are you sure?

301
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,118
What are you thinking about?

302
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,411
This.

303
00:21:27,305 --> 00:22:27,784

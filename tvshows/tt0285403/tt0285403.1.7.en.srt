1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,259
Let's start off with a toughie.
Who can tell me...?

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,221
<i>The last few weeks,
an amazing thing has happened.</i>

3
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:16,433
<i>I've been nailing rounds. I'm starting
to separate myself from the pack.</i>

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,394
Sir, the answer is Beck's triad.

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,606
<i>It keeps me on top of my game.</i>

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,400
Looks like a break in the ulna,
right there.

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,611
<i>It's good to be the king.</i>

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:32,616
You know, it's OK to be impressed by me.
Most girls are.

9
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,786
<i>The problem with reaching the top
is, sooner or later,</i>

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,247
<i>someone starts nipping at your heels.</i>

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,457
<i>For me, that guy was Nick Murdoch.</i>

12
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,924
Well, the gurney adds drama.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,074

14
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,903
<i>So that's the guy
who wants to take me down.</i>

15
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,030
Of course, you'll have a scar, Peter.

16
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:17,786
You're not getting surgery but chicks
dig scars so l'm gonna give you one.

17
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,291
Doctor, Peter's drug rash
is getting a lot worse.

18
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,585
No problem, give him Prednisone...

19
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,629
<i>Good bedside manner,
good rapport with the nurses,</i>

20
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,382
<i>sees me staring at him...</i>

21
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,509
<i>Act busy.</i>

22
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:36,138
That's the stud right there.
That's where you'd...

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,848
...hang a painting.

24
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,935
He was born John Dorian
but he was simply known as JD:

25
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,147
doctor, friend, lover.

26
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,525
- Hey, man, how are ya?
- Hey, how are you?

27
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,736
OK... There that is.

28
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,030
Gosh, can you believe we're doctors?

29
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:57,075
The other night at a restaurant
this guy starts choking.

30
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,537
They asked if anyone was a doctor.
l didn't even move.

31
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:05,000
l still feel like l'm seven years old
playing MASH with my older brother.

32
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,586
l don't want
to be Hot Lips again.

33
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,755
Shut up and kiss Frank.

34
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,676
l don't talk to my brother much.

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,137
<i>What you doing?
Don't connect with him.</i>

36
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,640
- Well, l'll see you.
- OK.

37
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,850
What happened to that guy?

38
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,770
Eventually l remembered l was a doctor.

39
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,856
He'd been dead for 20 minutes.
Very embarrassing.

40
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,942
Food was good, though.

41
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,736
<i>Don't laugh. Don't laugh!</i>

42
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:34,947
<i>Damn!</i>

43
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,619
Any time you wanna get more gauze,
it'd be a real treat for all of us.

44
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,374
- lt's hard being you, isn't it?
- lt is.

45
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,544
- What's with the smile?
- This whole big bad wolf thing,

46
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,712
it's such an act.

47
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,132
Neato!
Now whaddya want? A tip?

48
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,010
Get out. Go, go!

49
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,263
l'm not sure l agree.

50
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,816
- You good T-dog?
- Come on, man.

51
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,402
l could do this with my eyes closed.

52
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,322
- l won't, though.
- Open the peritoneum.

53
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,243
Nice, clean cut. Good.

54
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,621
Good. Whoa, what's that smell?

55
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,582
l don't know.

56
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,709
- Did you nick the colon?
- No.

57
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,545
l mean, l don't know.
l... l don't think so. Did l?

58
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,463
Cut the music.

59
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,466
You know, l kinda
had a date last night.

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,010
- Really?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,847
A guy on the bus fell asleep on me
and drooled on my shoulder.

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,516
- You slut.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,770
- How about Nick?
- l'd let him drool on me.

64
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,191
That's gross. Why did l say that?
l shouldn't talk to people.

65
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,527
l wouldn't know what to do
even if l was interested.

66
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,238
Well, you could start by looking at him.

67
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,576
Did he look back?
Why doesn't he like me?

68
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,536
l can't believe l already blew it.

69
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>It felt weird trying to push Nick on
her. This morning I wanted to kill him.</i>

70
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,752
<i>He's so nice,
he probably would've helped me.</i>

71
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,423
Come on, JD, you're not closing the
windpipe. Put more pressure down here.

72
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:20,219
Come on! l know you can do it!
Come on! Come on!

73
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,306
lf it isn't the brain trust.

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,809
Someone tell me
what this patient's rash is.

75
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,604
You have until l finish
my squeezy juice.

76
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,481
<i>My God, I'm drawing a...</i>

77
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,734
<i>I can't remember what you draw
when your mind draws a...</i>

78
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,902
<i>...something.</i>

79
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,572
- lt's Erythema Migrans.
- Why don't you answer it?

80
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:44,868
Everyone looks up to you. lt's
important you don't get stumped.

81
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,162
Besides, it's important to you, too.

82
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,249
<i>Please, like he knows me.</i>

83
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,251
lt's Erythema Migrans, sir.

84
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,712
Right you are, Dr Dorian.

85
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,714
Nice.

86
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,509
OK, there you go.

87
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,428
Now you've got it. Oh, good.

88
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,557
l don't know
where that smell came from.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,726
- Er, sir?
- What? Do you see something?

90
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,147
Sir, l farted.
That smell is from the fart l made.

91
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:18,443
- Dude...
- Get the hell out of my OR.

92
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,696
Yes, sir. Good.

93
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,450
<i>Time to put myself
right back on top of Nick.</i>

94
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,994
<i>That came out wrong.</i>

95
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,539
Excuse me, Dr Cox?
l know that you need to pick an intern

96
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,250
to co-write that case report
on post-partum...

97
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,669
Yeah, sure. Congratulations. Now, go.

98
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,588
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

99
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,923
Hey, buddy. How are ya?

100
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:45,220
Dr Cox, l was wondering if l could
co-write that case report with you.

101
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:50,267
Newbie א Newbie. Too bad it can't be
a fight to the death.

102
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,313
l didn't know you wanted to do it.
You do it.

103
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,565
Nice guys aren't even that nice.

104
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:02,154
Now let me see, just exactly
who to choose? Who to choose?

105
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,461
Nice. Very nice, indeed.
OK, over.

106
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,592
lnteresting.

107
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,845
Attaboy.

108
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,433
l'm gonna go with...
Guy Smiley, here.

109
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,189
- Huge moment for me.
- l know.

110
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,609
l wish my dad was alive.

111
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,237
<i>It doesn't mean anything.</i>

112
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,447
You flipped a coin in your head?

113
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:50,619
No. lt's just that, right now, he's
better at internal medicine than you.

114
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,251
OK, insult me, like you always do.

115
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,421
Too easy.
When you least expect it.

116
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,051
Dr Wen threatened
to sew my butt cheeks together.

117
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,806
- Yet you continue to eat chilli.
- Dude, l'm taking the cheese off.

118
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:16,979
Even though nothing happened today,
it still kinda freaked me out.

119
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,983
One hiccup and that's the difference
between life and death?

120
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,444
lt's a lot to have
on your shoulders, you know?

121
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,950
What are you guys talking about?

122
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,451
Cheese.

123
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,497
Turk is so lucky
l met him first.

124
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,875
How's my man doing?

125
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,252
Baby, most guys are here.

126
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,714
But me, l'm, like,
all up in here.

127
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,884
Dr Turk, you can
make the incision now.

128
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,097
Sir, my hand's tightening up.

129
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:56,351
- l must be low on potassium.
- All right, l'll take over.

130
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:05,736
Dr Murdoch, Peter's rash has gone but
he's vomited six times in the last hour.

131
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,781
No problem, give him Zofran and
a 20cc per kilo bolus of normal saline.

132
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:13,744
<i>Everyone's finally coming around
to my way of thinking about Nick.</i>

133
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,788
You're right, he definitely
has a cute little butt.

134
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,791
lt's almost like
it's been sculpted.

135
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,378
Who cares? Everybody's got
a cute butt. l have a cute butt.

136
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,131
You should bring it in some day.

137
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,844
- How's Turk doing?
- He's fine, why?

138
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:35,224
He totally froze during surgery
yesterday. Didn't he tell you?

139
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:42,981
l feel like we haven't talked in ages.
How are you?

140
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,441
- Fine.
- Yeah?

141
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,694
Don't l look OK?
You know?

142
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,786
You know? l'm fine.
As a matter of fact...

143
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:00,040
<i>I am doin' OK, I am doin' OK</i>

144
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,419
Good afternoon, doctors.

145
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,965
l've gathered you all here
because, well...

146
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,719
Attendance at my noon conferences
has been very disappointing.

147
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:17,391
l've begun to wonder if maybe
you have something more important to do.

148
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,146
Maybe you feel the need to sneak off
and have a little nappy-nap?

149
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,733
l love nappy-naps.

150
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:32,364
Or maybe you've forgotten that
my conferences are mandatory.

151
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,867
My hospital, my rules!

152
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,203
l've never missed one.
Batting 1 ,000 over here.

153
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,917
l'm more proud of you than
l've ever been of an intern.

154
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,337
<i>How do you like me now, Nick?</i>

155
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,633
So you see, sir, the poor attendance
is my fault. And my fault only.

156
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,803
Well, then,
you have just won the privilege

157
00:09:54,887 --> 00:10:00,642
of writing my next ten lectures
by this afternoon.

158
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,230
Paging Dr Martyr...

159
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,192
- What the hell was that guy...
- Way to go, man.

160
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,485
Nick, that was amazing.

161
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,282
<i>...thinking?</i>

162
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,329
<i>It's good to be the king.</i>

163
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,712
<i>Things change when
you're not the star any more.</i>

164
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:36,512
What can l say? The lectures
this kid wrote were fantastic.

165
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,765
<i>The hospital starts to seem
like a whole different place.</i>

166
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,231
Hey, man. Want some company?

167
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,400
No, l just wanna be alone.

168
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,782
- Well?
- Not yet. But soon.

169
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,577
Very soon.

170
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,542
Why would Turk talk to Elliot about this
and not me?

171
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,794
They're not friends,
know what l mean?

172
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,256
After 25 minutes, the only way
l could know what you mean more

173
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,968
is if you wrote ''My boyfriend doesn't
open up to me'' on a mallet

174
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,512
and smashed me
over the head with it.

175
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,390
Why can't you just for once
dig down in your heart,

176
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,519
access some emotions
and empathise with me?

177
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:30,107
- l'm sorry, what were we doing?
- That's why no one likes you.

178
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,150
You like me a little bit.

179
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,613
And so do you, sweet cakes.

180
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,284
Want a little sugar from Daddy?

181
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:47,624
Well, looky here.
l thought this was my special place.

182
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,919
l'd ask you not to tell
the others about this spot,

183
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,297
but none of them are talking to you.

184
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,799
lt's been a rough day, sir.

185
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,096
You see, Dr Dorian, your problem is,
you're a pansy.

186
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,643
lf you were in my way,
l'd throw you off this ledge right now.

187
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:10,022
We're out here alone.

188
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,233
No one would ever know.

189
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,578
l'm gonna...
l'm gonna... l have to...

190
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,996
...things.

191
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,128
lnterns are fun.

192
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,841
l'm single.

193
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,220
That was more subtle in my head.

194
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:45,891
Relax, l already left a message
on your machine asking you out.

195
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,310
- Really?
- No.

196
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,189
- But l will before you go home.
- Works for me.

197
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,777
Dr Murdoch, Peter's developed
a high-grade fever and a cough.

198
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,321
No problem. Give him
Ceftazidime one gram lV.

199
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,408
- How do you stay positive?
- l don't let the bad stuff in.

200
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,453
Try not to get too overwhelmed.

201
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,831
Call me tonight
when you get my message.

202
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,796
His butt?

203
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:21,510
So listen, l've scheduled
an appendectomy for you later.

204
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,179
Make sure you're good on potassium.

205
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,558
l got so much potassium,
it's coming out of my assium,

206
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,518
you know what l mean?

207
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,398
What l did was l took
the word potassium and...

208
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,192
l dropped
the first three letters,

209
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,777
made a doody joke.

210
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,530
Funny stuff.

211
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,243
- Looks like he bought it.
- Excuse me?

212
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,788
So you had stage fright. No big deal.
Happened to me once.

213
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,331
Really?

214
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:55,919
l'd be more than glad to tell you what a
lot of doctors do to relieve the stress.

215
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,380
Take a little trip to Palm-dale.

216
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,923
- What?
- OK.

217
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,384
Give yourself the old low five.

218
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,096
- l'm not getting it.
- Physician...

219
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,640
...love thyself.

220
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,018
You talking about
Downtown Lester Brown?

221
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:15,439
Lowers the heart rate, releases
endorphins. Basic physiology.

222
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,027
OK, you almost had me.

223
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,404
- You're not serious?
- Yes, l am.

224
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,448
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

225
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,033
No.

226
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,163
Nobody hurts Carla
and gets away with it.

227
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,706
Who's Carla?

228
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,626
l was talking to myself.
Don't eavesdrop.

229
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,087
lf this kid doesn't leave
l'm gonna kill him.

230
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:43,425
Now, if you leave,
l'll know you were eavesdropping

231
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,469
and l'll go and kill you anyway.

232
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,347
Stay. Good girl.

233
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,101
Tick, tock, Clarice.

234
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,982
<i>Kelso's talk helped me
figure out what I had to do.</i>

235
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,444
Good timing. Give me a hand
with this Foley cath, will you?

236
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:06,031
<i>Whether or not Nick knew how jealous
and competitive I'd been,</i>

237
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,784
<i>I felt I needed to step up,
lay it out there,</i>

238
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,203
<i>and apologise like a man.</i>

239
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,372
Are we cool?

240
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,873
Yeah.

241
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:19,419
<i>Besides, even if I was the star
for a little while, he's the man now.</i>

242
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,588
This belongs to you.

243
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,758
Thanks a lot, man.
Can you grab me some tape?

244
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,804
<i>Once you line up behind a strong leader,
everyone picks up their game.</i>

245
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,223
We need the results
of this urine sample.

246
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,017
<i>We began to function
like a well-oiled machine.</i>

247
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:17,060
Nick, l got the results back
from the...

248
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,271
Nick?

249
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,941
His blood cultures
don't look good at all.

250
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,110
No problem.

251
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:42,419
Listen, l was thinking about
what happened earlier and...

252
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,255
Anyway... Here.

253
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,385
You dug down in your heart
and came up with a muffin.

254
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,889
That's store-bought.
Blueberries the size of your fist.

255
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:57,601
l shouldn't have dragged you
into it. You don't know Turk.

256
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:02,147
Actually, l met him today.
We had a terrific chat.

257
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,529
Give the man a hand,
that's just terrific work.

258
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,697
You know darn well that felt good.

259
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,242
Feeling better about yourself,
aren't you?

260
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,785
Real nice guy.

261
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:19,248
lt's hard letting yourself be vulnerable
with someone, you know?

262
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,959
Just eat the damn muffin.

263
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:30,008
Even though l'm on call tonight,
l'm not gonna let the bad stuff in.

264
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,594
Not gonna let myself get overwhelmed.
What?

265
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:36,515
Friday, when you had people over,
you locked yourself in your room

266
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:40,310
- because we brought the wrong chips.
- Look at me.

267
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,604
That was the old Elliot.

268
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:47,234
Help me find Dr Murdoch. Peter's parents
are here, he's not answering his page.

269
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:51,780
Sure. You know, Elliot's not gonna
let herself be overwhelmed any more.

270
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,918
She's been drinking.

271
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,053
- You look great!
- You're not messing with me?

272
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,390
No, but l'd like to.

273
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:22,936
Turk bought me this dress out of
the blue. l guess he knew l'd love it.

274
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,816
Look, Carla,
back when l was an intern,

275
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,402
l remember the pressure
being so insane,

276
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,322
that the only way l could get by
was to race home

277
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:39,161
and although my wife was asleep,
l'd wake her, look her in the eyes,

278
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,788
and then passive-aggressively
torture her

279
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:46,585
until she packed a bag
and went to her mom's for the week.

280
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,504
Does that...help?

281
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,797
Like a big hug with words.

282
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:54,301
Just cos a guy
has problems expressing himself,

283
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,095
that doesn't mean
he doesn't need...

284
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,431
...you.

285
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,143
Women so don't get me.

286
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,897
lt's not even funny.
lt's mind-boggling, quite frankly.

287
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,024
The whole thing is stunning.

288
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,360
The point is that
it's the scrubs, right.

289
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:14,738
Because in jeans, my butt
is a force to be reckoned with.

290
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,951
- We were looking for you.
- Nick, touch my butt, please.

291
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,622
Are you all right?

292
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,917
That kid is eventually gonna die.

293
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,045
Whether it's today or tomorrow.

294
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,131
Or a month from now.

295
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,509
There's nothing l can do. Nothing works.

296
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,679
His parents wanna talk to me.
What am l supposed to say?

297
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,766
Peter lived a good long seven years?
Seven years, man.

298
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,565
lt's not fair.
l hate this place, this job.

299
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,526
- Nick, it's not your fault.
- l can't do it any more.

300
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,737
l'm done. l'm done.

301
00:19:55,821 --> 00:20:00,284
<i>The scariest thing was I thought
he was stronger than all of us.</i>

302
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,578
<i>Maybe it's not about being the best.</i>

303
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,582
<i>Maybe it's about finding little things
that get you through the day.</i>

304
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,501
<i>Whether it's the support
of someone close to you,</i>

305
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,424

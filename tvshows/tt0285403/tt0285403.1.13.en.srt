00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,130
<i>You asked out a girl
stuck in an MRI machine,</i>

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,299
<i>without ever seeing her face.</i>

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,635
<i>Remember, no matter
what she looks like,</i>

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,762
<i>be sure to play it cool.</i>

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,890
Yes!

6
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,476
Yes! You are smokin' hot!

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,645
ln your face!

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,899
<i>That night, we went out
on our first date.</i>

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>Had our first dinner.</i>

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,240
<i>Rented our first movie.</i>

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,494
<i>Took our first long drive.</i>

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,704
Look out!

13
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,957
<i>Killed our first raccoon.</i>

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,837
<i>Ever since then, every date we've
been on has always ended the same way.</i>

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,051
No!

16
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,637
Cox wants me back at the hospital.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,391
- But the page is addressed to Lillian.
- That's me.

18
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>What a drag.</i>

19
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,987
<i>That was probably the wrong time
to ask for a quickie.</i>

20

21
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,544
l have been coerced

22
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,214
by the forces of evil into
conducting rounds this morning.

23
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,508
Why do you have to do rounds?

24
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,052
Because l'm sleepy. How's that?

25
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,889
<i>To make this a more
palatable experience for moi,</i>

26
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,893
l am not going to call you by
your names. l'll be referring to you

27
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,855
by whatever distinguishing physical
characteristic occurs to me.

28
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,232
You, Chicken Beak.

29
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,694
What causes pneumonia
presenting with diarrhoea?

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,571
- Legionella.
- Nice job.

31
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,366
lt turns out your mind's
just as sharp as your nose.

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,577
And you, Dye Job.

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,205
What are the elements
of Whipple's triad?

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,587
<i>It's hard to describe how scary
it is when you don't know an answer.</i>

35
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,427
l can't remember. l am so sorry.

36
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,721
What are you sorry about?

37
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,182
Dr Kelso yells at us
when we don't know...

38
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,683
Children,

39
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,103
you can't let that bloated bag
of hate affect you.

40
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:29,900
Being a doctor is as much about
finding the answers as knowing them.

41
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,278
For instance, take Clarabelle's
patient here, Mr Yeager.

42
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,656
We have no idea what's wrong with him.

43
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:42,162
So we have run tests for everything
and according to these results...

44
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:45,624
Everything seems
to have come back negative.

45
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,753
Which doesn't necessarily mean
that Clarabelle is a failure.

46
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,881
lt just means
that she's got to keep trying,

47
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,843
no matter how frustrated she might get.

48
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,263
Now, of course, if you
are lazy and incompetent,

49
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,433
then, yes, that will buy you
a one-way ticket out of here.

50
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,269
Doug.

51
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:09,940
Listen carefully. Kelso can't do a thing
to you if you answer a question wrong.

52
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,820
lt doesn't work that way. Moving on.
Not you. You still have work to do.

53
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,866
Johnny No-Tan? l'd like you to
present the next patient to me.

54
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,078
l love you.

55
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,872
Now say it in Spanish.

56
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,748
<i>Te amo.</i>

57
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,543
Now... say it like Astro.

58
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,712
l ruv roo.

59
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,011
- You are very, very cute.
- l know.

60
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,139
l've been thinking
about this ''l love you'' thing.

61
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,017
lt's gonna make
everything so much better.

62
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,812
l mean, we're so in sync.
Better conversation,

63
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,231
better dancing...

64
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,151
And?

65
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,320
Way better shrumpdown.

66
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,991
Yeah!

67
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:20,177
l'm so sorry. That has never
happened to me before.

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,849
<i>Man, she's beautiful.</i>

69
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,561
<i>I wish I was that piece of bacon.
Wait a second.</i>

70
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,188
<i>I am that piece of bacon.</i>

71
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,065
That's right.

72
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,652
You mind not staring at me
while l'm eating?

73
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,320
l hate it.

74
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,822
- But l'm not.
- What am l doing right now?

75
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,033
- Eating.
- What are you doing?

76
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,285
Staring.

77
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,126
There. Now no one gets to eat it.

78
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,046
- You happy?
- Not really.

79
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,721
You know what's great?

80
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,141
Even when our dates get interrupted,
we can have a date here.

81
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,978
Let's say
you wanted to watch a movie.

82
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,898
We could go to the conference room
and watch that video on STDs.

83
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,484
lt's funny and it makes you think.

84
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:21,321
Maybe it would be good
if we actually had a date that

85
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,867
- ends.
- How does a date with you end?

86
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,244
lt can range from a kiss at the door

87
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,206
to ''all l have for breakfast
is yoghurt and l'm out of bowls,

88
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,251
so you'll have to eat off my stomach.''

89
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,879
Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.

90
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,506
lt's a date.

91
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,929
Judging from the ataxia dysarthria,

92
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,100
l've concluded that Mr Yeager
is suffering from... kuru.

93
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,935
- Kuru?
- Kuru.

94
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,812
- Kuru?
- Yes, kuru.

95
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,940
- l'd actually never thought of that.
- Hell, yeah.

96
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,319
Were you aware that the only
documented cases of kuru

97
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,572
were members of a cannibalistic tribe
in Papua New Guinea?

98
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,283
- l was not.
- Actually, doc,

99
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,410
l was in New Guinea last week.

100
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,038
- Really?
- No.

101
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,626
- Do you happen to know what a zebra is?
- He just mocked me.

102
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,837
lt's a diagnosis of an obscure disease

103
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:24,259
when it's more likely to be a common
illness with uncommon symptoms.

104
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,471
ln other words,
if you hear hoof beats,

105
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:31,725
you just go ahead
and think horsies, not zebras.

106
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,977
Mm-kay, Mr Silly Bear?

107
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,069
- What's wrong?
- lt's personal.

108
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,738
Why won't you ever open up to me?
l came to you

109
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,159
when l thought l had a broken tailbone
and it was just a really bad pimple.

110
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,328
lt's a sex thing. OK?

111
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:57,751
Like a gender issue or like intercourse?
Because l'm book-smart on both.

112
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,381
Carla? Use me.

113
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,304
- Last night, when l was with Carla...
- Dude, l can't talk.

114
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,974
l gotta figure this Mr Yeager thing out.

115
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,559
Cool.

116
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,187
My horse didn't finish the race.

117
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,357
l'm at the filling station,
but my credit card's declined.

118
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,401
- l'm on the jet ski...
- l got it!

119
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:26,488
- Good. l had no idea what to say...
- No. Mr Yeager.

120
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,576
Where you go...?
Who am l going to talk to about sex?

121
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,578
Let's get our talk on.

122
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,998
Player to player.

123
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,710
<i>Afternoon rounds
that day began like any other.</i>

124
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,840
This patient is hypoglycaemic. What
are the signs of an insulinoma, Dr Reid?

125
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,592
Elevated C-peptide levels.

126
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,345
Score! But before you do
your crazy end-zone dance,

127
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,849
tell me the spinal fluid findings
in Guillaume-Barr×™ syndrome.

128
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,518
- Xanthochromia?
- Wrong!

129
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:01,106
<i>And then it happened. Suddenly,
Dr Kelso didn't seem as frightening.</i>

130
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,027
Dr Reid, what do you
have to say for yourself?

131
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,154
Win some, lose some.

132
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:11,116
<i>In fact, nothing he did
seemed to scare us.</i>

133
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,245
<i>Not any more.</i>

134
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,251
<i>Not even the most horrible thing
he could think of.</i>

135
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,467
All right, welcome to the lCU!
No, really, sit down.

136
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,429
For women that don't know how to cook.
l put the Yellow Pages in there.

137
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,808
What do you want? Mexican? ltalian?
Japanese? American cuisine?

138
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,187
lt's a cook...
l'm flat-linin'. Beep!

139
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,315
Save him!

140
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,442
Tip your nurses.

141
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,989
<i>And I think he knew
who was behind it.</i>

142
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,285
Cox.

143
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,373
<i>Talk to me</i>

144
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,712
You know,
that's really getting annoying.

145
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,925
Every time you say it, it makes me
not want to talk to you all the more.

146
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,222
<i>Talk to me</i>

147
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,307
All right, fine!

148
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:25,732
Last night, Turk and l were,
you know, messin' around.

149
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:30,487
- lt's really hot, like always.
- Hot like how? Describe it.

150
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,573
Dude!

151
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,910
So suddenly, things aren't happening.
You know what l mean?

152
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:41,039
The only change is that we said
''l love you'' to each other.

153
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,541
lt's true.

154
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,920
l have never said ''l love you''
to a woman before.

155
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,214
Then how do you
get them to sleep with you?

156
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:53,635
lt's three little words.
lt shouldn't have this effect, right?

157
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:59,224
Anyway, l told him it wasn't his fault.
These things happen occasionally.

158
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,393
Try constantly.

159
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,980
l have cold hands, and...

160
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,652
So when l saw you this morning
and l said ''How's your penis?''

161
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,113
and you didn't wanna talk about it...

162
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,618
Dude. lt's not me.

163
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,786
lt's me.

164
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,165
Last night, for the first time
ever in our relationship,

165
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,167
no matter how long we tried,

166
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,794
l was unable to have an...

167
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:40,098
Dr Cox, l got the sed rate back
on Mr Yeager. Say ''how do'' to that.

168
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,643
But then
l'm due back at the hootenanny.

169
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,605
l noticed he had a rash. l realised
he's been having jaw claudication,

170
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,274
- which led me to...
- Temporal arteritis.

171
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:54,488
Of course. Nurse, start Mr Yeager on
solumedrol and get the surgery resident?

172
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,949
He needs a temporal
artery biopsy stat.

173
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,326
Newbie, l can handle this.

174
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,745
- You're off, aren't you?
- l'm with you.

175
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,623
Fair enough.
Let's go treat the patient.

176
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:08,252
<i>I am so on top of things tonight,
it's scary.</i>

177
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,969
Hell, yeah.

178
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,307
<i>You're only 80 minutes late.
She'll still be here.</i>

179
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,142
<i>Please be here. Come on, Alex.</i>

180
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,020
<i>Please be here.</i>

181
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,692
You gotta be kidding me.

182
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,361
There's a waste of a gift certificate.

183
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,530
Cancel the cobbler!

184
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,908
She's not having an orgasm.

185
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,662
Still not seeing what the problem is.

186
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,836
l've never even had an orgasm.

187
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,426
l'm sorry.
l should be more surprised.

188
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,511
That'd be nice.

189
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,767
- l want to talk to you about rounds.
- Here we go. Bring it on.

190
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,353
They're all yours.

191
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,815
You will be leading them from now on.

192
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,444
You've stunned me, but you
haven't dropped me to the mat.

193
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,281
Waiting for the roundhouse here.
The old haymaker,

194
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,409
when the yelling starts
and the voice gets high-pitched.

195
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,454
''Daddy, l've been bad.
Daddy, l've been a bad boy.''

196
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:29,166
''Oh, Daddy!
Daddy, l've been bad.''

197
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,045
lf you're not gonna play, it's no fun.

198
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,842
Hey, Alex, l am so sorry. l went
to the restaurant but just missed you.

199
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,178
Then l called, but there was no answer,

200
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:45,349
then l stopped by, and l guess
you didn't see me which was odd,

201
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,895
cos l was standing next to
the pizza guy while you were paying him.

202
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,066
We're still cool, right?

203
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:59,321
- Look, JD...
- ''Look, JD, we're still great?''

204
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,368
l think you're a really good guy.
OK? But...

205
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,746
- Alex dumped me.
- The blind girl you've been dating?

206
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,915
- She's not blind.
- Of course not.

207
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,918
How'd you drop the ball?
Don't tell me you cried,

208
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,337
or l'll ban you
from the men's room again.

209
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,008
l was so excited what we were
doing here, l forgot about our date.

210
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:26,056
<i>You didn't forget. You kept looking
at your watch. I saw you.</i>

211
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,810
<i>l assumed that you were
afraid of missing Judging Amy.</i>

212
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,521
lt never occurred to me
you were choosing work

213
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,275
over being with
that sweet little biscuit.

214
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,360
That means a lot coming from you,

215
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,572
Mr Right-here-with-me
two-hours-after-his-shift-

216
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,033
and-last-Monday-night-too... guy.

217
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,619
- What?
- You heard me.

218
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,455
Newbie, what're you saying?

219
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,083
That you want to be like me?

220
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:59,256
Do you understand that
l just barely want to be like me?

221
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,060
l can't even pretend
l can give you tips on intercourse.

222
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,771
l got one for you.
Stop calling it that.

223
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:18,901
My therapist thinks my trouble in bed
stems from a fear of intimacy,

224
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:23,322
but l think it's because any type
of repetitive motion makes me nauseous.

225
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,784
And since l was a kid,
l've had nightmares about being crushed.

226
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,120
That poor shrink.

227
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:34,625
The one thing l do know is that
l've sabotaged a lot of relationships

228
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,587
by never talking things out
with the guy that l'm seeing.

229
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,466
- Thanks.
- Sure.

230
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,722
So...
You've really never had...

231
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,766
No.

232
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,394
- Not even by yourself?
- Gross.

233
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,024
ls it easy?

234
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,194
When's your next laundry night?

235
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,112
Ted.

236
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,157
l need you to take care
of some lawyer crap for me.

237
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:13,664
lt'd be great if you would go to traffic
court for me and make this go away.

238
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,750
l don't think so.

239
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,545
Excuse me?

240
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:25,008
No, Bob! l have my own things
l need to take care of.

241
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,845
Of course.

242
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,391
Walk off, bitch.

243
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,477
How is it, exactly,
that you just said that

244
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,980
and your pants are still dry?

245
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,566
Don't you understand

246
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,819
what you did
when you spoke to those interns?

247
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:47,406
You took away the fear.

248
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,493
You...
are a wonderful person,

249
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,497
and... l love you.

250
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:06,383
<i>I have to ask Alex
for another chance. I have to.</i>

251
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,762
<i>OK, she's with a hot guy. Stay calm.
She's gonna be psyched to see you.</i>

252
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,182
JD. Hey.

253
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,683
<i>Or not.</i>

254
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,812
l don't prioritise you over my job,
but l'd like to.

255
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,190
l wanted to be a doctor for so long,

256
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,026
l sort of forgot
how to want anything else.

257
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,528
And now l meet you, and...

258
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:31,158
l'll do anything in the world
if you give me a second chance.

259
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,536
l'm sorry.

260
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,292
l'll leave you guys alone.

261
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,547
OK, Rowdy,

262
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,799
fetch!

263
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,885
Hey, sweetie?

264
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,429
- We have to talk.
- No time for talk.

265
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,057
We have a problem
we need to take care of.

266
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,726
Why are you wearing
a nose-breathing thingy?

267
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,396
Baby, bear with me.
l got big ideas.

268
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,151
l've been having all these
thoughts going through my head,

269
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,779
and l'm afraid if l tell you,
l'd scare you away.

270
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:14,117
That's the last thing that l wanna...
Take that damn thing off.

271
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,870
Oh, God.

272
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:22,876
Baby, there's nothing
that could scare me away.

273
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,675
Since we said ''l love you'',
l've been feeling all this pressure.

274
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,427
And wondering about the future.
Our future.

275
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:35,305
Are we gonna get married?
Are we gonna have kids?

276
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,766
lf so, when will l get my figure back?

277
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,104
Where are we gonna live? Will my mother
live with us? How big a house?

278
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,606
How many bathrooms?
What if she walks in on you

279
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,611
while you're in the bathroom, you fall,
and l can't afford the funeral costs?

280
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,865
That's a little scary.

281
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:56,493
l guess l just need to know
you think about that stuff too.

282
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,203
Carla?

283
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,876
No, l don't.

284
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,214
- But l love it that you do.
- Yeah?

285
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:12,050
That's what
makes this relationship work.

286
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,053
We're so different.
l keep us in the present,

287
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,015
you look out for what's up ahead.

288
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,645
Besides, there is no way in hell

289
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,356
your mother's ever
going to live with us.

290
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,443
lf she ever walks in on me
while l'm in the bathroom,

291
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,904
she's getting a trip to Florida.

292
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,072
- No, she's not.
- l'm tell...

293
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,828
Ladies and germs,
if you get this shorthand down,

294
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,539
it has a way of making your day
go quicker.

295
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:46,043
''CTD'' being ''circling the drain.''
Your patient is on the way out.

296
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:50,214
''SOB'', ''shortness of breath''
and ''WNL'', ''within normal limits''.

297
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,382
Elvis, feel free to write this down,

298
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,844
any time before
you leave the building.

299
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,722
- You paged me?
- l didn't page you.

300
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,393
<i>And that's when Dr Cox started
poking the old bear with a stick.</i>

301
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,604
l'm sick
of the grill 'em and drill 'em.

302
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,232
What do you say
we shake things up?

303
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:13,487
You kids ask me the questions,
and l'll just give you the answers.

304
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,698
Dr Cox, could l talk to you?

305
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:21,286
Sure, Bob, but you have to raise
your hand like all the other children.

306
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,748
- l just think it's inappropriate...
- Bob-o?

00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:27,417
Now, you've got five
good ones right there.

308
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:32,422
What do you say you put 'em up
in the air like you just don't care?

309
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,716
Get over here, right now.

310
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,012
<i>Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and
didn't wanna take the one thing he had.</i>

311
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,349
<i>Maybe he just hated rounds.</i>

312
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,518
Get the hell outta my lCU!

313
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,145
<i>But if you didn't
know Dr Cox like I did,</i>

314
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,691
<i>you would've believed
his performance too.</i>

315
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:54,361
<i>I guess the key
to a lot of things is balance.</i>

316
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,905
<i>Whether it's balance of power...</i>

317
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,325
Dr Simotas, stop smiling.

318
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,205
l hate smiling.

319
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,667
<i>...balance in love...</i>

320
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,588
<i>...or sometimes...</i>

321
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,507
<i>...just balance.</i>

322
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,848
<i>For some of us,
it seems too far out of reach.</i>

323
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,865
<i>Too difficult to achieve.</i>

324
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:20,364
<i>But the important thing
is just to never stop trying.</i>

325
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,744
<i>Especially if you
like girls named Alex.</i>

326
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,121
<i>And chicken salad.</i>

327
00:21:29,305 --> 00:22:29,469

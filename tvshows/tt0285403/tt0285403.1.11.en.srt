1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,881
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,759
<i>When you spend every
waking moment in a hospital,</i>

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,844
<i>it's hard to get into the spirit.</i>

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:14,515
Are you aware that
you're in everyone's way?

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,850
Everyone's way?

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,103
Or your way? Think about it.

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,358
Think about it?
l'll think about it.

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,569
<i>Still, there are
some traditions I enjoy.</i>

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,532
<i>Like Nurse Tisdale's 9. 1 5 cup of coffee.</i>

10

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,634
- Carla, what time is it?
- l don't know

12
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,387
but l'm guessing
it's about 9.1 5ish.

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,764
This thing!

14
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,810
- Who put this up?
- l did.

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,146
l drove round the whole city
before my 5am shift,

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,066
just looking for that.

17
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,360
Trying to add a little cheer.

18
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,446
You will not ruin my Christmas.
Not again.

19
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,241
Not this year.

20
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,744
l've only worked here for three months.

21
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:22,207
<i>Things could be worse. I could be with
Elliot doing my day in the free clinic.</i>

22
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,710
l understand that you took a cab here.

23
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,922
But l can't give you Vicodin
because your teeth are itchy.

24
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,174
Dr Kelso?

25
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:35,470
l don't want to sound insensitive, but
why don't these people have any money?

26
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,516
l don't know, sir,
they probably waste it all on food.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,727
l need you to precept a patient.

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,397
1 9-year-old with abdominal pain.
She's eight months pregnant.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,150
l'll let the family practice people
handle it.

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,404
Wonderful idea, except
l heard your smart-aleck remark

31
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,240
so why don't you keep
your little pregnant girl?

32
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,703
lt'll be good practice since you'll
probably end up in a female specialty.

33
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,123
What do you mean by that?
l'm internal medicine.

34
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,752
Well, of course you are.
But numbers don't lie

35
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,048
and most women end up in OB-G YN,
family practice or paediatrics.

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,468
lt's like a riptide, sweetheart,
pulling and pulling,

37
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,304
and you can swim against
the current all you want.

38
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:22,351
When Mr Stork comes a-calling, you won't
think, ''l'm internal medicine.''

39
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:28,524
lt's gonna be, ''Oh! Look at the baby!''

40
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,443
Sir, l have to say, l'm offended.

41
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,405
Oh, no. Now l have to go
buy flowers to make it right.

42
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,386
Newbie, stay.
What a good boy you are.

43
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,889
Dear God, Judy,
how much product do you use?

44
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,058
None. lt's like this when l wake up.

45
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,018
Quick tip, there, sports star.

46
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:10,148
When you're defensive about your
feminine side, it makes you more girly.

47
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,862
- You want something?
- Nobody likes a cranky punching bag.

48
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,365
And yes, it's about a patient.
Pretty good friend of mine.

49
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,826
<i>I guess that means
he respects me a little.</i>

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,705
Randy, Jackie, what do you say?

51
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,667
This is the monkey l got
to videotape the birth.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,169
<i>I hate him.</i>

53
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,005
<i>But not as much as
I hate moments like these.</i>

54
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:37,384
<i>There's nothing I can do for him, but
when I go in, the family'll look at me</i>

55
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,137
<i>like I've got some
magical power to fix him.</i>

56
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,562
Hey, everybody!

57
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:04,828
l'm sorry, it's been two weeks, and your
son shows no neurological improvement.

58
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,167
lt was a miracle! First of all, the man
was near dead. Then he comes out.

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,587
- You're ridiculous.
- l'm telling you it was a miracle.

60
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,715
- lt was not a miracle.
- Yes, it was. Dude...

61
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,761
l envy Turk. To be that sure
of something, to have that faith.

62
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,847
<i>That doesn't mean I don't
love busting him about it.</i>

63
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,558
You think God was responsible
for his recovery?

64
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,978
That's fine.
We all have our beliefs.

65
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:34,066
l carry around this tiny little
Monopoly piece for good luck.

66
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,110
Did you compare my Lord and Saviour
to a tiny top hat?

67
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,363
He did, l heard him, baby.
Go get him.

68
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,534
Excuse me, Nurse Teresa.
Have you ever read the Bible?

69
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,496
l started it. Then l skipped to the end
and it ruined it for me.

70
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,084
That's it. Both of you to the window.
Let's go. Right now.

71
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:58,257
''When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.''

72
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,218
Matthew, 2:1 0.

73
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,097
Dude, that's just
a Christmas tree in the park.

74
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,307
l understand what you're saying.

75
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,477
Please. You can't just jump back
on my good side.

76
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,729
You see all of this right here?

77
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,773
And this?

78
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,899
And this?

79
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,361
Consider yourself cut off.
Full love embargo, baby.

80
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,656
- That's not gonna last.
- lt will last.

81
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,157
- Yeah?
- lt's gonna last.

82
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:29,204
What if l came up to you, all tired,
and l just... l had to yawn...?

83
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,667
Damn!

84
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,255
- How pathetic is that?
- Do it again.

85
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,882
Please.

86
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,970
This is from last night.
The Christmas tree over at Miller Park.

87
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,765
God, l love that tree.
lt's so beautiful, isn't it?

88
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,476
- l've been there almost...
- Listen, Meredith.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,022
You're pregnant.
Pretty far along, actually.

90
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,983
What? That's not possible.

91
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,235
What am l supposed to do?

92
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,115
''Look at the baby!''

93
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,119
Babies aren't really my thing,

94
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,414
so l'm just gonna go get you
someone else to talk to.

95
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,671
lt's great to see you guys again.
Really, all three of you.

96
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,759
What is it with friends
wanting to be in your life?

97
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,552
Selfish is what it is.

98
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,804
l got Randy and Jackie in the divorce.

99
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,641
<i>My God, his ex-wife.
The tension actually hurts.</i>

100
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,852
<i>You have to break it.
Say something. Anything!</i>

101
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,896
Banana hammock!

102
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,858
Your ability to thrive under pressure
is what drove you to medicine.

103
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,611
You should have seen him
when he was a new intern.

104
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,739
''l. Don't. Want. To. Be. A. Doctor.''

105
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,662
You know, l think we all know
that's just not true.

106
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,167
l'm assuming, since you
already took everything else,

107
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,461
that you're here for my self-respect,

108
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,506
but there's bad news
on that one, sweetcheeks.

109
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,386
l already gave it to your mom
when she begged me to marry you.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,975
l wouldn't have room for it, what with
your testicles in my trophy case.

111
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,936
Holy cow.

112
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,939
Who's better?
You got me by the short hairs.

113
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,274
See ya.

114
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,819
What do you hate most
about the holidays?

115
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,281
- Wrapping presents. You?
- My family.

116
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,075
l don't know how anyone
can get in the spirit here.

117
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,412
Come on, guys. All the spirit
you need is right here.

118
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,664
Can l get a amen?

119
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,459
<i>Turk's always been good
at rallying people.</i>

120
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,712
Congregation, l said,
can l get a amen?

121
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,088
Amen!

122
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,632
'Tis the season of givin', y'all.

123
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:49,219
What better place to give
than right here at Sacred Heart?

124
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:54,808
Lovest thou me,
then feed my sheep!

125
00:07:56,185 --> 00:08:00,939
Right here, at Sacred Heart,
we are not only gonna feed his sheep...

126
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,776
...but we gonna clothe them.

127
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,404
- And we gonna bathe them.
- Bathe them!

128
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,323
And we gonna cut 'em open.

129
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,492
Then we gonna stitch 'em
right back together.

130
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:17,247
Because that is what
Christmas....

131
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,874
...is all about.

132
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,543
That's right! Preach, preach!

133
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,463
What's the name of the song
we're singing today?

134
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,263
Right, listen.
l'm on call tonight.

135
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:18,642
But tomorrow morning, when l get home,
we're going to Mass before work, OK?

136
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,269
OK, sweetie.

137
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,813
<i>I don't wanna go to Mass
in the stupid...</i>

138
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,232
<i>Candy!</i>

139
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,988
l was trying to...

140
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,866
l know exactly what
you're trying to do, but...

141
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,119
you're not gonna break
my Christmas spirit. You can't.

142
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,830
Not ever. l'm the Holly Jolly Janitor.

143
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,792
Little girl. What do you want
for Christmas...?

144
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,964
l know you must be busy. lt's really
nice of you to offer to do this.

145
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,842
lt's no problem.

146
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,928
<i>Childbirth has been so romanticised.</i>

147
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,681
<i>I guess because if people
knew the truth...</i>

148
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,226
<i>Congratulations!
You're expecting.</i>

149
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,772
<i>Your doctor will tell you
everything you need to know.</i>

150
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,107
<i>Hi, doctor.</i>

151
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:10,903
You'll fart, pee, puke and poop
in front of ten complete strangers

152
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,739
who'll be staring
intently at your vagina,

153
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:18,160
which, by the way,

154
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,163
You do it.

155
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:26,502
<i>Still, no matter what the realities,
the end result is always the same.</i>

156
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,506
Look at the baby!

157
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,258
lt's a bouncing baby boy.

158
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:37,429
Yet another soldier
in the fight against Communism!

159
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,690
- Where's the girl that was in here?
- l just make beds.

160
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,613
l got Meredith Fox's blood work.
She's got HELLP syndrome.

161
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,741
She needs to deliver
immediately so let's get...

162
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,786
What do you mean she just left?

163
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,872
Get me any contact numbers.

164
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:07,251
- Why did she leave?
- Again. Bed-maker.

165
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,466
Newbie, l always punch
the tabs out of my tapes

166
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,094
so there's no way
they can be recorded over.

167
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:22,724
So please tell me you didn't use
the tape that was already in the camera.

168
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,643
Banana hammock.

169
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,480
So, in other words,
there is no permanent historical record

170
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,984
of the birth of my friend's baby?

171
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,112
Well, l think that the baby itself

172
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,657
would serve as proof that it was,
you know...

173
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,410
...born.

174
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,997
You don't understand
what you've done.

175
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,333
My ex-wife is gonna hold this
over my head for so long

176
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,503
that l doubt l'll ever
see the sun again.

177
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:56,216
And l liked the sun, Newbie.
lt made me hopeful.

178
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,676
Well, l was there.

179
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,637
l could certainly jot down some of my...

180
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,932
...feelings and impressions.

181
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,313
<i>If he was really mad at me,
he would have stayed and yelled at me.</i>

182
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,192
<i>Don't kid yourself.
I couldn't be any madder at you.</i>

183
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:18,197
<i>No, do not do that again.
That's a bad Newbie.</i>

184
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:25,329
<i>I can go home now. Maybe
it's because Christmas is a hard time,</i>

185
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,831
<i>or because too many families
get together,</i>

186
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,628
<i>but Christmas Eve, it's one of the
worst nights of the year to be on call.</i>

187
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,091
l can't believe l'm wearing a suit
at 6.30 in the morning.

188
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,385
lf you ruin this for Turk,
l'll hurt you.

189
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,220
Noted.

190
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,267
You better hurry up.
Mass starts in 1 5 minutes.

191
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,770
- l'm not going.
- Great. Can l go back to bed?

192
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:35,023
l'm kidding. l wanna get
some of them church crackers.

193
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,943
No, l'm not going.
Ever.

194
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,282
Baby, what happened?

195
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,701
Turk? Turk, come on...

196
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,787
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

197
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,833
You're overreacting.

198
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,753
A girl said, ''What am l gonna do?''
and l said, ''Babies aren't my thing.''

199
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,964
How could l be too hard on myself?

200
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,175
<i>Just don't say
''Banana hammock''.</i>

201
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,094
Look, l'm sure she'll turn up.

202
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:08,640
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
She'll turn up, have a healthy baby

203
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:12,186
and nothing'll ever happen
to either one of them.

204
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,230
<i>I never really thought
of faith as important.</i>

205
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:20,736
<i>But without his, I don't know,
Turk kinda seems like he's fading away.</i>

206
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,449
<i>I could use a little faith. I have to
tell them I didn't tape a thing.</i>

207
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,952
You made some interesting
choices with the camera, Orson.

208
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,580
- You didn't want any faces?
- Excuse me?

209
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,916
l switched the tapes.
Just go with it.

210
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,293
Here it comes, l see the head!

211
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,505
- What a gorgeous head of hair.
- That's funny.

212
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,466
He was bald when he was in here
a few minutes ago.

213
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,801
- Yeah, well...
- We shaved the baby.

214
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,013
- You shaved the baby?
- Shaved it.

215
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,267
Standard procedure. What with
the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.

216
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,978
Yep. Definitely.

217
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,105
Shave and haircut.

218
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,067
Two bits.

219
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,568
Really?

220
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,990
l'm not buying it.

221
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,077
You two are gonna go by the
nursery and see baby Charlie?

222
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,329
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

223
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,665
Charlie and his new haircut.

224
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,298
- Have we checked the other hospitals?
- They haven't seen her, honey.

225
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,678
Dr Reid, isn't this your day off?

226
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,932
- lt's that pregnant girl...
- The one who went missing.

227
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,394
And now you're here, voluntarily,

228
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,314
hell bent on finding
one of your little lost ducklings.

229
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:43,569
lt's important you understand something.
l'm not interested in babies.

230
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,904
l don't melt when l see them,

231
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,782
l don't have a yearning
to make them my life's work.

232
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,119
l'm a doctor interested in my patients,
male or female.

233
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,872
Right now, one of them needs help.

234
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,167
God! Do l know women.

235
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,547
l don't get it. Why are we on the roof?

236
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,177
l wanted to show you that no matter
how ugly things can get down there,

237
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,679
there's still a lot of beauty up here.

238
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:15,934
ls that... gum or pigeon crap
on my sneaker?

239
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,937
Come on, look around.

240
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,857
There's nobody here,
no one can see us.

241
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,818
We could do whatever we wanted.

242
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,445
Like what?

243
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,238
How are you not getting this?

244
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:31,742
You mean have relations.

245
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,828
You wanna have relations
right here on the roof.

246
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:38,540
The pebbles will make my ass
look like a chocolate chocolate chip.

247
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:43,378
l can make you see God again,
or at least call out his name.

248
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,130
ls this a joke to you?

249
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:48,008
No, l'm just trying
to help you feel better.

250
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,053
- You don't know how l feel.
- Well, then tell me.

251
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,305
l feel abandoned!

252
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,935
All my life, l've believed
that God listens to our prayers,

253
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,606
and that he cares for us
and that he watches over us.

254
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,943
Last night, so many people
needed to be watched over.

255
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,451
How am l supposed to believe in someone
that's gonna let innocent people suffer?

256
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,913
Answer me, please.

257
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,624
l can't.

258
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,879
Did you see baby Charlie yet?

259
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:29,424
Oh, yeah, l was just planning
on doing that. Never.

260
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,552
You're such a special friend.

261
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,680
Gosh, Marjorie,
aren't you sassy today?

262
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:38,851
Did Santa finally bring you that
Y chromosome you always wanted?

263
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:43,105
- What's your problem, anyway?
- For starters, l hate Christmas.

264
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,900
l don't like bambersnoodles,
l loathe dinkerwallows,

265
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:50,112
l hate snagtumgopers,

266
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,115
l say, do you follow?

267
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,075
Do you think l'm a moron?

268
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,745
Don't answer that question.
lt's a trick, that's a trick.

269
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,914
Pre-natal lice?

270
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,750
You do realise that
would be lice in the womb?

271
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,211
l've seen them,
they're real and gross.

272
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:10,257
<i>Maybe Dr Cox had pushed me too far.
Whatever it was, I told on him.</i>

273
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,093
Plus, he didn't even
go see baby Charlie yet.

274
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,305
<i>And then something amazing
happened. They connected.</i>

275
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,099
<i>And all the hatred
they had for each other</i>

276
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,727
<i>was suddenly focused on me.</i>

277
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,564
Excuse me, Sally Sensitive,
l don't remember asking you anything.

278
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:29,151
Your mom's aware she'll
have to stop breast-feeding?

279
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:33,947
Good Jordan, good. Now work the body,
under the ribs.

280
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:39,036
l'm not gonna see that baby either.
Are you gonna tattle on me? Are you?

281
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,288
- l'm frightened.
- Do you have a second?

282
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,290
- God, yes.
- Run away.

283
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,668
l spoke to a 91 1 operator
who got a call from a girl in labour,

284
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,588
but they lost the signal.
l don't know what to do.

285
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,882
<i>One of the worst things
about this place</i>

286
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,552
<i>is how often you feel like
there's no one to turn to.</i>

287
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,777
You'll be OK.

288
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,157
<i>Babies are amazing.</i>

289
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,202
<i>Especially the way
they bring people together.</i>

290
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,371
So, baby Charlie is the bald one?

291
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:09,126
Yeah. He wouldn't be smiling so much
if he knew how ugly his parents were.

292
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,672
- You're a sexy bitch.
- Thanks.

293
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:20,470
<i>I really think it's impossible
to be unaffected.</i>

294
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,348
What up, little dawg?

295
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,521
<i>A baby can stir something deep down
inside you, you didn't know was there.</i>

296
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,191
Look at the baby!

297
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,152
<i>They help you find something
you thought you'd lost.</i>

298
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,529
How did you know she was here?

299
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,740
l don't know, l just knew.

300
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,327
<i>I guess Turk was right after all.</i>

301
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,662
<i>Miracles do happen.</i>

302
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,431
<i>I think you just have to

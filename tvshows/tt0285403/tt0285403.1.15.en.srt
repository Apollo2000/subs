1
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,889
<i>You slept with your best friend!</i>

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,351
<i>This will be a disaster
unless you say the right thing,</i>

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>so choose your words carefully.</i>

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,688
Great job last night, buddy.

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,447
Good thing you came along.
l've been on four since med school.

6
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,493
Damn it.

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,584
We shouldn't feel weird about this.

8
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,879
- Things like this happen all the time.
- All the time!

9
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,215
- lt's not a big deal.
- it's not a big deal.

10
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,968
Stop repeating
what l say in that weird tone.

11
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,223
- No more repeating.
- What happened last night was

12
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,392
a wonderful mistake.

13
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:03,355
And it's probably best
if we just go back to the way things were.

14
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,941
l totally agree.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,321
l'm gonna see you tomorrow.

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,532
Tomorrow.

17
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,160
<i>Elliot's amazing
and you're crazy about her.</i>

18
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,913
<i>If you let her leave,
I'm gonna do this all day:</i>

19
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:24,126
<i>I get knocked down but I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down</i>

20
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>I get knocked down...</i>

21
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,130
Wait, Elliot...

22
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,093
l just...

23
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,515
Just say it.
Say, ''Elliot, stay in bed

24
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,685
and have sex with me
until neither of us can move.''

25
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,563
Let's do that.

26
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,649
l cannot believe
you almost let me leave.

27
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,987
You're gonna pay for that.

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,406
l'm good for that.

29
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,076
l got to...

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

31
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,599
We are really good at having sex.
We should take this show on the road.

32
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,976
My mom would sit in the front row

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,021
and tell me l'd look prettier
if l smiled more.

34
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,982
You don't really smile.
You just make this face.

35
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,612
You looked surprised that
you were actually having sex.

36
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,490
l was. l mean, four times?

37
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,659
Give it up.

38
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,704
- l think l already did.
- You did.

39
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,998
How weird was that this morning?

40
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:49,002
Have you ever been more
uncomfortable in your entire life?

41
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>You look hot in that dress.</i>

42
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,340
What movie are we watching?

43
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,176
<i>lt's Basic Instinct, Grandma.</i>

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,054
Yeah, once.
But all this sex?

45
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,682
lt just soothes my soul.

46
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,977
And l really like your nose.

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,229
How did that last time even start?

48
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,565
l just know l went to the door

49
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,318
and when l came back, you said
l looked sexy holding a pizza.

50
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,488
You did.

51
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,575
For safety reasons, l should go.

52
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,994
You're not going anywhere.

53
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,247
You gotta help me eat this pizza.

54
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,378
Good.

55
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,132
See now, you even look sexy
holding that slice.

56
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,218
- l do, don't l?
- You do.

57
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,394
l was not. You were.

58
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,398
Sometimes l like
a little sugar in my coffee.

59
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,652
l just think it's best
if we keep this between us for now.

60
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,447
lt's hard enough
without everybody talking.

61
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,576
But it'll help people.
Like those two, for instance.

62
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,914
They've been dancing around
each other for months now.

63
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,212
l'm not afraid
to show people here how l feel about you.

64
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,798
You just want the guys
to know you're getting some.

65
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,967
Not just the guys.

66
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,053
Good morning, Dr Cox!

67
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,263
We are short-staffed today

68
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,683
because Kelso has volunteered
all of you scut monkeys

69
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,311
for some psychologist's research project,

70
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,648
which means
you won't be helping patients.

71
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,859
lnstead, you'll be
blabbering about your feelings,

72
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,445
and what it's like
working in the hospital,

73
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:42,324
and how that affects
your personal lives and...

74
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,537
And there he is now,
big Bob-o himself.

75
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,707
All nurses and interns,
let's gather round

76
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,918
and dance for the puppet master.

77
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,962
Dance!

78
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,298
lt's not just the nurses and interns.

79
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,926
Don't be that guy, Bob.

80
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,971
l guess l became a doctor because

81
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,599
ever since l was a little boy,
l just wanted to help people.

82
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,352
l don't tell this story very often,

83
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,063
but l remember
when l was seven years old,

84
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,108
l found a bird
that had fallen out of its nest.

85
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,694
So, l picked him up
and l brought him home,

86
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,030
and l made him a house
out of an empty shoebox, and...

87
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,533
My God!

88
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,080
l became a doctor for the same
four reasons everybody does:

89
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,499
Chicks, money, power and chicks.

90
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,586
But since HMOs have
made it virtually impossible

91
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,006
to make any real money,
which affects the number of chicks

92
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,885
who come sniffing around, and don't
ask what tree they're barking up,

93
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:47,014
cos they're sure not pissing on mine.
And as far as power goes, well...

94
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,517
Here l am during my free time
letting some 1 3-year-old

95
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:55,314
psychology fellow ask me questions
about my personal life.

96
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,775
So here's the inside scoop.

97
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,487
Why don't you go ahead
and tell me all about power?

98
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,574
Check her out.

99
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,202
- Dude, HFFA.
- Excuse me?

100
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,581
HFFA? ''Hot from far away''
but up close she's nasty.

101
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,667
That is so messed up.

102
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,883
l am sorry l made an insensitive
statement about an ugly person.

103
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,968
l'm taking one of those moments

104
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,514
where l weigh your good qualities
against your bad ones

105
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,850
and decide
if you're actually worth the trouble.

106
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,604
You made it. That was close.

107
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,315
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

108
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,984
Elliot's looking for a surgical consult.

109
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:45,072
- Do you know where she is?
- Why should l know?

110
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:49,910
l know where the Todd
would like Elliot to be. ln his pants.

111
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,411
Clever.

112
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:55,207
She's not going out with anyone.
You should ask her out.

113
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,043
Elliot and the Todd?
That's a terrible couple.

114
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,672
- Worse than Joanie and Chachi.
- Joanie loves Chachi.

115
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,674
The Todd is asking Elliot out.

116
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,760
- l think she'd be lucky to ride my...
- Please.

117
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,387
...motorcycle.

118
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,264
Gotcha.

119
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,892
God bless him.

120
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,897
When l was seven,
the only things that l loved

121
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,859
were my ColecoVision...
and Sandy Lowe.

122
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,820
Sandy was as fine
as a 7-year-old could be.

123
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,739
She had the body of a 9-year-old.

124
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,243
l joined the T-ball team
because she was on it.

125
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,121
l didn't care that much about sports.

126
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,083
But, during the first game,
l got all caught up,

127
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,586
and fell in love with competing.

128
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,130
And so, through
high school and college,

129
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,967
l pretty much played everything
because l needed to compete.

130
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,136
lt was my drug.

131
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:55,934
That's why l became a surgeon. Every day,
you get to step up to the table

132
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,271
and go one-on-one against
what's wrong with the patient.

133
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,690
And if you're really good at it,

134
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,943
you win most of the time.

135
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,157
l ran into Sandy Lowe last Christmas,

136
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,201
and she didn't look so good.

137
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,579
And that was kind of awkward, cos,

138
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,415
well, l look like this.

139
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,011
Are you following me?

140
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,514
No. You wanna go out some time?

141
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,015
With you?

142
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,727
Me and a bottle of Jagermeister.

143
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,772
No, Todd, l don't.
But l don't want you to think

144
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,233
it's because l'm a lesbian or anything.

145
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:50,405
l find you so creepy, l think you should
walk around with a bell around your neck.

146
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,741
All l heard was ''lesbian''.

147
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,661
Let me talk to her for you.

148
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,831
Why did he ask me out?

149
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,292
l don't know.
Because you're cute and you're fun,

150
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:07,339
and l told him to. Plus, there's rumours
going around that you're a lesbian.

151
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:12,719
You told me not to tell anyone about us,
so maybe l just wanna make a point.

152
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,181
And now l'm gonna kiss you.

153
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,567
lt's cool. JD's in the closet
talking to a girl for me.

154
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,152
White boys.

155
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,863
You too.

156
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:28,086
When l was little, my mom used to
have what she called ''episodes''.

157
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,592
''Episodes'' is a flattering term
for this thing where she'd sweat a lot and...

158
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,387
Let's just say her stomach talked.

159
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,641
Anyway, this one time,
we were at the supermarket

160
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,434
and she actually passed out.

161
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,938
And out of nowhere,
this fancy-looking guy comes forward

162
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:50,609
and tells everyone to step aside
and give my mother some air.

163
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,778
And everyone did.

164
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,617
You have to understand, in my family,
nobody listens to a word anyone else says.

165
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,205
Even screaming
at the top of our lungs... nothing.

166
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:08,126
So when this man said,
''Step aside'', and everyone did,

167
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,963
l asked my aunt, ''Who is this guy?''

168
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,423
And she said he was a doctor.

169
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,011
And l thought,

170
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,515
''l want to be a doctor too.''

171
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:28,355
But when l lost my first tooth,
and nobody left $1 80,000

172
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,567
under my pillow,
l decided to become a nurse.

173
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,737
We do all the real stuff anyway.

174
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,082
- You OK?
- Yeah.

175
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:51,211
l may eventually need a vagina transplant.

176
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:53,964
Go! Go!

177
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,926
We don't have much time!

178
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,721
You know what?

179
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:05,976
After l have sex five times with somebody,
l like to have the relationship talk.

180
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,562
l know it seems rushed,
but five times

181
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,983
usually takes me anywhere
between six months and seven years.

182
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,863
Let's do it.
Let's have the talk.

183
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,782
- You my boyfriend?
- Yep. You my girlfriend?

184
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,367
- Yep.
- Cool.

185
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,828
Good to talk things through.

186
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,206
l love that little laugh.

187
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,667
From now on, that is your laugh.

188
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,760
What?

189
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:44,973
l've seen you naked, so everything
you're doing, l'm watching you do it naked.

190
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:49,144
So, if l go like this...

191
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,481
l just... l saw all of that.

192
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,527
Don't be shy. Come here, baby.

193
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:04,117
- The echo report on the aorta...
- Bravo. Just a big bravo.

194
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,412
Heaven help me,
l love newbie theatre.

195
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,707
Honest, l do. lt's the way
you both play your parts

196
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,419
with such wonderful commitment
that almost had me believing

197
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,841
that you aren't having whiny, neurotic,
pale sex with each other.

198
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,009
What are you talking about?

199
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,638
The whole floor knows.
We do. Watch this.

200
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,807
Laverne, did you know?

201
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,143
Was it supposed to be a secret?

202
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,145
And Carla?

203
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,439
Please. l knew before they did.

204
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,608
So, there it is.

205
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,444
And if you go ahead
and listen very carefully,

206
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,865
you'll hear the familiar sound
of no one caring.

207
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,079
l like that guy.

208
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:54,334
When the Kelsonoviches
settled in Monroeville, PA,

209
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,212
there were two steel mills, three bars,

210
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,923
and not a doctor in sight.

211
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,635
Then my old man set up a shingle

212
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,138
and started delivering babies

213
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:10,392
and stitching up three-fingered
steel men by the wagonload.

214
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,937
Everybody loved him.

215
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,024
When they couldn't come up with the cash,

216
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,360
he would gladly
accept a handmade sweater

217
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:23,739
or a bushel of turnips.

218
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,782
Jackass.

219
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,993
Now l get to do this in public.

220
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,836
This is a hospital, all right?
People here are already sick.

221
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,671
You guys do it all the time.

222
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:43,091
- Tell me we don't look like that.
- We don't look like that.

223
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,010
You guys are just jealous

224
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,472
cos you're not
the hot couple in town any more.

225
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,682
Jealous, my chocolate butt!

226
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,519
l'm telling you, we are so damn hot,

227
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,605
last night, when l was
home waiting for Turk,

228
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:01,652
l put on this tiny negligee. lt was so small
l took it off my Latin Barbie...

229
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,988
When l got home, you were asleep,
drooling like a sheepdog.

230
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,366
You don't have to tell 'em that.

231
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,159
While you guys were sleeping,

232
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,371
we were up in the kitchen
fryin' up some love.

233
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,708
Relationships? Well, Sigmund,

234
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,920
relationships are so fragile.

235
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,631
lt just takes one thing, one...

236
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,511
...tiny little offence,
and it can snowball on you.

237
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,348
And if that snowball starts
to pick up speed, God forbid,

238
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,684
you better tuck and go.

239
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,105
Why did you do that?
How could you think

240
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,358
that's appropriate conversation for work?

241
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,112
- We didn't have sex.
- No.

242
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:50,909
- Especially not on the stove. What?
- That is not funny.

243
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,703
Sorry.

244
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,872
We didn't.

245
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:02,087
That's great. Thanks.

246
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,339
Thanks a lot, JD. Really mature.

247
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,633
Come on.

248
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,218
Elliot.

249
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,980
l am so full.

250
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,317
- Give me another slice.
- Really?

251
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,527
Yeah. Big one.

252
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:29,990
l cannot have any more
until l work off the last two slices.

253
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:34,328
So what do you say?
Fat, gassy, bloaty sex?

254
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,246
OK.

255
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,751
- l'm gonna puke!
- l don't care.

256
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,840
Mr Lewis,

257
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,801
we're gonna need another stool sample.

258
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:54,848
Not for medical reasons.
My robot needs food.

259
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,518
That laugh.

260
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,438
But it's your laugh. l gave it to you.

261
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:04,107
l love it so much,
l can't stop using it.

262
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,987
lt's not as charming if you're mad.

263
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,991
You only laugh at your own jokes.
You never laugh at anything l do.

264
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,618
That's not true.

265
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,204
...colonoscopy.
Dr Cox, l'm open!

266
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,122
Hit me!

267
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,170
There was nothing funny about that.

268
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,590
Maybe you just don't know funny.
Let me help you out.

269
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,636
<i>Silly hats are funny.
ALF? Very funny!</i>

270
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,974
Anyone in a chicken suit...
Oversized phones are funny.

271
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,393
- JD...
- Hold on.

272
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,519
Hello?

273
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,689
She's right here.

274
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,691
lt's for you.

275
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,653
You know what?
You're not as funny as you think you are.

276
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,197
And bam!

277
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,700
The shine's off the apple.

278
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,078
That's when you find out that
that pretty girl you married

279
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:02,666
isn't a pretty girl at all.
No. She's a man-eater.

280
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,462
And l'm not talking about the ''Whoa,
whoa, here she comes'' kind of man-eater.

281
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:11,717
l'm talking about the kind
that uses your dignity as a dishtowel

282
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,472
to wipe up any shreds of manhood
that might be stuck inside the sink.

283
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,684
l may have tormented her
from time to time,

284
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,520
but that's what l thought
marriage was all about.

285
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,857
So much so,
that by the end of that relationship,

286
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,945
l honestly don't know
who l hated more: her or me.

287
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,742
l used to sit around and wonder

288
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:41,622
why our friends weren't trying
to destroy each other, like we were.

289
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:45,209
And here it turns out
the answer's pretty simple.

290
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,630
They weren't unhappy.

291
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,883
We were.

292
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,058
l suck at this.

293
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,893
Sorry.

294
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,811
You look great bent over.

295
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:10,317
l rolled that damn thing exactly
the way the video l bought told me to.

296
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,862
Probably just a bad ball.

297
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,907
You don't have to patronise me.
Tell me that l suck.

298
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,827
lt's hard to be honest
when you're so neurotic

299
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,497
you don't even trust the computer
to keep your score.

300
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,375
- l'm neurotic?
- l'm sorry!

301
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:31,588
- ls it always this hard?
- Bowling's a tricky sport.

302
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,715
- No, l meant...
- l know.

303
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,884
lt's difficult for everybody.

304
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,139
- My baby got a strike!
- l got a strike!

305
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,479
- My baby did it!
- l got a strike!

306
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,440
Knock 'em down!
My baby know how to knock 'em down!

307
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,193
- Turk! l'm dizzy!
- Sorry.

308
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,779
l'm sorry about him.

309
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,197
My turn!

310
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,080
Want me to pick you up?

311
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,963
Enid has always understood

312
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,841
how much my career meant to me.

313
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,886
She knows
l'm an important man in my field,

314
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:22,973
and it helps her get on all those
boards of things her friends are on.

315
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,350
You know, like, bringing art

316
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:29,438
to the underprivileged kids
in the community, blah, blah, blah.

317
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:34,902
When l first met her,
she wanted to be a psychiatrist.

318
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,362
But we both decided

319
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,949
that that wasn't a fitting profession
for a family woman.

320
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,161
No offence, sweetheart.

321
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,831
l know she's grateful.

322
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,292
She likes to joke that

323
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,630
l choked the last breath of life
out of her long ago.

324
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:58,008
Now she's just a shell of a woman.

325
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,595
l think that's so cute.
l call her Shelly.

326
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,434
You know, when l call her that,

327
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,312
sometimes she laughs so hard,

328
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,190
she cries a little.

329
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,860
You should've gotten a cardiology fellow

330
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,322
to give Mrs Zuckerman
a transvenous pacemaker one hour ago.

331
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,616
Sir, l was waiting to see...

332
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,494
You were waiting. l'm sorry, that's...

333
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,080
That's my mistake.

334
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,415
l'm gonna wait with ya.

335
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,584
Dr Cox...

336
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,795
Gotta give it time.
Because, you see,

337
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:38,715
when you're waiting for someone
to get better all by themselves,

338
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,885
the whole thing becomes about time.

339
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:45,639
l was waiting to see if she would
tolerate her low heart rate,

340
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,101
which is what the textbooks tell us to do.
Am l right, JD?

341
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,398
- ls she right, JD?
- Technically, yes.

342
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,901
But it's really a judgment call,

343
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,362
and if she really was that bradycardic,

344
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,823
l probably would've called the fellow.

345
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,995
But l... That's me. l...

346
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:13,584
Always side with the hoochie, Newbie?

347
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,836
lt's a rookie mistake.

348
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,005
You hate to see it.

349
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:24,678
- Tell you about my girlfriend?
- Tell you about my boyfriend?

350
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,597
OK.

351
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,143
l can be myself around Carla.

352
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,687
Turk makes me feel completely safe

353
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,149
and totally independent
at the same time.

354
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:42,196
And it's all the same,
whether l'm with her or with my boys.

355
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,531
l can say whatever's on my mind.

356
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,783
And even if he doesn't like it,

357
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,828
even if he doesn't understand it,
he respects it.

358
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:54,875
Don't get me wrong. l'm not gonna
give my boys a back rub.

359
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,420
Sure, if a brother's got an itch,
l'll scratch it, but...

360
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:01,256
He seems to like who l am.

361
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,425
She's a cool lady.

362
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,554
- l love her.
- l love him.

363
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,438
l should've stood up for you
with Dr Cox.

364
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,315
You should've.

365
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,610
l don't want him to think
it's about our relationship.

366
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,279
l know that you want Dr Cox
to respect you,

367
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:26,698
but you should want me
to respect you too.

368
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:30,077
lf l didn't respect you,
l wouldn't be having sex with you.

369
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,289
- That's not true. l would be.
- lf you can't talk for real, forget it.

370
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:37,876
A perfect dismount
off her high horse.

371
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,922
lf you don't like something, say it.
Why hide behind stupid jokes?

372
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,716
Why is it impossible for you
to let anything go?

373
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,595
l let stuff go, like when you wouldn't
stand up for me with Dr Cox,

374
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,348
or when you told everyone
we're having sex.

375
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:55,602
- When are you letting that go?
- You wanna know why l won't let that go?

376
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,855
You wouldn't stand up for me

377
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:01,775
because you're terrified
that someone won't like you.

378
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,611
And that's a bad thing?

379
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:09,324
Why don't we get all my friends together
in a room and we'll fight your friend.

380
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,829
l'm getting so tired of this.

381
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,165
Elliot, this is me.

382
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:20,878
And there's a lot of people here
who like me for who l am.

383
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:26,550
- l thought you were one of 'em.
- l thought l was too.

384
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,096
Relationships don't work
the way they do in the movies.

385
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,684
Will they? Won't they? They finally do
and they're happy for ever.

386
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,771
Nine out of ten end because they
weren't right for each other to begin with,

387
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,941
and half of the ones that get married
get divorced anyway.

388
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:46,278
And through all this,
l have not become a cynic.

389
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:51,116
l do happen to believe
that love is mainly about

390
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,830
pushing chocolate-covered candies,
and you know, in some cultures, a chicken.

391
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,416
You can call me a sucker.
l don't care.

392
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,336
Because l do believe in it.

393
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:07,758
Bottom line is couples
that are right for each other

394
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,427
wade through the same crap
as everybody else.

395
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:14,348
But the big difference is,
they don't let it take 'em down.

396
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,101
One of those two people
will fight for that relationship

397
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:22,523
every time, if it's right
and they're real lucky.

398
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,151
One of 'em will say something.

399
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,292
Things that wouldn't have bothered
you a week ago in a friendship

400
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:46,547
become so incredibly important
when sex is involved.

401
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:52,803
l just think it'd be easier

402
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:56,348
if you weren't friends
with your girlfriend

403
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:59,017
at all.

404
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:03,522
l've always been sure about everything.
Sure that l wanted to be a doctor,

405
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:07,526
and l was sure that l was gonna
be married by the time l was 25.

406
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,904
But relationships...

407
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:15,075
l always heard that
when they were right, they were easy.

408
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,412
That even when things got hard

409
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,206
that they were easy.

410
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,084
l don't get that at all.

411
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,295
How is that possible?

412
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,548
Am l in a relationship now?

413
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:35,304
No. l'm not in one now.

414
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,184
No.

415
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,872
l can't believe today's over.

416
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:05,667
- l can't believe l ate half a pizza.
- Please. You had two pieces.

417
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:10,422
lf you tell anyone anything about today,
please leave that part out.

418
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,050
l will, cos l'm a gentleman.

419
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,935
Do you think this is gonna work out?

420
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:26,396
Yeah. l think it's gonna be great.

421
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,156
l believe you.

422
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,159
l believe me too.

423
00:27:40,305 --> 00:28:40,313

I thought I'd lost my watch</i>

Are you?
lf you have time to listen to music,

9
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:33,719

<i>That work day

12
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:16,428
- How's it goin'?
- l'm a 37-year-old janitor.

13
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,971
How d'you think it's going?

14
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,724
There is nothing wrong
with being a janitor.

15
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,479
Really? Thank you,
you've turned my life around.

16
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:30,234
l'll tell my janitor wife and all our
janitor kids that life is worth living.

17
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:35,072
And that comes straight from our hero,
Dr Whozits, Dr Nothing.

18
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,740
No, seriously, come on.

19
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:41,119
Come over to my humble house and
point out things that are cheap.

20
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,081
<i>Luckily, I had the night off to regroup.</i>

21
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,337
- That dog is creepy.
- Be nice to Rowdy.

22
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,049
The guy we bought him from kept
him in a box full of old hats.

23
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,179
Why is she here all the time?

24
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,934
- Just give her a chance, man.
- You want to hit that.

25
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,519
- No!
- Yeah!

26
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,522
She's just a friend.

27
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:13,652
lt's healthy, hanging out with a girl
without the ultimate goal being sex.

28
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,155
- You know?
- l'm not following.

29
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,078
Creepy. l had a run-in
with that nurse, Carla.

30
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,707
She forgot to check the stats
on a patient and gave me attitude.

31
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,584
Did you tell on her?

32
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:32,296
- Who's responsible for this?
- She is.

33
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,467
l don't remember.
Why do you assume it was my fault?

34
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,971
<i>It'd be a good point, except Elliot
puts her foot in her mouth.</i>

35
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,974
<i>A lot.
She can't really seem to stop.</i>

36
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,728
Just because l occasionally
say something stupid doesn't mean

37
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:53,275
l go door-to-door annoying people,
like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.

38
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,069
- You're not?
- No.

39
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,864
My mother is.

40
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,869
He's black, too.
You should tease him about that.

41
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,165
<i>I'm doing better with new people.
Like Carla, for instance.</i>

42
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,543
Bambi, that blonde stick
you hang out with? Tell her...

43
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,467
You might have to
write that down for me.

44
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,387
<i>And Dr Cox. We've really connected.
I'm kind of like his protיgי.</i>

45
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,141
- l need to see his chart...
- Done, copied and highlighted.

46
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:30,229
Unfortunately, radar,
l'm fresh out of gold stars.

47
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,233
Multilobar pneumonia at 31 .
How much does he smoke?

48
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,068
l don't know.

49
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,279
lt's your attention to detail
that impresses me most.

50
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,493
- How many packs a day, genius?
- Half a pack.

51
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,621
l'm sorry.
l phrased the question wrong.

52
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,165
How many packs a day, really?

53
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,251
Eleven.

54
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,545
You don't know where l'm coming from.

55
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,880
Two or three packs.

56
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,550
Let's hear it.

57
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,177
l don't smoke so... Zero packs.

58
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,765
What tests have you ordered?

59
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,852
l was just...
l was totally kidding with you.

60
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,145
He was. We're all in on it.

61
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,941
<i>I like Will. That makes this harder.</i>

62
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,319
l ordered blood cultures
and a high-resolution CT.

63
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,114
What are you looking for?

64
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,117
Cancer.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,912
<i>When you say ''cancer, ''
every person reacts the same way.</i>

66
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,623
<i>- Excellent.
- Not like that.</i>

67
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,127
<i>There it is.</i>

68
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,716
<i>I never know what to say to
Turk's buddies. But I'm getting better.</i>

69
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,593
So...

70
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,470
- How's surgery?
- lt rocks.

71
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:50,350
But my bedroom, that's where
l really operate. Am l right?

72
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,354
<i>- Come on, show Todd some love!
- I hate showing Todd love.</i>

73
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,735
Bambi, why are you slumming
with these scalpel jocks?

74
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,030
Please, baby.
This here's the VlP table.

75
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,575
Why don't you
sit your fine self down?

76
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,247
''Baby, this here's the VlP table...''

77
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,750
l'm not really interested in her.

78
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,796
Then the Todd'll show
that little biscuit some love.

79
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,677
<i>Maybe he's a bit interested.</i>

80
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,264
Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.

81
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,102
l'm going to ask Carla out.

82
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:38,232
- l think the janitor's out to get me.
- Thank you so much for your help.

83
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,400
Why not be a bit more paranoid?

84
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,362
- Wait, Turk...
- That's him.

85
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,370
Hi, how are you?

86
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,250
l need David Farr's chart.

87
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,794
We all need lots of things.

88
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,964
Great. Dr Kelso?
You're the Chief of Medicine.

89
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,759
ls there a special way
to communicate with nursing staff?

90
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,013
Sugar won't work.
They're already so sweet.

91
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,768
Now, listen,
Dr Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is,

92
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,312
you tattled yesterday, l responded.

93
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:21,191
l feel closer to you than ever.
But the ramifications are yours.

94
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:25,571
Don't drag me into your pathetic,
whiny, little squabble

95
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,366
with that bunch of malcontents.
l hope you all kill each other.

96
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,577
Have a great day, ladies.

97
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,833
l hate this place.

98
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,003
Dr Cox, l got Will's CT results back.

99
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,006
No cancer.
So what shall l tell him?

100
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,716
l'd open with that.

101
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,469
He's headed down such a bad road,
maybe we could talk to him...

102
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,682
<i>When you have a mentor, you understand
the meaning behind their words.</i>

103
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,227
<i>- You do whatever you want.
- Means ''Great idea''.</i>

104
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,314
l'm just happy
you haven't messed up yet today.

105
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,358
<i>Means ''You're really
coming along as a doctor''.</i>

106
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:08,405
<i>- Don't ever touch me.
- Means ''Don't ever touch him''.</i>

107
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,575
Just thought it was a nice moment.

108
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,206
- l don't wanna.
- Come on.

109
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,879
Carla, l shouldn't have
told Dr Kelso on you.

110
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,465
No, you shouldn't have.

111
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,135
<i>Comfortable silences.</i>

112
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,555
But thank you for apologising.

113
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,517
Good.

114
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,853
- l wanna make one thing clear.
- Nothing needs to be clear.

115
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,398
l still think you were in the wrong.

116
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:48,237
Checking orthostatics is your job.
l need to know you'll take care of it.

117
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,740
That's all l'm saying.

118
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,452
There. All better.

119
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:01,041
As of now,
you have no signs of cancer.

120
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,502
Who rules? Will rules.

121
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,046
This isn't great news.

122
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,966
Are you sure?
That's how it first hit me.

123
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,134
You're on a slippery slope.

124
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,054
<i>I had to scare him but
I sensed he'd heard it before.</i>

125
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,432
<i>Part of being a doctor
is your ability to improvise.</i>

126
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,853
Right now, the one thing
l want you to think about...

127
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,774
<i>How would you like to sound like this?</i>

128
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,943

<i>Would you like to play a game?</i>

132

<i>Sometimes,

133
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,503
<i>all you can do is
hope they say something new.</i>

134
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,840
Look, man. You're a great patient.

135
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,467
l like you enough
to hope l never see you again.

136
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,387
But if you keep smoking,
you'll be back here.

137
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,141
l bet my own life on that.

138

142

- Come on. Out with it.
- Don't rush me.

143
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,633
l mean...

144
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,054
You shouldn't be impatient
with the opportunity of a lifetime.

145
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:43,810
l'm gonna sit down because
you're so sexy? My knees are weak.

146
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,271
Really?

147
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,440
Dr Cox?
l know l'm being annoying,

148
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,984
but l'm getting used
to talking to patients.

149
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,946
This is why l became a doctor, right?

150
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,574
l heard, ''l know l'm being
annoying'' and then white noise.

151
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,410
Will, l got him to quit smoking.

152
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,081
For ever? No last one?
The last ones are better than sex.

153
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,250
Trust me, l've had 1 ,000 of them.

154
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,504
Done forever, he swore to me.
l reached him. l reached him.

155
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,179
You're having a big day, there, Susan.

156
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,228
Private party.

157
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,571
<i>Gotta get right back on the horse.</i>

158
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,739
- Dr Cox, about Will.
- Not now!

159
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,659
l've a 1 0-minute break
and my soap is on.

160
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,539
Hey, Skeech, if you go ahead
and change the channels,

161
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,917
l swear l'll suture
your hands together.

162
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,296
- Right. So with Will...
- This woman is just fantastic.

163
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:57,176
The breasts are probably fake
but by God, those tears are real.

164
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,803
<i>Time for a bold move.</i>

165
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,769
How are we gonna fix this Will thing?

166
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,856
Do you know what you've just done?

167
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,400
You just lost all lapdog privileges.

168
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,737
- Excuse me?
- No more walkies, no more treats,

169
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,072
no more following me around.

170
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,742
- l'm not your lapdog.
- You back there.

171
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,162
What do we do with lapdogs
who can't behave in the house?

172
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,331
Make them stay outside?

173
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,083
You have five seconds
to get out of this room,

174
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,587
or l'm gonna start whacking you
on the nose with this.

175
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,298
Don't laugh, this isn't a joke. Get out.

176
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,884
- But l was thinking...
- Go!

177
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,516
What do you want to watch?

178
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,435
<i>- Days of our Lives?
- Attaboy.</i>

179
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,856
Come in.

180
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,945
He smells the food.

181
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,448
Move your butt.

182
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,284
Peace offering?

183
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:09,832
l know l don't always
make the best first impression.

184
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,042
Or second, for that matter.

185
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:17,589
l'd like us to be friends. l thought
l could get to know you a bit better.

186
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,092
See what you're about.

187
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,555
For instance,
when did you meet Morgan Freeman?

188
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,932
That's my mom.

189
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,561
l like her freckles.

190
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,649
Rowdy, no!

191
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,362
l can't figure out why
Dr Cox tore me a new one today.

192
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,115
Enough already! He's a jerk.

193
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,826
- He's a jerk.
- He's a jerk.

194
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,537
- He's a jerk.
- You're a jerk.

195
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,790
He's just Dr Cox.
He's always like that.

196
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,710
Who really knows him?
Who does he hang out with?

197
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,379
<i>- No one.
- That must be lonely.</i>

198
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:01,216
''Take two Turks as needed,
apply to sensitive areas...''

199
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,385
Who wrote this?

200
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,720
Whassup?

201
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,103
Come on, Carla. Give me one good reason
why you won't go out with me.

202
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,398
You're a surgeon,
so you got the God complex,

203
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,775
the ''married to the job'' thing.

204
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,236
You're cute,
but you're very aware of it.

205
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,657
You've no idea what l'm like, so your
feelings for me come from down there.

206
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,869
But most of all,
l'm looking for the real thing.

207
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:33,415
You're nothing but a little boy
who's not used to being told ''No''.

208
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:37,669
So there's a bunch of reasons.
Pick your favourite.

209
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,547
l'd go with the God complex.

210
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,717
But it's hard to choose.
They're all so good.

211
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,094
<i>A hospital is a tricky place.</i>

212
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,181
<i>It's very cliquey
and you have to watch what you say.</i>

213
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,225
<i>It's a lot like high school.</i>

214
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,251
<i>If I didn't have
somewhere else to be,</i>

215
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,753
<i>I would have gone
and sat with her.</i>

216
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,843
<i>But tonight, there's somebody
else I have to take care of.</i>

217
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,893
l know watching Will
kill himself hurts you, too.

218
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,479
lt's harder if you have
no one to talk with.

219
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:41,441
So l figured l'd pick up
a few cold ones, right?

220
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:45,612
And you and l, we'll talk it out,
we'll just break the whole thing down.

221
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,574
Right? What do you say to that?

222
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:56,165
Everyone keeps ignoring me.
l'm like a plague around here.

223
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,458
Don't look at me
when you're talking.

224
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:03,213
Dr Reid. l just wanted to say,
you're out of my doghouse.

225
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:07,050
That was a great catch
on that patient with meningococcus.

226
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,888
That actually wasn't me.
Carla noticed the rash on his legs.

227
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,516
You could have been
back into my good graces

228
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,519
and instead you passed
the credit on to a nurse.

229
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:22,566
How noble. l tell you what,
l'll get the cafeteria staff to write

230
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,277
''Was it worth it?''
on a big cake for you.

231
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,116
''...station''.
This is the nurses' station.

232
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:39,041
- Do you think l've damaged ligaments?
- l don't care.

233
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:43,212
Now, can l count on you
to never drop by here again?

234
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,380
Or shall l just move?

235
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,967
You can't leave a place
with this much warmth.

236
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:53,722
l especially love this shelf filled with
photos of your friends and family.

237
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:58,352
<i>If he comes at you,
just try and roll out the door.</i>

238
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,522
Actually, you have a point.

239
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:06,026
l guess watching the game
by yourself with a Scotch

240
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,780
isn't really the only way
to watch a game.

241
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:17,162
lt's just that... l've always thought
of needing people as a sign of weakness.

242
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,082
- lt's not.
- Well, then...

243
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,544
Would you stay and
watch the game with me?

244
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,963
Maybe have a slice of pizza?

245
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,259
- Of course l will.
- l can braid your hair.

246
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:36,056
l know the couch isn't very deep,
but we could move the back cushion

247
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,225
and spoon.

248
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,146
Hey, you guys, what do you say?
Beer and chips in the back.

249
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,399
Just ignore them.

250
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,776
Tell me the answer to this question.

251
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,405
Do you want to be the big spoon
or the little spoon?

252
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,742
Kelso didn't ask her,
she gave you full credit.

253
00:17:55,826 --> 00:18:00,664
l don't care. Too little too late.
Plus, l know why you're really here.

254
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,459
So l'm gonna plop myself
right here in the VlP section,

255
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,588
so you can give me what you got.

256
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,966
l was gonna tell you
how l busted JD's chops the other day

257
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,302
for wanting to be friends with a girl.

258
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,680
And now l find it so amazing
to see how strong you are,

259
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,849
how well you carry yourself,

260
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:23,353
how l'd give anything to wake up
and watch you read the paper.

261
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,523
But instead l think you should
hop off your broom,

262
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,818
remember what it was like
when you first started here

263
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:35,866
and give Elliot a break. Because she may
be a chore but she is a good person.

264
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,497
And your ass is especially fine today.

265
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,666
Pick me up tomorrow at seven.

266
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,087
She's not the only one
who can do a speech. l can do a speech.

267
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,967
Return that umbrella to me at
the hospital. Not here. ls that clear?

268
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,513
And, Newbie...

269
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,349
- Know what your problem is?
- My bones hurt?

270
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:05,062
You were gonna rescue me from loneliness
with a $3 six-pack of light beer?

271
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,650
lt turns out we can't
save people from themselves.

272
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:13,529
We just treat 'em. Treat that kid
with a respiratory problem

273
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:17,074
and when he comes back with cancer,
go ahead and treat that.

274
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,786
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

275
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,540
Smokers, drinkers, druggies,
fatties, whatever.

276
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:30,254
lf you keep living and dying on whether
or not a person changes, well...

277
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,591
You're not gonna make it as a doctor.

278
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,890
Now come here and give me a hug.
lt's OK, come here.

279
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,727
Get outta here!

280
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,939
Take this piss water with you.
lt's embarrassing.

281
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:53,819
- l'll drink it!
- l'll take the beer. You'll beat it.

282
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,113
- You apologise.
- No, l don't wanna.

283
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,909
OK, come on. Just do it really fast.
Like a Band-Aid.

284
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:05,122
l wrote out the pharmacy renewals
on all your patients.

285
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:09,042
Great. You know what else
would be helpful?

286
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,173
<i>The one thing we never
stop looking for is acceptance.</i>

287
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,592
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome.

288
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,136
<i>Acceptance of our own shortcomings.</i>

289
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,347
- So when's the baby due?
- What baby?

290
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:26,143
<i>Acceptance that some things
are gonna be what they're gonna be.</i>

291
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,855
This is a strange resort.
The wheelchair service is great

292
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,192
but that suite l rented,
there was another person in it.

293
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:37,279
- And the bellhop gave me an enema.
- Yeah, he's new here.

294
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,576
So...

295
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,830
- Anything you wanna say?
- You know it all, man.

296
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,209
<i>Still, I hated Will a little</i>

297
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,086
<i>cos I looked at people
who are important to me</i>

298
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,464
<i>in terms of what
will probably kill them.</i>

299
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,674
<i>Heart disease.</i>

300
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,968
<i>Liver disease.</i>

301
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,346

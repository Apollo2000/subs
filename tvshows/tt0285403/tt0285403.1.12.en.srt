1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,801
Hey!

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,932
What? l didn't say anything.
l didn't do anything.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,102
What imaginary slight have you concocted
in that paranoid brain of yours?

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,691
<i>Crap.</i>

5
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,320
Shouldn't there be
some sort of sign...

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:33,450
Look at that. You should put it back
down before someone slips and falls.

7
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,620
Good, because l make most decisions

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,541
based on your opinion. l'm thinking
of splitting up with the wife.

9
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,168
Maybe you could mull that over.
Get back to me.

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,339
Floor's wet, ma'am.

11
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,802
Little help over here.
Little help.

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,847
Move it or lose it, Q-tip.

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,434
Q-tip. Cos you're skinny
and your head's fuzzy.

14
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,270
Something's going down.

15
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:06,024
Bring it in here, you knuckleheads.
Take a knee if you need to.

16
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,486
l have been on since midnight,
so l stand here

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,947
with my usual contempt for all of you,

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,117
but with the added wrinkle
of having 1 3 cups

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,371
of piss-poor excuse for coffee
passing straight through me.

20
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,875
The not-so-hidden message being,
that if you screw up today,

21
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,544
l'm going to hit you hard and fast.

22
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:30,132
Now, then, l think some of you
may have noticed

23
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,302
that all 27 of the patients
that were here in the lCU

24
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,471
when l started last night
are still alive,

25
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,349
and l intend
for them to still be breathing

26
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,728
when l get the hell outta here
tonight at midnight.

27
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:48,317
l think you understand what kind of
opportunity we have in front of us.

28
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,655
- What opportunity...
- Shut up!

29
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,824
ln baseball, when a pitcher's hot,

30
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,452
no one talks to him,
just stay out of his way.

31
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:03,040
- Why are you talking about baseball?
- Cos you should never jinx a pitcher

32
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,919
when he has a chance
to throw a perfect game. My God, Barbie,

33
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,172
how do you put your bra
and panties on in the morning,

34
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,301
all by yourself?
lt's remarkable.

35
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,346
- See, cos he's the pitcher...
- Yeah, l get it now.

<i>A chance to be part

38
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:41,578
<i>is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
It just never happens.</i>

39
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,249
<i>Which is why I don't mind
Dr Cox paging me</i>

40

<i>for the 1 3th time this last hour.</i>

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,379
<i>ICU is where
the most critical cases get turfed.</i>

42
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>So many patients die here, you
think of death as another co-worker,</i>

43
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:59,304
<i>looking over your shoulder with the same
demands as everyone else you work with.</i>

44
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,974
Dr Dorian...

45
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,227
l know you're busy, but
my daughter's selling cookies.

46
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,688
Put me down for two boxes
of mint thingies.

47
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,815
She's in second place
in her troop.

48
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:14,486
lf that girl who's in first keeps
doing well, we're just gonna take her.

49
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,785
Did you think you were gonna cash it in?

50
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,414
ln your face.
You're fine, thank you.

51
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,166
Barbie.

52
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,459
Whatever you need, l'm your girl.

53
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,462
Get me 30 grams of Kayexalate.

54
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,382
Don't dilly-dally trying
to refill your Prozac.

55
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,260
You're on my time now. Go.

56
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,680
Nervous guy. Go to bed 1 8
and get me his tox screen.

57
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,392
Cross your fingers the news is good.
lf it's not, l'm blaming you.

58
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,605
Newbie, start a drain on
the purulent pericarditis in bed 23.

59
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:53,483
He's a tricky bastard. He's tried
to die five times on me today.

60
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,778
- Keep an eye on him.
- l'm your wingman, Maverick.

61
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,989
<i>l was watching Top Gun.</i>

62
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,992
<i>Did you know that Goose
is the guy from ER?</i>

63
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,204
No, l didn't.
But, but please, keep talking.

64
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,207
<i>You have to keep
an eye on things around here,</i>

65
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,251
<i>cos just when it seems
everything's going great,</i>

66
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,672
<i>that's when the tiniest thing
can throw it all outta whack.</i>

67
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:22,346
What are you doing? When the lunch lady
asked if you wanted fries, you said no.

68
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,225
- Yeah, but l wanted fries.
- So why didn't you order fries?

69
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,353
Cos l can't have French fries. Duh.

70
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,776
Here. Have 'em all.
Have a fry salad.

71
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,153
What the...? Turk?

72
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,239
Baby, come on.

73
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,702
Girlfriend, you know
l cannot have French fries.

74
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,792
Dr Dorian, l need a favour.

75
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,754
- l'm crazy busy today.
- That's just fine, kiddo.

76
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,090
l won't make the board meeting today.

77
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:02,135
l'm going to be tied up
at Dr Dorian's pity party.

78
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,888
Should l bring something?
l could rent a clown.

79
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,557
A drunk clown hurt me once.

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,768
Just listen to the damn lawyer.
Go, Tom.

81
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,729
lt's Ted.
But hey, it's only been 1 2 years.

82
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,982
One of the social workers

83
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:19,278
that covers this hospital slipped
and knocked herself unconscious.

84
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,947
She might turn around and sue us.

85
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,159
lf that happens, some of the
higher-ups' heads could roll.

86
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:32,124
The point is that people
are less likely to sue an institution

87
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,919
if we can put a friendly face on it.
You've got a friendly face.

88
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,254
But, sir, l...

89
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,923
Sacred Heart is calling for your help.

90
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,510
Will you accept the call?

91
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,810
This is a special phone. lf you don't
answer it, you get to be the intern

92
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,855
who does the physicals
over at the state prison!

93
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,190
Hello?

94
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,818
- How are you? l'm Dr Dorian.
- Alex Hanson.

95
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,486
Nice to meet you.

96
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,489
Firm handshake. l like that.

97
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,201
<i>Hello.</i>

98
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,122
Mr Davis, l haven't seen you in three
months. lt's gotta be a record for you.

99
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,501
lgnore the dislocated shoulder
and make small talk.

100
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,419
This ought to help with the pain.

101
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,380
So... what'd you do?

102
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:24,968
Some woman just pushed me
off the bus. lt was totally unprovoked.

103
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,887
Mr Davis.

104
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,890
l may have told her
that she smelled like wet ass.

105
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,059
There you go.
Be proud of who you are.

106
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,562
- You wear too much mascara.
- You be careful now.

107
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,440
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

108
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,150
Covering for...

109
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:44,696
Whatever. 36-year-old male,
possible dislocated shoulder.

110
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,532
Great.

111
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,700
So, how are you doing?

112
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,869
lt just got so cold in here.

113
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,623
l think the swelling may have gone down.

114
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,875
Yeah, l hope that hurts.

115
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,671
- Oh, no.
- ls this the tox screen?

116
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,090
This does not bode well for you.

117
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,803
Get the results of Mr Chervin's
urinalysis. lf the numbers aren't good,

118
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,389
l'm gonna give
one of your kidneys to him.

119
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,559
Ten bucks says
l can make him wet himself.

120
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,396
- Everybody's afraid of Mr Man.
- Laverne, you give good sass.

121
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,023
l got the Kayexalate
and pulled the X-rays,

122
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,818
so l am yours.
Do whatever you want with me.

123
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,404
That came out wrong.

124
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,074
l want you to use me.
l don't care how degrading it is.

125
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:29,825
No, no...

126
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:34,037
l know that you like torturing people,
and l am up for that.

127
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,874
- l wanna make you happy.
- Marshmallow, hush.

128
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,878
This guy needs a lumbar puncture,
and l need an extra set of hands.

129
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,714
- Ready and raring.
- Ginger, get the lead out.

130
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,632
Excuse me.

131
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:49,344
- lt puts the lotion on the skin.
- You can do movies and l can't?

132
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,347
lt puts the damn iodine lotion
on the skin.

133
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,266
Mr Man!

134
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,358
Dr Dorian, l owe you an apology.

135
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,485
Obviously,
l was unclear when l said,

136
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,988
''Stay in the MRl room
with that patient.''

137
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,283
lt must have sounded like,
''Leave and do other things.''

138
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,995
Let me rephrase it
so there'll be no more confusion:

139
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,164
Get your ass back down there!

140
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,711
You have no idea
how loud that is in here!

141
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,672
l'm sorry. You'll be done in a second.

142
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,426
Was that a good sound?

143
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,596
- Not that good a sound.
- ls it stuck?

144
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,974
''Stuck'' is a literal term.
lt's more like ''not moving''.

145
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,686
- Pull me outta here!
- l can't. You were unconscious.

146
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,273
You could have an injury.
Be glad you're not claustrophobic.

147
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,694
- Promise you won't leave me.
- l promise.

148
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,950
Dr Cox must have my pager on speed dial.
He's completely on top of me today.

149
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,869
Do you know how much l wish
he was on top of me?

150
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,038
That's naughty.

151
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,624
You make me so mad,
l might actually scream.

152
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,627
Every day you bitch
about how hard Dr Cox is on you,

153
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,381
and you don't even realise
that you're his go-to guy.

154
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,051
- You're overreacting...
- What has he had you do today?

155
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,929
He had me intubate
and extubate Mrs Pollard,

156
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:18,058
float a Swan on Mr Kalka,
a paracentesis, a radial art line,

157
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,562
then place a transvenous
pacemaker for a heart block.

158
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,731
Why? What did you do?

159
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,237
Cream, no sugar.

160
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,241
He takes his sugar, no cream.

161
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,415
My arm is breaking!

162
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,042
OK. lt's not going in.

163
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,420
Really? Why don't we try kicking it?

164
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,923
- l'll talk to one of our orthopaedics.
- Hurry back.

165
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,092
That guy is the worst.

166
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,928
Be nice. He's my boyfriend.

167
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,515
- Not for long.
- Excuse me?

168
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,435
He's been dying to run
outta here since he came in.

169
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,855
- He did not run out of here.
- You're right.

170
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,609
He was fleeing like he was being chased
by a swarm of killer bees.

171
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,862
He said just keep pulling.

172
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,906
Goody.

173
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,451
Does this big metal contraption
make me look fat?

174
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,161
More chunky than fat.

175
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,790
- JD?
- lt's all right. l'm right here.

176
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,629
You're such a nice guy.

177
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,341
<i>It really feels like
there's something going on here.</i>

178
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,760
<i>I wonder what she looks like.</i>

179
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,931
Why am l always in your fantasies?

180
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,517
You got a problem.

181
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,270
Why are you squeezing
all my fingers?

182
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:49,441
l'll tell you what l'm not doing.
l'm not checking for a wedding ring.

183
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,610
<i>I am so in.</i>

184
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,031
<i>I'm right back out.</i>

185
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,825
l'm sorry about lunch.
l'm a little overtired.

186
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,746
That's OK. When we get home,
we can go right to bed.

187
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,706
That's the thing. l'm beat,

188
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,336
so it'd be better
if you crash at your place tonight.

189
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,091
lt's a private joke.

190
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,220
- What now?
- Watch the attitude,

191
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,891
or l won't let you go to the bonfire
with the beach bunnies.

192
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:26,103
<i>I was probably thinking
about the MRI girl,</i>

193
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:31,525
<i>but I believe that giving a friend the
chance to shine was just as important.</i>

194
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,988
Sir, it's Dr Kelso.
He's making me baby-sit this patient.

195
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:41,034
lt's the bottom of the ninth. lf you're
not gonna be my catcher, who is?

196
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,292
<i>- What?
-Play ball!</i>

197
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,088
Come on, baby.
Right here. Bring it in.

198
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,432
Dr Cox, you can trust me to help you.

199
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,143
l was top five in my class.

200
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,105
That's the noise
l make when somebody lies to me.

201
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,024
But l'll get us this perfect...

202
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,400
- Don't say it!
- ...game.

203
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,236
What part of ''don't say it''
did you not understand?

204
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,991
The ''don't'' or the ''say it''?
Help me to help you, Barbie.

205
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,040
l should get to work.

206
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,209
That would be lovely.

207
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,465
- Elliot, do...
- No time!

208
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,009
<i>We all have
important things to do.</i>

209
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,720
Do you know what
Alex Hanson looks like?

210
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,722
He's OK.

211
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,392
l don't know.
l don't look at the ladies.

212
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,771
Young man, l've been married
for over three decades.

213
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,107
l would've gone there, though.
Hell yes, l would've.

214
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,236
Who cares?
No one will ever love you.

215
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,030
l don't find her pretty,
but since my wife left,

216
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,326
when l look at a woman,
l find it hard to see past the evil.

217
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,705
- Something's wrong.
- Nothing's wrong.

218
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,625
You always say that,
then you sulk, then you tell me.

219
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,379
You haven't known me long enough
for me to ''always'' do anything.

220
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,922
You're always hurting me.

221
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,884
- So now you're getting defensive?
- Woman, l am not defensive.

222
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,719
You are, a little bit.

223
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:28,016
Turk, why don't you just take a deep
breath and tell me what's wrong?

224
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,686
That did it.

225
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,938
l guess we're done here.

226
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,653
Barbie, plates
are wobbling everywhere.

227
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,197
l'm starting pressors.

228
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,408
Or you could transfuse him.

229
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,494
- Transfusions are riskier.
- My instinct was pressors.

230
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,039
- Know what they say about instincts?
- Stick with them.

231
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,457
- Should you?
- Should l?

232
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:57,254
You'll have time to think about it on
the bench. That's where you're headed.

233
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,675
Get out of here. Go ahead.
Go. Hippety-hop to the barbershop.

234
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,553
''Should l?''

235
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,723
Did she ask what you look like?

236
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:12,269
No, she can tell l'm handsome.
l have a husky voice. ''Hello, baby.''

237
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,813
Look into your heart
and see how it feels.

238
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,773
My heart hates ''uggos''.

239
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,276
That's what's wrong with you men.

240
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,614
You're so afraid of what you feel.
l'm so sick of it.

241
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,200
So do you know
what she looks like?

242
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,493
Yeah, l do.
But l ain't telling you.

243
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:33,457
Just tell me. Does she look
anything like Jimmie Walker?

244
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:39,630
l'm noticing the bottoms
of your slippers are rather slick.

245
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,926
Perhaps they contributed in some way
to the incident this morning.

246
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,179
Those are hospital booties,
you moron.

247
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,640
And now l'm a moron.

248
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,977
Dr Dorian, why don't you take Ms Hanson
out for a lovely dinner?

249
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,397
Dr Kelso, l'm not suing the hospital.

250
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,567
lt turns out
l only have a mild concussion.

251
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,653
Alex? He's gone.

252
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:07,366
So, what restaurant
are you taking me to?

253
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,828
<i>You're not bad if you want to wait
and see what she looks like.</i>

254
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,789
l'm kidding. You don't have
to take me out to dinner.

255
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,292
Are you sure? Cos... OK.

256
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,754
l gotta go. Sorry.

257
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:24,258
Don't sweat it.
We'll see each other around.

258
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,635
JD, l'm really glad you were here...

259
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,638
Ms Hanson, he's gone.

260
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:34,184
lf l were in your slippers, l'd sue
this hospital for all it's worth.

261
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,435
Really?

262
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,063
We could run away together.

263
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:45,487
You know what to do. Be straight
with Carla, no matter how hard it is.

264
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,739
l hate this part.

265
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,744
l just don't know
what to do about Dr Cox.

266
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:56,748
- What is going on here?
- l say one thing, he says the other.

267
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,709
l can't take it any more.

268
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,379
Why don't you become a lesbian,
and hook up with some hot model?

269
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,550
- What's that got to do with anything?
- l just thought it'd be hot.

270
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:12,389
He's testing you. You can't be afraid
to disagree with him.

271
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,893
- You're afraid.
- But l still do it.

272
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,688
Get back in the game, Elliot.

273
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,840
Dammit!

274
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,511
So close. Dammit!

275
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,308
l'm sorry.

276
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,435
l'll be fine.

277
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,524
Perfect game.

278
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,693
Call it.

279
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,906
There's five minutes left, just
the two of us here. Can't we just wait?

280
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,991
Just call it.

281
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,704
No.

282
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,998
We all need this, so, no.

283
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,209
l won't call it.

284
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:50,672
That's the dumbest thing anybody's
said to me around here in a long time.

285
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:55,552
There's nothing wrong with a one-hitter.
ln fact, it's miraculous.

286
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:59,973
l won't have you cheapen what should
be an endless pursuit of perfection

287
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,519
just because you want the world
to laugh with you tonight.

288
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,020
Now, call it.

289
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,023
Time of death, 1 1 .55.

290
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,859
Good girl.

291
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,654
Better go get
yourself a cup of coffee.

292
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,198
New game starts in four minutes.

293
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,624
Hey, Carla.

294
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,252
Carla, wait!

295
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,753
Where are you going?

296
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,965
l'm gonna go crash at my place
tonight, like you said.

297
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,467
You want to know?
That's what's wrong.

298
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,387
''l'm gonna go chill out
at my house, like you said.''

299
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,514
God, you're so sexy right now.

300
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,184
l've been doing a lot of thinking.
And, you know...

301
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:47,312
We're past that new,
exciting relationship phase,

302
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,314
and all that's left is us.

303
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,942
Baby, l gotta tell you,
you drive me crazy.

304
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,280
You take my French fries, you boss
me around in front of my friends.

305
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,824
You said strong women turn you on.

306
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:04,413
We know what you're gonna do,
so why not do it so l can go home?

307
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,539
OK.

308
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,005
l love you.

309
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,467
You annoy me more than
l ever thought possible,

310
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,846
but l want to spend every
irritating minute with you.

311
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,267
Me too.

312
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,019
Yeah?

313
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,439
l love you.

314
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,153
l don't get it.
Why are you doing this to me?

315
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,449
All l wanted to do was have sex
with a foxy nurse, and now l'm in love?

316
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,535
Sweetie, that happens.

317
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,334
<i>I've been thinking lately
about taking chances...</i>

318
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,670
Run a tox screen and
a full blood workup for the guy in 37.

319
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,339
You can handle that?

320
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,882
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

321
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:01,386
Up on the second floor... There's a
laundry list of stuff l want you to do.

322
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,389
<i>...and how it's just
about overcoming your fears.</i>

323
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,518
<i>Because every time
you take a big risk in your life,</i>

324
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,230
<i>no matter how it ends up,
you're always glad you took it.</i>

325
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,651
Wait! Stop the machine.

326
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,488
- What the hell are you doing?
- Will you go out with me?

327
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,115
lf l say no, will you
let me out of this thing?

328
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,701
- lt's iffy.
- Then l guess l have to say yes.

329
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:28,372
- So say it.
- Sure. l'd love to.

330
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,213
Huh?

331
00:21:37,305 --> 00:22:37,619

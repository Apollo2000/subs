1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,922
<i>I don't know why
I came to watch Turk</i>

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,216
<i>when I could've been asleep.</i>

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,843
<i>I guess I haven't seen
much of him lately.</i>

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>It's not like I'm desperate.</i>

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,978
What makes you think you know better?

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,815
- ln my gut l know l'm right.
- We need this decision now.

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,945
- Fine, then it's on you.
- Yes, it is.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,696
Nurse.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,990
- Erasure.
- Yes, doctor.

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,845
l hate this song.

12
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,722
Me too, man.

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,120
<i>A hospital room can be
kind of a romantic place.</i>

14
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,914
<i>Maybe it's the soft green glow
of a heart monitor,</i>

15
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>or the way the moonlight
reflects off a bedpan.</i>

16
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,004
Our shifts keep overlapping
on Friday nights.

17
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,673
Closest thing
l've had to a date recently.

18
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,134
Well, l had
a great time tonight.

19
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,386
Oh, yeah. Me too.

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,016
- So, can l page you?
- Don't do the two-day waiting thing.

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,143
Oh, baby,
l don't play by the rules.

22
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,604
So, goodnight.

23
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,191
<i>Wait. Is she joking?
If she's joking and I kiss her...</i>

24
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,990
<i>Of course,
if she's not joking...</i>

25
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,548
l don't do this
for all the doctors.

26
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,675
<i>Yes!</i>

27
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,263
He's gonna need 40mEqs of KCL.

28
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,599
Grab me when you get the results.

29
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,434
You got it.

30
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:26,772
His TV is broken, so when you
two start tagging each other,

31
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,942
the least you can do is
wake him up and let him watch.

32
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,196
<i>In my experience, when two friends
miss a chance like this,</i>

33
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,949
<i>you've got exactly 48 hours
to get the kiss.</i>

34
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,827
<i>Or one of you will over-think it.
OK, she's gonna over-think it.</i>

35
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,581
<i>Then you end up permanently
stuck in the Friend Zone.</i>

36
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,084
l'll see ya.

37
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,420
You're such a girl.

38
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,759
Nothing went on between me and Elliot.

39
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,178
Good thing you still
have your flower.

40
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,973
That song is like a virus.

41
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,850
l'm just a little lonely.

42
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,770
l haven't been hanging out with Turk
since he's been dating Carla.

43
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,814
First of all, who's Turk?

44
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,276
And don't answer.
Look, if you have a medical question,

45
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,153
l'm forced by hospital policy
to answer you.

46
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,365
However, if you ask me
about a personal problem,

47
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,159
l'm going to start doing this.

48
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,166
You seem unhappy.

49
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,251
l like that.

50
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,932
l cannot get that stupid song
out of my head.

51
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,686
lt's like a damn virus.
Here's his chart, his transfer note.

52
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,523
He's haemodynamically stable.
Consider him turfed to medicine.

53
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,567
T-Man. l'm gonna get my grub on.

54
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,864
Means he's gonna go eat.

55
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,867
- Surgery went OK?
- lt was cool.

56
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:08,332
Dude, l got to close
for the first time ever. Ever.

57
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,751
The human body is so disgusting.

58
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,004
Not yours. Yours is stunning.

59
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,217
We should celebrate. Tear it up
like we used to, just the two of us.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,638
- What comes before Part B?
- Part A!

61
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,390
That's right, we used to tear it up.

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,771
We should probably
never do that again.

63
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:36,860
<i>That song is like a virus.</i>

64
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,955
No!

65
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,456
<i>Don't let it be awkward.</i>

66
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,916
<i>Do something cute.</i>

67
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,085
<i>Cover her eyes
and say, ''Guess who?''</i>

68
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,131
- Guess who?
- l can't breathe.

69
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,760
OK, gang, it's time for rounds.

70
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,556
<i>Let's see who's
The Weakest Link.</i>

71
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,603
The Weakest Link!

72
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,318
Now, then, Dr Simotas.

73
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:22,865
Severe swelling of the lips in this
patient might be an indication of what?

74
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,868
- Angio-oedema.
- Well done, sport.

75
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,621
And what treatment would you
recommend, Dr Dorian?

76
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:33,083
A combination of steroids
and antihistamines.

77
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,752
Attaboy, sport.

78
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,964
What would you recommend
the patient stay away from,

79
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,592
Dr Reid?

80
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:46,346
- My first guess would be shellfish.
- Right you are, sweetheart.

81
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,472
Sweetheart?

82
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,517
<i>I could see what was going on
in Elliot's head.</i>

83
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,313
Right you are, sweetheart.

84
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,407
<i>- What do you want to watch?
- Fletch.</i>

85
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,492
<i>- Fletch it is.
- Seen it.</i>

86
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,704
You haven't seen it with us
saying all the lines.

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,540
l'm so lucky l met you.

88
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,792
Maybe next time
her mom could come.

89
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,337
You won't even know she's here.

90
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,049
Except she laughs at stupid stuff
and that makes me laugh.

91
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:26,470
lt's stupid because it's so stupid.

92
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,182
- Tonight's still about us.
- Whatever, l don't care.

93
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,976
Turk, you wanna go hang out
in your room?

94
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,567
l know Dr Kelso
doesn't mean anything by it,

95
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,028
and OK, maybe l am
kind of a sweetheart.

96
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,281
- l'm sleeping.
- But it just sounds so demeaning.

97
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,201
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying.

98
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,162
lt's not like
he's my grandpa or anything.

99
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,457
Anyway, JD always tells me
how much you've helped him.

100
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,044
He obviously hasn't told you
about my ear-flicking policy.

101
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,506
This whole groovy
guidance counsellor thing

102
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,051
you people seem to have working
is a total fantasy.

103
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,720
l'm not that guy.
You can go and ask anybody.

104
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,432
Now, you've got to leave me
alone or l'll punish you.

105
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,479
Sweetheart is kind of innocuous.

106
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:21,316
Here's what you're gonna do.
Go down there and confront Kelso.

107
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,943
- Really?
- Absolutely.

108
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,488
Never mind
that he is the Chief of Medicine,

109
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,408
he'll have a whole new level
of respect for you.

110
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,034
- Honestly?
- Yes.

111
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:35,539
You can't have sexist terms
like that around here. You go get 'im.

112
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,214
This guy looks stable
but l still wanna get an EKG.

113
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,091
Let's do cardiac enzymes...

114
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,093
When you say sweetheart...

115
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,345
...and an aspirin.

116
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,931
<i>A lot of my work
has become second nature.</i>

117
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,601
<i>But it gives me too much time to think.</i>

118
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,520
Look, l'm surgery and you're medicine.

119
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:02,357
This isn't college any more.
Things have to change.

120
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:07,446
l know relationships change, l guess
l thought yours and mine never would.

121
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,450
- What's going on with you, man?
- We used to look out for each other.

122
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,702
l don't feel you have my back any more.

123
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,206
- You really feel that way?
- Yeah, l do.

124
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,583
You do? Great.

125
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,212
l'll get them from my locker,
you can write me a cheque.

126
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,466
Can you look at Mr Bidwell?
His temperature's starting to spike.

127
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,093
Sure.

128
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,262
Legally, there's a huge difference.

129
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,849
Stitch a patient, sew a sheet to him,
that's an accident.

130
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,603
He tries getting up, gurney collapses,
breaks his front teeth,

131
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,938
that's a lawsuit.

132
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,857
Say it with me.
Accident. Lawsuit.

133
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,567
Accident. Lawsuit.

134
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,487
So, what is it, sweetheart?

135
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,532
lt's the sweetheart thing.
lt doesn't hit me right.

136
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,701
l'm a doctor,
it seems sort of disrespectful.

137
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,455
l've always called men ''sport''
and ladies ''sweetheart''.

138
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,958
But you call Becky ''sport''.

139
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:09,216
Well, l am so sorry, sport.

140
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,052
lt's one of those bad habits
l've developed

141
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,639
after working in the medical field
for over 30 years.

142
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:20,185
30 years? But you look so young!

143
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,941
<i>It's hard to see a patient
get worse instead of better.</i>

144
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,152
<i>That's kind of the opposite
of what we're going for.</i>

145
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,363
He was fine last night.

146
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,409
Now he's diaphoretic, in and out
of consciousness, maybe septic.

147
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,953
We won't know till
his blood work's back.

148
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,039
<i>If he's septic, they might
have to re-open this guy.</i>

149
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,917
<i>Course, there's also
a chance he could die.</i>

150
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,753
l've seen this before.
Gauze, sponges,

151
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,673
some young surgeon
left something in this man.

152
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:54,386
No, l know the guy that closed.
He'd never be that careless.

153
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,513
Excuse me, sorry.

154
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,515
Has anyone seen my keys?

155
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,685
No? How about my wallet?

156
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,854
Anyone?

157
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,941
l've never seen that before.

158
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,878
Turk!

159
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,589
Dr Cox, have you seen Turk?

160
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,061
Turk.

161
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,233
l was just dreaming about you.

162
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,694
You were... Well, we were...

163
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,906
You got a few minutes?

164
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,076
Don't move.

165
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,453
No. Don't move.

166
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,501
- Have you seen Turk?
- Yeah, l saw him.

167
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,878
He just went out that door.

168
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,177
Turk?

169
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,861
Can't hear you.

170
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,323
- What?
- Let me in!

171
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,409
You love who?

172
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,329
Mr Kavanaugh,
your arrhythmia's much better.

173
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,082
Everything looks just great, actually.

174
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,210
You sound surprised.

175
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,212
lt has nothing to do with you.

176
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,507
l had a run-in with Dr Kelso,
so when he switched me to you,

177
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,218
l thought it would be a difficult case.

178
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,805
Go on, l'm listening.

179
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,601
Excuse me while l check
on another penis... patient.

180
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,812
Well, he's a penis patient.

181
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,941
Turk!

182
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,610
No, l gotta talk to you.

183
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,903
No!

184
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,781
lt's nine up, OK? We just
lost our fourth, it's your ball.

185
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,366
lt's important.

186
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,829
This is not a joke either. This is real.
lt's surgical versus medical.

187
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,457
- Your ball, you're shirts.
- Let's play.

188
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,877
<i>There it was. Everything was
more important than me now.</i>

189
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,630
Don't bring in the same crap
the last kid did.

190
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,298
<i>Suddenly, I was so fed up</i>

191
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,885
<i>I decided to teach Turk
and Todd a lesson on the court.</i>

192
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,724
<i>You know, once I warm up a little.</i>

193
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,446
JD, l'm gonna show you...

194
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,282
what the deal...
Oh, oh...

195
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,869
- Throw the body out of him!
- Oh!

196
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,837
All right, that's game.
What's so important?

197
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,839
l was looking at Bidwell...

198
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,049
One second.

199
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:24,179
l gotta go.
But you played a good game.

200
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,390
l thought you sucked.

201
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,977
Go get your grub on.

202
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,899
- Hey, baby.
- You gotta be kidding.

203
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,489
Yes?

204
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:48,245
- Sorry to bother you, sir.
- Well, if it isn't ''sport''.

205
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,708
How are things?
Did you see Mr Kavanaugh today?

206
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,459
Yes.

207
00:13:55,878 --> 00:14:00,382
Yes, l did. Dr Kelso,
l just wanted to say, well,

208
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,261
as far as the sweetheart thing goes,
maybe l overreacted.

209
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:09,141
Are you sure? l wouldn't want you
to be the least bit uncomfortable.

210
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:14,479
l have no idea what possessed me
to say anything in the first place.

211
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,900
You've got to leave me alone
or l'll punish you.

212
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:21,862
- Absolutely no idea.
- Super.

213
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,823
Then run along, sweetheart.

214
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,304
Have you seen
Mr Bidwell's blood work?

215
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,306
No, it hasn't come back yet.

216
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,310
- OK, have you seen Turk?
- Not since this morning.

217
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,021
l'm sure you'll see him
before l do, so...

218
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,233
Bambi, are you giving me attitude?

219
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,153
What if l am?

220
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:07,991
You have to be a minority sidekick
in a bad movie to pull that off.

221
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,578
- You know what l mean, right?
- Child, you speak the truth!

222
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,831
Explain it to him.

223
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,668
You do the hand, then the finger,
then talk through the nose.

224
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,297
Then give a lot of attitude. lf you're
not from there, you don't understand...

225
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,758
- OK, l'm gonna leave now.
- What?

226
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,136
Oh, no, you didn't! Where you going?
Where you going?

227
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,659
Thank you very much.

228
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,120
- What?
- Hi, how are you?

229
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,081
l have a quick legal question.
l'm just curious.

230
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:59,835
- What if, hypothetically...
- Oh, God! You killed somebody.

231
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,336
- No!
- Someone else did.

232
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,549
- No, no one killed anyone.
- Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.

233
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,718
l'm not sure there is a problem.

234
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,387
l'm running tests,
doing everything l should.

235
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,224
lf you know something, by not
reporting it you're as culpable.

236
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,393
Anything you wanna tell me?

237
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,147
<i>Why am I protecting Turk
when he can't give me five seconds?</i>

238
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,025
<i>- Anything at all?
- Tell him.</i>

239
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,735
No.

240
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,990
Scared the hell out of me.

241
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,503
Dr Cox...

242
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,964
l'm hoping there's another
Dr Cox sat behind me.

243
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:50,761
Sending me to Kelso like that, l'm not
sure what you were trying to teach me.

244
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:54,890
The value, and this is important,
of leaving me alone.

245
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,519
- There's more to it than that.
- No, there's not.

246
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:02,314
Look, l want you to go ahead
and spread the word.

247
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,192
l've had enough.

248
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:09,238
The next whiny intern that comes
to me for a cookie and a hug,

249
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,949
l swear to Aisha,
l'm going to hurt them.

250
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,326
And you, you one-woman freak show,

251
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,788
take your blah-blah
to the blah-blah-ologist.

252
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,834
lf you're so stupid as to
confront the Chief of Medicine,

253
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,336
over some
quasi-offensive endearment,

254
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,840
then you've got to replace
the captain of your brain ship

255
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,675
because he's drunk.

256
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,762
You're right. l need to learn to
pick my battles. Thank you, sir.

257
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,558
You're welcome.

258
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,478
And you say your husband
hardly wore them?

259
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,897
Fantastic.

260
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,400
The blood work came back.

261
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,321
Negative?

262
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,949
But the guy looks like death.

263
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,201
Hi!

264
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,370
What happened?

265
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,876
There's no infection. He's diabetic.
So when someone gave him insulin,

266
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:07,129
when he wasn't eating,
he became hypoglycaemic.

267
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:10,507
The only person
that could've given him insulin...

268
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,010
Me!

269
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,555
<i>l gave him insulin.
Twice.</i>

270
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:21,226
He's fine, Bambi. l gave him
an amp of D50 and he's eating now.

271
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,897
You should probably give him
some orange juice in an hour.

272
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,318
- Thank you so much. You saved my ass.
- No, it wasn't me.

273
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,034
- Look, Turk.
- Come on, man. l always got your back.

274
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,994
l know.

275
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,080
<i>Tell him how you feel
without sounding like a girl.</i>

276
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,292
l miss you so much
it hurts sometimes.

277
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,383
OK...

278
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:57,387
- l'm gonna let that go for now.
- Thank you.

279
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:01,058
We'll find time to hang, man.
We're both swamped right now

280
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,727
and l'm hanging out
with Carla a lot.

281
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,397
But if there was someone you were into
you'd be doing the same.

282
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,274
<i>Crap!</i>

283
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,030
Did Nurse Roberts
sell you these?

284
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:58,991
- You don't wanna hear about my day.
- You're right. Kiss me.

285
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,910
- Right now?
- We can wait three, four seconds.

286
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:07,624
- But l just ate, l feel gross.
- Not gross, pretty. Come here.

287
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,883
JD, can we just talk for a second?

288
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,801
<i>It never fails.</i>

289
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,732
Oh, yeah, another one.

290
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,442
How're you doing?

291
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,028
Went to high school with her.

292
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,197
We worked at Penguins Yoghurt.

293
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,367
- l met her on a bus.
- She'll come around.

294
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,786
Pretzel?

295
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,246
Thank you.

296
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,043
The first few weeks have been so hard,
mentally, physically, emotionally.

297
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,420
lt's like math camp all over again.

298
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:56,340
Not that l've been to math camp,
it's an expression.

299
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,467
l use it all the time.

300
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,552
- Come on.
- Anyway...

301
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:05,516
<i>Choosing friendship over sex is
the last thing any guy wants to hear,</i>

302
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,684
<i>but you know what?</i>

303
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,604
<i>This time, it actually
made sense to me.</i>

304
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,191
<i>Besides, I challenge anyone
to survive being an intern</i>

305
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,653
<i>without having a close
group of friends to lean on.</i>

306
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,825
l can't believe
you lost our bottle opener.

307
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,993
Yeah, l know.

308
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:32,501
l miss it so much
it hurts sometimes.

1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,841
What are you doing?

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,052
Wondering how to tell my roommate

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,222
he drives me crazy,
without hurting his feelings.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,682
Sarcasm works better
when it's shorter.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,685
- Fascinating.
- See, there you go.

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,188
So what're you doing?

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,525
- You're annoying me.
- l'm OK with it.

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:28,654
l've had such a crappy morning l decided
to come out here and eat my lunch.

9
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,574
This spot feels secluded.
lt's so peaceful.

10
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,535
l'm getting my spirit back.

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:39,540
- lt's just a bench.
- Sit down, sweet thang.

12

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,135
Nice. You know, l've already eaten,
but l could...

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,763
- What's it gonna take?
- Your cupcake.

15
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,394
This is how l get my spirit back.

16
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,609
l feel alive again.

17
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,537
<i>It's time to change this pattern.</i>

18
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,164
- Morning.
- How do you figure?

19
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,209
Doing a little drilling?

20
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,422
l have an idea. Let's go the whole day
without getting in each other's hair.

21
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,676
Just give each other a break?
What do you say?

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,179
l'm gonna give you a nickname.

23
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,766
That's good.
l already have a nickname. lt's JD.

24
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,937
How about... Whinyface?

25
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,815
Whinybritches?

26
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,736
Whinysomething.
l definitely like whiny.

27
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,321
Whinydancer.

28
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,467
l can't believe
l went out last night.

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,636
You said you were exhausted.

30
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,764
l was.
But l figured l owed it to the ladies.

31
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,183
Do you ever stop giving?

32
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,895
<i>It's hard for doctors and nurses
to be long-term friends.</i>

33
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,857
His O2-sat's dropping.
He just needs respiratory treatment.

34
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>When you start out,
the nurses know more than you.</i>

35
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:36,907
<i>After a few months, the training kicks
in and you both feel the dynamic shift.</i>

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,828
l think because of the congestive
heart failure, he just needs Lasix.

37
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:48,377
<i>The future of the relationship depends
on how she handles that very moment.</i>

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,004
l'm so proud of you, Bambi.

39
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,633
They grow up so fast.

40
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,484
- Dr Cox.
- And there you are.

41
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:16,280
- Excuse me?
- l was wondering if there's anything

42
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,658
that could push my headache
into a full-blown migraine.

43
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,160
And there you are.

44
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,498
- What's the story on the admit in 64?
- She's great. l really like her.

45
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:30,919
Let's see if you can't focus on things
l give a rat's ass about.

46
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,045
What?

47
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,007
She blacked out at work.
Accelerated heartbeat.

48
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,383
lnteresting.

49
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,553
l don't care if it wasn't
good first-date conversation,

50
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:44,892
Michael deserved to know what
l think about circumcising babies.

51
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,560
What? Actually, no.

52
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,938
No, it wasn't, which is
surprising cos he's Jewish.

53
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,609
- l gave her two Valium.
- l'm e-mailing you as we're talking.

54
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,903
How cool is that?

55
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,488
So she's actually sedated as we speak?

56
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,656
OK, bye.

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,992
Elliot. OK, first impressions.

58
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,203
- Did l scare Michael off?
- No.

59
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,289
Not if he enjoys a big fat cup of crazy.

60
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,460
Ms Tracy, we're all busy,
so if we could...

61
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,087
l have the same e-maily-pagey thingy.

62
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,756
Get out!

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,930
- My H sticks a little bit. Does yours?
- lt does!

64
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,643
lt may just be a bench,
but you know what?

65
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:32,064
lt's quiet. And l can chill.
lt's like my special place.

66
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,150
You are so damn cute,
l can't even stand it.

67
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,485
Serious?

68
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,404
l love it that my man's
all deep and whatnot.

69
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,698
- You know, l get deep.
- l know.

70
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,452
- What's happening, Rerun?
- What up, Roge?

71
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,915
How about some of this?

72
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,543
lt wasn't even that good a show.

73
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,087
- Take it back.
- This second.

74
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,299
Look at the time.
Gotta go, it's lunchtime.

75
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,843
See ya, baby!

76
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,805
- We still on for the Bresson exhibit?
- Yes, we are.

77
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,976
- Did you just ask out my girlfriend?
- You wanna come?

78
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,229
Black-and-white photography,
no boobies.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,773
Hell, no.

80
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,907
- Hello, sir.
- Nice spot.

81
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,326
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,664
l usually try to get out here
for lunch every day at 1 2.30.

83
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,749
You don't say?

84
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,378
Every day, 1 2.30, for 23 years.

85
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,050
From now on, your name is Scooter.

86
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:46,013
- l don't get it.
- Short for scooter pie.

87
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,182
l hate scooter pies.

88
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,477
Now l see.

89
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,937
<i>You big jerk.</i>

90
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,441
Thanks again for the invite, Bambi.
l love photography.

91
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,445
Photography's for studs.

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,659
<i>After working at a hospital for a while,
you develop a sixth sense for danger.</i>

93
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:11,580
<i>Maybe there's a mass cas alert,
maybe there's a code...</i>

94
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,167
<i>Maybe someone spent the morning</i>

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,712
<i>with an annoying patient
and needs to vent.</i>

96
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,714
<i>Luckily, I was prepared.</i>

97
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,176
- You do your pre-rounds?
- Yes.

98
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,929
Discharge summaries?
Pharmacy renewals?

99
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,640
SOAP notes?
Central line changes?

100
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,766
Yes.

101
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,520
OK, but did you
go ahead and fix your beeper

102
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:40,484
so it doesn't play that annoying
song every time you get paged?

103
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,653
Yes.

104
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,154
<i>Crap.</i>

105
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,451
l expect you to act like

106
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,621
a professional around here!

107
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,207
ls that all you got?

108
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,584
Good one.

109
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,382
lnteresting titbit.

110
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,593
Back during the gold rush
when a man staked a claim,

111
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,471
if he came upon another man
panning his spot,

112
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:12,349
he could shoot that fella dead

113
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,394
without even asking any questions.

114
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,230
You don't say.

115
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,399
Simpler times.

116
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,406
What if you've had three great dates
and he likes you so much

117
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,659
he hasn't even tried to have sex
with you yet?

118
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,912
l could sabotage that relationship
in two phone calls.

119
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:37,499
- l could do it in one.
- Sabotage that relationship.

120
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,419
l would ask him
why he finds me so repulsive.

121
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,088
Then, coerce him
into having phone sex with me,

122
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,300
then l would ask him
if he thinks we have a future,

123
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,595
and then l'd probably just cry
until he hung up on me.

124
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,806
- We are so alike.
- l know!

125
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,976
''Oh, stop.'' ''No, you stop.''

126
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,603
Oh, dear God.

127
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,650
- Ms Tracy, we'll go ahead...
- Can you give me one sec?

128
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:08,113
l'm arranging to have food delivered.
Fatty had a party and nobody came.

129
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,324
Preaching to the choir.

130
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,912
Think of what little patience l have

131
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,332
as your virginity.

132
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,627
You always thought it would
be there until that night

133
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,213
when you were feeling down,

134
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,216
and your pal, Kevin,
who just wanted to be friends,

135
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,886
he dropped by and he brought
a copy of 'About Last Night'

136
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,849
and a four-pack of Bartles & Jaymes.
And...

137
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,978
lt was gone for ever.
Just like my patience is now.

138
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,607
So you do scary little speeches?

139
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,486
- How adorable!
- This is so much fun.

140
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,615
Careful, Rapunzel.
Fun time is officially over.

141
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,202
You think you can just treat Bambi
like that and walk away?

142
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,704
Get him, girlfriend.

143
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,165
What up, T-Dog?

144
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,835
<i>The only way to avoid
the high five with Todd</i>

145
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,963
<i>is not to say anything
that he can connect to sex.</i>

146
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,507
How you doing?

147
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,011
That's totally how my car was rocking
when l took this girl out last night.

148
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,726
Am l right?

149
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,520
<i>He earned it.</i>

150
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,606
Pain.

151
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,193
- So Cox tore into you?
- You know what pisses me off?

152
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,279
No one ever calls him on anything.

153
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,031
You want to kick and scream,

154
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:37,244
that's fine, but if you ever yell
at my friend again over nothing,

155
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,372
then l will wipe
that scary smile off your face,

156
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,041
and keep it in my purse
until no one around here

157
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,002
is any more scared of you than l am.

158
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,798
lt's not fair.
Why are you eating in here?

159
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:54,011
- T-man's afraid of Kelso.
- l'm not afraid of Kelso.

160
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,305
l just felt like eating in here.

161
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:00,058
Go outside and stand up for yourself.

162
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,269
Hell, yeah.

163
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,108
You know what else
stands up for itself?

164
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:12,279
l'm not sure.
But l'll guess that it's your penis.

165
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,906
lt is.

166
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,490
<i>Oh, no.</i>

167
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,870
Everyone, we can all relax now.
The planets have been realigned

168
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,623
and order shall be returned.
Hey, you.

169
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,876
Give me two seconds.
Gotta finish e-mailing Jill.

170
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,670
l have
your little friend's test results.

171
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,131
Shall we have some fun
and take a look?

172
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:35,135
lnteresting. EKG, negative.
Tilt table, negative.

173
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,596
Echo, negative.

174
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,227
Nothing, in fact, is wrong with her
but exhaustion, brought on by...

175
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,230
let it come... being her.

176
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,025
- Yeah, but if you don't...
- No, no, no.

177
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,277
There's no time for ''Yeah, buts''.

178
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,947
l want her out of here in five minutes

179
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,492
or you will be responsible
for covering every missed shift

180
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,994
during this year's flu season.

181
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,413
Now go.

182
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,874
Hey, you...

183
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,379
For what it's worth,
l don't care if your beeper plays

184
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,298
<i>Who let the dogs out?
Hoof, hoof</i>

185
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,969
- as many times as you like.
- Actually, sir, it's ''who, who''.

186
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,931
- But thank you.
- And, by the way,

187
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,768
just a real smooth move
running to your mommy.

188
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,897
- Excuse me?
- Your mommy cr-rushed me.

189
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:32,025
She did. l'd like to issue
a warning to everybody,

190
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,152
and l'm dead serious.

191
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,573
FYl: JD's mommy
has made it clear

192
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,826
that she doesn't want her
daughter picked on any more.

193
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:45,956
Nothing mean. She's a precious flower
and we should all be super nice to her.

194
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,683
l was paged.

195
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,976
Hello?

196
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,978
Anyone?

197
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,147
Oh, hell, no!

198
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,570
When l get out, we should hang.

199
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,572
l'd love to. l should warn you,

200
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,783
l work a ton and when l'm off,
l catch up on paperwork

201
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:25,078
or read medical journals
to stay ahead of the curve.

202
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,580
l'm a nerd.

203
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,501
l wish l could stay home and read,
but my job, it's like, you know?

204
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:35,797
With the married-by-the-millennium
thing, l go on like, 1 ,000 blind dates.

205
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,842
And all my friends
always need something.

206
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:44,640
There's me who never wants to
let anyone down, you know, ever.

207
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:50,145
With so many balls in the air, sometimes
it gets a little overwhelming.

208
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:55,359
As soon as l leave, l know
l'm going right back to that mess.

209
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,990
My God, l'm practically crying.
How pathetic is that?

210
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,328
<i>Around here,
you make big choices every day.</i>

211
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,039
l came to tell you
we're gonna keep you here

212
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,291
for the weekend, just to get some rest.

213
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:17,172
<i>Most of these choices actually
have nothing to do with medicine.</i>

214
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,508
lt's so on.

215
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,718
<i>In those cases, you have to make sure</i>

216
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,638
<i>that your emotions
don't get the best of you.</i>

217
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,015
<i>Mommy.</i>

218
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:34,815
- Give me that, Bambi, that's not a toy.
- My name is not Bambi.

219
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:38,694
lt's Dr Dorian.
l don't need to be looked after.

220
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:43,574
How about l'll be the doctor
and you be the nurse.

221
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,576
Yes, doctor.

222
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,744
<i>Good choice.</i>

223
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,005
l have to go check on something.

224
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,340
<i>Fix this before word gets around.</i>

225
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,592
Carla, wait.

226
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,552
What did you do?

227
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:08,390
- What did you do?
- What did you do?

228
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,059
She called me Bambi
in front of everyone.

229
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,605
- My name is not Bambi!
- lt's Scooter!

230
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,817
Short for scooter pie.

231
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,154
Baby, JD is my best friend,

232
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:26,992
but if you need me to kick his ass,
l will kick his ass, cos l care for you.

233
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,996
- And cos l'm willing to sleep with you.
- Hell, yeah.

234
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,208
lf l wanted
his ass kicked l'd do it myself.

235
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,878
Todd,

236
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,173
if you ever make that noise at me again,

237
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,218
l will reach into your mouth
and unscrew that bulb

238
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,637
that barely keeps your brain going.

239
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,808
Dude, chick threats are hot.

240
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,102
What did l say about annoying Carla?

241
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,940
lf she makes me choose between you two,
you know how it'll end up.

242
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,235
Yes, l do. And l thank you for that.

243
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,158
Could you be any cuter
with the new hair colour?

244
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,495
Holy cow! Please, no.

245
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,457
Good morning, sunshine.

246
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,295
Could you possibly
excuse me for just one second?

247
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,051
Dear God, you're still here.

248
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,012
Who exactly is doing this to me?

249
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,684
<i>There's nothing worse than
knowing you've wronged a friend</i>

250
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,270
<i>and having to apologise.</i>

251
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,439
- Look, Carla...
- lt's OK. You overreacted.

252
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,818
l should've realised
you can stand up for yourself.

253
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,196
l know you would take it back
if you could. l do.

254
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,240
We're OK, right?

255
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,910
- l think l've said all l can.
- See you tonight for the exhibit.

256
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:56,331
- Why'd you have me paged?
- To ask you to forgive me.

257
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,000
For what?

258
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,669
Hello, sad clown.

259
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,881
- Thanks for paging her.
- How could you?

260
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,843
He called me cutie and said my eyes
were as blue as the ocean.

261
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,012
l got confused.

262
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:16,852
- lt probably would've worked on me too.
- You're damn right it would've. Come.

263
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,813
ls he single?

264
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,106
Hello?

265
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,234
Look at you, all proud.

266
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,070
Don't tell me
you've already managed to eat?

267
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,031
l took my sweet time, too.

268
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,954
Consider that your last supper.
l'm bored with the games.

269
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:40,292
- Are you forbidding me to sit here?
- This is a public bench.

270
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,463
You are as welcome here as l am
but you won't come back again.

271
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:49,885
You know why? Because you
just don't have the mettle.

272
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,639
Now get out of here so l can
eat my wife's egg salad sandwich

273
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,725
before the tomato
soaks through the bread.

274
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,732
Beautiful day.

275
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,447
Did you get into photography
when you were in college or...?

276
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,908
No. Actually, l never went to college.

277
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,039
Don't tell any of my patients
but neither did l.

278
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,961
ls that supposed
to make me feel better?

279
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,588
No, it was just a joke.

280
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,717
l was doing the whole, like,
turn a frown upside-down.

281
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:34,513
You know what? Hold it.
l don't think we're OK.

282
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,516
You accepted my apology.
You can't take it back.

283
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,060
Have you ever spent time with a woman?

284
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:52,364
ls my punishment still coming
because the anticipation is killing me?

285
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,200
- Make your case.
- l'm sorry, what?

286
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,703
Well, you tell me
why Chorey McCrazy Chore

287
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,414
gets to stay here two more nights.

288
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,999
OK.

289
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,919
You don't know how hard it is
for some women to make it alone.

290
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,798
Jill is so exhausted.
She's her own worst enemy.

291
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:14,011
Constantly trying to please.
She judges herself harsher than anyone.

292
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,763
Have you seen
what you look like today?

293
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,850
l'm a skank.
She never says no to anyone, so...

294
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:25,355
Could you pick up a sample of my dog's
stool and take it to the vet for me?

295
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,150
l can do it at lunch.

296
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,363
lt's OK.
Jill can stay a little longer.

297
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,992
And if we're real lucky,
she'll realise that it's OK

298
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,872
to give yourself a break
every once in a while, right?

299
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,843
l took a cab from the last stop.

300
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,930
- You forgot your coat.
- l don't want it.

301
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,057
Why would you?

302
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,143
l was only gonna go to that exhibit

303
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,438
because l wanted you to think
l was brainy.

304
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:10,025
- l'm so angry at myself.
- Thank goodness.

305
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,152
l thought you were mad at me.

306
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:16,657
Hundreds of interns have decided they
don't need me any more. Why should...?

307
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,993
This is why you can't
be friends with doctors.

308
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,789
lf it's a problem, you, me,
Elliot and Turk will get together...

309
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,750
l don't work with Turk and
l'm not close to Elliot.

310
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,878
The only problem here is you, OK?

311
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,424
We're supposed to be friends.

312
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:38,220
Your self-esteem
is so wrapped up in what you do.

313
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,849
A doctor. That's all you are.
That's how you define yourself.

314
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,643
You think you're
better than me because of it.

315
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,187
- Carla, l do not think...
- Admit it.

316
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,858
Admit it right now
or l'll never respect you again.

317
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,695
OK. Sometimes that's true.

318
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:02,119
- Carla, you're a good nurse.
- l'm a great nurse.

319
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,163
You patronising ass.

320
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,501
You don't even get it, do you?

321
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,463
ln nine years, l never once
felt bad about myself

322
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,091
for what l do, not for one second.

323
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,552
And then l met you.

324
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,431
- Please wait.
- Don't.

325
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,761
<i>Sometimes the only way to
take a good look at yourself</i>

326
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,055
<i>is through someone else's eyes.</i>

327
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:08,143
<i>If you're lucky,
you'll like what you see.</i>

328
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,653
lmpressive.

329
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,283
<i>Or you'll learn from it.</i>

330
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,580
<i>If you don't like what you see,</i>

331
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:31,834
<i>you have to hope
you haven't burned too many bridges.</i>

332
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,629
How many mEqs of potassium
should l give this guy?

333
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,465
You know the answer to that.
Don't do that.

334
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,680
But thanks, Bambi.

335
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,767
<i>From that moment on,
I knew I'd be Bambi for ever.</i>

336
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,936
See you tomorrow, Scooter.

337
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,984
<i>He's actually very talented.</i>

338
00:21:57,305 --> 00:22:57,360

1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:04,087
- Say ''ah''.
- Ah.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,466
- OK, say ''oh''.
- Oh.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,845
Everybody say ''Ah, oh, ah!''

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,682
Excuse me.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,311
As legal counsellor,
it's my job to inform you

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:24,191
that your suspension
is effective immediately.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,276
Just the messenger.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,447
Your long-term job status will
be decided at the board meeting.

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,785
Until then, and l cannot bend on this,

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,788
l don't want you
setting foot on the premises.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,167
- l'm going to be here all day.
- Works for me. That'd be good.

12
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,211
l hope that works out.

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,588
Dr Cox, if you need to talk...

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,218
<i>It was weird knowing my mentor
could be fired tomorrow.</i>

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>But there's no reason
to feel any less confident.</i>

16
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>I'll be fine without a safety net.</i>

17
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,435
What do you think, Dr Dorian?
Bypass or stent?

18
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:05,107
Bypass!

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,150
Or stent.

21
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>There's a lot of horrible things
about being an intern.</i>

22
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:30,257
<i>Long hours, constant stress,
having to deal with death.</i>

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,468
<i>But worst is the simple fact
that the average intern</i>

24
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:37,181
<i>has to disimpact 1 5 to 20 bowels a week.</i>

25
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,726
<i>There's an oath among interns
never to make fun of each other</i>

26
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,187
<i>for doing the things we have to do.</i>

27
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,814
You have to touch someone's hiney.

28
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,151
Dorian, come with me. And Dr...

29
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,777
- Reid.
- Sure. Why not?

30
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,946
Take over for him.

31
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,450
l'm assigning you to a board member

32
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,703
whose family built this hospital
with their bare hands.

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,705
<i>That can't be true.</i>

34
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,917
- Look for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- What happened?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,962
- Pre-syncope.
- So, this board member almost fainted?

36
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,965
- l'll fire up the paddles.
- Dr Weisenheimer's back.

37
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,218
- How was your ski trip?
- l'm confused.

38
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,053
- You annoy me.
- Now l get it.

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,932
But you have a charm
everyone else here seems to respond to.

40
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,808
Use it. OK, sport?

41
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,646
<i>Great, an 80-year-old,
grouchy, pretentious...</i>

42
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,863
<i>...smokin'-hot bitty.</i>

43
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,533
<i>Who do you love the most?</i>

44
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,830
Sweetheart, are you getting younger?

45
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,124
This is Dr Dorian.

46
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,879
- He'll be looking after you.
- And who will be looking after him?

47
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,640
Since your jaw is wired shut,
we'll give you lV nutrition, OK?

48
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,017
Sorry. lt's like the dentist.

49
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,688
They ask you questions and
you have that stuff in your mouth.

50
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,566
l did it again. Dr Greenberg.

51
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,484
What kind of doctor are you?

52
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,821
l keep doing it. Just act it out.

53
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,324
Head?

54
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,160
Shrinking. A shrink!

55
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,956
l can't imagine picking
psychiatry as a specialty

56
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,000
after interning as a real doctor.

57
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,461
That didn't come out right.
My dad. He's a doctor too.

58
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,257
He says therapy is for people
with more money than problems.

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,427
But then... my dad says a lot of things.

60
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,056
- Did anyone page a nurse?
- No.

61
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,477
- lt looks like his eyes are screaming.
- Please, we're talking.

62
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,689
Where was l?

63
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,110
- You should get dressed.
- l can't. lt's still out there.

64
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:59,948
Don't call my mother ''it''. lt implies
you think that she's a monster.

65
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,868
Get a move on,
it gets up to feed about now.

66
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,163
l don't understand
why we couldn't stay at my place.

67
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,332
l could've done the whole show.

68
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,751
- There's a show?
- Yeah, there's a show.

69
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:15,214
lt involves music, some dancing,
occasionally singing.

70
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>- Can you do Me And Mrs Jones?
- l don't know, what's she look like?</i>

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,767
You wanted to spend the whole night
together. l can't leave my mother alone.

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,602
She's frail.

73
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,528
Tell her to put the cane down!

74
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,240
- Tell her to put the cane down!
- lt's because l'm unmarried.

75
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,450
She doesn't have to know we had sex.

76
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,036
- She speaks English.
- Then why translate?

77
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,038
You don't speak Spanish!

78
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,623
No! No!

79
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,878
Tell her to put the cane down.

80
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,506
l have to be honest,
when Dr Kelso said

81
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,759
board member, l was thinking
this like old, grumpy...

82
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,011
That would be my father. He died.

83
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,639
- l'm so sorry.
- 20 years ago.

84
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,352
l would have said sorry then
but l had trouble with my Ss.

85
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:17,901
l was five. Ss.
So... how are you feeling?

86
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,612
Great, that's why l'm here. Listen, RJ.

87
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,948
- JD.
- Like it matters.

88
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,451
You seem like a nice, spineless, boy,
so let's be honest.

89
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:30,873
l'm here because it was the only way to
end my mother's nagging pseudo-concern.

90
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,458
- That's sweet.
- So, do your little tests.

91
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,794
But first, close the blinds,

92
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:40,257
wash off your 8th-grade-dance cologne
so we don't add nausea to my symptoms.

93
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,678
l'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling
water, which you've yet to get.

94
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,472
- Let me just...
- Doing things l want first.

95
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,225
- Your little tests later.
- Nice to meet you.

96
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,768
<i>I hate you.</i>

97
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,897
Merry Christmas!
l mean, happy Halloween!

98
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,525
l am so frazzled.
l did not sleep at all.

99
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:03,197
ln fact, l haven't really slept
since l started here.

100
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,870
lt's so much pressure. l can't talk
to anyone here. lt's so competitive.

101
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,165
l used to be able to talk to
my mom, but now, l don't know,

102
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:18,003
she listens, but she just never
seems to hear me, you know?

103
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,969
Lonely, depressed, overwhelmed.

104
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,681
And sometimes l have no idea
how l'll make it through this.

105
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,852
No. l don't even like to take aspirin.

106
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,646
l'd rather just...

107
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,272
Oh, you!

108
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:41,527
Dr Cox. l've been
thinking about your predicament

109
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,446
and l think l have a solution:
cruise ships.

110
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,491
- Right.
- Everyone'll call you Doc.

111
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,954
You'll visit exotic ports.
Maybe you'll even get to meet Charo.

112
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,832
Enjoy this while you can, Bobby.

113
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,417
lf your evil genie
does grant your wish,

114
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,712
and l disappear,
the only person you'll have left

115
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,006
to contend with will be yourself.

116
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,593
And when you really
get to know that person,

117
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,887
dear God, you'll scream so loud,

118
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:13,559
Satan will want to rip up the contract
you signed so he can get some sleep.

119
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,979
Look at you with your stiff upper lip.

120
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,648
l think l'm gonna miss that the most.

121
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,454
What are you looking at?

122
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,374
l just... l like your shirt.

123
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,002
- What kind of shirt is that?
- A white T-shirt.

124
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,753
l knew it.

125
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,260
l will never sleep
at your place again.

126
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,970
lt wasn't that bad.

127
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,055
l am in such a good mood.

128
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,558
Does she invite the priest over
every day?

129
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,811
Only when she finds me in bed
with some guy. So most days.

130
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,439
That's not funny.
That's not funny.

131
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,067
l'm just in a much better place.
Do l look different?

132
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,571
What kind of a shirt is that?
l am such an idiot.

133
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,656
l'm in a better place.

134
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,576
What do you say, my apartment, tonight?

135
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,578
l'll think about it.

136
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,538
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

137
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,500
ln a better place,
look different, feel good.

138
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,044
That's what happens
when you see a shrink.

139
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,214
My patient is a therapist.
l'm not seeing a shrink.

140
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,133
Stop spreading around
embarrassing rumours.

141
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:32,638
l'm just goofing around. The last thing
l want to do is upset a crazy lady.

142
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,225
- T-shirt.
- ls anybody up there?

143
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,727
Up there... up there... up there...

144
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,939
l'm all alone down here...
here... here...

145
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,733
lt's cold.

146
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,110
l'm frightened.

147
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,326
<i>Just keep moving. Refocus.</i>

148
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,537
<i>Think about helping Dr Cox.</i>

149
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,415
Ms Sullivan? Sorry. l didn't
realise you're in the bathroom.

150
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,211
lt's OK, come on in.

151
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,589
Come in the room, not in here.
What's the matter with you?

152
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,217
Are you even a real doctor?

153
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,097
l know that you're on the board, and l
have this friend. Well, he's a mentor...

154
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,392
- Losing interest!
- Sorry.

155
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,561
Why are you dressed?

156
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,189
l'm going to a party.
l assume my tests are normal.

157
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:28,610
But l sure hope we can go down
to the river some time and race frogs.

158
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,028
<i>That's it.</i>

159
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:33,574
Listen, you spoiled,
bossy chore of a woman.

160
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,451
<i>- What'd you say?
- You're in now, go for it.</i>

161
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,538
l'm the doctor here.
So put your gown back on,

162
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,792
get back in bed and shut the hell up!

163
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:48,130
- No one talks to me that way.
- Get used to it, missy.

164
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,636
l didn't mean to be
such a hard ass, just now.

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,931
You can wait until l'm gone
to put your gown back on.

166
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,019
- Take off your pants.
- Yes, ma'am.

167
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,359
l know it's tough
leaving your mother at home.

168
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,154
- l'm really glad you're here.
- You are?

169
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,323
Yes, l am.

170
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:18,285
And l promise l'm going
to make it worth your while.

171
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,121
We've already slept together.

172
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,874
You should be careful
about the build-up.

173
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:28,045
- ls that necessary?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,214
l got something for you.

175
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,592
You want to hear it?

176
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,145
Did you learn that for me?

177
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,813
More.

178
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,740
<i>The start of a relationship
is about three things.</i>

179
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,617
<i>Control.</i>

180
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,036
Oh, God!

181
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,621
<i>Dependence.</i>

182
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,208
He was released
a couple of hours ago.

183
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,335
<i>And timing.</i>

184
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,420
Your mother broke her leg.

185
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,423
<i>Other than that,
there aren't a lot of surprises.</i>

186
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,259
Dr Cox have you met...?

187
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,845
You don't have
to introduce me to my ex-wife.

188
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,348
Surprise!

189
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,643
You putz.

190
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,816
<i>- Oh, no.
- Hello, Jordan.</i>

191
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,818
<i>- Oh, no, no.
- Perry.</i>

192
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,487
- Perry?
- You never heard that.

193
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:38,365
<i>And I don't have your ex-wife's
bite mark on my neck.</i>

194
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,535
Don't look her in the eyes.
She'll steal your soul.

195
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,912
How are things down in the underworld?

196
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:48,292
Good. And you?
Still have a rollicking social life?

197
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,587
Since l cut you loose
it's been one big party.

198
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,384
Name some place, other than the
hospital, you've been in the last month.

199
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:02,181
Five, four, three, two...

200
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,724
My car!

201
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,519
On the way to the... big party.

202
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,981
That must have hurt.

203
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,108
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

204
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,945
<i>Anger like this has a way of being
passed on to whoever's closest.</i>

205
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:21,116
Dr Cox, l know you're suspended but
you're the only one my mother trusts.

206
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,243
Not now!

207
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,457
This is all your fault.

208
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,046
- Turk, can l talk...?
- No. You can't.

209
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,049
That's why they're called
your problems.

210
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,011
Sorry.

211
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,936
Happy Halloween.

212
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:54,399
That'll teach you not to spy on
people during their alone time.

213
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,737
<i>When dealing with a crisis, everyone
knows you go right to the source.</i>

214
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,614
<i>God, the source is pretty.</i>

215
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,449
Ms Sullivan?

216
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,201
Excuse me?

217
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,578
l think we're way past Ms Sullivan.

218
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,997
OK, Jordan...

219
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,171
l don't think
we should see each other again.

220
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:21,343
The story of my life. Any time l let
my guard down just a little, l get hurt.

221
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,512
l am so sorry.

222
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,099
You know how long it's been
since l connected with someone?

223
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,894
lt's not fair that because of him,
l don't get to spend time...

224
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,063
lt's hard to keep that going.

225
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,608
See you, DJ, l got a date.
''See each other again!''

226
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,990
She's gonna be OK.

227
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,660
l don't know, Mom,
l'm just feeling lost.

228
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:51,498
Everyone here is so busy,
and l guess l'm just kind of lonely.

229
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:59,006
Could you just try to hear
what l'm saying? Just this once?

230
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,967
No, l don't have short hair.

231
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,220
Yes, l know short hair
gives me pig-face.

232
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,639
Yeah.

233
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,184
- Dr Cox!
- OK, Linus.

234
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,605
You're too excited. Get your blankie,
go in a corner, and take a time-out.

235
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,442
Non-displaced femoral fracture,
Carla's mom's gonna be fine.

236
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,277
- OK, what?
- Your ex-wife.

237
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,989
- She's the answer.
- Things That Ruined My Life?

238
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,533
Things With Sharp Edges?

239
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,704
She's on the board.
l'm sure she's a reasonable person.

240
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,207
Not that l know her
or have been alone with her.

241
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,833
- But if you just...
- No.

242
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,085
- Ask.
- l'm going to go and do this

243
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,214
as slowly as possible
so you don't misunderstand.

244
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,175
No...

245
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,220
<i>I wonder if he wants me to ask her.</i>

246
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,097
Fine, l'll ask her.

247
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,602
<i>That's a no.</i>

248
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,441
- lt's always funny.
- Can't believe she's sleeping.

249
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,401
She's had two Valium.

250
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:05,197
- Why, was she in a lot of pain?
- No, she just wouldn't shut up.

251
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,407
l'm sorry.

252
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,744
l notice your little boyfriend's
name's not on the cast.

253
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,622
Making me leave her alone like that?

254
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,625
She would have gotten hurt,
whether you were there or not.

255
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,546
She fell in the shower.

256
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,550
So unless you have an extremely
disturbing relationship,

257
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:28,178
- l'm afraid you're full of crap.
- l'm full of crap?

258
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,473
lf you don't care about being
suspended, why are you here?

259
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,643
You don't scare me
with those crazy eyes.

260
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,187
She's an excuse to not take chances.

261
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,941
- You're only happy when you're here.
- You're afraid to live your own life.

262
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,944
Admit that losing this place
would kill you.

263
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,989
- We done?
- That's all l got.

264
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,079
Crazy eyes?

265
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,457
Low blow.

266
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,085
<i>There are other ways
to save Dr Cox's job.</i>

267
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,713
<i>I could try talking to Dr Kelso.</i>

268
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,845
<i>Cox could get plastic surgery
to look like Jimmie Walker.</i>

269
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:13,015
This guy's gonna need 30mEqs of KCL.

270
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,351
<i>Or I could just ask Jimmie Walker
to talk to Dr Kelso.</i>

271
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:21,481
Your man Cox is the best. l know he's
got an unorthodox way of doing things,

272
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,609
but all the innovators do.

273
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,320
Now, everybody deserves
a second chance.

274
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,488
Am l right?

275
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,283
Who are you?

276
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,328
<i>Or I could get back
to the problem at hand.</i>

277
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,917
l know you're on your way
to the board meeting

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,586
and l know
you don't really like me, but...

279
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,755
l don't dislike you. l nothing you.

280
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,592
Thanks, that's special.
l have to ask you a favour.

281
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,178
But this is not why we slept together.

282
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,723
You had nothing to do
with why we slept together.

283
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,101
l think we both know
that's not completely true.

284
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:02,189
Even though you're terrified
Dr Cox will find out,

285
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,943
if l wanted you to have sex with me
in front of him, you would.

286
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,986
Please don't do that.

287
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,281
You remind me of him
when he was younger.

288
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,450
Then see if you can dig up sympathy

289
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:18,163
for someone who means a whole lot to me,
and probably means a little to you, too.

290
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,543
- So will you help him?
- Ah, sweetie...

291
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,919
No.

292
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,006
- l went to therapy once.
- You did?

293
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,719
Yeah. Once though,
like, back in '93 to '94.

294
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,805
Then a few months in '95.

295
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,933
And then l went to group,
which was a disaster.

296
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,937
When l went to college it was
my first time away from home.

297
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,065
Things started piling up
and l felt l was sinking.

298
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,110
- Yeah.
- And no matter how embarrassing

299
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:52,114
you think it might be, it's always
helpful to talk to someone neutral.

300
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:55,534
For example, take a look at me.
l am now, thanks to therapy,

301
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,412
in a healthy relationship
with a beautiful woman,

302
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,708
who won't sleep over because
she thinks l broke her mother's leg.

303
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,669
Baby!

304
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,508
How long were you back there?
For a second, huh?

305
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,428
- l wasn't talking about us...
- Turk.

306
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:18,682
Mom's spending the night here,
so l will spend the night with you,

307
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,059
only we have to leave right now.

308
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,188
Go.

309
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,076
<i>Sometimes no matter how badly
you want to stop something,</i>

310
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,496
<i>there's nothing you can do to stop it.</i>

311
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,956
<i>The board of directors
of Sacred Heart</i>

312
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,462
<i>is behind that door sipping water
and killing the career of Dr Cox.</i>

313
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,507
Yes. l am bullet-proof.

314
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,761
<i>- He's taking it well.
- So, no hard feelings?</i>

315
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,972
- Careful.
- Catch you on the flip side.

316
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,392
l really think
you're making a big mistake.

317
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:06,063
- The most destructive thing about Dr...
- Yawn!

318
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:10,442
l say yawn because when l actually yawn,
you don't get it.

319
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,987
See you in hell.

320
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,615
<i>I don't know why she did it,
maybe I got to her.</i>

321
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,326
<i>Maybe she knows how much
the hospital needs him.</i>

322
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,663
<i>Maybe she remembers why
she cared about him in the first place.</i>

323
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,583
l did it cos the thought of you
rotting here in this fluorescent tomb

324
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:30,754
is more fun than tipping a valet
with your alimony cheque.

325
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:35,467
Listen, pumpkin, if you're having
this much trouble getting over me,

326
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,761
just go ahead and give me a call,

327
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,848
and l'll toss you
a sympathy throw-down any time.

328
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:44,852
<i>It made me realise
every ending leads to new complications.</i>

329
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,110
<i>New problems to be dealt with.</i>

330
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,447
l'm watching that.

331
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:03,537
<i>- New issues.
- Thanks, Dr Greenberg.</i>

332
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,542
See you next week.

333
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,548
- She was never boring.
- What happened?

334
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:01,803
You marry somebody like your mother
then remember you hate your mother.

335
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:05,057
You asked her for help, didn't you?

336
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,519
You don't realise how important
you are around here.

337
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,439
<i>I'll always remember that as
the first thank-you I got from Dr Cox.</i>

338
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:17,152
Jeez, Agnes. Does the field-hockey team
know that you're missing?

339
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,654
<i>It felt good.</i>

340
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:24,451
Although it did take
some stones to be honest.

341
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:28,914
Stick with the truth and you can't
get hurt. Always been my philosophy.

342
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:35,587
- You didn't sleep with her, did you?
- God, no.

343
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,923
<i>Philosophy is tricky.</i>

344
00:21:38,305 --> 00:22:38,766

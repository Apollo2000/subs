1
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:05,362
<i>So, yes,
it has been quite a summer.</i>

2
00:00:05,446 --> 00:00:08,093
- We finally got a new familiar.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:10,757
- But he had an
accident and died. - Yeah.

4
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:13,303
Left a bit. Left a bit more.

5
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:14,648
It's not even.

6
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:19,021
Ooh. Shit.

7
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:21,270
So we found another one
and she had an accident

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,340
and she died.

9
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,941
Oh, fuck.

10
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:31,955
I had what is known
as a summer of self- discovery.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,759
<i>I was being a vapor</i>

12
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:39,898
<i>and I got sucked
into an air purifier.</i>

13
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:42,049
<i>But apart from that,</i>

14
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:43,937
pretty slow summer.

15
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:46,697
And then the same thing
happened with the next one.

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,765
I spent so much time at the DMV

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,102
they finally just
gave me a license.

18
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,073
I did what any young,
handsome man would do,

19
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:59,076
I went and bought
a classic convertible,

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,247
put the top down,
blasted some tunes and, uh,

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,216
I blocked the entrance
to the Lincoln Tunnel.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,886
This is gonna
ruin my day, too, you know.

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,621
- And then the next one.
- Yep.

24
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:18,150
<i>We've been through about six... no,
seven familiars this year.</i>

25
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:20,197
- Seven?
- Yeah, remember Joey?

26
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,510
No, my dear,
I'm not that familiar.

27
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:26,370
No, don't you remember?

28
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,525
His intestines came
straight out of his bum.

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,594
- Oh, Joey. Yeah, yeah.
- Mm.

30
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,708
Not much new with me.
I've been spending

31
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,275
a lot more time
in the upstairs bathroom.

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,546
But besides that, my summer's
been pretty mellow and...  Ooh.

33
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,516
There's this little guy.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,361
Here. I've been trying to make
friends with him all summer.

35
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:44,654
Don't be afraid. Come on in.

36
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,431
Oh, sh...

37
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,482
<i>That's the tenth vampire
I killed this month.</i>

38
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,738
<i>These vampire assassins
keep trying to kill</i>

39
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,073
<i>Nandor, Nadja and Laszlo</i>

40
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:05,897
<i>ever since they escaped
from the Vampiric Council.</i>

41
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,511
I'm doing it
to protect my master.

42
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,846
<i>But I can't tell him
I'm a vampire killer,</i>

43
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,382
<i>because then he'd have
to kill me.</i>

44
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,184
Guillermo, what are you doing?

45
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,507
- Dusting. - Well,
can you dust more quietly please?

46
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,456
- I'm trying to sleep.
- Okay.

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,958
<i>I haven't slept
in 72 hours. I've been eating</i>

48
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,027
these chocolate- covered
espresso beans.

49
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,461
They give you enough pep
just to keep going

50
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,862
and just keep going, going,
going and pretend...

51
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,397
- Ah!
- Guillermo?

52
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,266
Someone's in here!
Please don't open the door.

53
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,326
Did you make
a messy toilet again?

54
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,099
I- I did. I- I
had an accident. Whoopsie.

55
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:37,003
- Well, actually, I just wanted to... - No,
Master, don't open...

56
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,580
Oh, Guillermo.

57
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,534
You should really
drink more water.

58
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,114

66
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,824
Anyway, that is all in the past,

67
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:25,559
because we have finally
found us a good one.

68
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:28,462
Topher, come in here!

69
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:30,498
- Look at this.
- Tophie!

70
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,067
Your skull polish, madam.

71
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:34,936
- I'll be right outside.
- There he goes.

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,039
Take care of business. Ooh.

73
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:40,041
<i>Topher is an absolutely</i>

74
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,211
<i>"Bob's your money"
spectacular familiar.</i>

75
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,478
And his résumé

76
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:46,047
<i>is impeccable.</i>

77
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:48,649
<i>It is. He
is proficient in Excel.</i>

78
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,118
<i>And went to Lehigh.</i>

79
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:52,720
Now, my wife and I
have not a whore's notion

80
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:54,823
what any of that means.

81
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,357
But we like it.

82
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:58,126
Need any help with that,
G- Money?

83
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,760
Nah, I got it.

84
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:01,930
It's like my father used to say.

85
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,799
"Never accept a towel
from an Italian."

86
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:07,368
- Yeah. Topher.
- Very true, darling.

87
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:08,769
- Master.
- Watching you stretch

88
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:10,939
your young body
across that fireplace,

89
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:13,241
- you know who you remind me of?
- Who, Master?

90
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:14,976
Me.

91
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,477
Bring it in.

92
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:18,012
You're the best.

93
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:21,049
- Guillermo! Guillermo!
- Y- Yes, Master?

94
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,017
Yes?

95
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,719
I dragged my cape through
a street doo- doo again.

96
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,989
I dragged it for three blocks
before I noticed

97
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:29,858
and I'm embarrassed to say
I dragged it

98
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,525
for another eight blocks
after that.

99
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,462
- Why did you do that, Master?
- Well, I thought it would help,

100
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:36,497
you know, drag the doo- doo off.

101
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,067
- Anyway, take care of it please.
- Hey, uh,

102
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:40,935
- you want me to fly in with
the assist? - No!

103
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,270
That actually
is a- a lot of shit on it.

104
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:45,006
This is a good solo job
for Guillermo.

105
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,109
But thank you for the hustle,
Topherino!

106
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:49,143
Look out.

107
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:52,413
- Hustle...?
- I don't think so.

108
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:55,316
- It looks fantastic
in here. - Doesn't it?

109
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,385
- I could watch him clean
all day. - Yes.

110
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:59,287
All right,
I'm glad to hear you say that.

111
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:00,488
Uh- huh.

112
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,689
All right.

113
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:03,691
All right! Bye, Bobby.

114
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,559
It's my little side hustle.

115
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:08,562
I'm a 0.5 percent owner in this
dope new line of hard ciders.

116
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:12,600
- It's called Doze Apples
Hard Cider. -

117
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:15,469
That's clever, 'cause it- -
they're made with apples.

118
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:16,670
Apple <i>flavoring,</i>

119
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:18,139
- we have to say.
- Do Laszlo and Nadja

120
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,841
- know about this?
- Eh.

121
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:21,109
What they don't know
can't hurt them.

122
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,244
- Am I right? High five.
- I...

123
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:25,113
- Come on, dawg. Don't leave
me hanging. - I don't know. Just...

124
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:26,580
- With our job... - Dawg.
Don't leave me hanging, dawg.

125
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:29,250
- And we're just...
- Dawg. Don't leave me hang...

126
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,152
- I just think that...
- No, give me a better one, dawg.

127
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:32,553
- I just think...
- Again, high five!

128
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:34,688
Oh, yeah. High five.

129
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:36,057
I feel like there's a way

130
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,426
to be cool...  which you are,
you're very cool...

131
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,628
- Thank you. - ...and also,
respectful, you know?

132
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:42,363
You need to let them know

133
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:45,133
that you are worthy of being
turned into a vampire someday.

134
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,901
- Which is why we're here.
- To be honest,

135
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,954
I don't really care
about being a vampire.

136
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:51,039
I'm sorry, what?

137
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:53,074
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I was very surprised</i>

138
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,276
<i>that Topher does not
want to be a vampire.</i>

139
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,011
Who doesn't
want to be a vampire?

140
00:05:57,095 --> 00:06:00,214
What are you doing
if you don't...

141
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:02,250
- What- what do you want to be?
- I don't know.

142
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,684
Maybe a warlock.

143
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:05,053
- That'd be cool.
- That would be cool.

144
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,888
That's, like, above vampire.

145
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,356
Alla- kazoom!

146
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,859
And it would explode
or something.

147
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,796
<i>He's still
learning. He's still finding himself.</i>

148
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,097
He'll get there.

149
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:18,232
So, these are like money.

150
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,802
You go to any store that sells
Doze Apples Hard Cider,

151
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,171
pay for the cider
with real money, but then,

152
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,706
you mail in this card to
the address there on the back.

153
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,709
And I can explain
this whole process

154
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:30,311
as I'm handing these out?

155
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:32,313
Oh, yeah.
Sometimes more than once.

156
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:35,216
You know,
if you want, you can drain me right now.

157
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,018
I'm, like, firing on all
four cylinders, you know?

158
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:39,087
You can crunch up as much as you
want. I can make some more.

159
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:40,955
Yeah, I want to, Topher,

160
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,058
but I'm having a pickle
of a time draining you.

161
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,493
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.

162
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,062
Like,
I know you're trying to bore me- -

163
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,364
Hang on.

164
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:52,918
Come on in.

165
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:57,438
The stuff that you tell me
is just so interesting.

166
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:58,772
You know?

167
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,374
Sue me.

168
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,877
- Who was at the door?
- I don't know.

169
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:05,379
Unbelievable. Topher?

170
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,882
Topher, did you happen to let
two vampires into the house?

171
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:10,118
- Hey, hang on, dawg. - Look,
there's a couple rules you need to follow.

172
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,685
- I know you're new, okay, but...
- Sorry, just, uh,

173
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,566
conferencing with this guy
I used to intern for,

174
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:15,489
this dope werewolf- -
You might know him, actually.

175
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,992
First of all, werewolves are not
dope, so I wouldn't know him.

176
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,627
- Uh, this guy's pretty dope.
- No.

177
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:21,562
Look, I don't mean to be hard
on you, but it's important

178
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:23,898
you follow the rules
for everyone's safety.

179
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:25,566
Do me a favor and stay away
from the koi pond.

180
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,668
I think there's an electrical
short from the heater, so just

181
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,871
- stay away from it... - Have you
tried turning it off and back on again?

182
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:31,539
No, just don't touch it,
Topher, okay?

183
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:33,607
- The electric guy's gonna be here
on Monday. - Always works for me.

184
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:35,295
So just leave it alone...

185
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:40,949
<i>Yeah. I'm sad that Topher died.</i>

186
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,584
Another familiar dead, you know?

187
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:46,754
But... that's the business.

188
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:49,423
I'm used to it.

189
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:51,376
That's bad, right?

190
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,165
Death comes for us all.

191
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:00,368
It comes for the bees.

192
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,170
It comes for the trees.

193
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:07,341
It comes for, uh, basically
anyone from zero on up,

194
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,510
so... one...

195
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:10,644
Are you kidding?

196
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,781
...two, three, four.

197
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,348
Put a cork in it,
Colin Robinson.

198
00:08:14,432 --> 00:08:16,885
- We're weak enough as it is.
- Perhaps there is

199
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:19,888
- a familiar killer on the loose?
- What?

200
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:21,755
Well, I was just thinking,
you know,

201
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,191
if there are vampire killers,

202
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:25,759
then why not
familiar killers, also?

203
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:28,229
There's no such thing as
vampire killers, you knob lord.

204
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:30,832
- Well...
- What was that, Guillermo?

205
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,333
I'm just saying
that it wouldn't hurt

206
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,268
to be more cautious and alert.

207
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,804
Enough of this!

208
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,438
This is horse piss.
We are vampires.

209
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:39,673
We can do better
than this for our Topher.

210
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:41,475
Guillermo, dig him up.

211
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,610
Yes.

212
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,879
Please be respectful of his mud.

213
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,747
<i>A necromancer is someone</i>

214
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:48,482
who can reanimate the dead.

215
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:51,419
<i>It's a truly fantastical part
of the dark arts.</i>

216
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:54,055
<i>And I happen to have
a very good old pal</i>

217
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,257
Wallace...

218
00:08:56,341 --> 00:09:00,161
...who is excellently proficient
in the art of necromancy.

219
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:03,264
No, he's excellent, at the dark
art of ripping you off.

220
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:05,166
These people are shysters.

221
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,501
They're obsessed
with the upsell.

222
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:10,171
I'm sure his hut
is around here somewhere.

223
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,506
It's a classic necromancer scam.

224
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,810
"Meet me at my hut."
What bloody hut?

225
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,013
There it is. I'm certain of it.

226
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:21,515
Look at all those pale,
desperate wretches

227
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,384
scurrying around
in the moonlight.

228
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:25,319
It's a performing arts school.

229
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:28,456
Hey, a high school
production of Thornton Wilder's

230
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,259
Our Town with a Q and A
afterwards.

231
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:33,995
- Don't mind if I do. Yum, yum.
- You seek

232
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,930
the necromancer?

233
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,765
What the...?

234
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:39,767
I am they.

235
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:40,935
Hello, Wallace!

236
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,105
Come on, everyone!

237
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:47,775
- I've got a lovely pot of
stew if anyone's hungry. - No.

238
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:51,345
- I see you admiring my wares.
Anything tickle your fancy? - No.

239
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,648
Hush. - These
bracelets ward off the evil eye.

240
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:56,985
- Ooh. Ooh.
- This one attracts the evil eye.

241
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:01,255
- And this one increases sexual
stamina. Yeah. -

242
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,157
You could do with a leg up.

243
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:07,195
- And these are key chains that look
like license plates. - Uh- huh.

244
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,863
Look, mister,
we are not interested

245
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:10,865
in your tricks and trinkets.

246
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:14,102
This one would make a cute gift
for a man named Steve.

247
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,138
Yes, yes, yes, but,
Wallace, what we are here for

248
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:18,406
is we were hoping
you could reanimate

249
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,974
our beloved familiar Topher.

250
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,743
Yes, uh, how long
has he been dead?

251
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:25,079
- Huh?
- Oh, that is Guillermo.

252
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:27,949
He is not dead, although
sometimes we wish he was.

253
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:31,953
Just a little joke there,
Guillermo,

254
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:33,454
I got it.

255
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:35,356
All right, so, uh,
where's the carcass?

256
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,759
Yes. Guillermo,
fetch the <i>carcass.</i>

257
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,529
- The what?
- The <i>carcass.</i>

258
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:44,298
- The cadaver, man.
- I'll go get the body.

259
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,200
What was that?

260
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:48,136
I'll go get the <i>carcass.</i>

261
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,703
Better.

262
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:58,312
And did you bring a personal
item belonging to the deceased?

263
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,648
Uh, yes, uh, his mini- fridge.

264
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,616
Uh, Guillermo, you did
bring the mini- fridge, yeah?

265
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,187
He absolutely loved
this cold, white little box.

266
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,156
And the foot of a deranged cat,

267
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,125
the night- thistle,
the parcel of wolf's- bane

268
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,494
and the $350 cash?

269
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:15,263
- Thank you.
- It's all there,

270
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:16,530
razzle- dazzle man.

271
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:18,967
Good, good.
I can't stress enough

272
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,869
the $350 cash.

273
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:23,905
- Yeah, I'll bet you can't. - Otherwise,
the spells don't work.

274
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,673
Wallace,
do you think we are going to get

275
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,843
- our beloved Topher back?
- Well, he seems well preserved.

276
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,046
Everything seems to want to...
seems to be intact.

277
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,048
He hasn't had that, uh,

278
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:35,817
intestines out of the asshole,
has he?

279
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:36,918
- No, no.
- Good,

280
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:38,686
'cause that really yucks me out.

281
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,722
Right, then, here we go.
Hold on to your hats.

282
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,699
Yes! You're alive!

283
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,201
You can jive!

284
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,036

306
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,621
The end.
I have achieved reanimation.

307
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:49,390
Your beloved familiar

308
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:51,425
will return to you tomorrow.

309
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,962
- Tomorrow?
- Life takes time, my friend.

310
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:57,498
We are reversing the very power
of nature itself.

311
00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:59,267
But there's
a- a quickening ritual,

312
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,369
if you want
to chivvy things along.

313
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,137
As we're all friends,
I could do it for a hundy.

314
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:05,539
- No, you bloody won't. We're
not interested. -

315
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:07,308
Thank you so very much, Wallace.

Everything is back to normal,
because our Topher is back!

319
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:20,588
It's true.
I've got to admit,

320
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:22,824
Wallace, as contemptible
a man as he is,

321
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:26,694
- actually came up trumps.
- Told you so.

322

You fucking didn't.

Don't tell Guillermo, but...

324
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm so happy Topher is back.

325
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:39,740
All right,
let us begin with the minutes.

326
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,242
I am here.

327
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,611
Guillermo, you are there.

328
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:44,913
And, um...

329
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:47,015
To- pher!

330
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,349
Oh, Tophie!

331
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,617
And there is Topher.

332
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:50,518
Wonderful.

333
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:52,320
We are all here.
We can begin.

334
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,022
Firstly- -
and I'm not naming names- -

335
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:57,125
but I have recently noticed
that the house reeks

336
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,161
of decaying flesh, and there are
dead birds everywhere.

337
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,629
Topher!

338
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:03,497
As I say, I'm not naming names.

339
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,466
But if we do have an issue,

340
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,468
then it's important
that we all work together

341
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:10,338
to let Guillermo know,
so that he can fix it.

342
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:12,273
Doze Apples!

343
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:16,911
Off he goes.

344
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,512
That chap's tireless, isn't he?

345
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:21,549
You could learn something
from Topher, no, Guillermo?

346
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,484
I actually have an order
of business I'd like to discuss.

347
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:24,953
- Oh...
- Okay.

348
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:27,288
- The floor is yours.
- I'm a little bit concerned

349
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:28,322
about Topher.

350
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:30,324
<i>I think there might be
something</i>

351
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:32,326
really wrong with him.

352
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,896
Topher! Aah!

353
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,299
- <i>- He waits under my bed and tries
to bite me, for one. - Yes.</i>

354
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:39,901
<i>He eats live birds and insects.</i>

355
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:42,003
<i>I think, I think
he might be a zombie.</i>

356
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:46,207
That, my boy,
sounds like slander.

357
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,776
Nandor, what are you going to do
about the state of the muck

358
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,444
- pouring out of his mouth?
- Guillermo,

359
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:52,346
do you have any proof
of this wild accusation?

360
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,632
Aah!

361
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,953
Well, do you?

362
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,554
He's not well!

363
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:02,323
- He's freaking out.
- Yes!

364
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:04,125
He's gonna eat me!
<i>¡Dios mío!</i>

365
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,626
Well,
now he's speaking in tongues.

366
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,295
That is awful of you
to call Topher

367
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:08,429
those things you just did.

368
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,834
Exactly.

369
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,837
Guillermo, have you
been getting enough sleep?

370
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,906
No. No,
I am not getting anysleep!

371
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,108
I haven't slept
in the last two weeks,

372
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:23,277
because I have to keep one eye
open to protect you guys!

373
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,763
Protect us from what?

374
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:30,718
Nothing.

375
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:32,520
I just wish you guys knew
how hard I work for you,

376
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:35,023
and you don't, so that's okay,
never mind, forget it.

377
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:37,125
Did you see that?

378
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,878
- He was eating his
own dry poops. -

379
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,134
The vampire assassins

Yeah, plus, he was crawling
on the ceiling, which is odd.

00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:18,379
- Well, he didn't do that before?
- Of course not!

445

Well, okay, I must have used
the wrong incantation spell.

446

But you know what?
No extra charge.

447
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,486
- Bullshit! You made it up as you
were going along. - No, no, no, no,

448
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,355
that was word- for- word verbatim.

449
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,824
No. You were bloody texting

00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:31,893
It was an Amber Alert.

00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:33,427
Well, I did think
it was important.

455
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:43,537
I'm gonna let him go?
You must be out of your mind.

00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:22,944
<i>I got "Nadia," uh,</i>

474
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:25,847
which is my name,
but with a less exciting "J."

475
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,615
<i>Completely free.</i>

476
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:29,217
You don't have "Colin."

477
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:31,585
We haven't sold any
since 1979, mate.

478
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,587
But you have "Condom."

479
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,890
Very, very popular.

480
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:37,792
- Can I take one?
- Go for it.

481
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:39,493
<i>So I got...</i>

482
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:40,761
"Gigi."

483
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:43,615
I guess that's better
than "Gizmo."

484
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:49,703
<i>Being a familiar
isn't for everyone.</i>

485
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:53,241
<i>You're not always thanked
or praised.</i>

486
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:56,344
<i>But after my master
saved my life,</i>

487
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:59,513
he proved to me that...
he really does care about me

488
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,783
and all the things I do for him.

489
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:05,871
And if one day
he doesn't, well...

490
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:26,674
Here you go. Down there.

491
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:28,642
That be slippy there, hang on.

492
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:31,345
Here you go.

493
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:32,947
Topher!

494
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:34,148
Yep.

495
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:36,935
Just uh, copy what they do,
you'll be fine.

496
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:39,087
Doze Apples!

497
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:40,855
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very good.

498
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:43,224
Be back to check on you
next year.

499
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:45,426
Doze Apples.

500
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,112
Yes, yes.

501
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:51,265
Gigi.

502
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:53,701
Condom.

503

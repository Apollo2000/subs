1
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,367
This gigantic pyramid in Antarctica

2
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:08,213
would be the oldest
pyramid on our planet.

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,909
It's possible that underneath the ice

4
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:15,252
will be keys for us
to reclaim our ancient past.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,419
The Nazis were particularly interested

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,218
in Antarctica.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,590
Saucers were coming up out of the water

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,519
and were shooting them
with some sort of beam,

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,155
literally cutting ships in half.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,360
Antarctica may hold lost remnants

11
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,362
of an extraterrestrial civilization

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,174
that existed there, thousands
and thousands of years ago.

13
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,639
Since the dawn of civilization,

14
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,669
mankind has credited its origins to gods

15
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:45,607
and other visitors from the stars.

16
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,713
What if it were true?

17
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,815
Did extraterrestrial beings

18
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:54,118
really help to shape our history?

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,921
And if so, might the
ultimate proof be found

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,385
when we uncover the
pyramids of Antarctica?

# Ancient Aliens 11x01 #
Pyramids of Antarctica
Original Air Date on May 6, 2016

23
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:38,428
Stretching over
five million square miles,

24
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,402
across the southernmost
reaches of the Earth,

25
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:46,372
lies the coldest and most
isolated continent in the world,

26
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,774
Antarctica.

27
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,075
Because of its hostile climate,

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,780
including average daily temperatures

29
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,183
of minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit

30
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:02,145
and wind speeds of
over 200 miles per hour,

31
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,686
Antarctica remains largely untouched

32
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,833
by mankind.

33
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,458
According to historical records,

34
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,874
modern man did not even
set foot on the continent

35
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,568
until 1853,

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,270
when ship captain Mercator Cooper landed

37
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,874
on what is now known as

38
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:25,136
the Oates Coast of Victoria Land.

39
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:29,846
Today, anywhere from
1,000 to 5,000 people

40
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,390
reside at the research stations
scattered across the continent,

41
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:37,415
braving the extreme conditions
in hopes of learning more

42
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,325
about this mysterious landscape.

43
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,765
The thing about Antarctica

44
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,367
is that as much as 98% of it

45
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,371
is covered in ice.

46
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:55,073
And just occasionally,

47
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,306
there are little areas that stick out--

48
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,181
mountaintops, ridges, peaks.

49
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,952
Antarctica is the least explored

50
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,521
of the continents.

51
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,749
Even the North Pole, which is just ice,

52
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,524
has been explored more.

53
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,489
It is a mystery, and it's
right here on the Earth.

54
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,888
It's perhaps the last big
unexplored part

55
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,834
of our home planet.

56
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,730
Antarctica is a vast, frozen world

57
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,473
and we know very little about it.

58
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,671
And, in fact, the ice in Antarctica

59
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,843
is up to three miles thick
in certain places.

60
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,113
And what's beneath the ice

61
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:34,178
is still largely a mystery
to scientists.

62
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,421
You just have to imagine this.

63
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,747
The Sears Tower is a little less

64
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,152
under a third of a mile tall,

65
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,615
so you have to imagine
that you can stack

66
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,464
nine Sears Towers on top of each other

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,490
and they would still not peek out

68
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,526
from that ice sheet.

69
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,466
Most geologists believe

70
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,238
Antarctica has been completely frozen

71
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,908
and uninhabited
for over 12 million years.

72
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,208
But in 2012, new photographs

73
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,651
revealed formations in the landscape

74
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,007
that challenge this notion:

75
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,116
Mysterious pyramid structures

76
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,389
emerging from the now-melting ice.

77
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,757
Recently there have been
a number of reports

78
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,761
of pyramids being found on Antarctica.

79
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,695
There are various photographs

80
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,402
that show what appear to be

81
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,114
perfect four-sided pyramids,

82
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:38,877
very similar in design
to those at Giza, Egypt,

83
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,949
and perhaps other places
around the world.

84
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,884
While the photos were explained away

85
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,346
by mainstream scientists

86
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,615
as nothing more than natural
land formations...

87
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,355
satellite imagery analysts
like Joseph White

88
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,732
are not entirely convinced.

89
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,271
In March of 2013,

90
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,097
he uncovered
what he believes is evidence

91
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,540
of yet another pyramid,
located just south

92
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,577
of Antarctica's remote
Shackleton mountain range.

93
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,708
I initially found the structure

94
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,753
whilst looking on Google Earth.
I was in fact looking

95
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,118
at some of the ra-rather strange
blank spots that you get

96
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,717
in Antarctica, when I stumbled
on... upon this very large

97
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,321
square structure which seems
to be some kind of building

98
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,985
or perhaps even a pyramid,
but certainly,

99
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,594
very large and very square.

100
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:31,126
It actually lines up perfectly
with the coordinates

101
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,471
of the compass:
north, south, east and west.

102
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,638
And, uh, this dictates to me
that it's probably

103
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,268
an intelligent structure,
because, uh, random structures,

104
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,614
like mountains,
are not aligned to the compass.

105
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,981
And another way we know
that, uh, a structure

106
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,350
is not naturally occurring

107
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,919
is generally to look for symmetry--

108
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,117
things like right angles
and equilateral triangles

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,060
and shapes that you would not
normally find in nature.

110
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,987
This structure is-is exactly,

111
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,963
uh, two kilometers square.

112
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,931
And, uh, this corner to this corner

113
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,061
is two kilometers and
this corner to this corner

114
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,196
is also exactly two kilometers,

115
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:11,072
which would make this
more than double the size

116
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,671
of any pyramid thus far found on Earth.

117
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,476
While it may seem unthinkable

118
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,678
that pyramids could exist in Antarctica,

119
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,121
in recent years, archaeologists
have found pyramids

120
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,148
all over the world

121
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,853
that had been lost for centuries,

122
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,356
mistaken as natural formations

123
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,128
or hidden in the most unlikely places.

124
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,859
They have been discovered

125
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,704
in the plains of northern Peru;

126
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,770
buried beneath dirt
and rubble in Indonesia;

127
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,771
and one may even exist

128
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,069
in Los Angeles, California.

129
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,175
All the way round the world

130
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,277
we find evidence of pyramid structures.

131
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,320
We should start
looking at the possibility

132
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:01,094
that there was habitation on Antarctica.

133
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:05,118
Was it a lost civilization?

134
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,855
Could it be ancient astronauts?

135
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,661
And just maybe

136
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,574
the earliest monuments
of our own civilization

137
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,897
came originally from Antarctica.

138
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,544
If this gigantic pyramid in Antarctica

139
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,581
is an artificial structure,

140
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:27,547
it would probably be the
oldest pyramid on our planet.

141
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,518
And, in fact, it might be
the master pyramid

142
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,917
that all the other pyramids

143
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,050
on planet Earth were designed,

144
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,185
uh, to-to look like.

145
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,331
There has been extensive research done

146
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,657
on pyramids throughout the world,

147
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,063
in terms of their structure and
what it is that they really are.

148
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,726
And one of the theories is that
pyramids are power generators.

149
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,567
And so, if you have these
pyramids strategically placed

150
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,074
around the world,
generating this charge,

151
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,143
it's possible to create

152
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,145
a general standing wave around the world

153
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,178
that is basically a wireless

154
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,593
transmission of energy.

155
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,557
It's been theorized that ancient ships,

156
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,787
extraterrestrials and those
with high technology

157
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,291
could use this interconnected

158
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,133
wireless energy system

159
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,903
to navigate around the planet

160
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,669
and it makes sense that,

161
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,541
if there was some kind of worldwide

162
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,142
pyramid power grid like this,

163
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,146
that Antarctica

164
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,678
would have pyramids as well.

165
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,324
The whole idea
of these pyramidal structures--

166
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,921
where did it come from?

167
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,991
'Cause it's not an arbitrary thing.

168
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,333
And these structures,
they exist worldwide.

169
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,928
So, you know, what was the impetus?

170
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,301
What's the origin?

171
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,729
And, even more fascinating,

172
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,265
did they originate

173
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,700
on the Antarctic continent?

174
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,835
Might the pyramid

175
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,014
Joseph White claims to have discovered

176
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,909
near the Shackleton Mountain Range

177
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,375
and other pyramid-shaped formations

178
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,294
recently photographed in Antarctica

179
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,957
provide evidence of
extraterrestrial visitation

180
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,457
to our planet in the remote past?

181
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,934
And if they are actually
man-made structures,

182
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,701
how is such a thing even possible

183
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
in a place that has been
buried beneath the ice

184
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,673
for over 12 million years?

185
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,873
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

186
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,406
Antarctica may not have
been a frozen continent

187
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:44,283
for as long as mainstream
scientists suggest.

188
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,324
And they say proof can be found

189
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:52,287
by examining a 500-year-old map
depicting the continent...

190
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,762
without any ice.

191
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:05,047
Siberia, 2013.

192
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:07,754
A wooly mammoth is discovered

193
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,350
flash frozen in the glacial ice,

194
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,393
engulfed so quickly

195
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:17,218
that its blood and muscle tissue
are perfectly preserved.

196
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,833
It is just one of dozens

197
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,659
that have been found
within the Siberian ice

198
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:25,565
since the turn of the 20th century.

199
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:29,298
Many seemingly caught
in suspended animation,

200
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,442
some with food in their mouths

201
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,340
and vegetation in their stomachs

202
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:37,483
that would only grow
in a much warmer climate.

203
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,176
The discovery of a woolly mammoth

204
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:40,811
that was flash frozen

205
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,246
raises some interesting
scientific questions.

206
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,092
Did something happen very
locally to the woolly mammoth

207
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,818
that it froze very fast?

208
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,723
But it does also raise the question

209
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,762
of how quickly can climate
really change.

210
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:54,457
And does it take some sort of cataclysm?

211
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:56,833
One that's sudden and unexpected?

212
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,803
In 1958,

213
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:07,066
Charles Hapgood,
a Harvard-educated scientist,

214
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:11,906
published the book,
Earth's Shifting Crust.

215
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:16,524
In it, he proposed that
portions of the Earth's crust

216
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:19,049
experienced violent and sudden shifts

217
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:21,815
during Earth's geological history.

218
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:27,329
His theory, known as
Crustal Displacement,

219
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,230
posited that both Siberia

220
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,431
and the continent of
Antarctica were located

221
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,438
in slightly more temperate climates

222
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,867
prior to the end of the last Ice Age,

223
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:40,212
approximately 12,000 years ago.

224
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:44,406
But then, some unknown
catastrophe plunged them

225
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:46,183
into their current positions.

226
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,520
Professor Hapgood came up with the idea

227
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:57,392
that the previous
North Pole position had been

228
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,490
in the area of the Hudson Bay.

229
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,895
And then it shifted to
where the pole is today.

230
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,397
And at the southern pole, he believes

231
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:09,873
that the area of Antarctica

232
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:14,542
had previously also experienced
a temperate climate,

233
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,880
and that this was suddenly now thrust...

234
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:23,019
into this deep ice and
this harsh, freezing climate.

235
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,585
He believed the last time

236
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,717
that this had actually taken place

237
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:32,329
was approximately 12,000 years ago.

238
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:34,288
When we think about
Earth crust displacement theory

239
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,126
and plate tectonics,

240
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:40,072
you want to think of the crust
basically floating on the magna

241
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:43,339
and being able to shift
and move around on top of it.

242
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,505
The Earth's crust
is not one solid piece.

243
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:48,514
We know it's made of individual pieces.

244
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,711
So, you could look and see

245
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,849
how the continents probably
used to fit together

246
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:55,378
and where they've moved,
and how they move apart

247
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,147
over a long period of time.

248
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:59,689
But the question is, you know,
would something the size

249
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,088
of Antarctica shift suddenly,
or is that too big?

250
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,958
These crustal shifts,
according to Hapgood,

251
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:08,628
actually could happen
over a period of even days.

252
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:12,101
And so, if you had
a thriving civilization,

253
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:15,801
this crustal displacement could
have hit it very, very quickly,

254
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,641
and so, it could have
actually been frozen

255
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:21,311
over a very short period of time.

256
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,679
Although Hapgood's theory of sudden,

257
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:28,418
large-scale shifts of the Earth's crust

258
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,447
was not widely accepted,

259
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,019
renowned physicist Albert Einstein

260
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:34,892
was "electrified" by it,

261
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:39,557
and even wrote the foreword
of Hapgood's book.

262
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:42,502
Hapgood would also find
additional support

263
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:45,368
for his theory when, in 1960,

264
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:48,701
while combing through the
Library of Congress archives,

265
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:53,341
he unearthed an unusual map,
published in 1531.

266
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,679
The map, credited

267
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:59,848
to mathematician and
cartographer Oronteus Finaeus

268
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:02,745
appears to depict an ice-free continent

269
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:07,821
remarkably similar
to today's maps of Antarctica.

270
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:12,133
It was not until as late as 1820

271
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:17,198
that we had any real idea
of what Antarctica looked like.

272
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:21,569
Yet, here, on the Oronteus
Finaeus map from 1531,

273
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,540
here was Antarctica.

274
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,909
How the hell is it possible

275
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:30,938
that it could appear on this map?

276
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:33,006
Researchers are baffled

277
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:35,175
as to how the Oronteus Finaeus map

278
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,024
could include a continent

279
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:41,049
that was not discovered
until over 300 years later,

280
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,023
and are even more perplexed

281
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:48,125
by the fact that it depicts
Antarctica free of ice.

282
00:14:48,197 --> 00:14:53,067
If explorers somehow discovered
Antarctica in the 1500s,

283
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,338
it would have been
completely frozen over.

284
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:00,238
Remarkably,
the Finaeus map shows not only

285
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,039
a detailed coastline free of ice,

286
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,152
but the entire continent,

287
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:08,284
including interior features
such as rivers,

288
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:12,624
valleys and mountains.

289
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:16,061
The map shows mountain ranges

290
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:19,458
that have rivers coming out
of the mountain ranges.

291
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,561
How could that be?

292
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:24,064
It's frozen. It's ice.

293
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:28,043
There's a NASA image of
the continent of Antarctica

294
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:31,373
using radar so that
mountain ranges come through

295
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,443
and can be seen.

296
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:38,482
And you can see a mountain range
on one photograph,

297
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:41,317
and on the Oronteus Finaeus map,
it's right there, too.

298
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,383
It's the same mountain range.

299
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,848
According to climatologists,

300
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,693
the estimates of when this
feature would have been free

301
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:55,503
from ice cover was
at least 6,000 years ago.

302
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:59,797
So how is it possible
that this map exists?

303
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:02,742
Did Finaeus have access to an older map?

304
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,468
One dating back thousands of years?

305
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:11,243
Perhaps more confounding,
U.S. Air Force cartographers

306
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:15,117
that were sent the maps in the 1960s

307
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,484
concluded that they were drawn

308
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:19,753
using advanced spherical trigonometry

309
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,792
with remarkable precision,
especially when considering

310
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,691
the maps were made
hundreds of years ago.

311
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:28,058
The fact that we find something that's

312
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:30,863
a reference to modern-day
technology on a map

313
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:33,296
that dates back to the 16th century,

314
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:36,139
makes me think: is it possible

315
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:40,508
that some type of advanced radar
technology was used?

316
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:43,479
Because in order to produce a map

317
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,605
that would outline the areas we see,

318
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:51,075
you would have to be
at an altitude of 80 miles.

319
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:54,216
So, how was that possible?

320
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:59,393
Could it be that the basis
for these maps was gleaned

321
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:02,895
from maps that were cartographed

322
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:05,698
by extraterrestrial land surveyors?

323
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:10,196
The implications of all this--

324
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:14,665
and if you now are able
to add things like pyramids--

325
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:18,037
this would really indicate
that there was some kind

326
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,377
of ancient civilization in Antarctica.

327
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:23,422
And that it would have been over
12,000 years ago.

328
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,989
And you've got to wonder what
kind of civilization this was.

329
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:31,156
Is it possible
that it was extraterrestrials?

330
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:35,431
Could Antarctica have been inhabited

331
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:39,101
by extraterrestrials
in the distant past?

332
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,971
Did they study this continent

333
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,599
and leave behind detailed information

334
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:46,335
about its landscape?

335
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:52,248
If so, just what happened
to these otherworldly visitors?

336
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:55,077
Ancient astronaut theorists believe

337
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,720
more clues can be found
in Egyptian stories

338
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:03,217
describing an Earth-altering catastrophe.

339
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,188
Edfu, Egypt.

340
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,998
Located on the western bank of the Nile,

341
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,967
the Temple of Edfu is one of the largest

342
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:24,604
and most well preserved temples
of the ancient kingdom,

343
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:30,111
dating back to 237 BC.

344
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,309
The Edfu Temple
is of tremendous importance.

345
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:37,213
As you enter the temple, it's
like you're going inside a book.

346
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,717
It's literally full of texts--

347
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,448
every wall, every column,

348
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,123
every room, every chamber
is filled with text.

349
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,793
They're known collectively
as the Edfu Texts.

350
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,329
What is very interesting is that

351
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,525
the majority of these texts
speak about the creation

352
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,761
of the world.

353
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,666
According to the texts,

354
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,371
the Earth was created by powerful gods

355
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,774
who came down from the sky,

356
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:07,753
and these gods first established
a place known

357
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:11,777
as the Island of the Egg.

358
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,021
Two gods,

359
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,960
they created an island in
the middle of the eternal lake.

360
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,286
Creation started with that island.

361
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,698
The occupants
of this so-called primordial,

362
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,870
mythical world-- very strange creatures.

363
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,467
There seems to be
three groups of people:

364
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,743
one called the sages,

365
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,343
one called the builders,

366
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,775
and the other called the Shebtiu.

367
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,150
Nobody knows who they are.

368
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,248
These are the ones
that are very mysterious

369
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,290
because they are said
to emerge from the water.

370
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:52,758
Then the Egyptians believed
a series of gods came

371
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,885
and built the first temples.

372
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,025
It says that here the first
temples were-were built,

373
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,528
the first ones ever in the world.

374
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,374
And that these became the blueprint

375
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,240
for every temple in Egypt.

376
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,241
Once all the creator gods
have done their job

377
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,844
with creating the world,

378
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:18,483
they would meet with their big
bird and ascend to the sky.

379
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,721
Ancient Egyptians believed
with all their heart

380
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:27,762
that everything listed
and inscribed on these walls

381
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:32,457
are true, true, true.

382
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:36,032
If the walls say there's an
island in the middle of nowhere

383
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,795
where gods would go
and ascend to the sky,

384
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,066
then ancient Egyptians,
the devoted ones,

385
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,882
would believe that island exists.

386
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,610
According to the Edfu Texts,

387
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,876
not all of the occupants left.

388
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,816
And after many generations,

389
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,888
the island suffered a terrible fate.

390
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,457
The texts are very different

391
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,799
as to what happens to the
occupants, these strange gods.

392
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
They seem to...
once they have set the scene,

393
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,072
once they have built the temples,

394
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:16,771
they hand over their work
to the historical lineage,

395
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,506
and then they depart.

396
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,641
We don't know where they go.

397
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,553
There seems to be something
very interesting here.

398
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,375
There seems to be a war going on.

399
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,724
The armies of these divinities

400
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,786
is led by this falcon god.

401
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:33,518
And he battles a kind of enemy
represented by a snake.

402
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:38,096
In the skies appeared what
was known as the enemy snake.

403
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,534
It had a name. It was called
the Great Leaping One.

404
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,971
It was said
that immediately it appeared,

405
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,570
there was a time of darkness.

406
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,912
And there were suddenly floods

407
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,875
that destroyed this sacred island.

408
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,949
And when the waters receded,

409
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:59,047
these original beings, who were
known as the Ancient Ones

410
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,922
or the Elder Ones,

411
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:05,361
were now no longer there.

412
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,964
Perhaps the Great Leaping One,
this enemy snake,

413
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,258
was the memory of the comet

414
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,671
that entered
into our inner solar system,

415
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,898
broke up,

416
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,770
causing devastation and destruction.

417
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,705
Might the account
of this ancient catastrophe

418
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,551
inscribed on the walls
of the Edfu Temple

419
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,991
be describing a natural event?

420
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,924
Or was it a deliberate attack,

421
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:42,494
an attack targeting
an otherworldly civilization

422
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:47,325
existing on what we now know
as the Antarctic continent?

423
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,630
We need to take a second look

424
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,035
at the Edfu Texts and the story

425
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:54,237
of the Island of the Egg because

426
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,567
it's the source material
for Plato's story.

427
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:00,406
In his story of Atlantis, he
gives a very important detail.

428
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,049
He describes it as an immense island

429
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:08,116
the size of Libya
and North Africa combined.

430
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,561
Now, the thing about it is,
is that there's only one island

431
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,057
on the planet that's out
in the middle of the ocean

432
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,826
that matches that description,
and that's Antarctica.

433
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:25,043
Curiously, the island continent depicted

434
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,367
on the Oronteus Finaeus map

435
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,673
reveals a shift of the South Pole

436
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,012
of seven and a half degrees,

437
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,751
or nearly 1,000 miles
from what it is today.

438
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,179
Might this shift corroborate
the accounts

439
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:44,656
of a major catastrophic event
in the remote past?

440
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,057
If so, could the creation myth
recorded at Edfu

441
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:53,931
be describing something more
than mythology?

442
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,233
The cataclysm which would have
shifted Antarctica,

443
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,703
this would have destroyed
the civilization that was there.

444
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,866
And then, over time,

445
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:05,605
whatever buildings and pyramids
that were there

446
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,381
would be covered with ice.

447
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,284
So the whole idea
that Antarctica is hiding,

448
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:16,045
beneath its ice,
some ancient civilization

449
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,855
is a very intriguing idea

450
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,934
and one that may very well be true.

451
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,203
Might there actually be evidence

452
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,130
of an ancient extraterrestrial
civilization

453
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:34,242
buried under the ice of Antarctica?

454
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,080
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

455
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,637
and believe that this long history

456
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:44,106
of an alien presence there
is precisely what brought

457
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:47,923
another occupying force
to its frozen shores--

458
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,710
the Nazis.

459
00:24:52,984 --> 00:24:54,724
Hamburg, Germany.

460
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:58,149
December, 1938.

461
00:24:58,256 --> 00:25:01,686
Four years into Adolf Hitler's
reign as Fuhrer,

462
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,689
he is beginning to establish

463
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:06,901
his total dictatorship
by taking direct control

464
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:09,058
of the German military.

465
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:20,442
But on the brink of World War II,

466
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:24,005
Hitler is also involved
in much stranger endeavors

467
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:26,175
that are hidden to the public.

468
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,220
He is committing
every remaining resource

469
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,049
to searching for ancient relics
that he believes

470
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,356
could hold incredible powers.

471
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,161
On December 17,

472
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:40,699
the German freighter MS Schwabenland

473
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,668
sets out on one
of these top secret missions.

474
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:49,169
Its 33-member team is rumored
to include scientists,

475
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:52,683
military experts, construction crews,

476
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:55,437
and key members of the Thule Society,

477
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:57,976
an elite group associated with the Nazis

478
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:01,949
that focused on mysticism
and the occult.

479
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:06,963
32 days later, they arrive
at their destination,

480
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:10,588
Antarctica.

481
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,755
The Nazis themselves were fascinated

482
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,925
by ancient civilizations

483
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:19,903
and legends of vanished super races.

484
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,974
They were searching for

485
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:24,173
this lost Arctic home

486
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,705
that they thought that
the Aryans had come from.

487
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:29,681
They were looking all over the world,

488
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
and that included Antarctica.

489
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:34,919
The Thule Society actually believed

490
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:38,689
that they were mystics,
or channels, who were able

491
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:40,559
to communicate with these beings

492
00:26:40,658 --> 00:26:43,488
who claimed to be either
extraterrestrial in origin

493
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:46,064
or claimed to belong
to this, uh, civilization

494
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:48,503
that lived in Earth's interior.

495
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,129
They gave a lot of information

496
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,135
about the building of advanced
aerospace vehicles,

497
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,008
flying saucers,
and I think this is where,

498
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:59,978
uh, Hitler's Nazi party
got a lot of its information

499
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,777
about Antarctica--

500
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:05,209
that, uh, in Antarctica there is
this ancient civilization,

501
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:07,276
or bases where they could find

502
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:10,115
a lot of these advanced technologies.

503
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:15,117
During their time in Antarctica,

504
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:17,586
the Nazis were believed to have mapped

505
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:21,625
huge swaths of the icy landscape by air.

506
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:25,132
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe they also established

507
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:27,836
an elaborate underground headquarters

508
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:31,509
known as Base 211.

509
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,039
Hitler and the Nazis

510
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:36,014
were particularly interested
in Antarctica.

511
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,713
I think they really believed
that there were things going on

512
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:40,546
deep under the ice.

513
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:42,951
And there have always been
rumors that the Nazis,

514
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:46,394
with their submarines,
have underwater caverns,

515
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,630
small cities; that they escaped there

516
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:52,357
after World War II.

517
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:55,233
When the Germans got to Antarctica

518
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,073
what they found were

519
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:59,198
massive cities

520
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,803
that were highly technological.

521
00:28:01,906 --> 00:28:05,206
And these buildings
were not just on the surface--

522
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,809
they went deep down underground.

523
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:11,112
So, they began relocating
a massive amount of equipment

524
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:14,045
and personnel to Antarctica,

525
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,091
repressurizing these ancient facilities

526
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:19,188
and reoccupying them.

527
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,730
In 1946,

528
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,229
one year after the end of World War II,

529
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,702
the U.S. government launched its own

530
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:33,541
large-scale mission to Antarctica.

531
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:37,307
Operation Highjump
deployed 4,700 troops,

532
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:40,538
13 ships, an aircraft carrier,

533
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:44,484
and a number of seaplanes to Antarctica.

534
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:47,318
Although the government
denied it at the time,

535
00:28:47,418 --> 00:28:49,918
it would later become known that

536
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:52,821
one of the operation's
primary objectives was

537
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:56,663
"extending the United States'
sovereignty over the largest

538
00:28:56,761 --> 00:29:00,401
practicable area
of the Antarctic continent."

539
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,799
The U.S. Navy, then,
sent what was basically

540
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:09,773
a flotilla of armed ships to Antarctica.

541
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,744
In Operation Highjump,

542
00:29:11,842 --> 00:29:14,612
there were stories
that were quite strange,

543
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,252
that ultimately
came out of that expedition,

544
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:19,178
which-which ended quite early.

545
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:22,623
There were stories of craft coming up

546
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,290
out of the water, around the ships,

547
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,359
and of flying saucer-type vehicles.

548
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:32,059
Saucers were coming up out of the water,

549
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:35,963
and were shooting them
with some sort of beam,

550
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,197
literally cutting ships in half.

551
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:40,902
They were shooting planes
out of the sky.

552
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,805
And they traveled so fast,

553
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,837
that it was almost impossible

554
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:47,012
to visually reference

555
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,141
where the disk was going.

556
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,576
So, the American fleet

557
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:54,652
had to limp back to the United States,

558
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,452
totally broken and destroyed.

559
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:58,988
It's still a mystery,

560
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,320
all of the activities

561
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,824
that were going on in Antarctica.

562
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,286
You have to wonder
if the American military,

563
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:06,055
and other governments, too,

564
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:08,503
are aware of structures under the ice,

565
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,299
of pyramids beneath the ice;
and perhaps they know

566
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:15,673
that there's some kind
of ancient civilization

567
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,813
frozen beneath the ice of Antarctica.

568
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,705
If, in fact, the Nazis were seeking

569
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:26,854
extraterrestrial technology
in Antarctica,

570
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:30,491
is it possible that they
actually discovered it?

571
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:33,658
And might the U.S. military
have encountered

572
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:36,927
this powerful technology years later,

573
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:39,734
during Operation Highjump?

574
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,300
Ancient astronaut theorists believe

575
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,169
that further proof of an
alien presence in Antarctica

576
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,340
may be found in a prehistoric lake

577
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,140
buried under two miles of ice.

578
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,959
Lake Vostok, Antarctica.

579
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,500
Buried under two miles of ice

580
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:11,226
is a 4,800-square-mile body of water.

581
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,496
It is by far the largest

582
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,935
of the continent's nearly 400 lakes

583
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,111
that are entirely covered by ice.

584
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,711
In 2001,

585
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,080
pilots collecting data here
recorded unusual

586
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,494
and extreme irregularities
in the magnetic field

587
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,217
at the southeastern corner of the lake.

588
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,063
Spanning a remarkable

589
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,159
65 by 46 miles,

590
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,662
the anomalous area is producing

591
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:43,525
an unusually high level
of magnetic energy.

592
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,365
This anomaly was roughly,
uh, 50 miles in diameter

593
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,873
and was something that would be

594
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,905
commensurate with the magnetic field

595
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,011
being generated by a city.

596
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,416
I have been
to Lake Vostok several times,

597
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,449
as part of expedition research.
And when we were

598
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,724
in the area, we did pick up
this magnetic anomaly.

599
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,864
But we also found
other magnetic anomalies

600
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,560
which were actually transitioning from

601
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,391
one place to another. They were moving.

602
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,463
Highly rare and extremely unusual.

603
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,302
We weren't able to determine what was

604
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,030
causing these anomalies.

605
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:20,897
It's totally inexplicable.

606
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,306
And of course, this has given rise

607
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,008
to theories that perhaps

608
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,881
there is something else here.

609
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,250
Perhaps it's a UFO...

610
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:33,119
some kind of alien base;
perhaps even the remnants

611
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,318
of a lost civilization.

612
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,820
And now the NSA themself

613
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,193
have almost put a blanket

614
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,832
over any further research,

615
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,857
and it's almost become a no-go area.

616
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,968
Vostok is not the only site

617
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,367
with limited outside access.

618
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,440
Seven different countries

619
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,069
have claimed territories in Antarctica,

620
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,305
yet it remains one of
the most restricted locations

621
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,481
in the world.

622
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,207
Currently, there are 68

623
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,215
international bases here,

624
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,247
many of which require permits

625
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,592
or special permissions to visit.

626
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:13,258
They are manned not just with scientists

627
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,488
but also military personnel.

628
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:18,904
But why is it so restricted?

629
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,230
McMurdo Station, Antarctica.

630
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,136
Located on a southern peninsula
of Ross Island,

631
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,140
this is the largest research
station on the continent.

632
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,284
It was opened by the U.S. government

633
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,050
in 1956 and houses

634
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,920
up to as many as 1,200
residents at a time.

635
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,088
In January of 2015

636
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,091
a U.S. Navy flight engineer,

637
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,993
who served with the
Antarctic Development Squadron

638
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:53,103
at McMurdo for 14 years,

639
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:56,665
came forward to investigative
reporter Linda Moulton Howe

640
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:00,198
with bizarre accounts
of his time in Antarctica.

641
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:03,205
In January of 2015,

642
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:06,338
I got an e-mail from a retired

643
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,105
naval flight engineer.

644
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,883
He's asked me to call him only Brian

645
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,083
in the world public.

646
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,685
And this is what he told me:

647
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:19,357
From about 1983, to when he retired

648
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,358
from the Navy in 1997,

649
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,101
he was in all kinds

650
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:28,967
of what they call Antarctic
squadron expedition missions,

651
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,527
that included rescuing people

652
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,597
in and out of various places.

653
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:38,105
In all these trips, nothing of
a high strangeness had occurred.

654
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,110
And then, all of a sudden,
it was one thing after another.

655
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:45,023
During a squadron mission
in the Transantarctic Mountains,

656
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:50,417
the whole crew saw a whole bunch
of silver darting objects.

657
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,592
And they are round.

658
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,988
And he says they're doing
the strangest thing.

659
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,063
They're going, like,
to this peak in a group,

660
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:01,103
to this peak in a group,
to this peak in a group.

661
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,296
And then they'd all take off.

662
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:08,042
And not only did this happen
once, it happened over and over.

663
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,436
According to the informant,

664
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,182
this was just one

665
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,277
of many strange mysteries
on the continent

666
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,109
that he witnessed during his time there.

667
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,375
They get an assignment not long after.

668
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,116
There's a medical emergency.

669
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,261
They are now under the gun,
the clock is ticking,

670
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,388
and a decision was made:

671
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,663
They're going o...
through the no-fly zone

672
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,459
because it's a medical emergency.

673
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,634
And what do they see?

674
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,273
In the ice,

675
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,999
like, a huge entrance to a cave

676
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:44,236
but slanted going down. And he said,

677
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,043
"I think it was at least, Linda,
200 feet in diameter,

678
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,805
a big hole in the ice."

679
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:52,224
And he said, "Our instruments
are not operating.

680
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,247
"We were losing electricity.
We had magnetic anomalies.

681
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:58,824
"And we concluded there's
something about this hole

682
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:02,064
that is now causing these problems."

683
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,300
They do their medical recovery.

684
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,598
And the next thing they know,

685
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,570
they're all being chewed out

686
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,069
by men in suits

687
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,671
that are not from McMurdo.

688
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,335
They appear to be from Washington, DC.

689
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:20,844
And he-he said,

690
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,746
"They told us that we are never, ever

691
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,279
"to fly over that hole.

692
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,485
And we are never to discuss it again."

693
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,217
What is that about?

694
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,292
And does that have anything to do

695
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,031
with all these other pieces
that keep emerging

696
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:38,357
that there might be
something archaeological

697
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,263
in Antarctica?

698
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,167
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

699
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,669
this was not the first time
a massive hole has been spotted

700
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:50,673
in the ice of Antarctica.

701
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,506
Famous polar explorer

702
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:53,511
Admiral Richard Byrd

703
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,382
allegedly reported

704
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,450
seeing a massive entrance
to an underground world

705
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:03,320
during his 1947 expedition
to the South Pole.

706
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:07,222
Admiral Byrd made
a lot of unusual statements,

707
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,725
allegedly talking about a large
opening at the South Pole,

708
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,400
that went deep inside
the Earth, ice-free,

709
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,670
and was inhabited

710
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:22,039
by various sorts of aliens.

711
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,510
And when Byrd got back
to the United States,

712
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,609
he was brought back to Washington,

713
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:30,251
where he was questioned very
heavily about his statements.

714
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:35,148
And, allegedly, he was told
to stop talking about this.

715
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,593
You have to wonder, is the South Pole

716
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:41,589
some kind
of extraterrestrial entry zone,

717
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,530
some kind of portal that's so important

718
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:48,359
that it has to be controlled
by the military?

719
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:52,067
Is the United States
government covering up

720
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,770
an extraterrestrial presence
in Antarctica?

721
00:37:55,874 --> 00:38:00,214
And if so, could they be
the same otherworldly beings

722
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:04,512
that once occupied the continent
thousands of years ago?

723
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,816
Ancient astronaut theorists believe

724
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,818
the truth may be revealed

725
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,190
when Antarctica's ice
finally disappears.

726
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:20,474
East Antarctica.

727
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:24,313
October, 2015.

728
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:26,641
Scientists at NASA announce

729
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:29,946
that despite years
of thinking otherwise,

730
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,680
they are now finding
that the ice in this region

731
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:34,692
is actually growing,

732
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:38,318
averaging 82 billion tons a year.

733
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:42,525
Snowfall is currently adding ice
to most of the continent.

734
00:38:42,629 --> 00:38:46,929
But at the same time,
glaciers are rapidly melting

735
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,773
along the coast of Western Antarctica.

736
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,640
Scientists calculate that, since 2009,

737
00:38:54,741 --> 00:38:57,581
as much as 60 cubic kilometers of ice,

738
00:38:57,677 --> 00:39:01,477
the equivalent of
70,000 Empire State Buildings,

739
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:05,151
is disappearing into the ocean
each year.

740
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:07,521
But why is the ice here melting,

741
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,590
when it is growing throughout much

742
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:12,889
of the rest of the continent?

743
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:17,232
We see the graphic
pictures on television

744
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:21,970
of the ice caps melting
and falling into the sea.

745
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:25,365
But it's actually only in some areas

746
00:39:25,438 --> 00:39:28,208
that the ice caps are actually melting.

747
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:30,538
What's so strange is that,

748
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:35,883
through various factors,
that the ice in Antarctica

749
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:38,722
might actually be growing and extending.

750
00:39:38,818 --> 00:39:41,888
This is very strange.

751
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:44,288
We can't rule out the possibility

752
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,560
that, in certain cases,
there could be entire cities

753
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:50,231
that are built underground

754
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,300
that may even be actively maintained

755
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:54,028
by extraterrestrials now,

756
00:39:54,134 --> 00:39:56,534
and that as those cities are powered up

757
00:39:56,636 --> 00:40:01,306
or expanded in size that they
are giving off some kind of heat

758
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:05,807
and that heat, in turn,
is melting the ice above them.

759
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:10,552
If there are things buried under
the miles of ice at Antarctica,

760
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,780
then that would mean
that had to have happened

761
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:14,746
before the last Ice Age.

762
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:16,894
So who knows what we'll find there?

763
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,390
Remnants of a lost civilization,

764
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:23,762
perhaps even tools with which
these civilizations were built.

765
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:29,572
It's possible that underneath
the ice will be keys for us

766
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:32,539
to actually save ourselves

767
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,639
and reclaim our ancient past.

768
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:38,082
We may end up in a situation

769
00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:40,478
where this can't be covered up anymore,

770
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,410
where visible ruins-- gigantic pyramids,

771
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:44,976
gigantic obelisks--

772
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:48,994
start to peek through the ice.

773
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:51,088
And, at that point, it's game over.

774
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,591
No longer can this be swept
under the rug.

775
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:57,603
There's no question that
under the ice of Antarctica

776
00:40:57,697 --> 00:41:00,097
there could be extraterrestrial craft.

777
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,470
There could be cities down there.

778
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:04,399
Bottom line is,

779
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:08,214
it will shock the entire
belief system of humankind.

780
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:11,608
It will just change everything we know.

781
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:14,781
What really lies beneath

782
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:17,681
the ice and snow in Antarctica?

783
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:23,024
Was this frozen continent once
covered with lush vegetation,

784
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:27,862
as well as pyramids
that predate those in Egypt?

785
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:32,531
And if extraterrestrials
truly did inhabit Antarctica,

786
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:34,872
could these otherworldly visitors

787
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:38,498
still be hiding out there today?

788
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:41,135
Perhaps, one day soon,

789
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:44,511
we will discover what the ice
of Antarctica

790
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:47,141
has hidden for thousands of years,

791
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:50,847
and it will finally expose the truth

792
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:54,124
about our alien past.

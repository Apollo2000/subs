1
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:07,162
To the dread rattling thunder,
have I given fire

2
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:11,086
and rifted Jove's stout oak with his own bolt.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:16,525
The strong-based promontory
have I made shake.

4
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:21,081
And by the spurs
plucked up the pine and cedar.

5
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:27,923
Graves at my command
have waked their sleepers.

6
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:34,530
Op'd and let 'em forth by my so potent art.

7
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:40,041
Here's one. What would you rather be?

8
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:42,923
Is now the best time to do this?

9
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,652
Right. Would you rather be you,

10
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:50,884
with your face and your legs
and the brain of a chimpanzee...

11
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:52,371
Brilliant.

12
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,967
...or would you rather be a chimpanzee,
but with your brain?

13
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:58,245
I can't answer that.

14
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:01,483
It's too inane, even for you.
That's the worst one yet.

15
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:06,685
...and deeper than did ever plummet sound.

16
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,681
I'll drown my book.

17
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,683
And cut!

18
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:15,124
Good. Very good.

19
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,487
Patrick, happy?

20
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,169
Okay, so we're...

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:33,800
Oh, for...

23
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:36,721
- All right?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,450
- Now that is acting.
- Yeah, I know what acting is, Greg.

25
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:43,806
Well, you know what watching acting is.

26
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:47,202
Actually, you can watch me later.
I've got a line.

27
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:52,084
"All's lost. To prayer, to prayer, all's lost."

28
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,969
- That's embarrassing.
- You don't know what it means, do you?

29
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,121
- Not the way you did it, no.
- But you don't know what it means?

30
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,566
- I don't care what it means so...
- You've no idea?

31
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:02,723
No, because while you were at school
swotting up on Shakespeare,

32
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:04,529
I was out living a real life, shagging birds.

33
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:06,920
You told me you didn't have sex
till you were 22.

34
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,842
- Why are you joining in?
- Interesting.

35
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,125
No, it's not.

36
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:12,725
You said your mum
wouldn't let you bring girls home.

37
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,722
- Why are you still joining in?
- The plot thickens.

38
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:17,564
The plot doesn't thicken
because I could have been lying to her.

39
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,289
- Calm down!
- Lf you were lying,

40
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:23,330
why did you say that you lost your virginity
to a woman that looked like Ronnie Corbett?

41
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:26,164
And it's good night from me.

42
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,442
- Rubbish.
- I've got to go. That's great. Good luck.

43
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:34,240
I hope you have better luck with the acting
than you clearly have had with the ladies.

44
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:35,764
You don't know anything.

45
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,682
- See you later.
- Bye.

46
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,529
I'd love to show him.

47
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:42,806
Don't worry.
You will get off with another woman.

48
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:45,724
I mean my acting career!
I get off with birds all the time.

49
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,244
Sorry.

50
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:49,606
Why did you tell him
about the Ronnie Corbett woman?

51
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:50,806
I don't know.

52
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,684
Enter.

53
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:08,286
Oh, hi. I'm probably going to get fired
for even being here.

54
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:12,683
I'm an extra in this, but I'm an actor, really.

55
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:16,206
And, well, I'm desperate
and as I said, I'm really sorry but...

56
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,884
Oh, come on, don't apologise. Sit down.

57
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,201
You're hustling. Acting is a noble
profession but it's a tough one.

58
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,406
So how are you getting yourself out there?

59
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,766
Well, I'm just getting my face around
in anything I can,

60
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,286
but, you know, I suppose I'm networking,
but I've written a script.

61
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,964
You see, writing, you see, that's the key.

62
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,803
- I'm writing myself at the moment.
- Right.

63
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,849
You see, as actors,
the only choice we have is yes or no.

64
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,162
Whereas if you're writing your own material,
you're creating your own opportunities.

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,888
Well, this is my thinking, yes.

66
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,847
I'm writing this screenplay

67
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,764
and I find the whole process
absolutely exhilarating.

68
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,205
What's yours about,
if you don't mind me asking?

69
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,962
How best to explain it?

70
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,722
- You've seen me in X-Men?
- Yes.

71
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,960
The character I am, Professor Charles Xavier,

72
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,089
if you remember, he can control things
with the power of his mind.

73
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,286
- Yes.
- Make people do things and see things.

74
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,487
So I thought,
"What if you could do that for real?"

75
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,448
I mean, not in a comic book world
but in the real world.

76
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,203
- Oh, right.
- So in my film I play a man

77
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,283
- who controls the world with his mind.
- Right. That's interesting.

78
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,443
Yes. For instance, I'm walking along
and I see this beautiful girl

79
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,886
and I think I'd like to see her naked
and so all her clothes fall off.

80
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,522
All her clothes fall off?

81
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,602
Hm. Yes, and she's scrabbling around
to get them back on again

82
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,966
but even before she can get her knickers on,
I've seen everything.

83
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,006
You know, I've seen it all.

84
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,966
- Okay. It's a comedy, is it?
- No.

85
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,360
It's about what would happen
if these things were possible.

86
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,647
- What's the story, though? What's the...
- Well, I do other stuff.

87
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,483
Like, I'm riding my bike in the park
and this policewoman says,

88
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,721
"Oi! You can't ride your bike on the grass,"
and I go, "Oh, no?"

89
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,528
And her uniform falls off.

90
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,920
And she goes, "Ah!" and she's trying
to cover up but I've seen everything.

91
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,049
Anyway, and I get on my bike, I ride off.
On the grass.

92
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,521
So, it's mainly you sort of going around
seeing ladies' tits.

93
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,799
Mainly.

94
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,848
And I do other stuff like,
I go to the World Cup Final

95
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,320
and it's Germany versus England
and I wish that I were playing.

96
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,765
And suddenly I am
and I score the winning goal.

97
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,080
They carry me into the dressing room
and there's Rooney and Beckham

98
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,729
- and then Posh Spice walks in and...
- Her clothes fall off?

99
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,037
- Instantly.
- Sure.

100
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,120
- She doesn't know what's happening.
- No.

101
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,279
- But I've seen...
- Seen everything.

102
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,882
Again.

103
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,882
Good. Is there a narrative at all?
Is there like a story in the film or is it just...

104
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:45,440
- Well, I'm a sort of James Bond figure.
- Right.

105
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,965
And I have to go to Iraq
to rescue these hostages.

106
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,359
And I get there and I rescue them,
but they're all women.

107
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,327
And they're naked
because their clothes had rotted off.

108
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:59,004
But I get them into the helicopter
and I'm flying the helicopter,

109
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,399
but I can still sneak a look in the mirror
and I can see everything.

110
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:05,083
You know, one of them is bending over,
two of them are kissing.

111
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,127
- They've turned lesbian?
- Because they'd been in the camp so long.

112
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:11,758
It can happen. Well, good luck with that.
I've just written a sitcom,

113
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,761
but I wonder if you could give it
to anyone you know, you know.

114
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:16,248
- Yes.
- In film or TV...

115
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,160
- Is there any nudity in it?
- Any...

116
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,046
- Any nudity in it?
- Not really.

117
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,359
- Oh.
- Well, there could be.

118
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,802
Men or women?

119
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,967
- Either.
- Oh.

120
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,801
Well, just women.

121
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,924
- Right.
- I'd need to rewrite, but...

122
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,604
in the meantime, if you could give it
to anyone in TV or film or...

123
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:37,157
Yes, definitely. I will make it so.

124
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,558
You've seen Star Trek: The Next Generation?

125
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,039
- I haven't, no.
- Your wife won't let you have it on?

126
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,720
- I'm not married.
- Oh. Your girlfriend, then?

127
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,198
I have no girlfriend. I live alone.

128
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,043
You're not married, you haven't got
a girlfriend and you don't watch Star Trek?

129
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,687
No.

130
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,568
Good Lord.

131
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,680
You're probably wondering why
I called you in for an unscheduled meeting.

132
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:09,523
- Got the wrong day?
- No, not at all, no. These are exciting times.

133
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:10,928
I know you've been busy.

134
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,365
I've been busy as well generating
a lot of heat about your sitcom script.

135
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:15,677
- Really?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,966
Took the liberty of sending the script to
a production company, Picard Productions.

137
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:23,406
They sent it to the BBC comedy department,
who got in touch, and there's a lot of buzz.

138
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:25,081
What, the BBC have called you?

139
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,887
Yeah. They just say, "We love the script.

140
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,279
"We'd like to get you in and
have a meeting, a chat and brainstorm."

141
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:33,281
- Brilliant. Who's the production company?
- You wouldn't have heard of them.

142
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,247
A little company called Picard Productions
set up by Patrick Stewart. I sent it to them...

143
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:40,047
- You sent it to Patrick Stewart?
- "This is dynamite stuff..."

144
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,720
- Recently?
- About two months ago.

145
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,766
No, you didn't. I gave it to him on set.

146
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,367
Even if I haven't done anything
towards this...

147
00:07:57,448 --> 00:08:00,599
please can I still have
my twelve-and-a-half percent?

148
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,201
Please.

149
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:07,208
- Yeah, why not?
- Yeah? Thank you.

150
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:10,124
I mean, that's sort of the way it's done so...

151
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,597
Have you thought about
who could play the main character?

152
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,644
- I'm playing the main character.
- Really? Are you sure?

153
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,437
You're a bit of a nobody. I'm not sure
they'd cast a nobody in the main role.

154
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:20,246
Well, we'd insist.

155
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:22,888
I think the obvious choice
is right under your nose. Barry.

156
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,528
Yeah. No offence, Shaun.
I'm playing the lead character.

157
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,405
Are you sure 'cause he's really versatile?

158
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,718
- I'm sure he is.
- I'm not sure what it is you can do.

159
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,686
Barry can do all sorts. Do your serious.

160
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:35,726
You do love me, Janine, you do.
I know you do.

161
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,845
- Yeah. Do your comical.
- Pat, you've trodden on my foot! Get off!

162
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,964
- He's a singer as well.
- # Mustang Sally #

163
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:44,085
- Loud, isn't it?
- He did a gig once without a microphone.

164
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:45,601
There wasn't a microphone there.

165
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,883
He turned up for this gig,
there was no PA system, nothing.

166
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:49,765
- Tell him.
- They were going to cancel the gig.

167
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:51,964
I said, "You're having a laugh!
I don't need a microphone.

168
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,243
- "Microphones are for wimps."
- He said microphones are for wimps.

169
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:57,445
I belted it out, just like that,
in front of what, 140-odd people.

170
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:59,962
And they were really spread out
because it was a thousand-seater venue.

171
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,482
Lot of empty seats, didn't faze him,
just went for it. Go on, do it.

172
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:05,366
# All you want to do is ride around Sally #

173
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:08,201
- Sing it with me now!
- # Ride, Sally, ride #

174
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:10,563
- What are you doing?
- Just having a little sing-song.

175
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:13,526
I'm doing the lead in this, okay?
I'm playing the lead character.

176
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,485
That's it, I don't want to discuss it.

177
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,967
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

178
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:19,926
I don't know...
You've never struck me as a funny bloke.

179
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,361
Sorry?

180
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:24,167
You always come in here
and you're really negative and a bit...

181
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,761
Doesn't that tell you something?

182
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,316
I know what you're saying but
I don't get Barry any work and he's happy.

183
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:30,364
- Not entirely happy.
- Calm down, mate.

184
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:33,838
Giving it all this in front of a client. If you've
got an issue, have a meeting with me.

185
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:37,125
You've been hanging around with him
too much, giving it this.

186
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,727
- Hi, hello.
- Hi.

187
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:51,243
- Lain Morris, Head of New Comedy.
- I'm Andy. This is my agent.

188
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:54,247
- Darren Lamb. Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Nice to meet you. Good.

189
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,363
- Okay, well, take a seat.
- Thank you.

190
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,560
Okay, we're just waiting for one more person.

191
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,684
I want you to meet Damon Beesley.
He's a producer here,

192
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,964
but he's also a great writer
and he's a script editor and I'd like to...

193
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,677
Room for a small one? Cheeky,
you started without me. Not for the first time.

194
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:21,076
What's he been saying? It's all lies.

195
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,203
Lucky for you, I haven't said anything at all.

196
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,766
- Andy, this is Damon.
- Hi.

197
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:28,635
Oh, bloody hell, we're not worthy,
we're not worthy.

198
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,195
Je t'aime your script. I wet myself laughing.

199
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:34,120
At last, some real talent at the BBC.

200
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,084
- Cheers.
- He's happy.

201
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,441
Where are we?

202
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:40,325
I just wanted to find out
where you see this project going.

203
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,999
- BBC 1.
- No, I don't actually.

204
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:43,805
- BBC 3?
- No, BBC 2.

205
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:46,355
I think that's just really good for comedy.

206
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,961
I think if you come up
with a new project on BBC 1,

207
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,481
you've got to really water it down,
you know?

208
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,842
- I don't want a laughter track.
- No laughs.

209
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:56,122
- There'll be laughs.
- There'll be big laughs.

210
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,767
But I just want it to be...

211
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:01,725
I don't want it to be a comedy
aimed at people without a sense of humour.

212
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:03,923
I want people to be able to think about it.

213
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:06,601
I don't want it filmed in front
of a live studio audience.

214
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:09,679
Unless you guys disagree with that,
in which case we can change all that.

215
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,598
- Just do whatever you want to do.
- No.

216
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,643
No, there's no need to do that.

217
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:16,878
What I would say, though,
is because this is your first project,

218
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,481
I would like you to initially write
with someone else.

219
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,205
- He will write with anyone.
- I won't.

220
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,199
He will not write with anyone,
that's a deal breaker.

221
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,323
No. I'd like to write it myself

222
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,877
just because it's based on
my own experiences, really.

223
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,845
The character is based on a boss
I used to work for.

224
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:35,646
And I just generally think
the best things are auteured.

225
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,480
Turd?

226
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:41,722
No?

227
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,727
All right, I'm happy for you
to write it yourself

228
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,924
but I would feel happier getting Damon
just to work with you as script editor.

229
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,794
Someone to bounce ideas off, just tidy up
the first script. I think it's a bit flabby.

230
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:56,764
Yeah, it's just a bag of ideas at the moment,
but yeah, fine.

231
00:11:56,846 --> 00:12:01,522
I think the best thing to move this forward
is to get you two together in a little room.

232
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:03,597
- Oh!
- Shh!

233
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:07,522
Inappropriate at a meeting at the BBC, that.

234
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:09,915
- Okay, that would be great.
- Okay.

235
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:13,760
Okay, let's talk cash because,
as you know, this script is piping hot.

236
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,644
- So we're looking for big bucks.
- We don't need to talk cash now.

237
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:18,557
We need to talk a little bit about cash.

238
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:22,275
Just get some money up front for,
you know, supplies, pencils.

239
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,244
- I could probably find you a computer.
- You happy with a computer?

240
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:27,601
- Yes.
- He's happy with that. We'll go with that.

241
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:28,880
Okay, good.

242
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,445
- You sure you're happy?
- Yes.

243
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,039
- Thanks.
- Great.

244
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,401
- Thank you very much.
- Nice to meet you.

245
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:45,959
# Celebrate good times, come on #

246
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:48,640
Did you get it? Oh, brilliant.

247
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,398
- Oh, well done!
- Oh, yes.

248
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:51,760
Someone's celebrating.

249
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:54,804
What, a wealthy old relative
popped her clogs, has she?

250
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,604
No. So why am I celebrating?

251
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,723
Could be because of the TV show
the BBC have just given me.

252
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:02,604
- TV show?
- Yeah, pilot for a sitcom. So...

253
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:05,041
- What sitcom?
- The sitcom I wrote.

254
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:08,038
- You're not funny.
- Well, the BBC beg to differ.

255
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:11,835
- What's it about?
- It's about my old boss I used to work for.

256
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,200
Write about what you know.

257
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:18,235
I'd just like to say I've got something for you,
just to say thanks for all the great times.

258
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:21,363
Just a few crumbs from the table.
Share the wealth.

259
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:24,085
I am devastated, really,
to be leaving you lot behind.

260
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,396
We've had such great...
Especially you, Julie.

261
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,875
- Lucy.
- Whatever. Shouldn't you be in costume?

262
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,843
- I am in costume.
- Yeah?

263
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,759
Why did we never...
And you, will you please call me?

264
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:37,276
- I haven't got your number.
- Yeah, 079...

265
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,800
- 07 what?
- Listen up. 0793334...

266
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,561
All the threes, put them all in otherwise
it doesn't work. And in a particular order.

267
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,079
- Get it off Julie...
- Lucy.

268
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,565
- Whatever.
- I haven't got your number.

269
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:48,364
- I'll text it to you.
- You haven't got my number.

270
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:51,040
I know, but I'll work it out.
Then we'll all have it, won't we?

271
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:54,835
Then we can arrange the camping trip
we've always talked about.

272
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:57,121
- Anyway, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

273
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,878
See you later, man.

274
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:02,799
You all right? You look a bit pale.
Could you get some rouge for Greg?

275
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,115
- I'm fine.
- You all right? You look a bit sick.

276
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:37,642
I think structurally,
we're all higgledy-piggledy-pew

277
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:41,559
and I think we can get to the boss coming in
quicker and set him up straight away.

278
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:45,320
Well, we could start with him actually
walking in to work, in the first scene.

279
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,760
He just actually comes in
and that's when you see him.

280
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,520
The real Ray used to come in to work
every day without fail.

281
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:53,561
He'd just walk up to someone
and say something like,

282
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,954
"Have you done those invoices?"
And they'd go, "No."

283
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:59,435
And he'd go, "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

284
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:05,394
Brilliant. We're having that.
That's super, that's funny. Do it again.

285
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,874
That's what he used to do,
just go up to someone

286
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:11,878
and go every time, "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

287
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:14,601
That's great. That will be a catchphrase.

288
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:17,119
- I'm not sure about catchphrases.
- No, it'll be great.

289
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:20,356
People can say it. "Is he having a laugh?
Are you having a laugh?"

290
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:23,323
- I just think catchphrases are too easy.
- Are you having a laugh?

291
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,396
I think it could get a little bit
annoying after a while.

292
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:28,682
Do you fancy a coffee?
I haven't had one in about 20 minutes.

293
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:31,404
Shall I get one from upstairs
or do you fancy one from Costa's?

294
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:34,158
- It might take me a bit longer.
- That one, then.

295
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:36,713
Are you having a laugh?

296
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:40,480
- Oh, hello. Can we help?
- Hi. It's my friend Maggie. Come in.

297
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,920
- This is Damon.
- Oh, you cow, I love your bag.

298
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,154
Oh, thank you.

299
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,281
I'm just off on a cappuccino run,
do you want one?

300
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:48,674
No, it's fine. I'm just here for a wee minute.

301
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:51,757
Okay, well, lovely to meet you.
See you again, hopefully.

302
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:53,324
- Bye for now.
- Bye.

303
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:55,680
Oi, Bowker, you poofter!

304
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:58,359
- Welcome to our world.
- Look at you.

305
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:01,198
- Take a seat. Take a letter.
- I will.

306
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,923
- Are you well?
- Yeah, well, you know. Got my health.

307
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:08,605
- But listen, how's it going here?
- He's doing my head in.

308
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,083
- Who?
- Who?

309
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:13,440
Who? Who do you...
The owner of this monstrosity.

310
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:17,876
Quentin Crisp who just skipped down
the corridor going, "I want a cappuccino."

311
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:20,603
Oh, he's too gay, he's too gay.

312
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:24,074
- What do you mean?
- No one needs to be that gay.

313
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:26,758
- What do you mean he's too gay?
- He's a clichי of a gay.

314
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:31,315
If I was doing Give us A Clue and
the clue came up "A gay bloke", I'd do him.

315
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:34,999
- Unbelievable.
- Well, that's just a wee bit homophobic.

316
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:38,918
It's not homophobic.
No, I don't care how much arse sex he has.

317
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:41,279
But why does he have to be that camp?

318
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,594
Screaming and clapping.
When does that happen?

319
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:46,960
When do you suddenly think,
"Well, I prefer a nice little saveloy

320
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:50,514
"to a battered cod
so I'd better walk like this."

321
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,879
- I liked him.
- Of course you do.

322
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:56,513
- Women like you love the gays.
- What do you mean, women like me?

323
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,799
Wrong side of 30, six out of ten for looks.

324
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,352
You've got someone to go to the disco with,
haven't you?

325
00:17:01,444 --> 00:17:04,356
And you walk in with him and you go,
"No, I'm not sharking, I've got a bloke."

326
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:08,357
But if a bloke comes up that you fancy,
you go, "Oh, him? He's just my gay friend."

327
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,833
- Perfect. It's a safety net.
- Six out of ten.

328
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:14,121
- Yeah.
- Is that all I get? Six out of ten?

329
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:17,162
- I don't know...
- Look me in the eye and say six out of ten.

330
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,394
Shall I look you in your wonky eye
or your good eye?

331
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:22,556
I have got one eye a wee bit higher up
than the other one.

332
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:27,203
- See you.
- Bye.

333
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:30,117
I was going to ask you,
how are you getting on with Andy?

334
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:33,480
He's lovely, isn't he?
He's very talented. Very funny script.

335
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:35,714
You've not run into
any of his funny little ways?

336
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,682
- No.
- Well, he can be quite odd sometimes.

337
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:41,437
I just wanted to let you know
that he is like that with everybody.

338
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:44,880
- How do you mean?
- Well, like noise.

339
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,875
He's got this thing about noise.

340
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,114
Like, I've seen him at a restaurant,
somebody at the table nearby

341
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:52,355
is cutting their meat too loudly and
he's getting himself all annoyed about it.

342
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:55,277
Oh, note to self. Cut meat quietly.

343
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:58,993
Yes. And you might find you might want
to just tone it down a little bit.

344
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:03,236
- Tone what down?
- Well, you're quite camp, which is great,

345
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:06,282
but I think maybe sometimes
he thinks you're too gay.

346
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:08,637
Did he say that?

347
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:11,557
Yeah, but I mean, he wasn't being nasty
about it. I just think...

348
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:14,442
Oh, no. I've said the wrong thing.
I shouldn't have, should I?

349
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,719
No, no, I'm fine. I'm glad you told me.

350
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,239
Oh, good. Thank God for that.
I thought I'd put my foot in it by telling...

351
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,836
- Not at all.
- Okay.

352
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:25,233
- Well, it was lovely to meet you.
- Absolutely. Lovely to meet you.

353
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:27,234
- See you again.
- I'll take it on board.

354
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:28,836
Bye.

355
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:39,515
You have one message. Message one.

356
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:44,836
Hello, dear. It's your daddy here, er...
with your mummy.

357
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,279
- Erm... nothing important.
- Oh, give it to me.

358
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:52,561
Hello, dear. Great news about Andy.
We're so pleased for him.

359
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:57,000
And it just got us thinking that maybe you
should try and do something with your life.

360
00:18:57,123 --> 00:19:00,240
I mean, your dad and I aren't expecting
anything spectacular.

361
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:03,201
We were just thinking maybe a wee job
you could be proud of.

362
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:06,673
You know, we love you so much,
we hate to think of you growing old

363
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:10,551
and being poor and living in squalor
and dying a spinster.

364
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,237
So, just give us a call
to put our minds at rest

365
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:16,315
that you're not just frittering your life away,
would you? Okay?

366
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:20,032
And if things get any worse, you can always
come back home. We've still got your room.

367
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:22,034
Well, it's sort of my study now.

368
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:25,160
We could easily squeeze in
a tiny wee single bed.

369
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:27,757
All right then, give us a call, sweetheart.
Bye for now.

370
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,117
Bye dear.

371
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:30,272
Bye.

372
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:39,237
Okay, great. Well, I love the changes.
I think this is looking great. Well done.

373
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:42,315
- Oh, thank you.
- I think we're ready to move things forward.

374
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:46,521
I'd like to shoot a non-broadcast pilot
with a view to making a series.

375
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,276
Oh! Okay, thank you.

376
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:50,876
- All right.
- Brilliant.

377
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:53,602
So, are you happy with the way
things have gone so far?

378
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,719
- Definitely.
- You happy working with Damon?

379
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:59,159
- Definitely.
- No problems with the working relationship?

380
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:01,882
- Nothing you want to discuss?
- No.

381
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,362
Okay.

382
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,718
- I'm not too gay for you, then?
- Damon.

383
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:08,954
I'm sorry. I said I wasn't going to say
anything but he's lying through his teeth.

384
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,795
Excuse me.

385
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:16,474
Your friend, Maggie, is it?
She told him what you said about him.

386
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,031
- What did I say about him?
- That he's too gay.

387
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:24,038
- Oh! No. She's an idiot. She's an idiot.
- So you didn't say that?

388
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:27,959
Yes, but he wasn't meant to hear it.

389
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:32,681
It concerns me if you're so homophobic,
you couldn't work with a gay person...

390
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:35,037
No, no, no, no, I'm not homophobic.

391
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:37,397
In fact, I actually said to her,

392
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:41,561
I said,
"I don't care how much arse sex he has...

393
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:45,681
"he's just too..." What was it?
I can't remember what I said.

394
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:48,910
You're aware that I'm gay?

395
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,321
Didn't...

396
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:55,235
Well, no, you didn't... And you don't make
a song and dance. You don't go,

397
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,233
"Ooh, hello! I'm..."

398
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,438
- No, I didn't.
- I'll stop you there.

399
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,671
Go on.

400
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:03,151
What concerns me is
we've all got to work together

401
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,073
and if this is where we are
when we've only just started,

402
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:07,198
where the hell are we going to be
a month or so down the line?

403
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:10,080
It won't be a problem
because I'll just apologise to Damo.

404
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:13,552
Everyone gets wound up with
the people they work in close proximity with.

405
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:15,519
Little things wind you up,
so it doesn't matter.

406
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:19,311
It's not a case of being straight or gay.
It's my neuroses and I'll just, you know...

407
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:22,121
Do you think you could put your
hang-ups and your neuroses on hold?

408
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:24,272
- Yes.
- He won't be around for long.

409
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,831
- What, AIDS?
- Sorry?

410
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:30,957
Is it AIDS?

411
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,915
No. I mean the pilot
will only take a couple of months.

412
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,515
Oh, yeah.

413
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:38,799
Right. Listen, talk to Damo, I'll talk to him.

414
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:42,961
We'll see where we are and if we feel
we can go forward with this project or not.

415
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:46,239
We can... Okay, I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to him now.

416
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:48,153
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

417
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:51,790
- Okay, I'll go and talk to him.
- All right, bye.

418
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,597
- Hello.
- Hi. Do me a favour. Stay out of my business.

419
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,276
- Andy, what? Come in.
- I may have lost the pilot thanks to you.

420
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:00,511
- Why?
- Why?

421
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,479
Because you stuck your nose in
where it wasn't needed.

422
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:04,996
Telling Damo I thought he was too gay.
What were you thinking?

423
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:07,801
I was thinking that you were stressed
and I just wanted to help you.

424
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:11,716
That's helping me, is it?
I just can't believe your stupidity sometimes.

425
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:14,635
Andy, don't be like this, I can't cope.
I'm having a bad time at the moment.

426
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:16,633
Sorry. What's a bad time for you?

427
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:19,031
Tie-dyed the wrong T-shirt?
You lost a kooky broach?

428
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:22,353
I was just about getting to where I wanted
to be and you may have fucked it up.

429
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,398
- I've been grovelling all day at the BBC.
- What do you mean?

430
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,996
I've got a meeting there at 4:00,
they may pull the plug.

431
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,550
Imagine if they pull the plug, how am I going
to look you in the face again?

432
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,314
- Do you want me to say something?
- You're not listening.

433
00:22:31,402 --> 00:22:34,235
I'm sorry, Andy.
I don't know what you want me to say.

434
00:22:34,322 --> 00:22:36,835
- I was just trying to help you.
- I don't want you to help me anymore.

435
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:40,675
I want you to stop living like a child,
floating through life like everything's okay

436
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,513
until it actually affects someone, okay?

437
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:46,435
So really, my advice to you is,
you've got to grow up.

438
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:52,199
Clean up, just sort your own mess out
before you get involved in my life, really.

439
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:27,436
- Do you want to follow me?
- Yeah.

440
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:35,594
It's unfortunate we've ended up
in this position, Andy.

441
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,876
I'm not going to speak for Damon.

442
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:39,997
Damon, come on.

443
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:42,914
- Well, things were said that were very hurtful.
- Yeah.

444
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,797
But your apology means a lot to me.

445
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:50,272
So, if you're happy to work with me,
then I'd like to carry on working with you.

446
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,272
Definitely. Definitely. Yeah.

447
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:54,317
I'm such a huge fan of this project.

448
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,915
- I'm a big fan of yours, so...
- Great.

449
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:58,434
- Happy?
- Definitely.

450
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,876
- Water under the bridge.
- Wonderful.

451
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:04,831
Okay, let's get some dates sorted
and get the ball rolling on his project.

452
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,799
- Yeah.
- Come on, silly. Huggy Bears.

453
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,120
Now.

454
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,316
Okay?

455
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,595
- Do you want one?
- No.

456
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:17,434
- Just normal? Okay, brilliant. Okay, thanks.
- Yes.

457
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,874
Cheers.

458
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,393
Cut. Great.

459
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,038
Thank you.

460
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,711
- See you.
- See you. That's me done.

461
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,597
- Oh, I'll see you soon.
- Yeah, bye.

462
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,794
Maggie.

463
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,719
- Hi.
- You all right?

464
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,358
Yeah.

465
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,271
- And you?
- Yeah.

466
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,951
Here, look.

467
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,359
Okay, now.

468
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,719
Hello, Maggie.

469
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,234
- Hello.
- This is Patrick Stewart here.

470
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,118
And the reason you're hearing
my rich, sexy voice

471
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,431
is that Andy is not man enough
to apologise himself,

472
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,431
even though he knows he's in the wrong.

473
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,715
That's why he's asked me to do it for him.

474
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,190
Please, look at his fat, expressionless face.
He doesn't mean any of the things he said

475
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,033
and he knows you don't have
a malicious bone in your body

476
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,554
- and were just trying to help.
- Thank you.

477
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,989
If you can find it in your heart to forgive him,

478
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,914
then please... make it so.

479
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,870
Have you seen
Star Trek: The Next Generation?

480
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,719
Er, no, I haven't, actually.

481
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,031
Never mind.
Incidentally, Maggie, are you an actress?

482
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,509
Because I'm writing a film
and I'd love you to be in it.

483
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,909
Okay. No, she can't. Okay, thanks.

484
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,634
Cheers.

485
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,110
- What was that about a film?
- You don't want any part of it, trust me.

486
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,951
- Your hair looks really nice.
- Shut your face.

487
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,600
- What? It does.
- Well, thanks.

488
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,194
- The pilot's fine, by the way.
- Thank God for that.

489
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,389
I just wanted to let you know
that I have taken on board

490
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,597
all that stuff that you were saying
about growing up.

491
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,035
- Oh, don't please, shut up.
- Well, I have.

492
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,190
- Oh, don't.
- Well, you know what I mean.

493
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,430
- Well, I'm mortified.
- No, I know, but you were right.

494
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,432
I wasn't right. You're about the most
grown-up person I know.

495
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,716
- I'm sort of the only person you know.
- You win by default.

496
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,237
Correct.

497
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:00,117
I'm really sorry.

498
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,029
Can you let go of my hand, please?

499
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:10,671
Of course. Aren't my hands lucky? 'Cause
that would ruin everything, wouldn't it?

500
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,592
- He's quite a nice one, though, isn't he?
- He's fine.

501
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,910
I've been working up to saying hello to him
for the last couple of days.

502
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,751
- Sure.
- What do you think?

503
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,192
- You know what I think.
- What?

504
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,190
I think you're a tart.

505
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,951
Go on, then.

506
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,157
- Work your magic.
- Yeah, I will.

507
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,467
I'll see you later, yeah?

508
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,231
- See you.
- See you.

509
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,637
That was quick.

510
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:43,075
I couldn't think of anything witty to say.
He was on the phone anyway.

511
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,951
What would you rather do...

512
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,633
Go on, then.

513
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,755
Wake up and your teeth
have sort of fallen out,

514
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,273
wake up and your hair's fallen out,

515
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,238
or wake up and your toes have fallen off?

516
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,553
Er... what, is my hair gone for good?

517
00:28:02,305 --> 00:29:02,352

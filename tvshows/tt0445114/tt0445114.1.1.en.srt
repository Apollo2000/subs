2
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:18,323
- Why did you do that?
- It's called acting.

3
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:20,481
Why did you have to be quite so rough?

4
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:23,607
Strange, that's what a bird
said to me last night.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,524
25 years old, absolutely gorgeous.

6
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:33,288
We did it five times. Nearly wore me out.

7
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:37,000
By the end of it...
bollocks like a bulldog, I tell you.

8
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,722
Cut! That's good, print that,
move to the next one. Mike.

9
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,962
Richard, that's exactly what I was talking
about with the smoke, thank you.

10
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:50,609
Right. I want to go in tighter, all right.

11
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:52,204
- Did you see me?
- It was brilliant.

12
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,849
You'll get more money for that.

13
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:55,409
- Do I?
- It's a direction, yeah?

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,843
- Yes.
- You get more money.

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,080
- Excellent.
- It's called supplementary performance fee.

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,649
- Talk to the production manager.
- Brilliant.

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,040
- Am I going to sort everyone's life out?
- Here we go.

18
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,724
Talk to the production manager
and you'll get a few extra quid.

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,528
God knows you could do with it.

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,728
- These aren't my clothes.
- You could have fooled me.

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,761
Hey, guys.
Guys, people, can we gather around, please?

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,203
Guys.

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,769
This is Goran,
this is the man whose story we're making.

24
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,327
Okay, he's the reason we're gathered here,
to share his story with the world.

25
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,127
A lot of you might be thinking
why am I making this movie.

26
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,920
Sure, you guys look at me as one of
the world's most successful comedy actors.

27
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,649
What does that mean?

28
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:59,200
I mean, yeah, I make Along Came Polly
and it opens to $32 million.

29
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,919
One of the biggest Martin Luther King Junior
birthday holiday opening weekends ever.

30
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,079
Goes on to gross 170 million worldwide.

31
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:07,000
Meet the Parents, double that.

32
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:12,642
But what does the money and the success
mean in real terms?

33
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:16,519
If I find a little orphan child in a war zone...

34
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,321
hiding in a burnt out building,

35
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,527
his parents murdered,
persecuted for his race,

36
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:25,964
his religion, what am I going to do?

37
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,045
Pop on Dodgeball on DVD?

38
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,402
It's a funny film.

39
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,923
Thanks and I can put on Dodgeball

40
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,002
and he's going to laugh for an hour
and 32 minutes.

41
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,082
You know, escape reality for a while,
but what happens when the film finishes?

42
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,961
Back to reality.

43
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,121
Still an orphan, still living with fear.

44
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,926
How do I help him, hm?

45
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:50,559
Put on Dodgeball again?

46
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:54,164
Sure he's going to laugh again,
he'll see things he didn't see the first time,

47
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,481
it's layered, it was made like that,
but this can't go on indefinitely, all right?

48
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,357
At a certain point, you know, after the fifth,
sixth, seventh viewing,

49
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,645
he's still laughing,

50
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:09,040
but it's not getting
to the root of the problem, okay?

51
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,238
How do I help him?

52
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,117
Make Dodgeball 2?

53
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,165
Make this movie.

54
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:19,366
Make people think. Change attitudes.

55
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,321
So, think on that
while you're sipping on your frappuccinos.

56
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:27,958
- And what are we doing? Mike?
- Let's have a break.

57
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,721
Break time, okay, good.
Thank you, thank you very much.

58
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:33,276
Thanks, everyone.
Back at quarter past, thank you.

59
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,840
And I want you to just be coming
straight in, without...

60
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,840
There shouldn't be a delay
between when the grenade has gone off

61
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,759
and when you guys come around.

62
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:55,363
Ben, is it possible, please, more smoke?

63
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:57,119
- Was there more smoke?
- Yes.

64
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:59,676
Okay, can I get more smoke, please!

65
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,441
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

66
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:04,521
All right, guys, now while
we have the smoke, can you come around...

67
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,280
- Also...
...charging right... Yeah.

68
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,438
The Coke, it's not cold.

69
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:11,998
Sorry, okay,
just kill the smoke for a second. What?

70
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:13,646
My Coke is not cold.

71
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:15,319
- Your Coke's not cold?
- No.

72
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:17,682
- Okay, all right. Mike?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:20,881
Can we get him a cold Coke? Okay?

74
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,158
Make sure his Coke is always cold, okay.

75
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:25,318
Look at that, he gets anything he wants.

76
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,638
I know,
but he's been through a lot, hasn't he?

77
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:29,286
I know he's been through a lot,

78
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,961
but they're making a film,
he's not a competition winner.

79
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,878
That's where the real power lies here.

80
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:38,359
- I think he's quite attractive actually.
- Forget it, I know what you're thinking.

81
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:40,962
Never get involved with a man
whose wife's been murdered.

82
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,527
That's awful. Why?

83
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,997
Well, for one,
he's not going to be a barrel of laughs.

84
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:48,636
Two, you can't compete with her. It's not
like the marriage started going downhill

85
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:51,241
and she was boozing and sleeping around,
do you know what I mean?

86
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,238
She was taken from him
at the peak of their love.

87
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:57,036
She's gone out on a high,
she's like Marilyn Monroe or Jimmy Dean,

88
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:00,483
Never get involved with a man
whose wife's been murdered. Rule one.

89
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:02,559
Choose someone else.

90
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,718
Well, who then?

91
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:06,684
It's as easy as that, isn't it, to you?

92
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:12,206
Yeah come in, just one second.

93
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:14,596
I think maybe I'm owed some money.

94
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:17,326
Some supplementary performance money
or something, I think?

95
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,841
Right, give me one second.

96
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,397
Hi.

97
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:25,522
Hi.

98
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,245
How can I help?

99
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,684
Yes, the thing, the supplementary acting fee.

100
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,406
Right, I'll have to check
with the first AD really.

101
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:36,047
- Let me get your details up.
- Okay.

102
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,402
- What's your name?
- Maggie Jacobs.

103
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,954
- Just take a seat, Maggie.
- Thank you.

104
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:55,997
I hope your wife doesn't catch me
on your sofa.

105
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:57,485
Or your girlfriend.

106
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,602
- I'm not married.
- Or your girlfriend.

107
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:02,116
I haven't got a girlfriend.

108
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:05,565
- Or I suppose your boyfriend.
- I'm not gay.

109
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:09,207
I should be worried
your husband catches you in here.

110
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,757
I'm not married and I don't have a boyfriend
and I'm not a lesbian.

111
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:14,882
I'm all done, available.

112
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,040
Hello.

113
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:32,994
Erm, you get on well with Ben.

114
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:36,442
I wondered if you could sort of, like,
have a word with him about me

115
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:40,445
because I'm a proper actor,
I'm an extra in this but I've done, you know...

116
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,243
lines...

117
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:44,759
You okay?

118
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:47,241
Yeah.

119
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,885
What you got there?

120
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:51,355
My wife, pictures of my wife.

121
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,277
I heard about that, yeah, sorry.

122
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:58,438
- Memories. Wonderful love.
- Yeah.

123
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,475
This is her, very beautiful.

124
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,760
She is.

125
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:06,998
Our first holiday.
Here she is with my son, one year old.

126
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:09,316
- Nice boy.
- Nice no more.

127
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:11,681
Dead. Dead boy.

128
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:18,078
My wife again.

129
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,521
Oh, I shouldn't look at that.
Was she sunbathing?

130
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,836
No, she is dead.

131
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,075
- Lying in the street.
- Oh, I see now.

132
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:26,883
- Dead.
- Yeah, yes.

133
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:32,323
- Why did you take...
- Why did I take photograph of her?

134
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:34,999
To show the world what must be shown.

135
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,805
This is why I want film to be made
by Ben Stiller.

136
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:39,444
Ben Stiller of Zoolander, sure.

137
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,402
You look. Dead, naked.

138
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:42,600
- Yeah.
- You look.

139
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:45,836
I am, but I'm only looking
at her dead naked face.

140
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,841
Where did you get these developed?

141
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:52,278
My cousin.

142
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:55,722
I was going to say, it's not the sort of thing
you pop into Boots with.

143
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:56,841
Boots?

144
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:01,282
Oh, it's a chain of chemists,
high street pharmacy.

145
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:04,198
They don't just do pharmacy now,
they do everything.

146
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:08,835
They do gifts, sandwiches,
weight watchers, smoothies, things like that.

147
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:11,315
We don't have Boots.

148
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:15,518
You missed a trick. True Print give you a
free film when you get something developed.

149
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,197
So you're a mug.

150
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:21,358
Anyway, if you could put a word in to Ben
to get me a line...

151
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:25,397
in this...

152
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:33,324
I'll catch you later.

153
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:41,124
He's got photos and everything.

154
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,274
- That's not going to help, is it?
- No.

155
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:46,515
What worries me is I can't push it,
can't go up to him and remind him,

156
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:50,074
"Sorry to interrupt you again when you're
thinking of your slaughtered loved ones

157
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:53,282
"but that line, have you done anything
about it?" Do you know what I mean?

158
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,925
Might seem a wee bit insensitive, eh?

159
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,961
Yeah, it could do.

160
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:01,002
- Oh, be warned, Jackie Greer's on the prowl.
- Why?

161
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,598
- She's having a birthday do.
- Forget it, I'm not going.

162
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:05,960
- I'm not going if you're not going.
- Don't go, then.

163
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,956
No, but I can't not go
because she's always really nice to me.

164
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,717
- Well, have an excuse ready.
- Like what?

165
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:15,801
My standard is,
"Oh, my sister's coming down to stay."

166
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:18,478
I find out exactly when it is, though.
I go, "When is it?"

167
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,043
"This Saturday."
"This Saturday?

168
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:22,115
"I can't, my sister's coming down."

169
00:09:22,204 --> 00:09:24,480
You're gutted,
you'd loved to have gone but family...

170
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:29,433
Oh, hello, you two.
I like your hair like that. Isn't she beautiful?

171
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:32,039
Now listen up, no excuses.

172
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:36,481
My birthday this week, I'm having
birthday drinks. I'm 21 again.

173
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:40,753
And I command you both to be there
and I won't take no for an answer.

174
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:41,913
Okay.

175
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,359
- My sister's...
- When is it?

176
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:48,153
- When is it?
- Friday, after we wrap. It's only local.

177
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:49,637
- This Friday?
- This Friday?

178
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:50,712
Yeah, Friday.

179
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,796
Oh, no, I can't do this Friday,
my sister is coming down.

180
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:57,922
Well, bring her along, I'd love to meet her.

181
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,436
Okay, I'll bring her along.

182
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,276
- Well, you can't bring her along.
- No.

183
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:06,195
- You can't actually physically bring...
- Why?

184
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:10,037
You haven't got a sister, you're confused.
My sister's coming down.

185
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:11,397
I just got confused.

186
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:13,314
- So you can come?
- Yes, I can come.

187
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:16,680
- And you, darling?
- As she said, my sister's coming down, so...

188
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:18,595
And as I said, bring her along.

189
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,323
But what she didn't say was
she's coming down because she's ill.

190
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,632
Oh, brilliant.

191
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:25,283
- God, is it serious?
- We're not sure.

192
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,797
- Well, send her my love.
- I will.

193
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:29,879
- But I will see you there?
- Definitely.

194
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,272
- Yes, I've got no excuses.
- Yeah.

195
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:35,403
See you later.
Bye.

196
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:36,962
Brilliant.

197
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:39,160
- Oh, my God, you're coming.
- No, I'm not.

198
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:42,474
I've got to be punished because you
didn't think on your feet quickly enough?

199
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:45,031
- I can't go on my own.
- I can't go at all.

200
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:47,796
- What if my sister died?
- What's she got?

201
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:51,518
I haven't got a sister.

202
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,720
- You haven't got a sister?
- No, I made it up, an excuse.

203
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,479
Reading a little magazine there, are you?

204
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,519
- Yes.
- Do you understand it?

205
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,682
Would you rather have all your food
too salty or too sweet?

206
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,038
Doesn't matter if it's too anything.
It's rubbish, isn't it?

207
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,761
You see, I would have too salty.

208
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:09,436
No, it'd be rubbish.
If it's too salty, it'd be rubbish.

209
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:10,797
Yeah, but I like savoury things.

210
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:13,192
But you said too salty,
which means it's horrible.

211
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:15,558
- I like crisps.
- Don't ask me any more questions.

212
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:17,951
- Hello, again.
- Hey, hello.

213
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,113
- This is my friend Andy.
- Hi.

214
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:21,921
Hiya. Jon.

215
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,801
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just having lunch.

216
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:28,717
- That's what we're doing, isn't it?
- Yeah, just letting it cool down here, though.

217
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:31,158
Having a bit of lunch
just before we go back to work.

218
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:34,120
- Are you having to work late tonight, then?
- No, not tonight.

219
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:37,990
I'm going to a drinks do. I don't know
if you know, it's Jackie Greer's birthday.

220
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:41,917
Oh, my God, I'm going! I'm already going.
Oh, spooky.

221
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:44,038
I'm sure you're welcome
to come along as well.

222
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,114
I can't, I'm doing anything else.

223
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:49,081
So do you know Jackie Greer very well,
good friends?

224
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:52,677
Not really, no. The producer's going down
so he sort of asked us to go along.

225
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:55,799
- You know, team bonding or whatever.
- The producer of this?

226
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,874
Yeah, Martin the producer. He's going to
be there. He knows Jackie from years back.

227
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:03,842
Yeah, I'll probably move stuff around.
I might as well come down for a couple of...

228
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:08,075
Yeah? Okay, we'll see you later on then
for a drink and a bit of a laugh, eh?

229
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:09,515
That'd be great, yeah.

230
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah, well I'd better get this down me.
Line my stomach. Coq au vin.

231
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,793
- Sounds a bit rude, doesn't it?
- Not really.

232
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:19,439
What have you gone for?

233
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,993
Oh, boring.
Just three bean salad, spinach and smoothie.

234
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,155
- I'm on a high fibre diet.
- Oh. No bowel cancer for you, then.

235
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,119
Hopefully not, no.

236
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:34,322
- Okay. See you later.
- See you later, bye.

237
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:35,720
Bye.

238
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,597
- "No bowel cancer for you, then?"
- All right.

239
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,434
Classic. That's really funny.

240
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,040
- Hi.
- Hello.

241
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:49,760
- You all right?
- Yes.

242
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:52,309
- You're not going to...
- No, no, I'm good.

243
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:55,950
- Good. Well, I got you a gift.
- Why?

244
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,352
Just to say thanks for being part
of this amazing project, you know.

245
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:00,999
Oh, thank you very much.

246
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,870
And to thank you for the line you said
you'd get me, do you remember?

247
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:07,192
- Did I?
- Yeah, you probably don't remember

248
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:10,079
because you were crying
about your dead family and stuff.

249
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,311
But you said you'd ask Ben for a line.

250
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:15,314
Are you going to ask Ben for a line?

251
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,710
Yes, I can do that.

252
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,031
I didn't know what to get you,
got you vouchers.

253
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:21,793
- Vouchers?
- Yeah.

254
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,997
Fifteen quids' worth.

255
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:26,311
- It's like money?
- It's exactly like money

256
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,756
but you can only spend it at Top Shop.

257
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,151
So, you'll ask Ben, yeah?

258
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:34,510
Yeah.

259
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:36,990
Brilliant. Fifteen quid.

260
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,958
See you later.

261
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,481
Cut! Cut!

262
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:55,352
Why is he laughing?
Why are you laughing, hm?

263
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,751
- I tripped up.
- What's so funny?

264
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:00,513
I tripped up.

265
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:04,070
Okay. All right, do you think this is funny?

266
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,351
You think war is funny?

267
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,274
Do you think genocide is funny? Huh?

268
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:12,031
Are you his mum? Yeah. Let me ask you this.

269
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,193
Do you think this'll be funny?
If I shot your mother right now?

270
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,636
If I shot your mummy in the face,
would that make you laugh?

271
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,472
Do you think that would be funny?

272
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,030
If I blew your mother's face off now,
would that make you laugh?

273
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,998
Okay, so maybe you should think
of that next time you trip, okay?

274
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,116
Let's do it right now, let's go.

275
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,437
- Still rolling.
- And the atrocities continue.

276
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:34,874
And action!

277
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,871
It's so itchy, this.

278
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:54,874
- Maggie and Andy.
- Hi.

279
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,593
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

280
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,956
Thank you so much. I wasn't expecting you,
I thought your sister was ill.

281
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,077
Yes, but it turned out to be
not as serious as we first thought.

282
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,878
So, yeah, women's problems.

283
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,672
Typical, quite a build up.
I had to get out of the house in the end.

284
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,117
I thought she was gonna have my face off.
A Rottweiler with lipstick.

285
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,917
Busy, though.

286
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,509
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

287
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,955
Someone said the producer was coming.
Is that...

288
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,155
It's Martin, he's over there.

289
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,957
- Oh, okay.
- You look gorgeous.

290
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,077
Look at you, I wouldn't have thought
to put that with that...

291
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,149
...and that's the same problem we've got...

292
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,953
Hello!

293
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,155
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

294
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,833
No, it was Elaine's idea originally.

295
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,387
He says that every time,
but it was both of us.

296
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:57,632
It's usually true. Anyway,
it's modern retellings of the old stories

297
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,597
and we're going to make several of them.

298
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,193
It's going to be a little bit like
Kieslowski's Decalogue.

299
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,758
- Have you see those?
- Yes.

300
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,071
Well, you know there's that one character,
the Watcher, and it's a fantastic character.

301
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,388
Have you read that
Kieslowski on Kieslowski book?

302
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:11,672
No, I haven't.

303
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:15,070
He wrote later that he was so upset
that he left him out of two of the films

304
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,878
'cause he really wished he was...

305
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,234
It's his fault, should've...

306
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:23,669
Do you want a drink?
I'm a friend of Jackie's. My round.

307
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,796
- Oh, great, we're on champagne.
- Three glasses of champagne.

308
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,268
- Oh, just get a bottle.
- Yes, definitely.

309
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,747
Anyway, so...

310
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,028
What do you mean,
why have you not seen me around?

311
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,268
I've gone red.

312
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,827
Have you done other productions?
Are you an actress?

313
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,149
- No.
- Oh, you look like you should be an actress.

314
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,990
- Costume dramas or something like that.
- Yeah?

315
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,115
I'd imagine it'll be seconds...

316
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:05,950
Hi. Andy.

317
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,835
Oh, Andy, yeah. Oh, cheers.

318
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:08,954
Cheers.

319
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,509
Just thinking what you and Ben
are doing in this film, wonderful,

320
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,668
it moved me, so...

321
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:17,317
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

322
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:20,276
Can I ask you something?
What was your inspiration?

323
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,428
Well, obviously the story.

324
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,746
Oh, yeah.

325
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,034
In film terms. Probably something like the...

326
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,836
- Are you a film buff?
- I adore films.

327
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:30,716
Well, I'll tell you what I re-watched
when we were planning this.

328
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:31,787
Oh, please do.

329
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:34,438
Andrzej Wajda's War Trilogy.
They're extraordinary, aren't they?

330
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:35,633
Yeah.

331
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:40,189
Ben's been watching them, particularly in
relation to battle scenes, a lot of Kurosawa.

332
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:41,791
Oh, okay.

333
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:45,348
Yeah, particularly in relation
to the kineticism of the mise en scטne.

334
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,872
In the film. Yeah, I see.

335
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,391
You a fan? Generally?

336
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:51,070
- Yes.
- Of Japanese cinema?

337
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:53,035
- Oh, definitely.
- Oh, well.

338
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:55,429
Kurosawa's obviously a master.

339
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:56,791
Yeah, he's number one.

340
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,187
I suppose on a personal level,
I'm more a fan of Ozu.

341
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:03,032
Me, too, but I think they're both,
they're both big boys.

342
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:06,269
- The aesthetics are completely different.
- Chalk and cheese, but...

343
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:09,907
- He tends to knock the camera off.
- And the other one just lets it on.

344
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:12,306
It was Elaine actually
who turned me on to Ozu.

345
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:14,627
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, I wasn't really a fan before.

346
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:16,070
Really?

347
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:18,269
No, I'm sure you've found this.

348
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:20,713
You say to someone, "Do you like
Japanese cinema?" and they say,

349
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:22,197
"No, can't get into it, boring."

350
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:24,348
And you say,
"Well, do you like the Magnificent Seven?"

351
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,315
- And they say, "Yes."
- Yeah, they like that.

352
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,548
And you think, well,
it's a remake of the Seven Samurai.

353
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:32,390
Yeah, yeah, course it is.
What, they didn't know that?

354
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,832
- No.
- Seven's the clue. Can't just make that up.

355
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,750
No, it really upsets me.
I want everyone to love the Seven Samurai.

356
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:42,548
I love all the number films, really.
Seven Samurai, Ocean's Eleven, Dirty Dozen.

357
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,435
Which is about as many as I think
you can have on screen at once.

358
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:48,031
- But seven is perfect for me.
- Apologies for this,

359
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:50,711
but I don't really recognise you.
What are you doing?

360
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:55,427
I'm an actor, yeah. Although at the moment,
I'm concentrating more on background work,

361
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:58,907
looking out towards getting a speaking role.
In anything.

362
00:18:58,997 --> 00:19:01,956
- Andy, sorry to interrupt.
- Not at all.

363
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,470
Listen, can I have a quick word?

364
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:05,627
- Not now, I'm a little bit busy.
- Two minutes.

365
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:08,789
- I'm in the middle...
- Don't mind us. We'll be here.

366
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,708
Yeah? Okay, all right.

367
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:17,875
I just wanted to let you know that
Jon's going on somewhere else

368
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,595
- and he's asked me to go with him.
- Fine.

369
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:22,874
I wanted to let you know
because it was me who dragged you here.

370
00:19:22,957 --> 00:19:25,346
You'd be all annoyed
because I'd disappeared...

371
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:26,950
I'm fine, I'm chatting.

372
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:28,947
- He's nice.
- He is, yes.

373
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:33,147
- Foot doesn't bother you?
- Eh?

374
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:35,956
I know you're a deeply shallow person,
I thought the foot would be a problem.

375
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,106
What do you mean?

376
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:41,075
He's got one leg shorter than the other, look.
He's wearing one of them big shoes.

377
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:43,716
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't notice that?

378
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:46,185
Well, no, it was under the table, wasn't it?

379
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,710
- Yes. Must have been a big table.
- No, don't.

380
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,435
- What?
- I didn't see.

381
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:54,192
Oh, look at him. He's a lovely man.
He's funny, he's attractive.

382
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,074
Look at him, everybody loves him,
life and soul of the party.

383
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:59,750
- Certainly the sole.
- Oh, come on.

384
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:03,305
If you're above it. If you don't mind
being known as Maggie, "Who's Maggie?"

385
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:06,547
"Maggie, the girl who goes out with
the fellow with the big shoe," that's fine.

386
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,548
But they can do something
about it now, can't they?

387
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,151
- No.
- Some doctor in China or something.

388
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:14,751
No, it's weird, that's the one thing
they can't do anything about.

389
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:18,112
They can give you a new face, new heart,
new lungs, new liver, new anything,

390
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:19,629
but if you go to a doctor and you say,

391
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,910
"Doc, I've got one leg
slightly shorter than the other,"

392
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:23,633
doesn't matter if you got a million pounds,

393
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:27,505
they can send you to Switzerland and
all you're coming home with is a big shoe.

394
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:30,554
- Stop it.
- That's fine, if it's not a problem for you.

395
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:33,150
I'm not so shallow
that I can't see beyond his big foot.

396
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:36,034
I know you,
you'll get involved and it will be a problem.

397
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,265
All I'm saying is this,
don't rush off with him tonight.

398
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:41,233
Sleep on it, if it's not a problem tomorrow,
give him a call.

399
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:44,786
- In the morning?
- Absolutely, why rush into it now? He's here.

400
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:48,192
- Hey.
- Hi.

401
00:20:48,276 --> 00:20:50,392
I'm ready to get going if you are.

402
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:53,431
Now? Right now?

403
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:56,310
Er... I don't think I can go right now.

404
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,670
Oh, right. You said you fancied it just then.

405
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,986
Yeah, but he just reminded me of something.

406
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:05,385
- Yeah, I just reminded her.
- I don't think I can go.

407
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:09,754
Is it... Is it the leg?

408
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:13,229
Hm?

409
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:16,906
Is it the fact that I've got one leg
shorter than the other?

410
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:20,711
- I hadn't noticed.
- You hadn't noticed?

411
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:22,069
I hadn't.

412
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:30,309
- You hadn't noticed that?
- Oh! No.

413
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:33,547
- I hadn't. God, it's a big clumpy one.
- Don't say clumpy.

414
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:37,595
- It's like a big Herman Munster.
- Oh! Don't say...

415
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,511
- Er...
- Oh, that's...

416
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:43,234
Do these come in any other styles?

417
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,994
Do you have to buy a pair
and throw one away?

418
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,067
It's been good talking to you.

419
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:53,908
- Just interested because...
- I've never seen a live one.

420
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:56,270
Maybe I can phone you tomorrow.

421
00:21:56,355 --> 00:22:00,143
No. No, don't worry about it.
You've shown your true colours.

422
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:06,223
- That was you.
- It wasn't my fault. How was it my fault?

423
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:07,906
That poor man.

424
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,031
All his life he's had to deal with people
that are so shallow

425
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:15,631
that they can't see beyond his foot thing
and he's going to think I'm like that.

426
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:16,943
You are.

427
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,265
I don't want him to know that.

428
00:22:19,355 --> 00:22:22,710
- Well, don't say Herman Munster then.
- Well, it just slipped out.

429
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:24,546
Herman Munster just slipped out?

430
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,034
Bit more room.

431
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:40,703
We were having a conversation earlier
about films, weren't we?

432
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:42,352
You'd have hated it.

433
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:46,905
I was going to ask you about this film.
Are there any parts left to cast?

434
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:50,270
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Oh, that's a shame.

435
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:53,273
- Jon seemed quite upset.
- Was he?

436
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:56,592
I thought you were getting on with him.
You seemed to be.

437
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:57,868
Yeah, we were.

438
00:22:57,954 --> 00:23:00,184
But you don't want to see him
because of his foot?

439
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:03,550
- I didn't say that.
- But it is though, isn't it?

440
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:06,102
Well, it's her private life, innit?

441
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:10,665
Yeah, I'm just saying that I think it's a shame
that she obviously goes through life

442
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:12,943
not liking anyone that's different than her.

443
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,672
That's not true.

444
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:18,669
She's gets on with anyone,
tall, thin, black, white, yellow.

445
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:20,551
She's not prejudiced.

446
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:23,622
- Who's yellow?
- What?

447
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:29,468
Well, you were just listing racial types,
black, white... Who's yellow?

448
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:40,189
- That's what we call the Chinese sometimes.
- Oh, do we?

449
00:23:40,273 --> 00:23:43,869
The Chinese? Well, one, I'm American

450
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:47,872
and two, my parents are Japanese,
not Chinese.

451
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:50,023
Oh, yes, Japanese, Chinese I wasn't...

452
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:54,425
What do you mean, Japanese, Chinese?
Both the same to you, are they?

453
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:57,471
Well, don't make me sound like a racist,
I don't happen to know

454
00:23:57,553 --> 00:24:00,068
the intricate differences
between Japanese and Chinese people.

455
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:02,031
There's that thing
that they teach you at school.

456
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:03,149
No.

457
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:06,270
Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees,
what are these?

458
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:11,747
- Do you remember it?
- Yeah, it rings a bell.

459
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,027
- Okay? That's us.
- Yeah.

460
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:15,864
Cheers, good night.

461
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:19,348
- Are we going?
- Yeah. Do you know why?

462
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:20,833
- No.
- Guess.

463
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:22,904
- Because of the foot.
- No.

464
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,743
- I know the first...
- Then we've got the second one.

465
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:36,031
Okay, I don't need to hear, you know,
the story of how we got to this point.

466
00:24:36,113 --> 00:24:39,742
I know what point we're at, I'm just
wondering when we can actually shoot it.

467
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,112
- Hey.
- Hi.

468
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,512
- Good news.
- Yeah?

469
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:45,823
- I got you line.
- Really?

470
00:24:45,913 --> 00:24:49,666
I talk to Ben, he say, here, you see.
Journalist Two.

471
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:52,505
"Don't go down there!
There are snipers down there."

472
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,187
Don't go down there!
There are snipers down there.

473
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,263
- What you doing?
- The accent. I was gonna...

474
00:24:57,352 --> 00:25:00,663
- Don't.
- I won't do the accent. That's brilliant.

475
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:02,550
- Okay.
- Excellent.

476
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:03,668
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

477
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:07,142
Hold on. Sorry, there's two journalists here.
Journalist One and Journalist Two.

478
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,541
I'm Journalist Two,
but Journalist One's got all the lines.

479
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,342
Look, him, him, him, me, snipers.
Him, him, him.

480
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,827
I think I should do Journalist Two, you know.

481
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:17,982
I think someone else already doing that.

482
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:21,588
- I know, but we could swap. I'd be better.
- I got you a line.

483
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:24,425
I know, but remember the vouchers.
I got you the vouchers, didn't I?

484
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:25,831
I put them towards this top.

485
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:27,664
- Brilliant. Doesn't that look good?
- Nice.

486
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:30,983
Looks really good. Have a word
and see if I could do Journalist Two.

487
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,391
He's busy.

488
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:36,784
Yeah, but he's always busy. Just get
a quiet moment when he's not so busy.

489
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:39,988
Kelvin, go back to one on this,
we've got to work this out.

490
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,505
- Ivan, when you come...
- Igor.

491
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:42,786
- What?
- Igor.

492
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:45,511
Igor, okay, when you knock her down,
don't ask her to come down.

493
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,185
You smack her in the back of the head

494
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:49,661
and then you come here
and you jam it into her mouth.

495
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:51,185
You can't put your hand up, okay?

496
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:54,025
Boom, you jam her in the mouth,
break her jaw on the first one.

497
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:56,103
Second one nose, okay. Her jaw's broken,

498
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:58,386
she's swallowed her teeth,
blood's coming out, all right?

499
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:01,144
Then you smack her again across the side,
breaking the neck.

500
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:02,506
All right, can we do this again, please?

501
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,787
- Go and get him now.
- Okay, I try.

502
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,345
- Ben.
- Yeah.

503
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,390
I need to swap the lines.

504
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:12,588
What do you mean,
you need to swap the lines?

505
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,423
For my friend. He wants to...

506
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,661
Your friend? No, no, I gave your friend a line.

507
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:20,107
Yes, but I want him to have more.

508
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:22,341
You want him to have more?

509
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:25,151
- You want him to have more lines?
- Yes.

510
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:29,020
I don't understand, are you directing
the movie or am I directing the movie?

511
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:33,468
No, but this is my story.
My memories, my tribute to my dead wife.

512
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:39,983
Would you stop going on
about your fucking dead wife?

513
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:49,949
All right, let's do another rehearsal.
Right away, please.

514
00:26:50,031 --> 00:26:51,305
Ben.

515
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:53,748
That was a wee bit much.

516
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:56,184
Ben?

517
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:58,420
I'm sorry, what's your name?

518
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:02,701
Oh, wait a minute, I remember.
I don't give a shit.

519
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:05,308
- Get out of my face.
- All right.

520
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:09,020
Don't have a go at her,
she was just worried about Goran.

521
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,190
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

522
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:13,421
What's that? Who?

523
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,785
- Nobody.
- That's right, nobody.

524
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:18,349
Yeah, and who am I?

525
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,744
It's either Starsky or Hutch,
I can never remember.

526
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,147
- Was that supposed to be funny?
- You tell me, you were in it.

527
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,744
- Get off my set.
- Okay.

528
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:30,549
Get off my set.

529
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:33,262
Hey, hey, question.

530
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,229
Do you know how much Meet the Fockers
made in its opening weekend?

531
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:38,745
- No.
- No, you don't, do you?

532
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:40,821
What do you think?

533
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,821
- Don't know.
- Take a wild guess.

534
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,025
Twenty million?

535
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,582
Way off. Double it, add six.
46, three days. 70 million, five days.

536
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:50,979
500 million worldwide.

537
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,461
Number one movie in India right now.

538
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:55,348
Well done. Bye, nerd.

539
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,383
- Oh, I'm a nerd?
- Yeah.

540
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:58,744
I'm a nerd.

541
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,539
I've kissed Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore.

542
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,019
I slapped Jennifer Aniston's butt.

543
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,020
- In films.
- It still counts.

544
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:16,268
It still counts.

545
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,262
It still counts. I did it, I actually did it.

546
00:28:23,305 --> 00:29:23,938

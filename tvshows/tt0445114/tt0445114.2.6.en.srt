JONATHAN ROSS:
A lot of people when they get famous

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,157
they find a lot of temptations in their way,
they maybe drink too much, eat too much.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,357
They get invited to parties and so forth,
and, you know, weight can be a problem.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,228
You look like you have always
struggled a little bit with your weight.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,353
Would I be right in that? Is it a struggle?

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,637
It's not a struggle.
The more I eat, the fatter I get, it's...

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,517
-But you're comfortable?
-It's easy, it's easy.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,194
What are your ambitions?
Obviously this has been a big hit for you,

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,349
a surprise hit some would say.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,237
But what are your ambitions
over and above this?

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,117
You gonna do more of the same
or do you want to branch out?

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,954
I suppose I would like to do,
you know, serious acting

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,359
and I would like to do films.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,237
Who'd you like to meet?
Who'd you like to work with?

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,435
You don't know anyone.

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,636
I know most people in Hollywood,
I've interviewed most of them.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,269
I've interviewed Tom Cruise many times,
I've interviewed Robert De Niro.

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,078
I've interviewed all the greats.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,357
Yeah, obviously Robert De Niro's
the greatest actor in the world,

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,670
so I'd obviously like to work with him.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,115
All right, challenge accepted.
Challenge accepted.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,953
No, challenge accepted, De Niro.
I will hook you up with De Niro.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,350
-You can get me De Niro?
-Yeah. But lose some weight first.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,353
-Andy?
-Hi.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,998
-Well done, that was great.
-Really?

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,991
-It was fantastic, you were fantastic.
-Cheers.

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,593
-Are you gonna stay for a drink?
-Yeah.

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,477
All right, wait for me in there,
I've got to pop downstairs.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,676
But don't go without seeing me,
I'd really love to chat.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,911
-Okay, all right.
-Wait for me. I'll be a minute.

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,437
-Is that your first chat show?
-Yeah.

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,919
-You're not serious?
-I was nervous as well.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,989
It didn't show.

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,354
-Oh, really?
-No, I didn't notice.

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,317
-You were great, I loved your stories.
-I'm used to it.

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,753
I've done loads, you'll get used to it.

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,798
Sorry, have you got a minute to talk
to a big fan of yours from the audience?

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,869
Yeah. What, now?

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,234
-Is that all right?
-Yeah.

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,231
MAN: Joe, this is Andy. Andy, Joe.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,548
-Hi.
-Hi.

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,110
-You all right?
-Yeah, can I ask...

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,791
Joe's going into hospital next week,
St Matthews.

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,874
May be in for quite a long time,

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,076
and would you pop in and say hello?

46
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,354
Would l...?

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,716
Can you pop in and visit him
whilst he's in hospital?

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,678
I'm not sure what I'm doing.

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,074
-All right, well...
-To be honest.

50
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,674
Give me your number
and we can arrange something.

51
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,194
-Yeah, if you call my agent on...
-Not your agent.

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,236
-Not my agent?
-No. They fob you off, agents.

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,629
What's your mobile?

54
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,475
I lost my mobile.
I don't know where it is at the moment.

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,955
-It's in your pocket.
-It's in my what?

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,917
It's in your pocket.

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,271
Oh, I thought I looked there. I...

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,115
Why didn't I look in there?
I usually look in my pocket. Well done, kid.

59
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,113
What's your number?

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,479
-Mine?
-Yeah.

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,029
Can I remember it? 0...

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,073
Oh, I'll just ring it so I've got it in there.

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,913
Well, don't, no, that's my old one.
That's the one I lost.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,638
That's the one I lost.

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,236
No. If you're gonna test it, it's 07700900168.

68
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,356
Okay, all right.
Well, I'll ring to confirm Monday.

69
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,476
-I don't know if I can...
-You can make it Monday.

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,357
-It's just half an hour.
-Yeah.

71
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,237
-Get a cab, you can afford it.
-Yeah, I know.

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,151
-But...
-6:00, St Matthews?

73
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,277
He's gonna be on the Parrot Ward,
neurology block.

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,271
-And it's 6:00.
-Okay.

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,429
-See you at 6:00.
-Yeah.

76
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,999
Great, thank you very, very much.

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,195
-Say goodbye.
-Goodbye.

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,315
-Cheers.
-Bye-bye, thanks.

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,515
Bye.

80
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,352
(WHISPERING) This way.

81
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,916
-Bit weird, innit?
-Bit presumptuous.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,991
No, I mean it's weird she didn't ask me.

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,914
I mean, knowing what I can do
and how much joy I bring to people.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,911
Well, maybe she didn't notice me.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,558
-Maybe.
-Unlikely.

86
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,950
I think you're gonna notice
Robert Lindsay in a room.

87
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,998
No, she probably saw me and thought,
"I'd love to ask him first,

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,232
"being one of Britain's best loved actors,
and let's not forget, you know, he can sing,

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,312
"he can dance and he has won awards
on Broadway, for Christ's sake."'

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,753
Ah.

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,231
No, she... I know what it was, she was
intimidated and she, you know, thought,

92
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,313
"Bird in the hand,
I'll definitely get a "yes" from the nobody."'

93
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,279
Worried about this kid though, aren't you?

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,316
-Yeah...
-No, I'm worried. I'm worried about the kid

95
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,439
because if this, you know, so-called mother
is making stupid mistakes like that,

96
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,080
you know, choosing you over me,
then what other mistakes is she making?

97
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,197
(INHALING DEEPLY)
Is she screwing up his medication?

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,552
-Is she, is she?
-I don't know.

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,834
No, no.

100
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,152
-Good luck. Keep them laughing.
-Cheers.

-Hello, Maggie.

-You live with your parents?
-Yeah.

If you two get up to anything tonight,
can you keep the noise down, dear?

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,828
We need to get up early tomorrow.

112
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,319
We're not gonna get up to anything.

113
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,958
Oh, I think Michael thinks you are.

114
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,873
I think he assumed
that's why you're coming back here.

115

You don't want people saying
you're a prick-tease, love.

Definitely not.

Girl like you, you're no spring chicken,
you must be sexually active.

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,070
You look like you know your way around.

119
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,072
Are you on contraception
or do you want to borrow something?

120
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,151
-Hmm?
-Are you on contraception?

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,958
-Yeah.
-What kind?

122
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,999
-Just the pill.
-The pill?

123
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,074
Don't go on the pill, danger of thrombosis.
I always use a cap, don't l, dear?

124
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,312
She does use a cap, but sometimes
I pop a johnny on as well, just to be safe.

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,279
Well, I'll call you later, then?

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,794
Yeah, I don't know
when I'll be finished, though.

154
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,314
-Look at this.
-Sort of really snowed under.

155
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,630
I've got to go. I'll speak to you soon, yeah?

156
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,029
All right, well, I'll speak to you...

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,038
That's my toy, right, but this is his toy,
I had to buy this separately.

158
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,509
-Check this out.
-I love the fact that your toys have got toys.

(MAN ON TV CHATTERING)

160
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,352
Okay, so, how are you getting on
with the De Niro thing?

161
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,319
-What's that?
-For f... I told you. It...

Jonathan Ross told me
he's over here doing a film.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,468
You said you'd get me an audition,
you said you'd make a few phone calls.

164
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,232
-I've been looking into that.
-Have you?

165
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,754
But it's tricky 'cause all his people
are in Los Angeles...

166
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,673
-So? You've got a phone.
-Yeah, it's complicated, though, 'cause...

167
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,990
It took me two days
to realise they're eight hours ahead.

168
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,399
-They're behind.
-Are they?

169
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,436
-Yes.
-That explains quite a lot.

170
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,115
-So what time would it be over there now?
-Right, it's 4:00 here so eight hours.

171
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,430
-Five, six, seven...
-No, you're going up.

172
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,636
-Five, six, seven...
-You're still going up.

173
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,508
-No, that's down...
-No, it's 4:00 here so eight hours, 8:00.

174
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,749
That's four hours ahead.

175

-In the morning!
-Oh, okay, yes.

176

-Supposing they get in at 9:00...
-10:00, have a cup of coffee.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,514
-Say hello to the people and... Yeah.
-All right.

178
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,318
-Add eight...
-To what?

179
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,833
-10!
-10. 18?

180
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,559
-What do you mean, 18?
-Oh, add eight hours, you mean?

181
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,675
-Well, of course.
-Yeah. Sorry.

182
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,115
-So call them at 6:00.
-Right, their time.

183
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,758
-Our time!
-Our time. Yeah.

184
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,829
And what time will it be over there?

185
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,989
-10:00.
-10:00.

186

-At night? In the morning.
-In the morning!

187
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,634
Forget it. If I can get hold of Robert De Niro
before you, you're fired, okay?

188
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,393
I've outgrown you,
I don't know what you're for.

189

Have another go but if I beat you to him,
you're fired.

190
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,433
-Hey, hello.
-All right. What you doing here?

191
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,192
Some more extra work, obviously.

192
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,635
-That's where it's tight, there.
-It's the same as it was before.

193
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,429
Listen, Andy, I've got to tell you about
this date that I went on with this guy, right.

194
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,751
To look at him,
you would think that he was Mr Perfect.

195
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,751
-Your dad?
-What?

196
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,116
-What did you say? Your dad what?
-No, a date. I went on a date.

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,838
-Oh, right.
-Try it now.

198
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,833
Is this a really bad time? 'Cause I can
easily come back and catch you here.

199
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,399
-That's better.
-At a later date.

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,879
-Whatever you did.
-We should hook up.

201
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,430
I've hardly seen you, well, not in the flesh.
I've seen you in the paper.

That's at his house in Swanage.

206

That was a brilliant day.

207
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,715
Yeah.

208
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,553
Well, we should go and get a cup of tea
or something sometime.

209
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,359
Yeah. Don't you get it, get a runner to get it.

210
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,753
No, not now. I'm saying we should
get together and have a cup of tea.

211

Tell you what, if you do want to hook up
and do me a favour at the same time,

I've got to go and see this sick kid
in hospital Monday.

213
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,678
I'm dreading it,
I don't know what to say to him.

214
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,318
At least if you're there,
I'll have someone to talk to.

215
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,198
You sure you want me to come? Sounds like
you should be asking some hot date.

No, it'll be awful. No, you're great.

-Buy myself a new dress, then.
-Ah?

Nothing.

219
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,313
Right, well, I'll leave you to it, then.

-Bye.

Comfy?

245
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,069
It's pretty comfy, yeah.

246
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,190
And I'm on morphine
so I can't really feel anything.

-Are you his girlfriend?
-No.

249

No, just a friend.

250
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,440
Why do you have a friend who's a girl?
Boring.

251
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,718
They're usually boring, but because
she's so stupid, that amuses me.

-I'm not stupid.
-Very dim.

That looks like one of those things
that you get a goldfish in at the fair.

-Could you keep a goldfish in that?

-Yeah, sure.

-Mmm.

Don't touch anything, they're not toys.

-Are you a Chelsea fan?
-Yeah.

00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,270
Can I just ask, and it's a very sensitive issue,

260
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,510
but if, heaven forbid, Joe did pass away...

-Who's Joe?
-Joe, my son.

-Oh, no, sorry, yeah, I know. Yeah, I knew.
-Yeah.

263
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,033
If he did pass away,
would you say a few words at his funeral?

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,594
Oh, l...

265
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,196
-I don't even want to think about that.
-Well, we have to think about it now.

266
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,349
I know, but...

267
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,557
It's something the whole family
would really very much appreciate,

268
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,474
knowing how much you mean to Joe,
and how much he means to you.

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,429
So if you could tell me,
yes, you'd be happy to say a few words...

270
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,148
But...

271
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,878
I think he's gonna live a very long time.

272
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,753
-He may not.
-He will.

273

-He may not.
-Oh, but, yeah, I know.

274

But it's mad to hold someone
to plans that far ahead.

275
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,678
We may even lose him
in the next six months.

276
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,389
Yeah, six months is a long time with
my schedule 'cause things change and l...

Can I just say
that you've promised you'll be there

278
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,875
unless it's something like literally impossible
for you to get out of?

279
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,916
-Like filming or...
-Not filming.

280
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,758
Not filming? That's not important enough?

281
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,628
Well, what do you consider
a good enough excuse to get me out of this?

282
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,154
Just so I don't bother you
with, like, I'm phoning you up going,

283
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,994
"Oh, I can't make it 'cause of this..."'
and you're going, "That's not an excuse."'

-You know?
-Right.

285
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,633
What we talking? What sort of...

286
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,676
-Can we just talk about it later?
-Yeah.

'Cause I don't remember planning anything.

I should have locked the door,
but I didn't think ahead. I just...

358

The moment took me
and I just went, you know, crazy.

-No.

If you must know what it was,
it was the lady on this pen.

362
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,474
I don't need to know.

363
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,632
It just looks like a regular lady, nice,
attractive lady wearing a bathing costume,

364
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,711
but when you turn it up the other way,
it comes off.

365
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,472
And then she's nude.

366
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,915
-Have you got my pen?
-Yes, take your pen, please, for...

I'm only gonna do one thing, aren't l?

Why didn't you have one
before you came out?

373
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,358
I did have one before I came out,
thanks for asking,

374
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,396
but I'm a very sexual being if you must know,

I didn't think I had to.

379
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,552
I didn't think I had to make a list of things
that you shouldn't do at work,

No. Nor do l.

That's it. This is pathetic, really.

387

I gave you a chance to sort something out
and you'd rather be doing that,

388
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,919
-so let's call it quits.

-That's it.
-Well, if...

393

If you fire me then you won't know anything
about the Robert De Niro meeting I've set up.

-Where?

-At his hotel.
-What hotel?

Dorchester hotel.

400

So, next Monday at 6:00 at The Dorchester,
I'm meeting Robert De Niro.

Brilliant, and if he doesn't turn up,
you're fired then.

00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,668
If he doesn't turn up, it's not my fault.

Well, no, you've arranged it,
so it's win-win for me.

404
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,756
So either I turn up and he's there,
I meet De Niro,

405
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,470
or I turn up and he's not there,
and you're fired, and I get a proper agent.

00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,792
(BEEPS)

451
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,756
I used to have that.

452
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,434
What are you doing here?
Has the meeting happened already?

453
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,193
-I didn't go, I came here instead.
-Why?

454
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,871
Well, you know,
don't want to let people down.

455
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,157
-But that's madness. It's Robert De Niro.
-I know.

456
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,958
-No, but that's madness!
-What do you mean, it's madness?

457
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,439
-Because it's Robert De Niro.
-I know it is.

458
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,078
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

459
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,230
I know, but I thought you were upset
about being second best.

460
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,799
-That's why I came here.
-Don't turn it round on me.

461
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,394
-I wasn't trying to make you feel bad.
-I got a text from you going...

462
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,357
-Don't make me feel guilty.
-Made me feel guilty.

463
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,032
-That was supposed to be nice.
-I know.

464
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,758
-It was supposed to be encouraging.
-And it was.

465
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,432
-lf you go now...
-Don't be stupid.

466
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,999
-Just get a taxi.
-I don't believe this.

467
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,116
-I do not believe this.
-It's Robert De Niro.

468
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,235
I know who it is.

469
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,117
Now I'm gonna feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

470
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,633
Don't make me feel bad
about you feeling guilty.

471
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,438
But what if your career goes down the pan?

472
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,953
-I wouldn't worry about it.
-How am I gonna feel?

473
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,679
My career is already down the pan.
Now it's my turn to operate.

474
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,035
(BEEPING)

475
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,473
He's dead.

476
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,754
You're a man of the world, you'll like this.

477
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,434
Right, it's just an ordinary pen, so it seems,

478
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,399
and with a picture of a lady on it
just in a bathing costume, just normal.

479
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,233
Turn it upside down.
Oh, what's happened there?

480
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,639
Nudie lady.

481
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,350
You looking at me? I am now.

482
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,475
-Oh.
-(CHUCKLES) It's good, isn't it?

483
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,757
-Yeah. Where did you get this?
-My friend, Barry, gave it to me.

484
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,038
Look at that, back on, nothing suspicious,
turn it up the other way.

485
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,711
Oh, hang on, hello!

486
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,038
-Can I have this?
-Do you want it? Take it.

487
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,548
Do you want to go for a pint?

488
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,309
Hurry up.

489
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,709
-You're in a bad mood.
-I'm not in a bad mood, but hurry up.

490
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,153
(GAME BEEPING)

491
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,834
-Dead. Dead.
-Stop putting me off.

492
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,512
If you were hacking at him like that,
he'd be dead.

493
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,113
(MOBILE RINGING)

494
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,270
Oh, it's Darren. What?

495
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,512
Hello, mate, what happened to you?
I'm still here with Mr Robert De Niro.

496
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,794
-You're with him now?
-Yeah.

497
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,677
We're just cruising down to a club.
Come down, mate.

498
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,035
Erm, could I bring Maggie?

499
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,114
He wants to bring his friend, is that all right?

500
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,475
DE NIRO: Who's that?
DARREN: Friend of his, a lady.

501
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,279
DE NIRO: The lady on the pen?
DARREN: I wish.

502
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,828
DE NIRO: Yeah, sure.
DARREN: All systems go, mate.

503
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,469
-Hang on, what you doing after this?
-Me? Nothing.

504
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,518
-Do you want to meet Robert De Niro?
-Nah.

505
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,397
-Really?
-I'm only joking. Yeah!

506
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,754
Okay, all right then.

507
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,035
We'll find somewhere, I'll text you the deeds.

508
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,315
-Okay.
-See you later, mate.

509
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,913
See you there.

510
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,196
-Really?
-Amazing. Let's go.

511
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,349
-Now?
-Yeah.

512
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,032
-What about the game?
-We can't just leave him.

513
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,112
We can. Just give him an extra couple
of drops of morphine, he'll be out cold.

514
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,509
-No, I'm joking. Right, whose go is it?
-You have a go.

515
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,033
Okay, okay.

516
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,318
What would you rather do, right?

517
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,913
-(GROANS) Oh.
-No, listen.

518
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,472
Would you rather die a sad, lonely,
bitter old man, in a cold and empty flat,

519
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,236
or if we're not with anyone in about
five years' time, just move in together?

520
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,792
I know what you've tried to do there,

521
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,155
you've tried to make the first option
sound the worst.

522
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,593
Why is it a cold flat?

523
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,116
'Cause you're too fat to get up
and put the heating on!

524
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,792
What, I've got five years to decide, have l?

525
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,677
Why's it taking you so long
to actually think of the answer?

526
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,275
I want to keep my options open.
I don't want to commit.

527
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,229
Hi.

528
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,038
-He doesn't want to see you, Robert.
-Yes, he does.

529
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,190
He does,
because I've brought DVDs of My Family.

530
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,475
-Come on, everyone likes this.
-I don't.

531
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,870
-I prefer that edgier stuff on BBC Two.
-What are you, a critic?

532
00:27:04,305 --> 00:28:04,325

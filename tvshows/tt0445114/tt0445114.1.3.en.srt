2
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,612
Cut!

3
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:52,083
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Okay, we'll get it on that, thank you.

4
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:58,169
- Was I in it?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:58,252 --> 00:01:01,403
No, I wasn't in it. What is the point
in getting all tarted up like this

6
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:04,766
- if you're not going to make it to the scene?
- You look quite dapper.

7
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,160
- It's a Nazi uniform.
- I know. It's a bit natty, though, isn't it?

8
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,684
- Natty?
- I bet it's more comfortable than this.

9
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,919
This is riding up my clunge.

10
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,684
Can you imagine hiding from the Gestapo
for weeks on end dressed like this?

11
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,919
Yeah, it must have been awful.

12
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,524
- It's actually very slimming that.
- Yeah? I'll wear it out Friday night.

13
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,758
She's right. I can see what she means.

14
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:26,645
Yeah? You think I look good in this?

15
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,482
You should see me with a white sheet
over my head setting fire to a cross.

16
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,203
- Who's that?
- Not sure.

17
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:34,799
Seems nice.

18
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:38,284
I've got to get out of this,
it's doing my back in.

19
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:43,118
Okay, take care moving on now.
Thanks, chaps.

20
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:54,233
- Do you know what worries me?
- Don't know.

21
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:56,554
Where do baby ants go to school? Go on.

22
00:01:56,644 --> 00:02:00,477
No, all these people going about
pretending to be nuns.

23
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:03,077
- What do you mean?
- Do you think that's right?

24
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:04,754
- It's a film.
- I know.

25
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:07,834
But they're all wandering around
as holy ladies.

26
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:10,561
Wouldn't that offend God or someone?

27
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:13,202
- Offend God or someone?
- Does it not worry you a bit?

28
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,875
No. What, offending God? I'm an atheist.

29
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,873
What one's that? Is that the one
where you haven't decided what...

30
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,919
No, that's agnostic. I'm an atheist.
I firmly believe there is no God.

31
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,992
- Why?
- Wh... The burden of proof is not on me.

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,389
The burden of proof is on the people
who say there is a God.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,709
I don't believe in God, I believe in science.

34
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,508
Do you not believe in anything
like ghosts or spirits or anything?

35
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,718
No, I don't believe in ghosts or spirits
or elves. Certainly not God, no.

36
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:41,710
So what do you think happens
when you die?

37
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:45,506
Well, if you're buried,
you go in the ground and you're worm food.

38
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:47,474
See, I don't like that.

39
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:53,154
I would rather believe that there is a God
and your soul just floats away on to eternity.

40
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:56,871
All your friends from school will be there,
all the ones you haven't seen for ages,

41
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:59,628
and all your dead pets
and just, like, all nice people.

42
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,865
You don't have to worry about worms.

43
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:05,345
You believe in God, then.

44
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:08,743
I think I need to go for a wee.

45
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,665
Oh, that's the third one already.

46
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:13,473
Good. Well, keep me posted
throughout the week.

47
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:15,191
Maybe keep a journal.

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,708
Oh, God!

49
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,940
- What have you done?
- What?

50
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,861
What's happened? Are you all right?

51
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,579
No, I've got cerebral palsy. Don't worry.

52
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,102
Oh, good.

53
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,501
- I thought you'd had a fall or something.
- No, I'm cool. Really.

54
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:56,340
Oh, hello, then. I'm Maggie.

55
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm Suzanne again and this is my sister Fran.

56
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:01,064
- Hello.
- Good to meet you.

57
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,418
- Are you in this as well?
- Oh, she's just here to watch.

58
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:10,102
- I was going to say...
- Oh, I have a bit of spare time, you know,

59
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:13,940
because my tap dancing class
was cancelled so...

60
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,383
Right.

61
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,660
Joke, tap dancing, me.

62
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,975
Right. Yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:26,938
- I've got a question about your props.
- Go on.

64
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:30,254
- Where's all this stuff come from?
- You just buy it.

65
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:34,655
What, there's a shop for
a 30 foot swastika is there?

66
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:37,336
No, I got that from home. It's my Nan's.

67
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:39,575
Here she is.

68
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:40,856
- All right?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,093
Hey, do you want to have lunch
with us later?

70
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:47,298
I can't. I've got to go
and see my fool of an agent.

71
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:50,612
- Still going well, is it?
- I went in the other day, right,

72
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:54,489
and he said to me, "Andy," he said,
"if I don't get a decent client soon,

73
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:57,889
"I'm going to have to go full time
at The Carphone Warehouse."

74
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,332
Unbelievable.

75
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,774
- Here, got to go.
- See you later.

76
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:04,498
- Go and move some props around.
- Will do.

77
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,614
- Going well, is it?
- Yeah, it's good.

78
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:11,212
That's longer than a day you've been
going out with this one.

79
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,687
- Three weeks.
- That has got to be a record for you.

80
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:16,531
- Cheekiness.
- No, well done. Good bloke.

81
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:19,006
- Well, I'm glad you like him.
- Yeah, good.

82
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,014
- What?
- Nothing.

83
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,576
- Married?
- No.

84
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,408
- Gay?
- No!

85
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:28,412
It is something, though.

86
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:32,249
He likes to talk dirty on the phone.

87
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:36,325
He'll call me up
and he's coming out with all this filth.

88
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:39,483
Why would you tell me that?

89
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:43,844
What does he say? What does he say?

90
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:47,087
He calls up and says things like...

91
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:50,006
"Ooh, what are you doing?"

92
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:51,572
What do you say?

93
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:55,406
I didn't know what was going on at first,
didn't realise, and I was just honest with him

94
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:59,484
and I said, "I'm just cleaning out
the vegetable drawer of the fridge."

95
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,562
Well, he probably thought
that was a euphemism.

96
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:05,644
"Oh, I'm cleaning out my vegetable drawer."
"Oh, I am scrubbing my front step."

97
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,561
- Have you talked dirty back to him?
- No.

98
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,003
- Have you?
- No, I have not.

99
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,365
I don't know what to say to him.
It's too embarrassing.

100
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,159
- Yeah.
- What if I say something and he laughs at me

101
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,798
or something and it's too much
and he gets all offended?

102
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,087
Well, no, it's just all stuff like,
"Oh, I'm playing with myself."

103
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,204
Oh, that sounds interesting.

104
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:28,916
- Hi. Not me, her.
- Go on.

105
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:34,401
Her boyfriend likes to talk dirty on the phone
and she doesn't know what to say to him.

106
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:36,842
Oh, yeah, that can be a bit awkward.

107
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:40,521
Why don't you just start off
with something light, you know, like...

108
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:44,363
"I'd love it if you stuck your Willy Wonka
between my Oompa Loompas."

109
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,722
You know, something a bit jokey
and then you can get more hardcore.

110
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:52,003
Rattle off the old classics like,
"I'm playing with my dirty pillows."

111
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:56,441
"I'm aching for your big purple-headed
womb ferret." And then go straight in hard,

112
00:06:56,524 --> 00:07:00,596
"Get round here because I'm fudding
myself stupid and I'm bloody loving it."

113
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,321
- All right?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:03,518
Yeah.

115
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,115
Anyway, better get on. Good luck.

116
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:09,834
Love to Sam Mendes.

117
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:14,474
Kate Winslet just talking dirty to...

118
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:17,921
Anne Frank and Joseph Goebbels.

119
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,037
Just... another normal day.

120
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,034
- Guten Tag, Frהulein.
- Oh, hi.

121
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,428
What is this "Oh, hi"?

122
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,316
Sorry, is that meant to be German?

123
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,708
You are resisting the great German
sense of humour. You are English, ya?

124
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:45,791
Then I have something for you
that will make you roll in the aisles.

125
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:50,634
This is funny to you, yeah,
because it looks like a thingy. Yeah.

126
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:54,675
Actually, this will make you laugh.
Jesus, look, pissed up nutter over there.

127
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,827
She's had a few.

128
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,713
Actually, is she pissed or mental?

129
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:01,547
Oh, here she comes.

130
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:03,466
- That's my sister.
- Huh?

131
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:05,352
She's got cerebral palsy.

132
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:09,426
No... not... her.

133
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:13,905
Another nutter that was...
Not another nutter, she's not...

134
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,953
She's gone now, the one I meant.
Shot on and just shot off again.

135
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:20,711
- Hi.
- Hi.

136
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,144
- This is my sister.
- Hiya.

137
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:25,665
- Francesca.
- You all right?

138
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,629
Hiya, you all right?

139
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,782
What do you do in this, then?

140
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,950
What Judith...?

141
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:35,706
- No, she said what do you do in this?
- Oh, a background artist.

142
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,669
Oh, right. And what does that entail?

143
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,463
What does that entail?

144
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah, just standing around, really.
Although it's not what I do.

145
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,147
I'm a real actor,
this is just sort of like pocket money.

146
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,901
Yeah, well I bet they all say that, don't they?

147
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:02,860
All right, mate. Come and check this out.
I just typed in 58,008 into a calculator...

148
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:07,699
and lo and behold, amazingly,
it comes up "boobs".

149
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,339
You see that? That's worth knowing, isn't it?

150
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:14,934
Good.

151
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,541
What can I do... Oh, sorry.

152
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,297
Better get that. Hang on.

153
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:30,052
Just...

154
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:45,175
Hello? It's gone.

155
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:47,571
That's... annoying.

156
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:50,334
It's weird that,
it always happens with that one.

157
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,774
- Turn it off.
- Okay, I'll put it on vibrate.

158
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,698
How do you do that?

159
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,448
Erm... what can I do for you?

160
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,050
You called me in for a meeting.

161
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,891
Did I? What was that about?

162
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,209
I don't know, you said you wanted to see me.

163
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:11,653
All right. I'll just check on here.

164
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,572
- What's the gist of it?
- It'll be on here.

165
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,854
I've got everything organised on there
so it's all...

166
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:30,807
I'm looking at the wrong date.

167
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,204
- Erm... it's the third today, isn't it?
- Fourth.

168
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:35,047
Fourth. Yeah, I was looking
at the wrong date.

169
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,966
Tuesday 3rd, blank.

170
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:41,012
What does it say here?
It just says, today, "catch-up meeting".

171
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:43,608
Just to catch up, really, with you
and find out what's been happening

172
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:47,163
- tell you about what's coming in and...
- Okay, what's coming in?

173
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,843
Nothing's come in according to that.

174
00:10:57,932 --> 00:10:59,285
- Nothing's come in?
- No.

175
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:01,840
Okay, good. Well, that was well worth it.

176
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:05,003
Apart from sitting there waiting for
the phone to ring, what have you done?

177
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:07,605
Have you called anyone?
Have you sent the script out?

178
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:09,124
What script? Sorry?

179
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,520
Oh, man, the script I gave you
two months ago.

180
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:12,725
That sounds good.

181
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,119
- The sitcom.
- Yeah? Funny?

182
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,040
You haven't read it?

183
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,962
What's it called?
Because I can get on to that.

184
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:25,126
- When the Whistle Blows.
- I'll just write down "When the 'W' Blows."

185
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,006
Don't put "W", you'll forget what the "W"
stands for. Write it out.

186
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,999
- No, When the Wind Blows.
- Whistle.

187
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:32,999
I'll put that in. "W" equals wind.

188
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,282
- Whistle!
- Whistle. It's there.

189
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,198
- It's in.
- That's safe then, is it?

190
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,676
That's done. I can forget about that.
That's on its way, yeah?

191
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,485
I've got my best man on it?

192
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,682
- Yeah.
- Safe hands, safe hands.

193
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:47,283
- Do you want to put another meeting in?
- Any point?

194
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:51,358
May as well. And then when nothing
comes in, just phone you up and cancel it.

195
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:54,083
That's a plan.

196
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:56,519
I don't think of him as an agent now.

197
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:59,402
I think of him as a bloke
who had some cards printed up

198
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,918
in a vending machine in the garage
with the word "agent" on them.

199
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,914
That, to me, is his qualifications.

200
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:07,632
He sent me up for the lead role in Billy Elliot.

201
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:12,682
Yeah, right, the man in charge of my career.
I'm glad you're finding this funny.

202
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:14,479
She's laughing at my life.

203
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,870
Aw.

204
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:19,191
It must be lovely to see her laughing.

205
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,280
She laughs all the time. She lives to laugh.

206
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:26,113
Well, you have to be able to laugh,
don't you?

207
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,350
Keeps you sane.

208
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,078
I thought she was sane?

209
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,549
No, I mean, it keeps anybody sane.

210
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,278
Oh, right, yes. People laughing and...

211
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:39,671
You know, don't you reckon if you can
laugh, you can cope with, like, anything?

212
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:44,025
It's a God-given gift, isn't it?
Laughing in the face of adversity.

213
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:48,354
- You're quite religious, are you?
- Yeah, we both are.

214
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:52,350
We both really believe, right,
that God gives us a struggle

215
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,745
and that's the point of life, isn't it?

216
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:58,670
You know, to overcome
the difficulties thrown at you

217
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:03,511
and the greatest thing is you know
that in heaven, everything will be all right.

218
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:06,473
Maggie, do you believe in God or...?

219
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:09,194
- Yes, I do, I think, yes.
- Oh, great.

220
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:12,711
And what about you, Andy?
Do you believe in God?

221
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:16,422
Like, do you believe
everything will be okay in heaven?

222
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,912
Yeah.

223
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:24,823
- What faith are you?
- What...?

224
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,984
- What faith are you?
- Catholic.

225
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:31,382
- Oh, really? So are we.
- Oh, excellent.

226
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:34,351
Lot of us about and I am definitely one of us.

227
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,347
Catholicism, the "C" word.

228
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,104
Not the "C" word, a "C" word.

229
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:44,499
Heaven, yeah, amazing.
It's going to be brilliant up there.

230
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,547
You're going to have an amazing time,
you'll love it.

231
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:50,305
Be like lbiza or something.

232
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,943
Please, Lord...

233
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:58,100
let us know that you have seen
what we have seen.

234
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,261
Please, Lord.

235
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,427
You have to let us know
that we are not alone.

236
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:28,101
Thank you, Lord.

237
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,143
Cut!

238
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:33,294
Christ, that is bloody hot.

239
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh, fuck, my fucking knees.

240
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,778
- Can we go again on that?
- Not now.

241
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:40,615
- Does it have to be that hot?
- It's okay now.

242
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:44,741
I'm sweating like a bastard.
No wonder they lose their rag sometimes.

243
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:47,781
Oh, hiya. How did it go
with your dirty phone call?

244
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:50,091
Oh, I haven't done it yet. I'm working up to it.

245
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,172
Well, here is another one that's always good.

246
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:55,059
Just do all the preliminary stuff
and then you go, "Hang on,

247
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:59,019
"why is the slut from next door just coming
into my bedroom and is taking her bra off?"

248
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,898
Then you just pretend
you're getting it on with her.

249
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,699
- I couldn't do that.
- Course you can, you're an actress.

250
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,816
No, I'm not. I'm just an extra.
You're the actress.

251
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,617
- A brilliant actress, by the way.
- Yeah, she is.

252
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:15,135
I'm an actor as well as... If there's a line
going in this film, I'd love to be part of this.

253
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:18,892
I'd just like to say, I think, you know,
you doing this is so commendable.

254
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:22,936
Using your profile to keep
the message alive about the Holocaust.

255
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,488
My God, I'm not doing it for that.

256
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:28,534
I don't think we really need
another film about the Holocaust, do we?

257
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:32,131
It's, like, how many have there been?
You know, we get it, it was grim, move on.

258
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:35,731
No, I'm doing it because I've noticed
that if you do a film about the Holocaust,

259
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,567
guaranteed an Oscar.

260
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:40,612
I've been nominated four times, never won.

261
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:44,209
And the whole world is going,
"Why hasn't Winslet won one?"

262
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:46,889
Definitely, yeah.

263
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,401
That's, er, that's why I'm doing it.

264
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,563
Schindler's bloody List.

265
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,291
The Pianist.

266
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,728
Oscars coming out of their arse.

267
00:15:57,772 --> 00:15:59,364
Well, good luck, then.

268
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:01,363
- It's a good plan.
- Thank you.

269
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:04,046
- Good luck with your phone call.
- Okay.

270
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,724
- See you later.
- Bye.

271
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,370
- Can we go again?
- Yeah, let's do it.

272
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,888
And action.

273
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:21,843
Sorry.

274
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,521
Cut there, thank you.

275
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,520
All right, reset, please.

276
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:33,320
- Are you married or single?
- Why?

277
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:38,082
- I think my sister might like you a bit.
- Really?

278
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,043
She's only human.

279
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:59,277
...square head, I must say.

280
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,043
Anyway, I meant to ask you actually,

281
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:03,319
a couple of friends of mine are having
a get together tonight.

282
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:05,315
Wondered if you were free,
would you like to come along?

283
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:06,961
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.

284
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:09,158
Definitely. Ya!

285
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:15,159
Oh, my God,
I've got Jeremy Clarkson's clothes.

286
00:17:15,562 --> 00:17:19,474
- I can't... It's awful.
- Well, what sort of a party is it?

287
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:22,155
Well, she said a get together
with some friends, probably casual,

288
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,471
but I want to look good, don't I?

289
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:26,470
Ooh!

290
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,068
I know. You said
she was quite a classy, stylish...

291
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,718
- Yeah.
...type of lady.

292
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,153
This. Look.

293
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,033
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us,
over the world's tempestuous sea.

294
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:43,791
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us

295
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:46,028
for we have no help but Thee.

296
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:50,386
Yet possessing every blessing
if our God our father...

297
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:52,468
- Lovely suit.
- Thanks.

298
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,593
I like to look good for a prayer meeting.

299
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:57,908
...our God descending,
fill our hearts with heavenly joy.

300
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:59,714
Love with every passion...

301
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,548
How long is this going to take,
out of interest?

302
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:04,070
- An hour and a half.
- Hour and a half!

303
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,387
Time for a drink afterwards?

304
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:08,988
- Yes.
- Yes?

305
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,588
...nothing can our peace destroy.

306
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:15,904
Isn't that lovely?
Thank you, Lisa, it was lovely.

307
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:22,584
Hi, it's me.

308
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,589
Yeah, no, I'm good. You?

309
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:29,901
Good. Yeah, I'm ready.

310
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:31,541
Okay.

311
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:36,180
I'm not wearing anything.

312
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:39,024
No, you're not wearing anything?

313
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:42,182
Hey, both of us are not wearing anything.

314
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,022
What am I doing? Yeah.

315
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,463
Er...

316
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,179
First off, I'm fudding myself stupid

317
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,703
and I'm bloody loving it.

318
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:54,857
Fudding.

319
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,906
I think she wanted me to wear my uniform.
You told her how good I looked in my...?

320
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:00,137
Really nice.

321
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:02,503
Yeah, she really liked it.
Do you know what uniform it is?

322
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,703
German. I know, yeah.

323
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:07,824
With what they did,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

324
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:10,374
I don't think you two
have been formally introduced.

325
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:12,741
- This is Andy, Father.
- How are you, son?

326
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,976
You don't have to do that. I'm not the Pope.

327
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:19,298
No, old habits die hard. My old priest
used to make me kiss him on the ring.

328
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:22,616
On his finger.
There was none of that going on.

329
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:27,261
That makes me sick as well, people saying
priests are paedophiles and kiddie fiddlers.

330
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:31,337
There's probably, I mean, there probably are.
I mean, you probably know some,

331
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:35,052
but it's no higher percentage of perverts in...

332
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:38,897
But they, you know...
They're in all walks of life, aren't they?

333
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:43,658
You know, there are nonces everywhere
but let's not exaggerate it is what I'm saying.

334
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:47,655
I've never been touched by a priest.
I've been touched by God. Not in that way.

335
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:51,290
In the heart but, you know... or...

336
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,452
Er...

337
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,101
Oh, condoms. It's just...

338
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,180
Do we need them? I don't think so.

339
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:03,615
Let the free seed of love gush forth.

340
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,487
Who was your confirmation saint?

341
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:17,857
Mine?

342
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:22,575
- Saint Bernard.
- Saint Bernard?

343
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:25,652
Who was your priest growing up?

344
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:29,732
Father.

345
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,529
Flaa-heer-ty.

346
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:37,964
Flah... Father Michael Flatley.

347
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:39,966
- Michael Flatley?
- O'Flatley.

348
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:41,693
Irish fellow.

349
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:49,972
- And where was his parish?
- Just the parish of where I grew up my town,

350
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,442
the holy parish of Wokingham.

351
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:56,043
I've done a lot of work in the London
and Thames area...

352
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,327
Oh, yeah?

353
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:00,609
...and I've never heard of
a Father Michael O'Flatley.

354
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,443
No, he died.

355
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,449
Dead. Untraceable.

356
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,719
He won't be replaced. Not by me anyway.

357
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,688
He was a great man.

358
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,039
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Go for it.

359
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,965
And it may seem blunt, but honesty
is a cornerstone of the Catholic faith.

360
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,483
Amen to that.

361
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:25,726
- Are you a Catholic?
- Am I a...?

362
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,199
- Are you a Catholic?
- Am I a Catholic?

363
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,838
Well, if you're asking to see
some official documentation,

364
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:38,519
you're going to be gutted.

365
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,917
Have you been confirmed?
Have you ever taken Communion?

366
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,118
No, actually.

367
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,036
- Did Father Flatley exist?
- O'Flatley.

368
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:51,003
Did he ever exist?

369
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:52,835
No.

370
00:21:57,605 --> 00:22:00,038
Why have you been pretending
to be a Catholic?

371
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:01,955
Because it does no harm.

372
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:04,562
Does it?

373
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:09,153
- We've all had a laugh.
- Was it just to get close to me?

374
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,319
Well, I do fancy you if that's...

375
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,920
Even you must think...

376
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:21,957
And I thought you might not get off
with someone who wasn't Catholic.

377
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:26,918
Sorry, I wouldn't get off with you anyway.
I don't believe in sex before marriage.

378
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,112
Really?

379
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,630
In this day and age.

380
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:37,436
Bit annoying, to be honest.

381
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:41,590
I can't believe you lied to me
just to try and sleep with me.

382
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,876
I'd already lied
before I tried it on with you so...

383
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,835
Well, what was the first lie?

384
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:49,991
The f...

385
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:53,711
I didn't want to upset her.

386
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:55,947
Sorry, what do you mean?

387
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,948
- Sorry, what the what?
- What do you mean?

388
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,913
Oh. Oh, well.

389
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:07,864
She was saying the only thing
that keeps her going

390
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:12,426
is the thought that one day she'll be
in heaven and everything will be all right.

391
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:15,711
And I didn't want to go,
"No, you're barking up the wrong tree, love.

392
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,307
"There's no God, there's no heaven.

393
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:20,192
"You're not going to be up there
talking normally and running around...

394
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,152
"Legs and playing volleyball
and everything."

395
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,144
So, I didn't... I said...

396
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:30,387
It's like a white lie, isn't it?

397
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,062
Look, if it makes you feel uncomfortable,
then you shouldn't do it.

398
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,266
- But I want to make you happy.
- I'm happy if you're happy.

399
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:01,579
It's just a silly little thing, isn't it?
I mean, it's a bit of fun.

400
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:03,898
If you're not into it, so be it. That's cool.

401
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:06,023
- Really?
- I'm going out with you because of you.

402
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:07,904
My God, really?

403
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:09,940
- Do you know what?
- What?

404
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:11,176
You're cool.

405
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:13,586
I like to think so.

406
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,020
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

407
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:16,459
- Good.
- All right.

408
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:17,979
- How are you?
- Good.

409
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,296
- Oh, how was the date?
- The date?

410
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:25,697
Erm... oh, good.
Let me just go over some highlights for you.

411
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:28,344
Lied to a priest
in front of a room full of Christians.

412
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:31,177
Some of them elderly,
some of them just weird and bewildered.

413
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:33,414
So insulted them and their belief system.

414
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,698
Made a woman hate me
for the rest of her life.

415
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:39,219
Yeah? Didn't believe in God before.
Definitely going to hell.

416
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:40,702
I liked her as well.

417
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,776
Oh, here, listen, but don't worry.
I know someone who'd be perfect for you.

418
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:49,219
She's desperate and she has trouble hanging
on to men 'cause she's clinically depressed.

419
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:51,975
- Have you got her number?
- I do. I think it's in my phone.

420
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:54,894
I'm being sarcastic because
I don't want to go out with a psychopath.

421
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:57,448
- She's quite nice underneath.
- Oh, she just cuts you

422
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,292
if she forgets to take her lithium.

423
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,450
Hi. How did it go? With the phone?

424
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,418
Oh, oh, this is my boyfriend Mike.

425
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,287
This is Mike, I don't think you've met before.
Mike, this is the actress Kate Winslet.

426
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:10,370
- Hi, Mike.
- Hiya, great to meet you.

427
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,177
- How you doing?
- Do you want a tea?

428
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:14,011
No, it's fine.

429
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,215
So, it's the weekend,
you all got any big plans?

430
00:25:23,297 --> 00:25:26,493
I tell you what we're going to do,
we're going to have a big spring clean.

431
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:29,454
Yeah, my husband's going to be
rummaging around in my basement

432
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,652
while I polish his Oscar.

433
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:36,646
I see what you mean.
No, I'm going to be in the garage probably.

434
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:41,650
Just cleaning the car. Giving the old girl's
headlamps a good soaping up.

435
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,930
Giving them a good seeing to.

436
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:48,212
Can I just say, I mean, you probably get this
all the time, but can I just say I'm a big fan.

437
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:51,604
- I've seen Titanic, like, five times as well.
- Oh, that's sweet.

438
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:54,491
- Have you seen Titanic?
- Yeah, great, brilliant.

439
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:56,882
A lot of it was...

440
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:03,326
It's, erm...
A lot of it is CGI actually, you know that?

441
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:05,482
- Half the boat...
- Really?

442
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:16,205
- What you doing?
- Just checking that.

443
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,282
Is it all right?

444
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah, I think so.

445
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:27,525
So you've told them, have you?
About the phone call?

446
00:26:27,608 --> 00:26:30,076
- No, no, I haven't.
- You've told them about the phone call.

447
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:32,966
I can't believe you told other people.
Hey, where you going?

448
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:34,083
Just...

449
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:36,602
You know everything anyway
so you might as well watch the break-up.

450
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:40,043
- What? No, listen...
- Well, how can I trust you now?

451
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:42,482
Were you really doing anything?

452
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,718
When you said you were rubbing it,
were you really rubbing it?

453
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,604
No.

454
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,205
I don't know what to do.

455
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:51,845
I don't know what to do,
this is such a betrayal.

456
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:54,314
- You're just laughing at me behind my back.
- I'm not.

457
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,236
Then what's all this with her?

458
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,515
- I was getting advice.
- Off Kate Winslet?

459
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,360
Are you proud of yourself? Are you?

460
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,960
You think because
you were in the biggest film ever

461
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:08,114
you've got the right to
mock the little people?

462
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:09,556
No.

463
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:12,111
So that stuff about
your husband polishing his Oscar,

464
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:14,842
- was that supposed to mean wanking?
- Yeah.

465
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,718
And your basement meant?

466
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,314
My fanny.

467
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:25,749
Pathetic.

468
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,438
Thanks very much.

469
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,917
I keep seeing her around.
What is up with her?

470
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,354
She's got cerebral palsy.

471
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:45,512
Oh, that's worth remembering, I tell you.
That is another way you win an Oscar.

472
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,307
Seriously, think about it.
Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot. Oscar.

473
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,387
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, Oscar.

474
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:55,433
John Mills, Ryan's Daughter, Oscar.

475
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,348
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

476
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:01,234
You are guaranteed an Oscar
if you play a mental.

477
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:06,504
- See you later.
- Cheers.

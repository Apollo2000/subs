1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:06,275
For God's sake,
you bloody Yanks are all the same.

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:10,190
You walk round like you're John Wayne
then leave us to clean up your mess.

3
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,793
I've got three embassies baying for blood.

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:17,754
I've got two dead diplomats
and a partridge in a bloody pear tree.

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:20,827
Whitehall's running around
like a bunch of headless chickens.

6
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:24,305
What exactly am I supposed to tell
the Prime Minister?

7
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:32,270
Tell him Uncle Sam's in town.

8
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:37,263
And we'll cut there, thank you.
Check the gate, we're moving on.

10
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,705
Sarge, those lads keep saying,
"Afternoon, Cont-stable,"

11
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:05,752
but making it sound like you know what.
What'll I do to them? Can I hit them?

12
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,710
If I was a real copper, though,

13
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:10,431
I'd get ready like that. I would and I'd have...

14
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:13,470
It's all right, it's only hairspray.
I like my prisoners to look good.

15
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:16,988
Excuse me. Can I just say I thought
you were really brilliant in that scene?

16
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:20,223
Thank you. I didn't really do anything,
I just had to hold this folder.

17
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:23,304
Which you did brilliantly.
Didn't drop it or anything.

18
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:26,429
Well, you know, that's three years
of drama school for you.

19
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,987
- Sorry, I'm Maggie by the way.
- Dan.

20
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,229
- Hi, Dan.
- Hi, Maggie.

21
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,263
Look, I can't really talk now. I have to...

22
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:43,310
Oh, no, sorry. You go and do your thing.
So, I just wanted to say that.

23
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:44,980
Thanks.

24
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,504
- Bye.
- See you.

25
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:48,899
What?

26
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,743
- What? Nothing. Just a normal conversation.
- Stop it.

27
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,663
He just held the file well,
that's all you wanted to say to him.

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,218
- Shut your face. Going to put my pumps on.
- Don't leave me.

29
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,063
- Why?
- What if one of them talks to me?

30
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,869
- Well, they're only human.
- He's not.

31
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,467
- Just two minutes, right?
- Hurry up.

32
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,900
- Quite incredible, eh?
- Huh?

33
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:31,583
- Mr Samuel L. Jackson in our midst.
- No, I'm not Sam Jackson.

34
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,307
I can see your confusion. We look alike.
But...

35
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:39,780
I've hit gold, eh?
I've found the joker in the pack.

36
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,301
I don't know about that.

37
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,777
No, I tell you what, seriously,
that is great, that is mate.

38
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,587
That is brilliant.
That's a gift that is, the gift of laughter.

39
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,544
- You remind me of a mate of mine.
- Yeah?

40
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,777
Pete Shepherd.
Used to run the launderers near me.

41
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:53,540
- God, we used to have a laugh together.
- Did you?

42
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,663
He'd have me in hysterics
every time I saw him.

43
00:02:55,747 --> 00:03:00,025
He was a Chelsea fan, I supported Spurs and
when we met, we'd have a chat and laugh.

44
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:03,986
- Yeah. Why are you telling me this?
- We'd have a chat and laugh every time.

45
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,705
- Good.
- One day, a couple of kids,

46
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,903
they were messing around in his shop,
and they chucked bleach in his eyes

47
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:10,863
and they blinded him.

48
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,856
I went to visit him in the hospital.

49
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:23,104
Tears were coming out of his bandaged,
frazzled, useless eyes.

50
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,098
And he went...

51
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,455
"I don't think I'll ever laugh again."

52
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:32,463
- You know what?
- No.

53
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,177
I don't think he has.

54
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:39,133
I stopped going to visit him in the end,
to be honest.

55
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,978
- That cheer him up?
- Got too depressing, you know.

56
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:44,818
I only used to hang out with him
because he was a laugh.

57
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,464
But, he just got boring.

58
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:50,058
He was miserable blind.
That's not my cup of tea.

59
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:53,378
- "My eyes, my eyes..."
- Andy.

60
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:56,103
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, please don't apologise.

61
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,334
I need someone to do a few lines
sometime next week,

62
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:01,382
probably not until Tuesday,
it's an officer in an ID parade.

63
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,978
- Interested in that?
- I don't mind.

64
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:08,341
Hang on, I was already seen. I was on
the desk when Sam Jackson walked past.

65
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:10,618
Yeah? No, I can't use you then. Sorry, mate.

66
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:12,853
- Need someone who hasn't been seen.
- He hasn't been seen.

67
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:14,581
- I haven't been seen.
- You fancy that?

68
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,540
Sam Jackson comes in,
you're joking around with him

69
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,217
and you go, "Ten to one
he's going to pick Sergeant Harris again."

70
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:21,578
- With Sam Jackson?
- Yeah, you want to have a stab at that?

71
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:22,812
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,370
- I'll let you know when. It won't be today.
- Okay.

73
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:27,180
- Cheers.
- All right.

74
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:33,219
Oh, bloody hell.
A line with Sam Jackson. Cheers for that.

75
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:37,611
- I owe you one.
- Hey, a favour's a favour. Don't worry.

76
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:40,500
- Just take me out one night.
- What?

77
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:43,491
Take me out, on the town, one night.

78
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:03,330
Let's go and eat on the other bus.

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,093
- Why?
- Nothing, no reason. Don't need a reason.

80
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,933
Just let's do something
out of the ordinary once in a while.

81
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,217
- Yeah, all right.
- Bit of a break from the old routine.

82
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,573
Whoa. Where are you going?
You can't come on here, it's actors only.

83
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,094
- I am an actor.
- No, you're background.

84
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,649
- Your bus is over there. This is for actors.
- I am an actor.

85
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,889
No, your voucher is green,
that means you're background.

86
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,733
Okay. So you're judging my entire career
on the colour of my voucher?

87
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,811
No, I'm sure you've had major roles
in other things.

88
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,491
- He hasn't.
- Shut up.

89
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,570
- I can't let you on here. Okay?
- Sure.

90
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,049
There's no one on, though. Can I just
eat here and go? I'll be five minutes.

91
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,571
- I can't allow it.
- No?

92
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,376
You can't come on here.

93
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,450
You've got a perfectly good bus over there.
This bus is for actual actors.

94
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:47,971
Yeah, don't know why I asked!

95
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:51,175
Mental! As if I could go on a bus
meant for other people.

96
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:53,977
- I don't really know him. Can I come on?
- No.

97
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:55,966
Okay.

98
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:58,453
Pig.

99
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,166
Hiya.

100
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:18,770
- Got any more jokes?
- I haven't. No.

101
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,653
- Come on, eh?
- I...

102
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:23,528
What's ET short for?

103
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,925
- Don't know.
- He's only got little legs.

104
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,213
- My uncle was like you.
- Was he?

105
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:33,289
A very funny guy.
Not towards the end, though.

106
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:36,209
Not so much to laugh about towards the end.

107
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,605
Lost both his legs, you see. Thrombosis.

108
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:42,844
There was very little to laugh about
when he knew he was stuck downstairs.

109
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,611
No legs and he could hear his wife upstairs
with another man having it off.

110
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:53,530
Despite the morphine,
he could still hear her up there.

111
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:54,889
At it.

112
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:58,688
They reckon he died of a broken heart
in the end.

113
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:03,291
Still, it's a wonderful gift that.

114
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:06,653
Laughter.

115
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:10,483
Yeah. The gift that keeps on giving.

116
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:14,203
I've got to go and slash my wrists.
I'll see you later, all right?

117
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:16,603
Hey, what are you doing
on Saturday afternoon?

118
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:17,729
Why?

119
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:21,806
I thought you could come round my place,
couple of lads, open a couple of cans.

120
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:25,124
I got a new DVD. Do you know what it is?

121
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:26,646
Vera Drake.

122
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:32,163
Tempting. I've got to watch the game.

123
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,813
It's Chelsea-Man U. So, see you later.

124
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,009
When are we gonna go for that night out?

125
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,851
- What?
- I know a lovely little restaurant.

126
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:44,686
You said shall we go for an evening out
and I didn't say no.

127
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,808
- Are you going back on your promise?
- It's not a promise.

128
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:49,360
- It was.
- You did me a favour, which I thank you for,

129
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:52,922
but I don't think it warrants
a whole evening out, a candlelit meal.

130
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,924
- What's wrong with going for a meal?
- Nothing. But a bit weird.

131
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:58,320
What's weird about a couple of mates
having a meal together?

132
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,562
- We're not really friends...
- But that's how we'll become friends.

133
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:04,085
I go out for meals with people
that are already friends.

134
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:07,288
I don't go up to people and go,
"All right, mate. I don't know you from Adam

135
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,407
"but do you want to go
to Butlins for the weekend?

136
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,846
"You might be a mental case
but let's find out." It's mad.

137
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:13,683
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.

138
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:15,489
What you...

139
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,969
Oh!

140
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,842
- Hi.
- Hello.

141
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,838
- Hi. It's Maggie.
- Yeah, Dan.

142
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,963
- Hi again.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,078
So how long
have you been in this lark, then?

144
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,525
I've only been acting for a couple of years.
Done a couple of plays.

145
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:42,077
I'd like to do more films
but they're hard to come by.

146
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,922
- So, I'm just trying to get into TV.
- Sure.

147
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,046
To be honest, there's not a lot
of black faces needed on television.

148
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,642
No.

149
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,845
- Crimewatch.
- What?

150
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,398
The reconstructions on Crimewatch.
They always need black actors.

151
00:08:56,888 --> 00:09:00,847
Or white actors.
They need black actors and white actors.

152
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:03,726
Depending on who's committed the crime
that day.

153
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,527
I mean, there's criminals, black criminals.

154
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:10,078
Certainly there's white criminals
as well as black criminals.

155
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:14,363
Oh, God!
I've just remembered I've got to go...

156
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,637
Yeah, what was that again? It was the...
It was a bag.

157
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,843
Yes, I'll see you later.

158
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:28,566
Why don't you just tell him
you don't want to be his friend?

159
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,115
It's too damning.
You can't say that to someone.

160
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:34,323
That is saying that you fundamentally
have a problem with their personality.

161
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:37,045
- What are you gonna do?
- The only honourable thing I can do.

162
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,276
- What?
- Add him to the long list of people

163
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,199
that I have to avoid for the rest of my life.

164
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,918
You can never have that time back.

165
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:48,681
I sat through a whole evening of
Comic Relief once because I was...

166
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,279
Sorry, excuse me.

167
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:51,879
- Are you an actress in this film?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,603
- You can't come on here.
- Sorry?

169
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:58,122
You can't come on here. This bus is for
supporting artists and you're an actress.

170
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:01,083
- What are you talking about?
- You've got your own bus there.

171
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,156
And we've got our own bus.
I'm not allowed on yours,

172
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:06,760
you're not allowed on mine,
but you can come on. On you go.

173
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,756
- No.
- This is pathetic.

174
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,642
I know. It is pathetic, isn't it?
But you can't come on.

175
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,443
- Get out the way.
- Look, I don't make the rules here.

176
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:18,084
- You're a child.
- Yeah, well, that's as may be.

177
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:22,916
We'll stick to our own, you stick to your own
and then we're all happy.

178
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,635
- He doesn't think you're a racist.
- He does.

179
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:36,840
He's just seen me say to a black woman,
"You're not allowed to sit on this bus."

180
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:39,357
It's like that whole racism
on a bus incident all over again.

181
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:43,072
- The Rosa Parks incident?
- It wasn't in a park, it was on a bus.

182
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,077
Sure.

183
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:48,155
He doesn't think you're a racist.
And even if he does, which he doesn't,

184
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:50,279
he's wrong because you're not.
Don't worry about it.

185
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:55,311
But what if I am and I don't know it?
What if subconsciously, I'm a little bit racist?

186
00:10:57,002 --> 00:11:00,677
- Well, there is that test I can give you.
- What test?

187
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:03,435
The racism test. The one they give you
when you join the council

188
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:05,831
- to make sure you're not racist.
- I've never heard of it.

189
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,641
- Do you want to do it? Just 10 questions.
- Go on, then.

190
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:11,872
Right, you've got to answer
just totally honestly, okay?

191
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:17,958
Just relax, you've got nothing to
worry about unless you are a racist.

192
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,875
Question one is who would you
rather see with their shirt off?

193
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,917
Brad Pitt or Sir Trevor McDonald?

194
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,196
- Brad Pitt, obviously.
- Obviously.

195
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,918
- What?
- No, I can't say anything till the end.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,833
Right, question two.
This is about racial awareness.

197
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,832
'Cause often you catch out a real racist
because they don't know

198
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,229
or care about any black issues.

199
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,629
Who's the Prime Minister of Great Britain?

200
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,948
- Tony Blair.
- Correct.

201
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,474
Who is the Prime Minister of Namibia?

202
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,517
I don't know.

203
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,715
You knew the white one. Okay, good.

204
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,754
Oh, dear. Who is the Queen of England?

205
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,477
- Queen Elizabeth II.
- Correct.

206
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,629
Who is the President of Djibouti?

207
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:05,109
This is ridiculous.
I've never even heard of blooming Djibouti.

208
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,952
Please do not ridicule
the totally valid African language.

209
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,756
Right, next question.

210
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:12,955
Who would you rather have waiting for you
when you got home tonight?

211
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:15,188
Johnny Depp or OJ Simpson?

212
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:19,436
- Johnny Depp because of the murder thing.
- Because of the murder thing?

213
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:21,634
I think you'll find
that Mr OJ Simpson was acquitted

214
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:23,788
but in your eyes 'cause he's black,
he's still guilty.

215
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:26,950
- People still think he is guilty.
- Racist people still think he's guilty.

216
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,153
- I'm not a racist.
- I'm just going by the test.

217
00:12:29,237 --> 00:12:31,592
I'm trying to get off with a black person.

218
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:34,111
Yes, but according to you,
you wouldn't want him waiting for you

219
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:35,789
in your house when you got home tonight.

220
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:38,027
Only because I would go,
"How did you get in here?"

221
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:41,268
Now he's breaking and entering as well.
Fascist.

222
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:43,712
Right, I'm going to go and ask him out now.

223
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,230
- Hold on.
- Watch.

224
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:48,353
Tell him you had a hate rating of 9.8,
one more than Hitler.

225
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,427
Watch, I'm going now.

226
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:55,188
He said yes.

227
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,586
He is so lovely and totally amazing
and I'm going out for a drink with him.

228
00:12:58,676 --> 00:12:59,870
- When?
- Tonight.

229
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:02,675
- Well done.
- I'm a wee bit nervous about this date.

230
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:04,474
Racist.

231
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:06,592
- Did you get my plate?
- No.

232
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:08,188
You left it.

233
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,393
ANDY: Quick!

234
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:17,305
Oh, very cool. It'd be funny
if you were squashed like that, wouldn't it?

235
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:22,547
Would you rather die of the cold
or die of the heat?

236
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,424
Would you rather be trapped in a freezer
or trapped in a microwave?

237
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,711
- How would you get trapped in a microwave?
- Hiya.

238
00:13:29,794 --> 00:13:31,068
- You going to the station?
- No.

239
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,712
- Going back into town?
- No.

240
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:35,024
- Where you going, then?
- We're just...

241
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:38,070
We're going in here.

242
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:41,305
- Really?
- Yeah.

243
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:42,873
- So...
- Why?

244
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,869
- We're going to visit his mum's grave.
- Yes.

245
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,511
Taking her some flowers and stuff.

246
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,391
- You haven't got any flowers.
- Not taking her some flowers.

247
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:53,510
Collecting the dead flowers
from all the other visits.

248
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,622
That's a bit of a coincidence, isn't it?

249
00:13:56,713 --> 00:14:00,467
She's buried in the graveyard
next to the studio we're working at.

250
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:03,943
- Handy. That's why we're going.
- We'll see you later.

251
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,988
Do you mind if I come with you?

252
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:08,108
Why would I? Come on.

253
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:23,424
You don't have to wait around. I'll be about
half an hour and I get quite emotional so...

254
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,742
That's all right, that's not a worry.
That's not a problem, mate. No.

255
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,948
I've spent a lot of time by graves.
I'm used to it.

256
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:32,022
You take your time. Enjoy.

257
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:35,501
Yeah. Which one is it anyway?

258
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,070
- Which one?
- That one.

259
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,460
- That one.
- The one with the...

260
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:41,184
Yeah.

261
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:45,539
- There she is.
- Rebecca Leibovitch.

262
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,109
Mum.

263
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,499
Sounds Jewish.
I didn't know you were Jewish.

264
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,342
Didn't you? Oy!

265
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,661
Yeah, oy.

266
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,709
Good God, died in 1953.

267
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,781
How old does that make you, then?

268
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,066
- At least 52. 52.
- You're 52?

269
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,344
- Don't look it one bit.
- No, thanks.

270
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:09,067
Hard to believe, isn't it?

271
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,381
Just like it's hard to believe that we were
just passing my dead mother's grave...

272
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:15,778
who is Jewish.

273
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:18,144
She was born in 1893.

274
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:20,868
So she died when she was 60.

275
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:23,666
In childbirth.

276
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:27,184
They warned her. They said,
"Becky, you cannot have a kid at your age."

277
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:29,702
- But old Ma Leibovitch didn't listen.
- No.

278
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:32,507
- And here I am, 52 and Jewish.
- Yeah.

279
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:36,263
- Okay.
- Why did you change your surname, then?

280
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:39,420
Fed up with the persecution.
The usual story, isn't it?

281
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:42,658
Enough is enough, proud race and religion.

282
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,099
- Is your dad round here?
- No.

283
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:46,700
He's still alive.

284
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,106
- Really?
- Apparently.

285
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:50,417
- How old is he, then?
- 100.

286
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:53,146
- He's doing well though for 100.
- Yeah.

287
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:58,303
Do you like taking the mickey out of me?
This fun for you, is it?

288
00:15:58,387 --> 00:15:59,740
What?

289
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,976
That is not your mother's grave.

290
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:05,615
- Oh, no!
- And I don't think you're Jewish.

291
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:08,618
- No she pointed to that...
- Why do you keep lying to me?

292
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,458
- I don't keep lying to you.
- Yes, you do.

293
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:12,935
You said that we were going to go
for a nice meal.

294
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:16,496
Then you went back on that.
Do you think I haven't got any feelings?

295
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:19,862
I know you've got feelings. Which is why
I thought I would avoid the issue.

296
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,743
I don't want to go for a meal with someone...

297
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:25,544
You won't go for a meal with me
because you hate me.

298
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,263
- I don't hate you.
- You hate me so much

299
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:31,418
that you can't bear to sit opposite me, have
a nibble on a bit of food in my company.

300
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:35,054
- I could have a meal with you.
- I know, I'm not the joker of the pack.

301
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:38,376
- That's nothing to do with it.
- All right, I might not be able to do that.

302
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,581
I'm reliable.
If I say I'll be somewhere, I'm there.

303
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,894
I know. I'm quite happy
to have a meal with you.

304
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,815
You're just saying that now because...

305
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,940
- No, I'd like to have a meal with you.
- When?

306
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,343
- Any time.
- Tonight?

307
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,823
- Not tonight.
- See what I mean?

308
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,337
Okay, tonight.

309
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:55,575
Tonight will be fine.
Let's have a meal tonight, okay?

310
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,416
I'm looking forward to it.

311
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,858
Aw... poor... Oh, no. Come on.

312
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:10,973
Louise, 13. Karen, 10.

313
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,256
Haven't seen either of them in three months.

314
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,539
Word of advice, never get married.

315
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,378
And if you do get married,

316
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:26,534
don't let your wife
go to the greengrocer's on her own.

317
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:28,940
- Right?
- Right.

318
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:34,293
She was going out three, four times a week.
Getting fresh fruit and veg.

319
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:38,379
I said to her,
"Why don't we do one big shop?"

320
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:42,857
No, she wasn't having that.
She was always down there.

321
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:46,652
I got suspicious, you know.

322
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:50,336
My wife's going out
8:00 at night to buy cauliflower.

323
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,416
Right, then. What we having?

324
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,138
- Shall I order us some champagne?
- No, it's not appropriate.

325
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,008
We'll have a lager. We'll have a lager each,
down it and go home and watch telly.

326
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,897
In our separate homes.

327
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,210
- I don't... What are you going to have?
- I don't know.

328
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,094
Cor, I just can't decide.

329
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,574
- What a tragic couple we are.
- We're not a couple.

330
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:22,015
His wife left him and I'm out shagging,
regular as clockwork.

331
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:55,137
There's this stallion of a horse, right,
being brought on to set,

332
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:59,608
and whose got to ride it? Me. Okay. All right.

333
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:03,053
So, okay, I can't go out like a chump.
So I big up my chest

334
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:04,889
and I'm going to ride this horse.

335
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,889
- I get on the horse...
- Got to go to the toilet.

336
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:10,250
Yeah, sure, yeah.

337
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:16,245
- What you got there?
- Nothing.

338
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,804
- No, you've got something. What is it?
- No, it's fine.

339
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,409
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

340
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:22,771
Come on, let me see. What you got?

341
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,494
It's just a golliwog... toy.

342
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:30,808
- A golly toy.
- A what?

343
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,095
A golly toy.

344
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:37,965
Don't worry about that, though.
I mean, I have had Sambo... San... Sinbad

345
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:41,491
since I was about six or seven.
He's been in the family for years.

346
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,567
So, I mean, that's harmless.
I think, if I was a racist,

347
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:47,044
I wouldn't be about to do
what we were about to do.

348
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:51,572
Not that I know what we were about to do,
but whatever you want to do I'm up for it.

349
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,929
- Why were you trying to hide it?
- I wasn't hiding it.

350
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:57,609
I was putting it there because it puts me off.
Well, it doesn't put me off.

351
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,845
I was putting them altogether,
all the toys together.

352
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,004
Because all the toys are equal.

353
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,483
Hello. How are you?

354
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:09,567
Hello, there... Hello, there. How are you?

355
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:13,646
I'm fine. I'm not a racist.
In fact, I think I fancy you.

356
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,371
Oh! Oh!

357
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,806
- I think I'm going to shoot off.
- No, really?

358
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,120
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

359
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:36,443
No, it's totally cool. I just think
the black thing's getting in the way here.

360
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:37,647
No, it's not.

361
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,848
Don't worry, I don't think
you're a racist or anything.

362
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:42,321
I just think that it's on your mind
and you can't get past it.

363
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:45,165
So, you know, we should just relax
and rewind things a bit.

364
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:48,289
Okay. Look, can I just say something?

365
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,887
The black thing, it's not an issue.
I hardly notice it, really.

366
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:55,043
Maggie, it's fine. It's cool.
Let's do something next week, shall we?

367
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:56,849
- We'll go out Friday.
- Yes.

368
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,569
- Dinner, dancing?
- Definitely.

369
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:02,041
I love dancing, me. Are you a good dancer?

370
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:05,441
Not that there's any reason
why you should be a good dancer.

371
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:09,249
I have to... I'm going to go.
I'll speak to you tomorrow.

372
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:12,447
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right, see you.

373
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,407
- See you. Okay.
- Bye.

374
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,845
Thanks again for the wine and everything.

375
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,363
- Okay, bye.
- See you.

376
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,922
Oh!

377
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,446
- This is delicious. Try that.
- No, what are you doing?

378
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,848
- Jesus, listen to that.
- What?

379
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,089
That big... fat hippo.

380
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,642
Listen to this, right.

381
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,849
Nothing. I'm two feet away.
Now, listen to him.

382
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:50,316
Oh! He's driving me mental.

383
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:56,160
You really are Mr Grumpy Boots tonight,
aren't you?

384
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:03,241
I can't do this, sorry.
I can't go through with this.

385
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:06,925
I am so fed up.

386
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:09,078
I'm 43 years old

387
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:12,204
and most people my age
are out with their wives or their girlfriends.

388
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,359
I'm sat here having dinner
with another middle-aged man...

389
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:19,716
because I felt sorry for you.
And don't take this the wrong way,

390
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,401
I looked at you and I thought,
"What a pathetic loser."

391
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:25,001
And I took pity on you and that's why I came.

392
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,123
I'm worse off than you in many ways.

393
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:31,404
I'm lower on the chain than you.
How do you think that makes me feel?

394
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:36,682
And I'm not having a go at you
because I know you're a nice bloke.

395
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:40,679
But, I've got to go, mate,
because I'm actually depressed.

396
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:45,559
Wait, I understand.
I know what you're saying.

397
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,081
Look...

398
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:52,954
I got you this as a surprise.
I was going to give it to you later

399
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,878
- but you may as well have it now.
- What is it?

400
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,478
That...

401
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:05,680
is two tickets for the Ben Elton musical,
We Will Rock You.

402
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:23,919
What are you doing?

403
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,113
Oh! Hm...

404
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,713
See you later.

405
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:49,921
Cheers.

406
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,792
I've really had it with all this. I am so fed up.

407
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:06,678
- It'll be all right.
- What will?

408
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:09,912
People always say that.
What'll be all right? When will it be all right?

409
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:13,835
- I'm 43. I've got nothing.
- No, listen, things are looking up.

410
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:17,197
You've got a line
with Samuel L. Jackson, haven't you?

411
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:21,911
- It's a start. Please, don't be like this.
- Oh, it's just...

412
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:25,834
It's just after last night, I was...
How was your evening? Any better?

413
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,079
Word of advice.

414
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,799
If you get the most amazing,
gorgeous, good looking black guy

415
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,475
in the world back at your house,
don't leave your golliwog lying around.

416
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,278
That's remarkable advice, cheers.

417
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,999
Then he caught me trying to hide it
which made matters worse.

418
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,832
Why did you try and hide it?

419
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,037
I didn't want to offend him. And he was right
'cause the black thing was on my mind.

420
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,509
I didn't know whether to talk about
black things or not talk about black things.

421
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,272
I ended up talking about
what I thought he wanted to hear.

422
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,237
Don't pander to him just because he's black.

423
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,038
- Lf he says, "I like reggae," and you don't...
- Which I don't.

424
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,916
...then say you don't.

425
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,991
It's not being racist. It's having an opinion.

426
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,390
- I'll go and have a wee word with him now.
- Aye, go and have a wee word with him.

427
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:11,830
- Hi.
- Hey.

428
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:14,227
- Can I have a quick word?
- Yes, of course.

429
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:16,752
I just wanted to say that I hate reggae.

430
00:25:17,478 --> 00:25:19,196
- Sorry?
- I hate reggae, I hate it.

431
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,828
It's slow, everything sounds the same,
it's boring, I can't be doing with it.

432
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,316
What do you think?

433
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:27,706
- I don't particularly like reggae, either.
- Right.

434
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:29,947
Well, even if you did like it,
I would still hate it.

435
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:32,505
- What sort of music do you like?
- Well, I like jazz.

436
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,588
I hate jazz. I hate it.

437
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:37,635
In fact, do you know
who I really hate in jazz?

438
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:40,914
You know that big fat black man?
Him with the big fat puffed out cheeks

439
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,352
and his bulging out eyes and everything,
he's like trumpet man.

440
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:47,109
- Sasquatch...
- Satchmo. Louis Armstrong.

441
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:50,426
- Oh, yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

442
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:53,709
- Do you hate all jazz?
- Yeah, that's just my opinion.

443
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:56,310
It's not based on anything else
other than the music

444
00:25:56,396 --> 00:26:00,025
because I hate anybody doing it,
you know, like black or white.

445
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:03,425
Sorry, we were just having
a conversation about music.

446
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:05,426
Obviously, she doesn't hate jazz.

447
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:08,427
Yes, I do, but I like
lots of other things, white or black.

448
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:12,554
- I like you, for example. I think you're great.
- Thank you.

449
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:17,265
I don't normally watch films more than once,
but I thought The Matrix, I loved it.

450
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:20,108
- It was amazing.
- Yes, it's a good film.

451
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:23,584
- Good film, that's all she's saying.
- And you were brilliant in it.

452
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:26,830
I wasn't in that one.

453
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,632
- Wasn't in it.
- Yeah, you were.

454
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,386
- He should know.
- You were in The Matrix.

455
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:31,873
- He was the main one.
- No.

456
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:35,230
No, I can assure you I was not in The Matrix
but Laurence Fishburne was.

457
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:37,874
- That's why you're confused.
- I know what you're thinking.

458
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:40,184
She doesn't think you all look alike.

459
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:43,826
If that's... what you were thinking.

460
00:26:43,913 --> 00:26:47,952
No, I'm just saying she doesn't...
She's not racist.

461
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:50,149
- No, sir.
- No way, she's not a racist.

462
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:54,021
In fact, she's been trying to get a black guy
to shag her for a few weeks so...

463
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,466
That one.

464
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:59,307
Specifically. But, I mean, it's open to all.
Not all, I mean, you... definitely.

465
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:01,269
I know you're married

466
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:04,742
but, if you wanted to,
you could be up her like a rat up a drainpipe.

467
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,704
Yeah. Okay.

468
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,345
Pulp Fiction.

469
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:24,788
- Are we ready for the next shot?
- Yeah, are we ready yet?

470
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:29,101
Why are they keeping him waiting...?

471
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,142
- Can I see you about...
- Yeah, we're off. We're off.

472
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:37,462
Yeah, but we can't because you've got
the line with Samuel L. Jackson.

473
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:40,428
I haven't, that's the point.
I haven't got a line with Samuel L. Jackson

474
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,740
because the line "Right up a drainpipe".

475
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,060
Okay, well, cheers, everyone. Thanks.

476
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,383
That's my hat there.

477
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,428
Yeah, that's it.
Another good day being friends with you.

478

1
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:04,983
What's on your mind? Seriously, talk to me.

2
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:07,985
Why am I not getting any acting roles?

3
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:10,786
I've been thinking about this.
I'm glad you brought it up.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,781
I've got a feeling it could be your shape.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,580
It is a very unusual shape and I'm not sure
who would be looking for it.

6
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:19,869
- Could you maybe do a bit more exercise?
- Could you maybe do a bit more work?

7
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:23,831
- I don't know...
- We can banter all we like but, I mean,

8
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:27,952
if you insist on remaining, you know, a blob,

9
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:30,787
could you maybe at least get a tan?

10
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:33,342
They're looking for a fat bloke
with a tan, are they?

11
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:36,984
What's that for?
Oliver Stone's story of Buddha?

12
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:41,149
Before I get up and walk out of here,
possibly forever,

13
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:44,946
- have you got anything for me at all?
- Loads of stuff.

14
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:50,112
Do you fancy panto in Guildford
with Les Dennis?

15
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:51,426
No.

16
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,677
- What, that's it?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:00,471
- You said there was loads of stuff.
- I thought you'd go with that one.

18
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,478
What's the role?

19
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,280
It is the part of the Genie in Aladdin.

20
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,830
They're happy with a fat bloke for that,
are they?

21
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:13,360
With a tan ideally.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,074

23
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:39,482
I promise you,
listen, I've done a panto before.

24
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:42,720
- Ah! Andy Millman, this is Les Dennis.
- Hi. I know who you are.

25
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:44,037
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,166
- Andy is playing our Genie.
- Oh, no, really?

27
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,478
Yeah.

28
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,879
- Could Chris Biggins not do it?
- He was busy.

29
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,483
- Biggins was busy?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,562
That's a nightmare.

31
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:56,562
What about John Thomson off Cold Feet?

32
00:01:56,651 --> 00:02:00,201
Well, he was available but he screwed up
the audition. He was very nervous.

33
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,771
Yeah, he can get nervous. That's a shame.

34
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,969
Sorry, can I just say,
if you're interested in a famous face,

35
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:05,805
I represent Barry from EastEnders.

36
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,408
Not for this part though, no.
It's too late, isn't it?

37
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:10,052
This part's taken, innit?

38
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:12,285
What about Jono Coleman?
I thought he was up for it.

39
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:16,527
Yes, but since he did Celebrity Fit Club
he's... Well, he's just not fat enough.

40
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:20,291
I've got Barry on the phone now,
if you're interested...

41
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,208
No point, is there? No, the vacancy's filled.

42
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,686
Remember you took
12 and a half percent, ring any bells?

43
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,529
Sorry, Barry.

44
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:28,574
No one on the list was available, then?

45
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:33,096
No, and in the end we were running out
of time and we just got desperate so...

46
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:01,743
Fantastic!

47
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,304
- Andy.
- Hi.

48
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,616
- Can I introduce this gorgeous creature?
- Hello.

49
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,537
- This is Simone.
- Hi.

50
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:12,699
Show him your ring. Engagement ring.
Cost an arm and a leg.

51
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:16,667
Didn't want you seeing her and thinking,
"Who's that stunner? I'll make her mine."

52
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:19,262
- Hands off, she's taken.
- Silly.

53
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:23,419
I'm going to have to
get going, sweetheart. See you later.

54
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,261
- Nice to meet you.
- See you later.

55
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,183
Bye. Bye, darling.

56
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:34,424
Save it for later.

57
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:43,262
Eh? We asked 100 people,
"Which comedian is going to land on his feet

58
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:45,390
"and get his end away
with an absolute cracker?"

59
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:49,228
You said, "Les Dennis," our survey said,
"Ding, top answer!" Jammy bastard.

60
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:51,590
Yeah, well done.

61
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:54,793
Still, it's about time I had
a bit of good luck, isn't it?

62
00:03:57,676 --> 00:04:00,032
The stuff that's happened to me,
been in the papers.

63
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:02,187
- I don't know.
- You do.

64
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,553
- Did you watch me on Celebrity Big Brother?
- It was good.

65
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:07,914
Might have been entertaining for you,
but I was at my lowest ebb.

66
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,513
The shit that was flying around
before I went in.

67
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,354
I remember I was sitting there one day
thinking, "What's the point, eh?

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,431
"What is the point?"

69
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,799
And... l've never really
told anybody this before.

70
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,439
Okay.

71
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,399
- I even considered suicide.
- Oh!

72
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:26,712
Yeah, actually thinking
I'm going to end it all.

73
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:30,034
I'm thinking, "I'll do it here, live on telly.
That will show them."

74
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,958
And as I was thinking about it,
Melinda Messenger came in, lovely girl.

75
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,842
- She was chatting away.
- Took your mind off it?

76
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:40,804
Yeah, I was looking at her tits. Lovely.

77
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,644
And I was thinking, "Come on, Les,
look at them. Life is worth living after all."

78
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:48,844
I mean, I'd seen them loads of times
in the papers and on the telly,

79
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:50,679
but when you're face to face with them...

80
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,680
- Live.
...you go, "Yeah, well done."

81
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:56,726
Yeah, that's a lovely story.

82
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:01,923
Hello, Heat Magazine.

83
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,605
Yeah, hi. Do you deal with
the Celebrity Spotted section?

84
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,127
- Can do, yeah. Why, who have you seen?
- Well, I just spotted Les Dennis,

85
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:11,679
the comedian and impressionist
and actor Les Dennis.

86
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,161
I just spotted him
shopping in New Bond Street.

87
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:16,561
Doubt he can afford much around there,
can he?

88
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,325
Well he can because I just saw him

89
00:05:18,413 --> 00:05:21,211
and he was spending
a fucking shit load of cash, all right?

90
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:24,013
So put that in. Make sure you put that in.

91
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:27,934
- Hello.
- Hiya.

92
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:30,006
I just wanted to introduce you
to my friend Maggie.

93
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:32,325
- Hello, Maggie.
- Hello, pleased to meet you.

94
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,852
Nice to meet you, too. What are you doing
with this reprobate? You two an item?

95
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,007
- Oh, Christ, no.
- All right.

96
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:41,692
No, I'm just here visiting him.
It's the first time he's treaded the boards.

97
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:44,576
Oh, well, theatre. The stories I could tell you.

98
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:48,732
It's where it all started for me,
up and down the country. Great to be back.

99
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,287
Things have changed a bit, mind.

100
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,690
There was a time when I wouldn't have had
to share a dressing room.

101
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,181
Back in the day I'd have had
two dressing rooms if I'd wanted.

102
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:01,971
One for me, one for all the cards
and flowers from all the well-wishers.

103
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,622
Little presents and things they sent me.

104
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:09,700
Don't need a whole dressing room
for those three, do you?

105
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:13,893
No.

106
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:20,982
What were you doing?
You said you had to...

107
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:23,102
- What?
- You were about to do something.

108
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:25,905
Yeah, I've got to go to the post office.

109
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:30,183
- See you later.
- Yeah, it was really nice to meet you, bye.

110
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,259
- Yeah, nice to see you, bye.
- Bye.

111
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,340
One and two, three and four,

112
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:43,228
five, six, seven, eight.

113
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,189
One and two, three and four,

114
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,660
five, six, seven, eight.

115
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:51,346
All right, stop, stop, stop.
You're missing something.

116
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,900
I'm not getting something.
What is it? What am I not getting?

117
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:56,507
- What am I looking for?
- I know.

118
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,150
Somebody else.

119
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,906
- Yes?
- 110%% .

120
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,985
You should be giving me a 110%%
all of the time,

121
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:06,226
but that is not what I was thinking of.
What am I looking for?

122
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:07,953
- Okay.
- T and T.

123
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:12,791
Correct. T and T. And what is T and T?
Come up here and show them.

124
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:17,589
T and T. Tits and teeth, yes. Tits and teeth.

125
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:20,238
And before any of you have me
up on sexism charges,

126
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:22,036
do not forget this is my daughter.

127
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,473
That is all right. One more time...

128
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:28,393
- I know that girl.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

129
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,278
Hold on, his daughter?
But he's definitely gay.

130
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,195
He can't be gay if he's got a daughter.

131
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,274
- Oscar Wilde was married with two kids.
- Well, he couldn't have been gay.

132
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,512
- What, Oscar Wilde?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:44,117
- I've got to stop hanging around with you.
- That's lunch, back at 2:00.

134
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,360
I do know her.

135
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:53,203
- Oh, hi.
- Hiya.

136
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:56,800
Maggie! Do you remember me?
Lizzie Bunton?

137
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,003
Daddy? We worked on that
BBC kids' show together,

138
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:02,441
- The Orphans of Penny Farthing Lane.
- Penny Farthing Lane.

139
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:04,039
Brilliant that.

140
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:08,439
Daddy, this is my friend Maggie.
We worked on Orphans together.

141
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:11,679
Hello, nice to meet you.
Lan Bunton, everyone calls me Bunny.

142
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:15,364
- Oh, already started your lunch I notice.
- It's a banana.

143
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:17,917
# Food glorious food

144
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,365
# Hot sausage and mustard

145
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,362
# While we're in the mood

146
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,646
# Cold jelly and custard #

147
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,490
- No, no, no, no. Cust-terd.
- # Custard #

148
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:32,042
- No, come on, cust-terd.
- # Custard #

149
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:34,601
# Cust-terd #
# Custard #

150
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,571
- Don't worry about it.
- No, come on.

151
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:40,009
# Custard #
# Cust-terd #

152
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:41,288
# Custard #

153
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:45,732
There. See, if something's worth doing,
it's worth doing correctly. Must dash.

154
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,167
I'll catch up with you later, then.

155
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:49,484
- Yes.
- Definitely.

156
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,009
Bye-bye.

157
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,167
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

158
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:54,929
Give her a kiss.

159
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:58,249
- Don't.
- Oh, where have you been hiding her?

160
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:02,246
Oh, she's really lovely
but she's a wee bit mental.

161
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:06,298
- Of course she's mental. Her dad's a gay.
- He can't be gay.

162
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,136
Ho, ho, ho! Smarties. Yum, yum, yum.

163
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,544
- Les, you all right, mate?
- Hiya.

164
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,663
- You all right?
- Yeah.

165
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:46,545
- What have you got in your little bag?
- It's the local paper.

166
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,380
Don't want to blow my own,
not with my back,

167
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:50,902
but there's a little article in here.
Hi, darling. Listen to this.

168
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,378
"Family Fortunes loser Les Dennis

169
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:56,746
"is on the comeback trail
thanks to a starring role in Aladdin.

170
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,866
"Things are looking up for Les, 50,

171
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,183
"who recently announced his engagement
to beautiful fiancיe Simone Lewis, 26.

172
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,501
"With an age gap of a quarter of a century,

173
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,901
"Dennis is clearly punching
above his weight again

174
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:10,381
"but insists they are very much in love."

175
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:13,146
- Marriage, faithfulness.
- Do you want to get some lunch, darling?

176
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,872
- I can't, I promised I'd meet a friend.
- A friend.

177
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:17,945
- Do you want some money?
- Yes, please.

178
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,262
- Fifty okay?
- Yeah.

179
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:20,946
Bit much for lunch, innit?

180
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,753
- Bye.
- Bye.

181
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:26,190
- Alone again.
- Yeah.

182
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:29,074
- Do you want to get some lunch?
- I can't. I've already eaten.

183
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,384
Yeah?

184
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:33,469
- But I'll come for a coffee with you.
- Yeah.

185
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:36,311
Yeah, course I will, course I will.
If that's what you want.

186
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:38,389
Yeah. Thanks.

187
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,915
Come on, then, what shall we have?

188
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,159
Maggie.

189
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,719
- Oh, it's you.
- Hello.

190
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,520
I'm trying to find my way out of here.
It's like a blooming maze.

191
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,798
- Come in. This is my dressing room.
- Oh, look at it.

192
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,713
I share this with the other girls in the chorus.

193
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,633
Yeah? Where are they?

194
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:02,716
I think they've all gone to lunch.
Sometimes they forget to invite me.

195
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:05,122
Right.

196
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:08,162
- What are you doing on Sunday?
- What, this Sunday?

197
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:09,279
I'll tell you what you're doing.

198
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,401
- You're coming to my party.
- My sister might be...

199
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:16,241
It's going to be my birthday on Sunday
and I'm having a party. I'm going to be 29.

200
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:20,081
It's very important and I'm just inviting
my very best friends like you.

201
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,361
Yeah.

202
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,484
It's going to be brilliant.
Oh, my parties are always great.

203
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,638
- Yeah?
- Please come.

204
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,798
There will be entertainment there
and everything.

205
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,641
- Oh, well.
- Please, please.

206
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:33,368
- Oh, I'm just thinking...
- You must! You must!

207
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:37,167
- Okay, then.
- Brilliant.

208
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,481
Let me just check with Daddy
that that's okay.

209
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:41,960
Yeah, you'd better check with him first.

210
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:46,407
- Do not come in!
- Daddy, it's Lizzie.

211
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,960
I won't be a minute. Do not come in!

212
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:52,329
I'm just finishing up a meeting.

213
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:07,375
Okay, we've finished.
This is an old friend. Bye, Paul.

214
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,169
And old friend.

215
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:11,451
- Daddy.
- Yes?

216
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:14,211
- Can Maggie come to my party, please?
- Of course, dear.

217
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:17,335
The little bastard's pinched my watch.

218
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:19,330
- He nicked your watch?
- It's fine...

219
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,728
- Call the police.
- Do not call the police!

220
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:25,495
And don't tell your mother, she'll only worry.

221
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,213
That happened before, didn't it?
With your mobile phone?

222
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,940
- The crime rate's through the roof.
- Yeah.

223
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,984
- You all right?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,264
Cheer up. Turn that frown upside down.

225
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,224
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

226
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,776
- Is everything okay? You look a bit down.
- No, I'm fine.

227
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,540
If you're worried about the audiences,
don't be.

228
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:08,178
They're always a bit thin early on but
they'll pick up as we get towards Christmas.

229
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,067
We've got the press in tonight,
they'll rave about it. It's a good show.

230
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,981
Oh, it is, yeah.

231
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,903
- Can I ask your opinion about something?
- Yeah.

232
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,743
- What do you make of Simone?
- She's fine.

233
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,105
- Beautiful girl.
- Yeah.

234
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,751
- Lovely girl, I'm very lucky.
- You are, yeah.

235
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:24,710
- When is the wedding?
- We're thinking June, July.

236
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:28,866
Summer wedding. That'll be good if, when...
Well, it will happen, I suppose.

237
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:32,187
- Congratulations again.
- Oh, cheers, mate, cheers.

238
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:38,507
- I can't marry her.
- Why? What have you heard?

239
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:41,029
- Nothing. What do you mean?
- No, what did you say?

240
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:44,791
It's just that I've been doing a bit of thinking
and I just don't think I can marry her.

241
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:47,630
It's not fair. I mean, don't get me wrong.

242
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:49,435
- Funny little switch.
- Nothing wrong physically.

243
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:50,666
I'm sure.

244
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:53,591
The sex is extraordinary.
Some of the stuff she dreams up.

245
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,509
What is that for?

246
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:58,591
She likes to video us
and we watch it back together.

247
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,434
And sometimes I can't believe
it's my arse going up and down.

248
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,799
- I'm getting excited just thinking about it.
- Well, think about something else, then.

249
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:10,112
It will break her heart
but now I'm back on the up and up.

250
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:13,877
The papers is just the beginning. I'll be in
the full glare of the media spotlight again.

251
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:15,600
- I can't put her through that.
- No.

252
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:16,832
- She's young.
- Yeah.

253
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,153
- She can't take that pressure.
- Probably not.

254
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:23,920
Who knows what this will lead to?
More TV, maybe even Hollywood.

255
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:28,438
I just think I'm better off letting her go now
before she falls in love with me any deeper.

256
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:30,322
I think you're making the right decision

257
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:33,443
and I'm so glad you said this
because it's a weight off my mind.

258
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:36,883
I saw her getting off with the stagehand
and that's who she's with now.

259
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,923
Well, I wasn't going to say anything
but you...

260
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:43,240
Oh, I wish I hadn't, but you were
going to finish it anyway and I...

261
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,724
You're not upset, are you?

262
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,606
The house is open, gentlemen...

263
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:57,685
Sorry.

264
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:02,127
- Les, cover it up, mate.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,285
I'll shut the door.

266
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:16,367
Look, Wishy, what's this?
It looks like the magic lamp.

267
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:18,969
- What do you think I should do?
- Just leave it here.

268
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,532
What do you think, gang?

269
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:25,007
Should I just leave it here
or should I give it a rub?

270
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,650
Give it a rub.

271
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:29,775
- What? Can't hear you?
- Rub it.

272
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,769
- Rub it?
- Yes.

273
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:35,215
Okay. If you say so, I'll rub it. Here goes.

274
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,852
- Blimey, what a big puff.
- Cheeky. Hmm.

275
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,980
- Who are you?
- Well, I'll be anyone you want me to be,

276
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:54,293
but you can call me Genie.

277
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,303
How does somebody as big as you
fit into this tiny lamp?

278
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:02,660
Don't worry about it, I'm used to
squeezing myself into tight holes.

279
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:06,374
Oh! No pain, no gain.

280
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:11,299
Can you help us?
We're in danger, the evil Abanazar is after us.

281
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:15,141
- What makes you think that?
- We heard him say he wants to get Aladdin.

282
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:17,183
Don't we all?

283
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,102
Abanazar has a glorious ring.

284
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:36,460
I know the line. What's the point though, eh?

285
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,546
They don't care. Look at them.

286
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:43,507
- You lot enjoying yourselves?
- Yeah.

287
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:45,629
Yeah, well tell your faces.

288
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:49,546
And maybe some of your friends as well,
get them along.

289
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,273
The empty seats aren't laughing much,
are they?

290
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:56,348
- Get on with it.
- You bloody get on with it. Ignorant.

291
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:02,108
How many of you
are thinking of leaving at half-time?

292
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:08,269
Even less people here then, won't it?

293
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:11,077
Even more embarrassing
for those that have stayed.

294
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,237
- Where do you want to go from?
- How about 1992?

295
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:26,274
No, where do you want to go
from in the script?

296
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,320
I don't know.
Just do some more of the queer shit.

297
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:31,553
Let's just get through it, shall we?

298
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:36,434
Oh, I've been in that lamp so long
I'm bent out of all recognition.

299
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:50,077
- Hello!
- Hi.

300
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,965
- Come in. Look at you.
- Thank you.

301
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:56,847
Everyone, this is Maggie.

302
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,446
Hello, Maggie.

303
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,122
You know Dad.

304
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,126
That's Maureen and John and Barbara
and Len and that's Nana.

305
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:17,520
We're just waiting for Frank and Jean.
They said they'd be here by 8:00.

306
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:21,401
- What time is it dear?
- About 8:00.

307
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:25,566
Irene, fetch the Glade. Nana's let off again.

308
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:27,645
Why don't you sit next to Nana?

309
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:36,048
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.

310
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,328
- There you go.
- Thanks.

311
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,892
Thanks for doing this tonight
on your only night off.

312
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:51,130
- It's not a chore.
- I was scared to be alone tonight.

313
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,449
Bit worried about
what I might do on my own.

314
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,417
- Well, you're not alone.
- No.

315
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,337
We asked 100 people,
"Will Les Dennis ever hang on to a bird?"

316
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,139
Our survey said...

317
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:02,415
We asked 100 people,

318
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,891
"Do you want to go out tonight
and watch Les Dennis in panto?"

319
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,018
Our survey said...

320
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,298
Why don't people want to come out
and see Les Dennis?

321
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,339
- They do.
- Why don't twice as many?

322
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:14,062
Well, because you're competing
with a lot these days, aren't you?

323
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:17,295
- Internet, DVDs.
- Where did it all go wrong, eh?

324
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,978
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

325
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,455
- You're a comedian, right?
- Yeah.

326
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:30,056
- I haven't seen you make a joke in five years.
- What do you mean?

327
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:33,298
When you're on telly and stuff, when
you're on chat shows or in Big Brother.

328
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,618
You're talking to the chickens
but you're moaning about stuff.

329
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,300
That's the way they cut it.

330
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:41,462
There you go, moaning about stuff.
Make a joke about it. Make a joke.

331
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,541
What was that impression you used to do?

332
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,427
Lmpressions. I did loads.

333
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,740
- What was it?
- Mavis Riley, Coronation Street.

334
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,867
- Do that.
- No, I'm not doing that.

335
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,145
- Do it.
- No!

336
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,030
- Go on.
- "I don't really know."

337
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:56,990
- That's great.
- Yeah, I know. It is good, yeah.

338
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,985
You need another one, she hasn't really
been on telly for 15 years, but...

339
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,064
- Yeah.
- Good.

340
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:03,826
Correct me if I'm wrong,

341
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:07,827
but I'm famous for more than a Mavis Riley
impression and Family Fortunes.

342
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,105
I am famous for other things, aren't I?

343
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:12,514
Er...

344
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,269
The Les Dennis Laughter Show?
Russ Abbot's Madhouse?

345
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:16,755
- Were you in that?
- Yeah.

346
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:20,273
- Well then, if you...
- You don't remember. Nobody remembers.

347
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:22,188
That's why I'm in a shitty little panto

348
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:24,553
where the only people laughing
were that bunch of gays.

349
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:27,870
- Nothing wrong with gays.
- I know. But they'll laugh at anything.

350
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,792
No victory making a bunch of gay fellows
laugh. They'll laugh at anything.

351
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,711
- Look at that Graham Norton.
- He's all right, isn't he?

352
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,358
Is he? Is this funny, is it?

353
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,195
"Oh, look at this website
about cocks and fannies!"

354
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,875
"Oh, Jackie Collins, what lovely tits!"

355
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,760
"Do you like a cock up your arse? Oh!"
Is that funny?

356
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,276
It is quite funny when you do it,
but keep it down a little bit.

357
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,001
- We're in a pub.
- What is that?

358
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,472
I want to do something more high brow.
Oscar Wilde or something.

359
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:52,077
Yeah, definitely. He was gay.

360
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:54,394
I know, but not in the same way,
he was clever.

361
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:56,679
Would this have been funny,
him going through customs,

362
00:20:56,764 --> 00:20:59,074
"I have nothing to declare but my genius."

363
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:04,479
"Oh! And this vibrating tongue
for pleasuring fannies! Oh!" Is that funny?

364
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06,443
Again, quite funny when you do it,

365
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:09,678
but it's Sunday, can you keep
the fannies down to a minimum?

366
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:13,318
Why can't I just stay in this?

367
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:16,241
Because that is not the costume
we said you'd wear.

368
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:19,082
Olivia Newton John
wouldn't be seen dead in that.

369
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:21,843
Look, just do as you're told, will you?

370
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:36,450
- I'm changing, I'm changing.
- It's me, it's Maggie.

371
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,527
Hi.

372
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:42,572
Your mum said I had to come up
and have a look at all your awards

373
00:21:42,654 --> 00:21:44,645
- and cups and...
- Oh. Here they are.

374
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:47,408
- Wow, look at that.
- Gymnastics.

375
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:50,649
- Second, second, first.
- First, that one.

376
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:56,647
Lots of photographs of your dad there,
doing his... Whatever he's doing.

377
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,848
I don't see any photographs
of you with your friends.

378
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:04,248
- Have you got any friends your own age?
- Yeah, you. You're my best friend.

379
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:07,137
- Apart from me?
- Well, all the friends downstairs.

380
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:08,937
They're all friends, they're all old friends.

381
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:12,456
They are old friends. It looks like the cast
of Last of the Summer Wine down there.

382
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,136
Dad said when I'm famous
that I'll have all the friends I'll need.

383
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:18,576
He said I'd have too many friends.

384
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:20,220
Do you enjoy all this, though?

385
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:24,056
I mean, really,
all this dressing up and performing?

386
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,417
Yeah, I love it.

387
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:28,700
But do you, though? Is this what
you want to do or is it what your dad wants?

388
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,695
Dad knows what's good for me.

389
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,696
I've been doing this
since I was two, it's in my blood.

390
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:36,299
But it wasn't your ambition
when you were two, was it?

391
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:40,101
I mean, I think you seem to be missing out
on a whole load of stuff.

392
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:42,984
Just... I think he's suffocating you a bit.

393
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:46,978
You're making me sad and it's my birthday.

394
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,136
Sorry.

395
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:02,141
# Anything you can do I can do better

396
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,984
# I can do anything better than you

397
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:06,629
# No, you can't
# Yes, I can

398
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:07,746
# No, you can't

399
00:23:07,831 --> 00:23:09,026
# Yes, I can

400
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:11,945
# Yes, I can, yes, I can #

401
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:13,910
# Well-a, well-a, well-a uh!

402
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,870
# Tell me more, tell me more

403
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,784
# Was it love at first sight?

404
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,705
# Tell me more, tell me more

405
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,432
# Did she put up a fight?

406
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:24,791
# A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha

407
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:28,944
# Ah-a, ah-a, ah-a, ah-a #

408
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:32,150
# Well, you've got to speed it up

409
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,910
# And then you've got to slow it down

410
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,069
# 'Cause if you believe
that a love can hit the top

411
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:40,467
# You've got to play around

412
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,198
# And soon you will find
that there comes a time

413
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,951
# For making your mind up

414
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,677
# For making your mind up

415
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,479
# For making your mind up

416
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,440
# For making your mind up #

417
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:06,279
- Sorry, Dad.
- Don't apologise to me.

418
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,924
Apologise to the audience
who thought that you ruined it.

419
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:12,714
That was bad. It was bad
because we did not do enough rehearsal.

420
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:16,161
- I was getting ready for my birthday.
- We were all getting ready for your birthday.

421
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,521
Some of us found time to practise
and some of us didn't

422
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,643
because you were too busy worrying
about a stupid bloody dress.

423
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,922
And now you have let down your public.

424
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:26,123
- What is the golden rule?
- Never let down your public.

425
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:28,164
Never let down your public.

426
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:32,481
Well, you have let them down and you've
let me down and you've let yourself down.

427
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:36,922
Enjoy the rest of the day. Maybe next time
you'll listen to your silly old daddy.

428
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,207
- Maggie was right.
- Why? What did Maggie say?

429
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,521
- This is weird.
- I didn't say weird.

430
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,728
I should have friends my own age
like she said.

431
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:48,451
You do look like the cast
of Last of the Summer Wine.

432
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:52,242
- Great show.
- I want to start living my own life.

433
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:56,691
Do you know what I want to do in life?
No, because you've never asked me.

434
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:07,012
Well, well, well.

435
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:10,805
It seems quite a poisonous element
has entered our little home.

436
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:13,536
- Quite a nasty little piece of work.
- Can I just say...

437
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:16,086
I think that you should go,
you have done quite enough damage.

438
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:19,250
Oh, God, this is daft, this is silly...

439
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:23,014
It's his house.
If he wants you to leave, you should leave.

440
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:35,373
Bye, Nana. Yeah. Bye, everybody.

441
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:40,860
Oh, I just want to say, do you mind
if I take a couple of sandwiches for the train?

442
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:44,140
I haven't eaten since 4:00
and I've got no food in the house.

443
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:46,374
Didn't think I was going to get
chucked out of the party.

444
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:49,501
You should have thought of that
before you fucked up my daughter's life.

445
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:51,303
- Good night.
- Okay.

446
00:25:55,706 --> 00:25:59,585
When the laughter stops,
when the audience departs,

447
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:03,785
when the make-up has been removed,
what is left of the clown?

448
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:06,537
Nothing but an empty costume.

449
00:26:09,228 --> 00:26:12,380
I should have listened to that.
Do you know who said that?

450
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:15,223
- Jean Paul Sartre?
- Bobby Davro.

451
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,827
Davvers took me aside, he said, "Beware,
Les, you won't always be riding high."

452
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,061
But I wasn't even listening.

453
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:26,145
I was too busy telling him some of the funny
answers we get on Family Fortunes.

454
00:26:26,232 --> 00:26:29,942
Have I ever told you any of those?
Like I said to this woman,

455
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:32,308
"Name something red."
She said, "My cardigan."

456
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:36,592
How could that have been up there?
We survey 100 people, how'd they know?

457
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:39,553
"Name a domestic pet,"
this fella said, "Leopard."

458
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:41,307
- That's not domestic, is it?
- No.

459
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:42,794
No way.

460
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,193
What about her?

461
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:48,665
No, I'm not interested in birds anymore.

462
00:26:48,756 --> 00:26:52,432
They just bleed you dry and
then they're off out the door. Bye-bye.

463
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:54,554
She's been looking at you all night.

464
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:58,794
She's pissed up. She's a pissed up slapper.

465
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:02,471
I'm not about to have a one night stand
with a pissed up slapper

466
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,235
just to make myself feel a bit better.
I've still got some dignity.

467
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:22,078
Hello?

468
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:25,679
Would you rather have a bionic arm
or a bionic leg?

469
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:30,043
Good question.
Bionic leg so I could hop to work.

470
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,922
So would I. I'd have a bionic leg
but it would be for kicking.

471
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:38,397
Actually, I tell you what, a bionic arm
would come in useful some nights.

472
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:41,481
- How do you mean?
- Doesn't matter.

473
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:45,202
- I'm starving. Have you eaten anything?
- No.

474
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:48,602
Can I come over and cook you something?

475
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:51,328
It's 11:30. And you can't cook.

476
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:56,521
- Fair point. Well, see you tomorrow, then.
- Yeah.

477
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,166
- Bye.
- Bye.

478
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:16,609
Is that good? Is that good?
I don't really know.

479
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,168
What?

480
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:23,010
If it's up there,
I'll give you the money myself.

481
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:25,934
Get off me.

482
00:28:26,305 --> 00:29:26,361

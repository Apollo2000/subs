00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,371
Right, Mr Yamaguchi's on his way up
now with his lovely wife.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,416
As you know he's thinking of investing in us.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,298
And if he does, it'll be the best thing
that happened to this company

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,610
since old Gladys the cook
burnt down the canteen.

(CHUCKLING)

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,257
She wasn't a bad cook.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,298
Are you having a laugh?
Is she having a laugh?

(Audience LAUGHING)

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,170
Oh, be fair, Ray. She wasn't that bad.
We all loved her milky puddings.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,218
Not when they dragged in the mash,
we didn't.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,056
Now, I don't want you and your team
mucking things up for me.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,858
You've prepared the traditional
Japanese cuisine, have you?

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,339
-Yes. It's here.
-Right.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,934
But I'm still not sure
you should have let Gobbler organise

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,818
-the traditional Japanese entertainment.
-Why? What's he planning?

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,289
-Well...
-No time. Here they come.

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,170
Mr Yamaguchi. Hello, hello.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,655
-This is Rita and my team.
-Hi.

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,890
We've prepared some traditional
Japanese cuisine.

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,130
Welcome. I hope you like it.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,135
-Lovely.
-Well done, Rita.

24
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,248
And now for your delectation,
may I present Gobbler and Kimberley

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,298
with some traditional
Japanese entertainment.

-It's not bad, is it?
-It is.

48
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,373
No, no. Bad suggests that, you know,
it's evil or something. You know, it's not...

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,214
It's poor, it's rubbish, you know. It's...
It's shit.

-It's a shit sitcom.
-It's a shit-com.

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,616
We've sorted that out. Thanks very much.

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,136
-That's the career over.
-That's what one of the reviewers said!

53
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,660
Shouldn't really...
No, I shouldn't really joke about it. It's not...

54
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,855
What are reviews like?

55
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,419
If I was being kind,
I'd say it was a mixed bag.

-Let me have a look.
-Really?

Yeah. Let me see them.

-Bar?
-Yo!

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,171
-Can you bring some of the reviews in?
-Why has he got them?

60
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,251
Got to do something with his mornings,
hasn't he?

61
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,774
-Found another one.
-Oh, have you?

62
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,648
Er, "Perhaps it's unfair
to judge a sitcom on its first episode,

-No. Don't pop it in the scrapbook.

-Put good ones in the scrapbook.
-What... What good ones?

-What, there's no good ones?
-Best one was the Telegraph.

-They didn't review it.

Well, no, despite what they say, the viewing
figures were really good, 6.2 million.

73
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,812
Six million people watched it last night
and yet none of these liked it?

These people know about comedy,
don't they?

75
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,535
They know what they're talking about,
but the general public, I mean...

You said if you get your own show,
the offers would come flooding in.

You said the phone
would never stop ringing.

78

Have you had any phone calls at all?

-No.
-No.

-Oh, no. What am I talking about? Sky called.
-And?

-Hello.
-What are you doing?

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,292
I'm actually flicking through the phone book
and I'm pointing my finger on a random page

86
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,213
to see what my name could be
if I wanted to change it.

-PB Grout.

-CT Punchaganowno.

-No. I'm fine.
-Phew.

I'm Andy by the way. I live here, obviously.

-Nice to meet you.

I thought I'd moved into
an old people's home.

106
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,532
No. There are some oldies in there,
some over 40s, but they're quiet.

107
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,214
-Got the old telly there. Watch a lot of telly?
-I don't, no.

No? Last night, BBC One?

-No?
-No.

-Okay.
-Okay.

112
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,854
Well, if you need someone
to show you around at all, just come and...

113
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,931
-Thanks. That'd be nice.
-Oh, good...

114
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,055
-All right.
-Okay.

115

-See you later.
-See you, bye.

-I saw it last night.
-And?

117
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,818
Yeah. It was good.

118
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,255
-Are you just saying that?
-No.

119
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,537
Too long a pause.
If you're gonna lie, lie well.

120
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,292
Bits of it were funny.

121
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,814
-It doesn't count. You laugh at anything.
-What?

122
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,733
I found you laughing to yourself once,
and I said, "What are you laughing at?"

123
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,459
-And you said, "My toes."
-Oh, yeah. Ha!

124
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,815
They are funny, though, the way they waggle.

125
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,618
It's you that's making them waggle.

126
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,292
-Spare any change?
-Sorry, mate.

127
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,733
-Okay. Have a nice day.
-Cheers.

128
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,415
-And good luck with the show, Andy!
-Cheers. How does he know who I am?

129
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,456
Where does he watch the show,
through Dixons' window?

130
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,098
You've been in all the magazines.

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,375
-Oh, he reads heat, does he?
-Everybody reads heat.

132
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,018
Everybody reads heat.

133
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,658
Now I'll have to start giving money
to the homeless.

134
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,775
Why?

135
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,930
'Cause I don't want people to say
Andy Millman hates the poor.

136
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,578
You don't just hate the poor,
you hate everyone.

137
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,696
That's why it's so unfair.

138
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,849
Sorry, but I've only got, like,
8p in change, or a 20.

139
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,453
-Just give him the 20.
-No. He said change.

140
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,371
-You said change, didn't you? Cheers.
-Yeah, whatever.

141
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,576
Your TV show's doing all right, though, is it?

142
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,412
-Yeah, yeah.
-Good, good.

143
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,814
Pay well?

144
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,259
Yeah, erm...

145
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,455
Haven't you got anything else?
Have you got like a quid?

146
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,216
-You haven't got a ten and five, have you?
-I haven't.

147
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,532
-Of course he doesn't. He's homeless.
-I know he's homeless. I'm not blind.

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,613
That is mental! That is...
He must have been a pervert.

153
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,295
Twenty quid, though.

154
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,134
Considering your average is probably what,
20p or something.

155
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,251
I do come past here quite a lot,
so we'll count that as a few goes.

156
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,208
Can't do that every day. Say it's, I don't
know, three months of leaving me alone.

157
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,779
-Leaving you alone?
-No.

158
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,532
If you're gonna have this attitude,
I don't want it.

159
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,338
-No, no.
-No, seriously. Take it back. I don't want it.

160
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,014
I'm just saying I couldn't do that...

161
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,333
What will you say to people about this?

162
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,735
I'll probably say,
"Don't ask Andy Millman for money

163
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,458
"because he'd only give it to you
begrudgingly."

164
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,499
Well, no, say that I offered you 20,
the second most you've ever been given,

165
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,378
and then I insulted you
and you made me take it back.

166
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,736
But mention the 20 in any anecdote
slagging me off.

167
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,129
-Oh, just take it. Just take it, it's fine.
-Fine.

168
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,259
-Nice aftershave, by the way.
-Cheers.

169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,535
-What is it?
-Calvin Klein.

170
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,649
Apparently Vernon Kay uses that.

171
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,493
Okay, cheers.

172
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,374
Why are we walking back this way?
This is the way we came.

173
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,293
Now I've got to walk past him again. You...

174
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,217
-See you later.
-Yeah.

175
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,092
Oh, walked too fast.

176
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,093
-You did?
-Yeah.

177
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,934
Oh! She's moving into my block.

178
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,295
I spoke to her earlier.
I think there's a bit of a vibe, right?

179
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,699
I'm gonna go and talk to her.

180
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,658
You come over, okay?
Just ask for an autograph...

181
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,698
Yeah, and just say something like, "l think
you're the most amazing actor on TV."'

182
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,975
You're already using
your new powers for evil.

183
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,620
-You've got to use what you can.
-Fair enough.

184
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,177
Hello. Need any help here?

185
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,569
Thank you.
A big, strong man's just what I need.

186
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,695
Will I do?

187
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,896
-Yeah!
-Excuse me?

188
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,333
-Are you Andy Millman?
-Yeah.

189
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,853
Star of the new sitcom
When The Whistle Blows?

190
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,532
-Yeah.
-Can I get your autograph, please?

191
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,973
No worries.

192
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,532
-Who's it to?
-Me.

193
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,338
Yeah, but I don't know your name, do l?

194
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,489
(LAUGHING)

195
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,252
-Maggie.
-Maggie.

196
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,129
Can I just say that I think you're the most
amazing comedy actor on television?

197
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,812
Oh! Not amazing!

198
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,292
-But that's what you told me to say.
-Shut up.

199
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,728
Okay. How many have you got?

200
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,818
Did he ask you to come over and say that?

201
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,014
-I don't know.
-You don't know if he asked you to say it?

202
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,458
No. I don't know.

203
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,369
Are you friends?

204
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,291
-Are we friends?
-Yeah.

205
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,174
Unlikely.

206
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,133
-Well, we have met.
-Have we?

207
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,576
Oh... Yeah. I didn't... Changed your...

208
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,376
Hello, you all right? I didn't realise.
Are you, um... Are you still...

209
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,659
Those aren't going to move themselves.

210
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,139
See you later.

211
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,694
-Andy, am I coming with you?
-Yeah.

212
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,012
-Are you still thinking about the reviews?
-Yes, the terrible, terrible reviews.

213
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,136
Think about the good ones.

214
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,659
What am I gonna do now?

215
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,208
I'll never get over this.
I'll just spend years and years

216
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,657
trying to claw back credibility by doing
anything, just popping up in bad films

217
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,255
and charity events, just begging forgiveness.

218
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,858
They'd forgive you if you did
Celebrity Fit Club.

219
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,376
-Brilliant. What else? What else could I do?
-There's Celebrity Love Island.

220
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,453
Why would I do a show that when
I watched it, I was praying for a tsunami?

221
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,734
Oh.

222
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,579
-Do you want to just go to the pub?
-Yeah.

223
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,296
That's the beginning.
"Depressed TV star drinks himself to death."'

224
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,779
Oh, don't be daft.

225
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,978
You're not a star. And being fat
will kill you before the drink does.

226
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,254
Are you sure you can come to the pub?

227
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,012
You're not manning the phones
at the Samaritans tonight?

228
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,375
-No.
-No? Okay, pub it is, then.

229
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,139
MAGGIE: Right, here's one.

230
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,973
Who would you rather fight
and have a decent chance of winning,

231
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,417
a big fat hairy silver-backed gorilla
or a Thomson's gazelle?

232
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,697
Well, the gazelle.

233
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,055
I know, but you'd have to catch it first
because they're like...

234
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,372
Well, I wouldn't catch it. I turned up for
the fight, it ran away, I win. Not my problem.

235
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,529
-Oi, oi.
-Oh.

236
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,451
Don't look at me like that.
Little bit of good news here.

237
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,019
-All right, Shaun?
-All right?

238
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,775
Barry and I were scouring the internet and
we found a glowing review of your sitcom.

239
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,259
-Really?
-Listen to this.

240
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,854
"This charming story of lovable,
larger-than-life characters

241
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,728
"will please all the family.
This is a delightful woodland romp

242
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,369
"with many of the best scenes
featuring a roly-poly toad."'

243
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,893
Give me that.

244
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,896
This is a review of Wind In The Willows.

245
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,050
What's yours called, then?
Oh, When The Wind Blows is his.

246
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,732
-Whistle!
-Whistle. Yeah.

247
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,778
-I said that was a picture of a frog, didn't l?
-It's got the same throat.

248
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,339
Yeah, I know, yeah.

249
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,014
Well, you can see
where we went wrong, yeah.

250
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,091
I'm going to get a drink.

251
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,296
-Have a look.
-He's a ringer.

252
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,779
-Oh, yeah. Except he's green.
-Who? Andy or...

253
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,737
-The wee frog.
-Oh, the frog.

254
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,938
-God, it's you.
-Hi.

255
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,928
Love it.

256
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,859
-What are you doing here?
-Just having a drink.

257
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,851
Oh, so are we. Amazing.

258
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,378
-Do you live near here?
-Yeah.

259
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,416
-Where?
-Just round...

260
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,252
-What street?
-It doesn't matter, does it?

261
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,535
-Just locally. Just...
-I love your show.

262
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,057
-Oh, good. Cheers.
-The wig, the glasses, the catchphrase.

263
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,493
-Brilliant.
-Thanks.

264
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,138
-Everything about it.
-Oh.

265
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,610
The wig. The glasses. The catchphrase.
Brilliant.

266
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,578
That's becoming quite a catchphrase itself.

267
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,179
Oh, the wig.

268
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,535
-The glasses.
-The glasses and the catchphrase.

269
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,258
-Brilliant?
-Yeah.

270
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,099
-Can I take a picture?
-Yeah.

271
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,613
(EXCLAIMING)

272
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,659
You got a wig with you?

273
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,014
-No.
-No.

274
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,888
Do the face, then. Do the face. Do the face.

275
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,015
(LAUGHING) Look at that!

276
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,969
It works even without the wig or the glasses.
Can you do the catchphrase?

277
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,732
-I'd rather not.
-Do the catchphrase.

278
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,175
-No. It's just a bit...
-Do the catchphrase.

279
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,375
Just do the catchphrase!

280
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,930
-Okay, okay. "Are you having a laugh?"
-Do it properly.

281
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,574
"Are you having a laugh?
Is he having laugh?"

282
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,571
-I love everything about it.
-Cheers.

283
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,299
The wig, the glasses, the catchphrase.

284
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,011
-Can I call my mate Pete?
-Why not?

285
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,852
Oh, he'll love this.

286
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,892
-You can't call the barman as well, can you?
-I haven't got his number.

287
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,737
Pete, what's your favourite catchphrase?
He's only here.

288
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,535
Yeah. Speak to him.

289
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,656
-Speak to him. No, speak to him.
-I can't.

290
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,857
-Just speak to him.
-All right, Pete? How have you been, mate?

291
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,852
Yeah. Yeah? He likes that as well.

292
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,771
No, I haven't got the wig on me, no. No.

293
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,614
Oh, Pete, I've got to go, mate,
because life's too short.

294
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,179
Okay? Yeah, see you.

295
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,659
(GIGGLING)

296
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,292
Huh? Yeah. That was actually him, yeah.
Come down.

297
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,894
-Ah, that's me.
-Bring Ralph and Walnut.

298
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,540
And tell Count Fuckula.
Oh, yeah, he loves him.

299
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,056
Hold on, I've got to go.
Quick, quick, quick, Jilly.

300
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,015
-By winning...
-Forget it, drink up. We're going.

301
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,692
-Why?
-Because I've just been spotted

302
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,771
by something from The Hills Have Eyes.

303
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,009
Hello!

304
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,255
Hello, mate, all right? How's it going?
Darren Lamb, agent. Nice to meet you.

305
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,489
This is my girlfriend, Jilly.

306
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,013
DARREN: Hello.
SHAUN: Hello, Jilly.

307
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,058
-Oh, I recognise you.
-Yes, possibly.

308
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,648
-You did my mum's guttering, didn't you?
-Maybe, yeah. Where does she live?

309
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,968
Arundall Court, opposite the BP garage.

310
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,413
What's this?
You didn't tell me anything about this.

311
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,138
What's going on here?
How much did you get paid for that?

312
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,573
-Not much.
-It was 200 quid.

313
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,730
Mum said he did such a good job
she gave him a £20 tip.

314
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,458
-220 quid?
-I don't have to tell you everything.

315
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,575
You don't have to tell me everything. No.

316
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,696
Although you're happy
to tell me when you're sleeping in your car

317
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,850
and you need to have a bath,
then you can't keep your mouth shut,

318
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,009
but this you're keeping shtum about?

319
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,773
You're supposed to be my agent for acting,
not bloody Artexing or whatever.

320
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,532
Rumbled!
He said guttering. Now it's Artexing!

321
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,973
What else are you keeping from me?

322
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,335
I'm appalled, I can't...
This is scandalous, Barry.

323
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,378
-Such a slap in the face.
-Do you do roofing?

324
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,293
-Do you need some roofing done?
-No, it's too dangerous. I'm not...

325
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,893
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're turning down work now, are you?

326
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,936
I'm sorry.
It seems that beggars can be choosers.

327
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,409
My mistake. Unbelievable.

328
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,455
How much was it? 220?

329
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,937
Right, you owe me 27.50.

330
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,976
-Can I give you a cheque?
-Yeah, if you must, yeah.

331
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,209
Unbelievable.

332
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,258
Here, I tell you this,
if you like his show, you'll love this.

333
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,299
Right, have a look at that. Just regular.
Turn it up the other way.

334
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,336
-"Boobs."'
-It's good, innit?

335
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,138
-How do you do that?
-It's just numbers.

336
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,619
-What numbers?
-58,008. Have a look.

337
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,296
(GIGGLING) Boobs! Jilly, look.
58,008. Boobs!

338
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,940
-Let me have a wee look.
-Yeah, have a look.

339
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,135
58,008...

340
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,539
BOTH: Boobs.

341
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,060
-You wanna get used to this, mate.
-It's doing my head in.

342
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,735
I know, they see you on telly
and they all want to be your best mate.

343
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,573
When I was on East Enders we used to go
to a place called Castro's.

344
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,537
It's quiet and they treat you well
if they recognise you.

345
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,009
-Let's go there.
-Yeah, all right.

346
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,771
-Here.
-Cheers, mate. Oi, oi, oi! Boing!

347
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,691
If it does, whose fault's that?

348
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,259
Let's not talk about business, mate,

349
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,650
in front of a couple of nobodies like this.
No disrespect. Unbelievable.

350
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,891
I'm already annoyed with you,
giving it backchat.

351
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,095
Anyway, give me your number.
We'll meet up again.

352
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,252
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Don't touch me.

353
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,694
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, hi.

354
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,419
I used to come here a lot a few years ago.
I don't know if you remember me,

355
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,456
-when I was in East Enders?
-Yes, hi, how you doing?

356
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,008
-Greg's in here.
-We don't have to speak to him.

357
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,897
Like he's not gonna come over and gloat.

358
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,369
-Big, fat, smug face.
-We're here now. Shh.

359
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,452
-It's fine. You've just got to sign in.
-Okay.

360
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,098
-Oh, hello. Look who it is.
-Hi.

361
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,377
-Hi, welcome. Enjoyed the show last night.
-Really?

362
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,418
Yeah. Mark, can you get Mr Millman
to the VIP area, please?

363
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,331
-Oh, thanks very much.
-No need to sign in. That's fine.

364
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,888
-Cheers. Thanks.
-Okay, enjoy. Good.

365
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,138
-Thank you.
-Okay.

366
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,176
Ah, Andy Millman.

367
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,297
I can't stop, mate. I'm going to the VIP area.

368
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,613
-That's mine. Take a seat.
-Oh, that chair!

369
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,338
-Oh, more like it. Thanks very much.
-Can I get you anything to drink?

370
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,332
-Um, some champagne?
-Yeah!

371
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,890
-Can we get a bottle of champagne, please?
-No problem.

372
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,129
Finally, a little bit of respect.

373
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,048
Oh, God. Look, David Bowie.

374
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,179
Oh, my God. Unbelievable. Don't look.

375
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,418
-Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
-You just put us here.

376
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,459
-David Bowie's here.
-I know, but it's just really embarrassing.

377
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,935
(ANDY SIGHING)

378
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,612
-Quick sit down.
-At least I had a sit down.

379
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,260
Quick little sit down, energy, back into it.

380
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,853
-How's it going?
-Brilliant. You?

381
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,055
Excellent.

382
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,736
Doing Chekhov at the Wyndham, just been
nominated for an Olivier Award, so...

383
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,219
Ooh!

384
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,729
-How's your sitcom going?
-Brilliant. Ratings are brilliant.

385
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,334
-The reviews very harsh. Very harsh.
-Don't read reviews. Don't bother.

386
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,409
-No?
-No.

387
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,697
I think I've got one here, actually.
Sorry. Can you just hold that?

388
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,133
Don't hold...

389
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,011
-Being meaning to throw it away.
-Throw it away, then.

390
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,649
Didn't get round to it.
Oh, no. "When The Whistle Blows.

391
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,652
"As I watched this abysmal
time-warp comedy

392
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,300
"l found myself expecting someone
to shout, 'I'm free!'

393
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,291
"and for Andy Millman to exclaim,

394
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,852
"'Hmm, Betty, the cat's just
shat out the worst sitcom of all time.""

395
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,414
Don't really care about his opinion.

396
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,691
If I want an opinion,
it won't be a snotty little reviewer,

397
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,452
it'll be the people that count,
the man on the street.

398
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,816
-Yeah, he gave him 20 quid earlier.
-Not that specific man on the street.

399
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,618
If you want to chase ratings, that's great.

400
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,329
I'd rather win the respect of my peers
than get big ratings and everything...

401
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,934
Both. Get both.
Anyway, always nice to see you, mate.

402
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,170
-You having a laugh!
-All right, mate.

403
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,058
-Sitcom's shit, mate.
-He's changed his tune. Why...

404
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,416
-The man in the street, so fickle.
-No. He didn't have a bald head.

405
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,092
No, not that specific man.

406
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,899
-Does that happen a lot?
-No, never. It's all good usually. So l...

407
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,096
I tell you who's not having a laugh,
the public.

408
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,499
-Well, they are.
-That's just rude.

409
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,696
It's not rude. It's stupid. It's ignorant.

410
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,259
To say that!

411
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,537
-He's a little ant to me.
-I feel it's just social rudeness.

412
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,814
Well...

413
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,139
Barry, don't look round, right,

414
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,051
there's a couple of birds over there
without drinks.

415
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,133
-I think you know what to do.
-Oh, yes. Excuse me.

416
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,256
There's a couple of girls over there
not drinking.

417
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,013
So I think you should probably tell them
to either buy something or get out.

418
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,694
No, sorry. That's a mistake.
No, I didn't mean that. Sorry.

419
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,169
What I meant was we could buy them
some drinks. That's an in, isn't it?

420
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,659
-To start a conversation.
-I thought you were worried

421
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,253
they're taking up valuable space
and costing him money.

422
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,409
Why would that concern me?

423
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,809
The man's running a business.
The overheads are probably extortionate.

424
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,289
-He probably makes a lot of money on food.
-Don't give me that.

425
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,972
There's 20 pubs a day
closing down in this country

426
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,937
and it's due to people like that. All right?

427
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,580
What, and you're suddenly an expert,
are you, on that?

428
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,378
I don't know why it's your concern
is what I'm...

429
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,734
Leave it.

430
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,169
Ladies, pardon us,
can I just introduce myself?

431
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,979
Darren Lamb,
agent to the TV actor Andy Millman,

432
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,732
-star of the sitcom When The Wind Blows.
-Whistle.

433
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,776
Whistle, thank you.
And do you remember this guy?

434
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,169
-It's only Barry off East Enders?
-Hello.

435
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,728
-Oh, yeah. How's it going?
-Not so good, actually.

436
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,969
Things aren't quite panning out as I'd hoped.

437
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,415
Let's not talk about that now.
Let's not bring the mood down now.

438
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,298
-A couple of sorts like this are up for it.
-What do you mean, up for it?

439
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,893
You're out and about, you know,
no guys with you,

440
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,016
you meet a couple of players like us,
ships in the night,

441
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,818
let's get down to business,
who wants Barry off East Enders?

442
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,492
-Neither of us.
-You're out in the cold.

443
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,457
That's the story of me life.
My house was repossessed last...

444
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,338
Let's not bring the mood down.
You're ruining it again. I'm still in the frame.

445
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,888
Who wants Barry to walk them home
while the other one comes home with me?

446
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,494
-Neither of us.
-Okay, final scenario. Listen to this, right.

447
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,140
Neither of you are interested in Barry,
so obviously I choose the fit one.

448
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,733
No disrespect to you. We all go back to mine.

449
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,651
Barry keeps you talking
whilst you and I get down to it.

450
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,891
It will take, I swear to God, 10 minutes max.
I can get everything done in that time.

451
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,129
Then you get a cab fare home,

452
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,337
anywhere you want to go,
up to say a maximum value of £15.

453
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,617
Or you could walk home, pocket
the cash, you've made a sweet, sweet profit.

454
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,815
-So it's up to you.
-No.

455
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,174
No? All right, Bar, forget it, mate.

456
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,171
Always know when to cut your losses.
Let's go.

457
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,177
I mean, he was actually a qualified surgeon
if I'm not wrong.

458
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,329
Really?

459
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,729
And he used to sing in the operating theatre.

460
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,856
-No!
-That's where he got his first start

461
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,329
because one of the patients
he was operating on

462
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,378
was an A&R man from Decca Records.
You won't know Decca.

463
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,169
Sorry. Can we?

464
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,615
I'm getting a bit of hassle out here.
Can I just pop myself down there?

465
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,214
Not really. This is the VIP section.
Can you step away from the rope, sir?

466
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,177
I know. I was in there a minute ago.
I was a VIP a minute ago.

467
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,898
-What happened?
-There's nothing I can do, sir. Sorry.

468
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,699
Can you just step away from the rope?

469
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,649
Come on. I've got more in common
with David Bowie than this rabble.

470
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,617
-How do you work that out?
-We're both entertainers.

471
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,338
We've both done something with our lives.
I'm just...

472
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,456
I don't think you can equate yourself
to David Bowie.

473
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,330
He's one of the seminal artists of the last
35 years, doing work tantamount to genius,

474
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,095
whereas you've just made a camp,
catchphrase-based comedy.

475
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,297
Just got a bad review off a bouncer.

476
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,211
-No. I just know what I like.
-Yeah? Do you like money?

477
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,575
-Sorry?
-Do you like money? 20 quid.

478
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,174
Sorry. You're trying to bribe me
to sit next to David Bowie now?

479
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,137
I'm giving you 20 quid to sit there
in those spare seats.

480
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,255
No.

481
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,654
50?

482
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,412
-50 quid?
-Yeah.

483
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,339
Let's see it.

484
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,098
-You got a 10? I've only got 20s.
-No.

485
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,818
Well, it's either 40 or 60, then.

486
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,856
-60, then.
-60, then.

487
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,531
That's for both of us.

488
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,530
Go and get a drink.
I haven't got any money now.

489
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,895
-Hey, what are you doing in there?
-It's the VIP area, innit?

490
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,572
Can we come in 'cause
we're getting no action out here?

491
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,494
-It's a wasteland.
-You're on your own. I'm not made of money.

492
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,298
It's the same seat!
It's actually the same seat for 60 quid!

493
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,733
You paid 60 quid to go in here?

494
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,731
-You should've let me negotiate.
-Your show's shit, mate.

495
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,334
They can still see me! There should be
an actual barrier or something.

496
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,809
Let's go and sit next to David Bowie.
He's not getting any hassle.

497
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,209
-We can't just sit next to him.
-We'll just go and speak to him.

498
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,892
-I don't know him, do l?
-Excuse me.

499
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,493
-What are you doing?
-It's all right.

500
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,899
Excuse me.

501
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,013
Mr Bowie, can I just say that
we're both very big fans?

502
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,216
I can't hear you, love. Come over here.

503
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,211
(WHISPERING) Come on, go, go!

504
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,098
Budge up a bit, Linda. Thank you.

505
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,454
-Hi.
-Hi, hi.

506
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,656
We were just saying
that I'm an entertainer, too.

507
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,492
Oh, yeah? What do you do?

508
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,696
-I'm in a sitcom.
-It's called When The Whistle Blows.

509
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,499
-Have you seen it?
-I haven't, no. Is it any good?

510
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,812
-MAN: No. It's shit.
-Oh, just riff-raff everywhere.

511
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,336
-Not going down too well, huh?
-It's getting six million viewers...

512
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,378
I mean, it's not exactly how I meant it to be

513
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,293
because the BBC have interfered
and sort of chased ratings

514
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,416
and made it a lowest common denominator
sort of comedy.

515
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,458
Sort of catchphrases and wigs and...

516
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,134
-I think I've sold out, to be honest, but...
-Yeah.

517
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,858
It's difficult, innit? When they...

518
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,931

you're going for that first...

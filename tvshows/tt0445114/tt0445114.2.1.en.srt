your wife flowers and not include a card.

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,889
I'll text it to you. You're a dirty old man. Bye.

149
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,373
Actually, he's not old.
He's 28 and he's got his own yacht.

150
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,894
-Oh. Oh.
-He's quite a catch.

151
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,574
So where you living at the moment?
Have you got your own place?

152
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,572
-Yes, I've got my own place.
-'Cause you were renting before.

153
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,537
That grotty little council place
behind Londis.

154
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,215
-Yeah, I'm still there.
-You're well, though?

155
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,292
-Surprisingly.
-Yeah, well, that's the main thing, yeah.

156
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,292
Even if you've got nothing else,
at least you've got your health, eh?

157
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,371
-At the moment.
-Yeah.

158
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,054
Talking of bad luck.
Did you hear about Barbara?

159
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,817
Trevor's left her for a younger model.
She is devastated, honestly, all alone,

160
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,619
crying herself to sleep every night
in that big house.

161
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,419
She has got her own house, at least,
which is something.

162
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,535
Good for her.

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,497
Oh, that'll be Matty.

165
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,699
Oh. No.

166
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,457
Never mind.

167
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,849
Oh, he's late again.
Alfie's going to be in so much trouble.

168
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,215
Well, I'm not carrying the can for him again.

169
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,339
Well, there's no excuses this time.
Mr Stokes said if he's late one more time,

170
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,854
he's gonna give him the brush off.

171
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,929
Oh, here he is. Alfie, not again.

172
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,535
-Why are you late?
-Because I buried me sister today!

173
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,298
Yep, great. Let's move on. Next scene.

174
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,213
Sorry, I don't want to interfere.
Is that how he's gonna do it?

175
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,689
Because it's meant to be a sad line,
"l buried my sister today."'

176
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,816
He was smiling. It's got to be an emotional...

177
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,494
-Hang on, everyone.
-Sorry, Keith, can we try that again?

178
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,571
You were smiling, mate, it's...

179
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,094
They all sort of think you're a joke
'cause you're always late,

180
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,489
but today you've got a valid reason,
you buried your sister.

181
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,617
It's sort of like a...
Oh, it's like an emotional point in the show.

182
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,816
-Could we do it again?
-Yeah, no worries.

183
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,539
Okay, sorry.

184
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,250
You're smiling again.
You mustn't smile, you're sad. Okay?

185
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,570
You've just been to a funeral.

186
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,972
Okay, in you come.

187
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,568
Alfie, not again. Why are you late?

188
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,455
Because I buried my sister today.

189
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,179
Don't look at the camera.

190
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,251
-You mustn't look at the camera.
-Sorry.

191
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,489
-Okay?
-Yeah.

192
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,536
It sort of breaks the illusion this is real life.

193
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,372
-Right.
-Go again.

194
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,774
Okay, in you come, action.

195
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,372
You're smiling. Sad.

196
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,097
You looked straight at the lens again.
Good, double whammy, and again.

197
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,659
Action.

198
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,969
-Alfie, not again. Why are you late?
-Because l...

199
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,132
We can't see you, Keith,
you've gone too far, okay?

200
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,893
You've got to stay on that mark,
the blue mark down there,

201
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,416
that's for you to stand on
'cause that's where the camera is pointing

202
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,297
and then we can see your face.

203
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,133
So, just to recap, come in,
not smiling 'cause you're sad

204
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,893
'cause you just buried your sister,
don't look at the camera

205
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,529
and stand on that mark
so we can see you on the telly.

206
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,973
Okay?

207
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,529
-There's a lot to remember, isn't there?
-There is a lot to remember.

208
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,489
There is a lot to remember.
It's called acting. Okay, okay, action.

209
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,893
Sad!

210
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,499
Too far, left a bit, don't look at me!
Okay, ask him the question.

211
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,048
-Why are you late?
-Because my sister buried me today.

212
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,859
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Why would your sister bury you?

213
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,649
-That'd be mental!
-Oh, sorry, I get so confused.

214
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,973
-The thing is my sister's not dead.
-What?

215
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,332
I told them when I started,
me sister, she's not dead.

216
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,091
-Do you mean in real life?
-Yeah.

217
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,130
Presumably you don't work in a factory
in real life?

218
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,176
-No.
-And your name's not Alfie.

219
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,932
Yeah, you see, that's another thing.

220
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,535
Sometimes I don't know
who's talking to who.

221
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,738
Would you rather be called Keith in this?

222
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,458
It would help.

223
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,298
Okay, everyone, we're changing
Keith's character name from Alfie to Keith.

224
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,610
Okay? Good. Let's go again.

225
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,009
This time, then. Okay, in you come, Keith.

226
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,739
-Keith me or Keith the character?
-Same person!

227
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,857
Keith... Okay,
Keith you and Keith the character,

228
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,057
all-in-one Keith, okay, in you come. Action!

229
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,890
-The door's stuck.
-That's lunch!

230
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,569
Okay. No, okay, bye. Bye.

231
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,611
Yeah, just a call to do a small part in a film,
but I just had to let them down,

232
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,531
-I'm too busy.
-Aw.

233
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,418
-Oh, I wonder if they'd want you.
-No, I wouldn't have thought so.

234
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,570
-No, hang on, let me give them a call.
-No, no.

235
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,254
Try and help my bloody mates.
You need the help.

236
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,535
-But I'm not even a proper actress.
-Hang on.

237
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,898
Hiya, Pauline. Listen, about that job,
I've got a friend who's available.

238
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,770
Does she have to be good looking?
Does she? Oh.

239
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,892
Oh, I don't know, late 30s, early 40s.

240
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,494
-I'd say mousy.
-Blonde.

241
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,698
But lovely girl, great personality,
desperate for anything.

242
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,618
No. All right, well, I tried. Okay, cheers.

243
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,738
Oh, sorry about that.

244
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,857
-It's not your lucky day.
-No.

245
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,332
-You okay?
-Yeah.

246
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,571
MAN: Come on, up you go.

247
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,458
-All right?
-Yeah.

248
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,975
I'm back again.

249
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,210
Fourteen years I did here at the BBC.

250
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,578
Swap Shop, Cheggers Plays Pop, all sorts.

251
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,850
Still run by Jews and queers, is it?

252
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,329
-It's what?
-This place.

253
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,494
Still run by your Jews and queers?

254
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,539
I think there are some Jewish people
and some gay people, yeah.

255
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,938
Gay!

256
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,376
Yeah, I forgot,
you're not meant to say "queer", are you?

257
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,020
Suggests something abnormal.

258
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,258
What could be more normal
than shoving your cock up a bloke's arse?

259
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,659
And put it this way,
if God had wanted a cock up an arse,

260
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,129
he wouldn't have given us minges.

261
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,292
Men have knobs,

262
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,217
women have fannies.

263
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,295
Pop knob in fanny,

264
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,892
not up the arse.

265
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,618
Good. I should be making notes.

266
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,209
-You what?
-Nothing. It's... It's all good advice.

267
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,731
-Hi.
-Hello again.

268
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,698
-What are you reading?
-Oh, just Hello!

269
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,418
Oh, yeah, heat.

270
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,053
-Oh, no, I don't believe it.
-What is it?

271
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,415
Just Top 5 Sexiest Film Stars,
for God's sake.

272
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,570
-Are you in it?
-Number one.

273
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,408
-Stupid. What do they mean, these lists?
-Nothing really.

274
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,253
Don't slag them off. It's their opinion. Just...

275
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,969
Oh, no. Look at this woman magazine.

276
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,928
"I'm having an affair
with my brother-in-law's ghost"?

277
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,774
No, that. Women's Top Ten Fantasy Snogs.
Number one again.

278
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,976
What's that thing about the ghost?

279
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,290
"My, um... My husband's brother's ghost
visits me at night

280
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,293
-"and I think I'm falling in love with him."'
-Do they have sex?

281
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,616
Well, it doesn't say.
But it doesn't matter, does it?

282
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,214
Look, we were looking at
the Number One Fantasy Snog For Women.

283
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,336
Number one, Orlando Bloom.

284
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,533
Oh, better not show this to Johnny Depp.
He's only number four.

285
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,815
Really? He'd be my number one.

286
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,449
Well, you'd be wrong, wouldn't you?
I'm number one, there's the proof.

287
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,337
It was the same on the set of
Pirates of the Caribbean.

288
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,856
Me and Keira Knightley do a kissing scene,
I do a brilliant take, everyone claps,

289
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,249
the director goes, "That was amazing."'

290
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,729
Keira goes,
"Oh, can we just do that kissing bit again?"

291
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,493
Well, I know what she's up to.

292
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,775
And I tease her, and I go,
"lf you wanna kiss somebody,

293
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,293
"why don't you kiss Johnny Depp?"

294
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,339
She goes, "Don't make me fucking sick.
I'm gonna vomit if you carry on like that."'

295
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,978
Why do you keep talking
about Johnny Depp?

296
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,574
I don't keep talking about him.
I never talk about him, he's boring.

297
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,776
He's a prat. Where I'm from,
he wouldn't last five minutes.

298
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,737
-He'd get a smack straightaway.
-Where are you from?

299
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,698
-Haply-on-the-Wold, near Royal Windsor.
-Oh.

300
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,898
But they're all subjective, though,
those lists, though, aren't they?

301
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,619
Well, no. Obviously,
I am objectively really good-looking.

302
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,452
But it's not objective, is it?

303
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,976
Personally, I think you're a wee bit...

304
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,856
What's that? You winding me up?

305
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,408
-Come out for a drink later.
-I can't, I'm meeting my friend.

306
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,252
Come out for a coffee with me,
you know. Come on.

307
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,808
Just get to know me,
get to know the normal me,

308
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,573
take a better look and, you know,
see the attractiveness.

309
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,730
But I don't think you are.

310
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,853
Liar.

311
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,375
-Try them on.
-Bit wacky, aren't they?

312
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,655
Big glasses are funny.

313
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,777
-The real Ray didn't even wear glasses.
-Put them on.

314
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,452
-That's funny. Do the catchphrase.
-It's not a catchphrase.

315
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,338
-It's something he actually used to say.
-Do it.

316
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,457
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

317
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,577
-Now the wig.
-What about that one?

318
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,697
-It looks ridiculous.
-That looks funny.

319
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,089
-He didn't even have curly hair.
-Curly is funny.

320
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,650
-What do you mean, curly is funny?
-Curly hair is funny.

321
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,975
Harpo Marx, Leo Sayer.

322
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,528
I can name you loads of people
with curly hair that aren't funny.

323
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,851
Starsky from Starsky and Hutch,
Jim Morrison.

324
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,295
-Blacks.
-Don't say blacks.

325
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,531
-What shall I say?
-Say black people.

326
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,853
-Okay, black people aren't funny.
-Black people are funny, Keith.

327
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,339
Name one black person that's funny.

328
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,139
I can name you loads of black people
that are funny. Dave Chappelle,

329
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,688
-Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy.
-English.

330
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,417
Don't change the rules half way through.

331
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,572
There are loads of funny
English black people, too.

332
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,815
Who?

333
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,254
Um...

334
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,412
Um...

335
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,254
MAN OVER RADIO: Paul on two, Paul on two.

336
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,215
-Good news.
-Oh, more good news. Excellent.

337
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,610
Right, Eddie Osbourne, electrician.

338
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,693
He split up with his wife a while ago
and he's back on the market.

339
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,055
-Lovely guy, just your type.
-Really?

340
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,018
Sweet guy. He's a lovely guy. Interested?

341
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,489
-Yeah.
-Great. Eddie?

342
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,179
Yo!

343
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,613
This is her.

344
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,338
(EXHALING)

345
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,895
-No? Oh, never mind.
-Not bothered.

346
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,339
I just don't know where you're going wrong.

347
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,453
-Right. Kiss me. One kiss, come on.
-No.

348
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,100
One kiss, just let me show you how I do it.
No tongues if you don't want.

349
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,569
Right. If it's gonna shut you up.

350
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,535
(BLOOM SIGHS)

351
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,532
-Well?
-Not really my cup of tea.

352
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,098
Sorry about that.

353
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,775
You're in this club, this vision walks up.

354
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,974
She says, "Hi, handsome,
wanna buy me a drink?"

355
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,494
-What do you say?
-I say, "I'm not made of money."'

356
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,377
Oh, you're never
gonna get a woman like that.

357
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,849
No, I don't want a woman like that.

358
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,091
Go on, be nice to her, caress her hair.

359
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,295
No, don't pat her, she's not a dog.

360
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,940
She must be a dog
if she's going out with him. Oh!

361
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,533
Oh, Mr Stokes.

362
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,616
I'm sorry, um...

363
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,252
-Maybe waggle the glasses?
-I'm not sure about the glasses.

364
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,376
Oh, you've got to have the glasses,
it's hysterical.

365
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,815
-I don't think so.
-It's definitely funnier with the glasses.

366
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,334
-Oh, yeah, it is, I agree.
-There's a surprise.

367
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,810
Well, I'm sorry that my presence here
as head of comedy irritates you,

368
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,538
but I've been in this business
a lot longer than you,

369
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,498
and my opinion will be heard
because I'm the man with the money.

370
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,332
-It's not your money, though, is it?
-No,

371
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,888
but I'm entrusted to make sure
that it's spent correctly.

372
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,017
Oh, we'll make sure it's spent correctly,
which is apparently on funny glasses.

373
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,328
I'll just take five, right?

374
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,092
-Yes.
-Yeah, all right.

375
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,937
-Oh, do you mind if I take these for later on?
-No.

376
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,488
Can I just say that I know
what you're going through?

377
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,209
My character on East Enders, he started out
as an interesting three-dimensional person,

378
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,530
but then over the years the writers
turned him into a joke,

379
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,692
and that's why I walked away, you know,
it wasn't what I wanted to do.

380
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,931
And I know some people
look at me now and say I was a fool

381
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,172
but I know that I walked away
with my integrity and my pride intact.

382
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,650
I just think you've gotta do
what you think is right.

383
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,090
-lain, can I have a word?
-Yeah, what is it?

384
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,219
This isn't the comedy I set out to make,
okay? In fact, I think it's awful.

385
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,734
Yeah, well, shall we not do this here,
shall we go up to my office...

386
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,334
No, I don't care who hears
what I've got to say

387
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,696
because I'm at that point now.
Everyone's interfered, it's embarrassing.

388
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,452
I don't want to get on television
for the sake of it.

389
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,055
I don't want to be famous for the sake of it.
I want to do something that I'm proud of.

390
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,338
And I won't be proud
of shouting out catchphrases

391
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,012
in a stupid wig and funny glasses.

392
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,456
I wanna do what I wanna do, otherwise
I'll hate myself for the rest of my life.

393
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,576
And I tell you what, a case in point.

394
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,414
Shaun, on East Enders, they started to turn
his character into a joke

395
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,618
and he walked away at the top of his game.
That's called integrity.

396
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,296
Okay, it doesn't matter what happens
to him now 'cause he's got his dignity.

397
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,891
-Shall l...
-Leave it.

398
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,978
So basically, I'm not gonna prostitute
myself any more, or my work, okay?

399
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,735
I'm just sick of people coming along,
telling me how they think it should be done

400
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,651
and me just having to bend over
and take it up the arse.

401
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,018
Ah! Oh, sorry, can we just say no disrespect
to either of you as gays?

402
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,534
You know, we don't know
if you're givers or receivers,

403
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,178
very difficult to tell just from looking at you.

404
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,137
Although if I was putting money on it,
I'd probably go...

405
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,699
We don't need to put money on it.

406
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,372
(CLEARING THROAT)

407
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,774
You've heard what I've got to say.

408
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,852
Right, well, thank you
for telling us how you feel.

409
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,893
So here's how I see things going forward.

410
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,892
You can either carry on and record
this show as we've already planned,

411
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,290
or you can pull the plug,
waste everybody's time and hard work,

412
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,894
waste the thousands of pounds
we've already spent so far,

413
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,131
burn all your bridges with the BBC
and you can go back to being an extra

414
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,371
and then you can work your way
back up again from nothing.

415
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,371
What do you want to do?

416
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,452
-Well...
-What do you want to do?

417
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,053
Sitcom.

418
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,974
This can be good.
That's what I've been trying to say.

419
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,735
This... Finish this off, 'cause it can...

420
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,529
I don't wanna let people down. I wanna
get on with this. I wanna get this on the telly.

421
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,293
And then in the future, maybe look
at doing it the way I wanted to do it.

422
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,610
-Yeah, or not.
-Or not, see how it goes.

423
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,656
That's all I wanna...

424
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,690
-Right. Yeah.
-Yeah?

425
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,013
-Okay.
-Good.

426
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,489
-Andy?
-Yeah?

427
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,536
-Don't forget your...
-Glasses.

428
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,932
Right.

429
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,618
-Hi.
-Cutting it a bit fine, aren't you?

430
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,418
I know, sorry I'm late.

431
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,377
-Everything all right?
-Yeah.

432
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,451
-No first-night nerves?
-No, no, no.

433
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,055
I actually had to kick a bit of arse earlier
'cause I was getting sick of all this,

434
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,732
-"Is it a good comedy? Is it a bad comedy?"
-Yeah.

435
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,380
I just went, "Look, it's a good comedy
if it pleases people.

436
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,098
"Can we get on with it?"
Do you know what I mean?

437
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,932
I think comedy should be as broad
as possible,

438
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,488
so you take everyone in.
I want the whole family to like this.

439
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,650
-I want four-year-olds to like this.
-They will.

440
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,050
Do you know what I mean? And if it
doesn't stand the test of time, so what?

441
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,089
Do something else, but, you know,
bring as much joy into the world as you can.

442
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,536
-That's all.
-Yeah, well, as long as you're happy.

443
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,817
I'm happy if people are happy.

444
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,216
-Are you definitely gonna do this? Yeah?
-Yeah.

445
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,292
-You're definitely gonna go on and...
-Yes.

446
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,415
Yeah.

447
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,695
-Forget it, Barry, he's gonna do it, mate.
-Fuck.

448
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,419
I know. I'm as annoyed as you are, man.

449
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,049
Bloody hell, Rita, you look terrible.
Life as a single mum getting to you?

450
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,418
I was up till 2:00 am
doing me daughter's science homework.

451
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,970
Did you know that Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin

452
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,620
when he found mould
on some old bread he'd left out?

453
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,733
Oh, he should look under Gobbler's bed,
he'd find a new species.

454
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,216
He'd find a new species
if he looked in Gobbler's bed.

455
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,819
-I don't get it.
-You don't get it?

456
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,291
I've been without a man so long,
I think I'd say yes if Ray asked me out.

457
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,215
-My ears are burning.
-Maybe I can last a few more years.

458
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,650
Morning, campers.
Well, congratulations are in order.

459
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,300
You all successfully clocked in
on time this morning,

460
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,974
you just forgot to start bloody work!

461
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,253
Steady on, Mr Stokes,
we've been comforting Rita.

462
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,696
She's been up all night trying to get
her head round some fella called Alexander.

463
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,499
Oh, lucky beggar.

464
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,811
-No one who works here I hope.
-No, he's dead.

465
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,649
You cooked for him as well? He he!

466
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,812
Oh, Mr Stokes, will you be nice to her?

467
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,333
(MUMBLING)

468
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,254
Well, Rita, I know you've had your problems,
but I want you to know this.

469
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,731
-The door to my office is always open.
-Thank you, Mr Stokes.

470
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,052
Yeah, I think it's the bloody hinges.
Get off your arse and fix it, will you?

471
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,654
-I haven't got any tools.
-You're joking? You've got two right here.

472
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,935
Gobbler's a complete spanner.

473
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,571
I don't get it.

474
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,938
What Mr Stokes has cleverly done,
with recourse to a pun,

475
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,569
is take Rita's usage of the word "tool",

476
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,573
a device that performs manual
or mechanical work,

477
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:24,212
and transpose its meaning
into the vulgar, slang definition of "tool",

478
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,292
meaning the male reproductive appendage.

479
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,618
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

480
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,418
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

481
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,531
You're having a laugh!

482
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,338
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

483
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,134
He is having a laugh.

484
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,978
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

485
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,495
Ooh. You're having a laugh.

486
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,179
RITA: Oh, I got a letter back
from the dating agency.

487
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,457
-Yeah, this guy replied, sent me a picture.
-My word.

488
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,815
RITA: Before you ask,
it was taken on his allotment,

489
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,289
and, yes, he did win first prize.

490
00:28:17,305 --> 00:29:17,179

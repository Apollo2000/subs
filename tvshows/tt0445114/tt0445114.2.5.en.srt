1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,431
Oh, it says here I'm going to meet
a handsome man with bags of personality.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,516
I told you, I'm married.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,074
I still can't believe
you got somebody to marry you.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,993
Don't be too amazed. You haven't seen her.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,598
RAY: Bloody hell, Kimberley.
Are you still doing that timesheet?

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
-Hurry up.
-It's complicated, Mr Stokes.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,312
Are you having a laugh?
Is she having a laugh?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,311
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,073
You know it gives me a headache
if it's too hard.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,311
Funny. That's what the wife
said to me yesterday.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,228
I said, "Don't flatter yourself, love.
That's not hard. It died years ago.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,072
"That's rigor mortis."'

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,233
Andy Millman as Ray Stokes

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,471
in a scene from BBC One's new sitcom
When The Whistle Blows.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,154
The catchphrase is "Are you having
a laugh?" Did you, Germaine Greer?

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,392
Oh, for goodness sake, why me?
Why do you make me watch this stuff?

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,474
This was sexist, misogynistic,
Neanderthal garbage.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,031
It was nothing
but really nasty sub Carry On innuendo.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,793
And it seems that this talentless Millman
individual also wrote the script. Wrote?

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,350
-It's supposed to have a writer?
-I think he needs a defender. Mark Kermode.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,432
I think Germaine's being flattering about it.
I thought it was absolutely horrible.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,556
Oh, I get the idea. They all seemed to like it.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,392
No, I don't think so.
I think they're slagging you off.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,833
Yeah. I'm being sarcastic.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,037
Everyone involved should be
thoroughly ashamed of themselves.

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,919
Why did Germaine Greer
and all those feminists burn their bras?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,149
What was going on there?

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,233
Well, it was a symbolic gesture to suggest
emancipation from a patriarchal society.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,197
But I thought a bra
was supposed to help a lady,

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,429
stop her getting backache, or whatever.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,192
You couldn't tell them at the time.
They were furious.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,838
I bet they're kicking themselves now,
aren't they?

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,638
I bet their boobs are all saggy
round their ankles.

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,790
Sorry.
Can we concentrate on the matter at hand?

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,233
I was going to say, the weird thing is

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,038
that the worse the reviews are,
the better the ratings.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,270
It's strange. I was thinking
about all those people that are making

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,113
really great programmes, but not getting
half the audience that you're getting,

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,952
and thinking, "Oh, wouldn't it
be great to work with them

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,837
"'cause they get a load of critical
respect and everything."'

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,230
Then I thought, "No, I'd much prefer
working with you because you've," erm...

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,276
"You've sold out."'
Do you know what I mean?

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,554
We're all making a fast buck now,
which is great,

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,517
because I don't want to be doing this
for the rest of my life.

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,556
I do want to be doing this
for the rest of my life, actually.

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,234
Do you know how exhausting it is
getting panned by the critics every week?

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,279
I've got no respect and why should I have?
I'm not an actor. I shout a catchphrase.

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,272
Do you know why I got into acting
in the first place? Robert De Niro.

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,195
Do you think he'd be impressed with wigs,
shouting the same thing every week? No.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,874
He's got a body of work
he can look back on and be proud of.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,474
That's what I want.
Get me something I can be proud of.

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,279
-Has anything classy come in?
-Well, funny you should say that.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,352
BBC are doing more
of those modern adaptations of Shakespeare.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,589
Right.

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,229
-Doing King Lear.
-Okay. Who's playing Lear?

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,992
-Robson Green.
-No.

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,354
Get me some real Shakespeare.
Get me any play.

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,510
A play always sorts out an actor
whose career's struggling,

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,239
or they always pretend it was their first love
and they do a bit of theatre

60
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,438
and it gives them a bit of cred.
Get me a play. The play's the thing.

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,358
I'm going to write down play, Bar, all right?

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,830
I'm going to put this in an email
so you remember as well.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,749
I've got the worst management in the world.
Do you know what I mean?

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,990
-Yeah.
-I'm successful now.

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,275
I'm still surrounded by the D team.
I want the A Team.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,194
It's hard though, isn't it? I mean, they're
hiding in the Los Angeles underground, so...

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,396
-Not The A-Team.
-That's what you said.

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,948
No. They're fictional characters.

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,110
I thought it was a bit weird
you mentioned them.

70
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,111
-I didn't. I meant the phrase.
-What phrase?

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,839
The A team. It means the best
possible people for the job, doesn't it?

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,831
What about The Six Million Dollar Man?
Was that a phrase?

73
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,434
No. That was very specific to him
because he cost six million dollars.

74
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,829
No, no, no. That could have been a phrase.

75
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,639
Like, "Oh, look at him. He's a right old
six million dollar man, isn't he?"

76
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,994
When would you ever say that?

77
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,674
If you saw a man that could run fast
and see really well out of one eye.

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,558
What's the chance of that?
What is the chance of that ever happening?

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,154
I don't know.
I didn't make up the phrase, did l?

80
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,437
-It's not a phrase. It's, oh...
-See you down there.

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,873
See you later.

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,111
Oh, Liza, before you go,
could you sign that picture for me?

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,315
Yeah.

84
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,915
What's your name again, love?

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,318
Don't worry about it. If you can't remember
my name, it really doesn't matter.

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,517
No. I've just forgotten
'cause there's so many people.

87
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,910
Right. So have you forgotten his name, then?

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,631
Or do you remember the actors,
but not the little people?

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,075
I've been doing your hair and make-up
for five weeks!

90
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,392
-I'm very sorry. I just...
-It's fine, it's fine. Doesn't matter.

91
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,439
-I've got a terrible memory.
-Don't worry about it. Don't worry.

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,235
Okay.

93
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,789
Sorry.

with some of these people.

-Yeah.

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,676
Can you sign me a picture?

102
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,432
Can you sign that?

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,512
-This one?
-Yeah.

Uh...

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,915
What shall I put, though? To...?

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,111
To me and, I don't know,
best wishes or whatever.

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,829
Erm...

110
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,116
-What? Do you not want to sign that?
-No, with pleasure. It's just...

111
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,510
I was just thinking, erm,
I don't want to spell your name wrong.

112
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,876
-How are you spelling it?
-Oh, it's just the usual.

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,954
Okay, let's go for it.
Erm, oh, can't do it with that, though.

114
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,837
Let me go to the dressing room.
I've got a magic marker.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,593
-Oh, I've got a magic marker.
-Have you?

116
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,279
In my bag.

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,797
Thanks. Right...

118
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,438
Let's start with me first.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,230
Andy Millman. Work backwards. Best wishes.

120
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,754
I mean that, "To..."'

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,037
and then your name.

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,157
Oh, right, sorry. Before we do that.

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,199
Sorry about this, must... No, hold on.

124
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,479
Let me do this and we can get on with it.

125
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,868
Good.

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,279
-Do you want to get this done?
-Yep.

127
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,954
I'm really conscious of time.
I've got to get back down to the set.

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,235
Right, yeah, no. No, I know.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,638
What's your name?

130
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,750
Well, you'll see what it is now
because Andy is about to write it down.

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,508
-Oh.
-Oh, stop blowing.

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,477
-Well...
-You don't know my name, do you?

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,030
-It's not that I don't know it.
-Yeah? What is it, then?

134
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,079
-What, in this context?
-Oh, forget it.

135
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,116
Honestly, forget it. It doesn't matter.

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,795
I've got to get down to set.
Just unbelievable.

137
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,711
Un-fucking-believable.

138
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,512
-She was upset.
-Yes. She was.

139
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,679
You knew I didn't know her name.
I said to you, "l don't know her name,"

140
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,797
-so why did you give me the magic marker?
-Just because you needed one.

141
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,917
No, no. That was an excuse to leave
and ask someone her name, wasn't it?

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,788
That's clever!
I'd never have thought to do that.

143
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,829
-What are you doing?
-Smell that. Nice fabric conditioner.

144
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,918
I like smells.
Do you know, I once had this bar of soap

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,595
and it smelt so nice that I bit into it
because I wanted to see what it tasted like.

146
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,796
It just tasted of soap.

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,599
Andy, reception say they've got
a guy here who says he knows you.

148
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,069
-Oh, God. Who is it?
-He says he went to school with you.

149
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,991
-Steve Sherwood.
-Steve Sherwood?

150
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,308
-Who is it?
-That's what he said.

151
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,719
-What? He's here now?
-Yeah.

152
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,358
-Can he come through?
-Yeah.

153
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,079
-Hiya, can you send that guy up?
-Who's that?

154
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
He was like the coolest kid in the school.
Everyone wanted to be like him.

155
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,835
-Even you?
-I suppose so. Yeah.

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,115
-What does he do now?
-I think he's something big in the city...

157
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,634
-You could still do that!
-I don't want to be like him now, do l?

158
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,872
I'm doing really well.
He probably wants to be like me, if anything.

159
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,393
He definitely doesn't want to be like you.

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,110
Andy Pandy, you little fat poofter.
Hey, poofter.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,833
Hold on, hold on. You're with a pretty girl.

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,957
There can only be one explanation.
Are you a prostitute, darling?

163
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,359
Pretty girl.

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,078
-So you're doing all right?
-Yeah, not bad.

165
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,434
-Is this the missus?
-No.

166
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,748
Why do you protest so much?

167
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,479
What, you find the idea so repulsive?
She's an attractive lady.

168
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,549
Stop it.

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,959
You know we always thought
you were gay at school.

170
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,109
No, you didn't. Why?

171
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,997
-You never had a girlfriend.
-Not in front of you, I didn't.

172
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,115
Oh, so you had a girlfriend, did you?

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,713
-Yes.
-No, not until he was 28.

174
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,199
-28?
-And she looked like Ronnie Corbett.

175
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,349
-Not this again.
-Ronnie Corbett?

176
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,556
No, it's... Why do you think I'm gay?

177
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,312
-You don't, do you? I'm not...
-Well, you are an actor.

178
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,073
-That is the gayest profession.
-Yeah. I think rent boy's gayer.

179
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,276
-Yeah, well, I wouldn't know.
-Well, of course it is...

180
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,670
Oh, you tell me,
you seem to know all about rent boys.

181
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,196
Oh, I'm not gay.
I never have been, I never will be.

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,393
Let's...

183
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,596
nip that in the bud.

184
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,989
Andy! Oh, for fuck's... What am I doing?

185
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,353
What are you sitting on that little chair for?

186
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,954
-Just, well, that one's dangerous.
-What do you want?

187
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,439
Erm, the play.

188
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,990
-I was talking to one of my contacts.
-You mean Barry from East Enders?

189
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,150
Yeah, and he's got a friend who's an actor

190
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,471
who's just had a meeting with
Sir Ian McClellan, who's directing a new play.

191
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,039
So I put in some calls and you've got

192
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,917
-a meeting with McClellan on Wednesday.
-Really?

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,958
-Yeah.
-There's some nice birds round here.

194
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,155
Suppose so.

195
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,356
-Andy, we'll be ready in about five minutes.
-Cheers.

196
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,670
-Five minutes is all I need.
-What?

197
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,159
Steve Sherwood. What's your name?

198
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,992
-Susie.
-Nice to meet you, Susie.

199
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,355
-What time do you finish here?
-About 10:00.

200
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,829
Right, do you mind if I give you a call?

201
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,229
-Sure, okay.
-What's your number?

202
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,716
-Speak to you later.
-Okay.

203
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,912
Player. Respect, man.
Darren Lamb, agent to Andy Millman.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,309
-This is Steve Sherwood, friend of mine.
-Are you a friend of his?

205
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,233
I don't think so.
This guy's an absolute player. Respect again.

206
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,676
Listen, if we're talking about the honeys.
There's a chick I've got my eye on actually.

207
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,910
-Who?
-Her.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,753
-Maggie.
-Maggie? Forget it.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,638
Yeah, from what I've heard, she's pretty easy.

210
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,075
Yeah. She's not that easy. Good luck.

211
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,991
How would you approach it?
I mean, what sort of...

212
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,311
Just walk straight up to her and say, "I've
been admiring you from afar for a long time

213
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,960
"and I haven't said anything,
but I would love to take you out one night

214
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,712
"and see if we have
as good a time as I think we will.

215
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,631
"Would you like to have dinner
with me sometime?"

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,039
-Bang.
-Okay.

217
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,678
-Don't think about it. Just do it.
-Just do it.

218
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,034
No. Don't do it, please.

219
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,759
-Well, he says do it.
-Get over there. Go on.

220
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,432
Oh, look at him.

221
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,957
-Maggie, hello, sorry to...
-Hi.

222
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,793
Erm, just wanted to let you know
that I've been watching you secretly

223
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,839
without you knowing and I would be
very keen to spend the night with you

224
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,357
and see if you enjoy it
as much as I know I will and, erm,

225
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,752
happy to pay for it as well if, you know,
for dinner, if you want to, if you eat dinner...

226
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,831
Obviously you eat dinner.

227
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,595
-Are you asking me out?
-Yeah.

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,553
-What, and cook me dinner?
-I can cook you dinner if you want, yeah.

229
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,039
-Can you cook?
-Yes.

230
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,509
-Yeah, okay, then.
-Really?

231
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,790
-Yeah.
-Okay, cool.

232
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,839
-I'll give you a call, shall l?
-Yeah.

233
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,352
-See you later.
-Bye.

234
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,150
-What did she say?
-She said yes.

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,313
Really? Oh, my God.
It's worse than I thought.

236
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,437
-She's hit rock bottom.
-Yes, she has.

237
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,559
Do you know what? I've never seen him
even try and chat up a woman.

238
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,596
No, no, because I wouldn't do it
in front of you, would l?

239
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,432
I'm actually beginning to think
he might be a bit gay.

240
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,557
-Join the club.
-No. Don't join any club because I'm not.

241
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,039
Sure, you could chat up a woman right now.

242
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,712
-Yes, if I wanted to.
-Go on, then.

243
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,631
-I don't want to.
-We've both done it.

244
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,792
-Go on. This one coming now, go on.
-No, no, no, no.

245
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,030
(IMITATING CHICKEN CLUCKING)

246
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,473
Hi.

247
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,915
Hi, do you know what, er,
time we finish tonight?

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,513
Oh, I don't know. About 10:00-ish, I think.

249
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,033
10:00, hey...

250

(SPLUTTERING)

251
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,470
Just wanted to know what time we finished.
Cheers. That was unlucky.

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,959
(GASPING)

253
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,076
She answered me and everything.
10:00, she said.

254
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,630
You know, are you still... Sparkling.

255
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,637
She definitely noticed.

256
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,119
(COUGHING)

257
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,078
McKELLEN: Tilly, I thought
she was interesting.

That... That's better. That one.

259
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,796
-Hello.
-Hello, Andy Millman.

260
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,952
-Andy, do sit down.
-It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir Ian.

261
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,113
Please, no titles in the workplace. Thank you.

262
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,509
Andy Millman.

263
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,671
Good, good.

264
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,557
Not much theatre work of late?

265
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,358
-No, no.
-No, that's fine.

266
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,036
You're in good hands here.

267
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,957
How do I act so well?

268
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,072
What I do is I pretend to be

269
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,232
the person I'm portraying in the film or play.

270
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,035
Yeah.

271
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,315
-You're confused. It's perfectly simple.
-No.

272
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,949
Case in point, Lord of the Rings.
Peter Jackson comes from New Zealand,

273
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,999
says to me, "Sir Ian,
I want you to be Gandalf the wizard."'

274
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,198
And I say to him, "You are aware
that I am not really a wizard."'

275
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,953
And he said, "Yes, I am aware of that.
What I want you to do

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,149
"is to use your acting skills to portray
the wizard for the duration of the film."'

277
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,599
So I said, "Okay."'

278
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,753
And then I said to myself,
"Hmm, how would I do that?"

279
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,431
And this is what I did.

280
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,153
I imagined what it would be like
to be a wizard

281
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,036
and then I pretended

282
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,588
and acted in that way on the day.

283
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,280
-Yeah.
-And how did I know what to say?

284
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,591
(WHISPERING) The words
were written down for me in a script.

285
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,150
How did I know where to stand?
People told me.

286
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,558
If we were to draw a graph of my process,
of my method,

287
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,871
it would be something like this.
Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian, action!

288
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,353
"Wizard, you shall not pass!"
Cut. Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian.

289
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,559
-Okay, do you see?
-Yeah.

290
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,599
Now, you would be pretending
to be John in this play.

291
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,192
And how would you know what to say?
Well, the words will be in the script.

292
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,635
-Yeah.
-And you would learn the words.

293
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,870
You would not have the script on the night.

294
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,269
And that goes for everybody.
There will be no scripts on the night.

295
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,554
-You'll learn the words.
-Yeah, l...

296
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,313
And you will speak them
as if you were saying them for the first time.

297
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,709
-I didn't think we would have the script.
-No, you won't.

298
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,155
Because if you did have the script,
it would break the illusion

299
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,958
-and the whole thing is illusion. Do you see?
-Of course.

300
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,190
-You are not really John.
-No, I know.

301
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,829
You are pretending and that is acting.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,433
What's the...

303
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,518
What's the play about?

304
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,879
It's a new play by Charley, Charley Heyward.
And as I say, you would be the part of John.

305
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,632
And you're in love with Fran.

306
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,793
And the whole centrepiece of the play
is the emotional confrontation

307
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,032
where the two of you address
those unspoken feelings...

308
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,633
-Okay.
-...that you've been bottling up.

309
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,154
-That sounds challenging. Yeah.
-Oh, I hope so.

310
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,834
And, I don't know, is it anything
that you'd be interested in?

311
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,674
-Oh, definitely, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Great.

312
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,751
So let me introduce you to the team.

313
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,593
-There's Fran, who's your lover.
-Yeah.

314
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,593
-Leslie. Leslie, this is Andy.
-Good to meet you.

315
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,035
-You're Fran? Fran's a man?
-Yes.

316
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,793
It can be because Fran Healy out of Travis.

317
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,238
-What?
-Yep.

318
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,077
And our clever little writer, Charley.

319
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,639
Who's a woman!

320
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,510
-I'm Fran's lover in this?
-Yes. Fran.

321
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,912
Can l... Can I have a quick look
at the script just before... Yeah.

322
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,032
No one said anything about that...

323
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,678
And I don't know
if you'd be happy to do this...

324
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,910
Yeah. I just want to...

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,877
We thought we might do a little workshop

326
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,190
of some of the lines, you know,
get it up on its feet.

327
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,714
Kick it around a bit, I don't know.
Do you have time for that?

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,870
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Andy?

329
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,279
Can I get you something?

330
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,555
-Some water, cup of tea?
-Yeah, yeah. Tea.

331
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,235
-George, will you get Andy a cup of tea?
-Yeah, no problem.

332
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,117
George. Of course.

333
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,712
All right?

334
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,231
Moron.

335
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,072
-What? Are you talking to me?
-Yeah, I'm talking to you.

336
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,833
-Why didn't you tell me it was a gay play?
-What... What gay?

337
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,797
The play I'm in that you got me,
A Month Of Summers.

338
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,111
It's a gay play. I've got to play a gay
with another gay, acting all gay,

339
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,636
all through the play. It's... It's so gay.

340
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,428
Do not worry. Do you know why?
Gay, my friend, is all the rage.

341
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,556
-What does that mean?
-Let me tell you what it means.

342
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,837
It will show you are sensitive.
It will show that you are versatile, all right?

343
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,799
Case in point, Mr Thomas Hanks, okay?
Now people weren't interested in Tom Hanks

344
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,518
and suddenly he does that film,
Philadelphia, yeah.

345
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,070
Remember in that film he played
a skinny little bent fellow, remember?

346
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,720
After that, everyone loved him.
Do you know what I mean?

347
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,950
Or those two guys from Brokeback Mountain.
They're not even gay.

348
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,600
I was watching that, right,
and they were getting off with each other.

349
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,829
Oh, I was sick to the stomach.

350
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,558
They were so convincing
that even though I was going,

351
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,039
"They're not really queer,
they're not really queer,"

352
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,396
I was still repulsed
because of how good they were.

353
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,828
When did you go and see
Brokeback Mountain?

354
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,195
I watched it on DVD with Bar.

355
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,713
I don't know.

356
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,150
(BOYS KEEP SWINGING PLAYING)

357
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,396
John, I love you.

358
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,794
I know.

359
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,478
Yes. That's lovely.

360
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,154
Thanks.

361
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,279
Hi. Can I just check
there are some tickets for, uh,

362
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,157
my colleagues from the BBC
who should be coming down.

363
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,357
Damon Beesley plus one
and lain Morris plus one.

364
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,552
-Yeah. We've got them.
-Oh, great, okay, well...

365
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,359
-Andy Pandy!
-Oh.

366
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,318
You remember these boys from school,
don't you? Nobby, Boss Hogg, Gut Rot.

367
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,038
(STAMMERING) What are you doing here?

368
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,315
-You're not here for the play, are you?
-Yeah. We've got tickets.

369
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,879
Oh, not your type of thing.

370
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,678
No, no, no. We're looking forward to it.
What's it about?

371
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,354
It's all feelings and emotions.
I'm just here for the...

372
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,352
Oh, no. Oh, God, look at that.
Poofters at 1 2:00.

373
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,555
What can you do?

374
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,392
-Is that your audience, is it?
-No way.

375
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,552
-Andy? Hiya!
-Fans.

376
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,308
-Thanks for sorting out tickets, love.
-No worries.

377
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,992
Why are you sorting the Village People out
with tickets?

378
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,513
Village People!

379
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,593
-Guess who!
-Bunny. Christ!

380
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,753
I couldn't miss
my little genie's first grown-up play.

381
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,513
Oh, you do hang around
with all the butch boys, don't you?

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,953
Hello, I'm Bunny.

383
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,830
-He was... He was... How's the wife?
-Oh, gone. I was living a lie and she knew it.

384
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,515
But now I'm able to go out
and enjoy some serious cock, guilt free.

385
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,673
Yuma, yuma, yuma, yuma. Break a leg.

386
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,753
I'm going to, er, go down, get changed.

387
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,829
Come down for a few beers if you want,
but don't hang around for this shit.

388
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,079
-Hello.
-Hi.

389
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,798
-How are you doing?
-Good.

390
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,917
I've just been talking to Leslie
and we think it would be better

391
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,436
if at the end of act two,
you were to kiss each other.

392
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,157
-No.
-No?

393
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,232
Leslie and you kiss each other
at the end of act two?

394
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,833
-Ah. No, no.
-No?

395
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,993
-No. Why?
-Because it's too obvious.

396
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,356
Oh, now, dear.
Don't forget you've finally been able

397
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,839
-to express your feelings...
-Yeah.

398
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,514
...toward each other
for the first time in 20 years

399
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,991
and I think a kiss would be a sort of
physicalisation of this emotional liberation.

400
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,311
You know, your freedom to show the world
what you are.

401
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,833
Not the whole world, though.

402
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,150
Let's... Let's give them a clue,
but let's keep it subtle.

403
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,389
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

404
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,072
-But if he just leans over you...
-Yeah.

405
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,994
Kisses me on the cheek,
shake hands, curtain comes down.

406
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,197
Bravo, encore.
What a brilliantly directed play. Well done!

407
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,430
Well, thank you, dear.
No, dear, he must kiss you on the lips.

408
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,158
-No. He can't kiss me on the lips.
-Why is that?

409
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,117
-Cold sore.
-Where?

410
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,316
-Yeah, opening night. Sod's law.
-What, let me see.

411
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,152
-You can't really... It's underneath.
-No!

412
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,435
-Don't you worry about that.
-I do worry about that.

413
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,592
We'll soon sort that out.
Old theatre trick. Yeah.

414
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,274
George, can you get us some Vaseline?

415
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,479
DARREN: Hello, all right?
MAGGIE: Hello, yes.

416
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,154
DARREN: Come in, come through.
This is the crib.

417
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,559
-So, um...
-God, it's big!

418
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,632
-No, it's... Well, er, yes. Yeah, it's all right.
-It's nice, isn't it?

419
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,075
-I've bought you...
-Oh, thank you very much. Is that red or...

420
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,513
It's red, but I'll drink anything.

421
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,989
-No. I got red myself.
-Oh, right, okay.

422
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,116
So obviously we're both fans of red.

423
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,758
-Fine.
-I quite like wine.

424
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,114
I like anything, me.

425
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,998
Sorry. Do you want me to take your coat
because it's quite hot in here?

426
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,513
-Because of the cooking.
-It's a nice smell.

427
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,672
Yeah, no, it's... Well, we're going sort of...
Sort of Oriental.

428
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,955
-Will I just hang it up?
-Yeah, just hang it up, yeah.

Come on, Fran! You're like an old lady.

431
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,914
I stopped to pick up this shell. Look.

432
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,275
-It's beautiful.
-IT is.

we came here?

434
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,869
-Yeah, with Paul.
-Yeah.

435
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,156
-Ah, bloody sea.
-Why are you so scared of the sea?

436
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,239
I'm not scared of the sea.
It's just when it gets in your shoes,

437
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,995
the salt-water just rots away the stitches
and they fall apart

438
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,473
-and you... You have to throw them away.
-Are you still talking about the sea?

439
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,314
-Of course. What else?
-You're mad.

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,038
Fran! Wait for me!

442
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,037
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

443
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,519
-Ooh.
-Yeah.

444
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,159
You've got to go like that.
It kept getting caught.

445
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,394
-Christmas?
-Yeah.

446
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,358
-That's not a proper Christmas.
-No. It's just... I like the sound of it.

447
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,432
I know, but you can't have
a proper Christmas dinner in Ibiza.

448
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,352
(TOILET FLUSHING)

449
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,908
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, just waiting for the cistern to refill.

450
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,837
Just left a bit of...

451
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,469
Didn't, you know, flush away completely.
So... Anyway...

452
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,511
-Are you going to sit down?
-No,

453
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,591
'cause it's on my mind, to be honest, so...

454
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,672
-Okay, right, right.
-I want to get it sorted.

455
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,590
-Is that all right?
-Yes. Just...

456
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,071
Let's have another go.

457
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,752
(TOILET FLUSHING)

458
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,432
Oh, for fuck's sake.

459
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,999
Don't worry about it.

460
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,718
Do you know,
I don't want you to have to see it.

461
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,395
I don't want you to have to worry about it.

462
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,232
That'll sort it.

463
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,391
I was just mashing it up.

464
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,192
You kept the shell?

465
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,948
Of course I did. You gave it to me.

466
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,911
It wasn't mine to give.

467
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,478
I kept it anyway.

468
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,632
Nearer the knee.

469
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,793
John, I love you.

470
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,230
In the play. I know.

471
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,589
-I'm going to kiss you.
-No point.

472
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,270
Silly. Sometimes I don't know
what you're talking about.

473
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,557
We do, we agreed.
If any nonsense happens, I'm going home!

474
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,437
Let's just have a lovely evening

475
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,990
and appreciate the stars and the moon
as agreed, okay?

476
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,799
So just run to the next bit.

477
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,711
It's not going to happen.

478
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,552
Who the fuck's that?

479
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,429
What are you doing?
It's like Deliverance in here.

480
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,476
What are you playing at?

481
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,830
I said I wouldn't do the kiss.

482
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,109
McClellan comes to me five minutes before
and drops that bombshell on me.

483
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,590
"Oh, we'd like you to do the kiss."'
Not my cup of tea, mate.

484
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,309
And then all that.
And him a knight of the realm.

485
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,633
Do you want to do the end bit without that?
Oh, he's got the hump.

486
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,399
No understudy, so I'm afraid
that's the end of the run. Sorry about that.

487
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,916
We'd nearly finished anyway, to be fair.
Only about five minutes to go, wasn't there?

488
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,233
All you missed was, er, we find out me
and Fran were both having it off with Paul.

489
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,118
Do you remember Paul we mentioned earlier?

490
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,039
Paul killed himself
'cause he was wracked with guilt

491
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,396
about doing both of us
behind the other one's back.

492
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,875
So...

493
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,749
She's writing all this down.
That's not very good, is it?

494
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,918
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

495
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,551
Not my audience, so what?

496
00:28:00,305 --> 00:29:00,885

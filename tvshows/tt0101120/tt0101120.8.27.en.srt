1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,855
You guys ready for
the farewell show?

2
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:05,085
Yes, sirree! And we're
gonna go out on top!

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:07,455
We're gonna go out on top
and we're gonna segue

4
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,027
to new beginnings
and brighter tomorrows!

5
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:10,257
That's the spirit, Al.

6
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:12,626
All right! Oh,
I'm a total wreck.

7
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,428
I can't believe this
is going to be over.

8
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:16,364
Oh, I know.
Me either.

9
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:19,500
This is the last time I'm
gonna introduce you guys.

10
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:22,270
The last time I'm
gonna give you CPR.

11
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,474
Oh, gosh! I'm gonna
miss all this!

12
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,411
I'm even gonna
miss your putdowns.

13
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:35,549
Just because the show's over doesn't
mean the putdowns have to stop.

14
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:38,519
I can insult you
long-distance.

15
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,922
What do you mean,
long-distance?

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,959
Jill got a job at a family
practice in Bloomington.

17
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,993
Looks like we're
moving to Indiana.

18
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,061
Indiana?

19
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:48,596
Our lives are changing so fast!

20
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:52,233
- Oh, stop the roller coaster!
- Oh.

21
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,334
Al... Al...

22
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:54,469
You know what, Tim?

23
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,504
I knew we had to
say good-bye to <i>Tool Time,</i>

24
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,973
I didn't realize we'd have
to say good-bye to you.

25
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:03,011
You know, but change can be a good thing.
Al's getting married.

26
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,080
- Well, that's true.
- Yeah!

27
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,415
- Yeah!
- All right.

28
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:09,150
And you know what?
I'm pregnant.

29
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:11,285
She's pregnant.

30
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,790
This is it!
Today's the big day!

31
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:19,561
Talk about a hot show!

32
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:21,863
I got about 20 fire
marshals standing by

33
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,699
for when you "accidentally"
burn down the set.

34
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,447
Do you really want us
to burn down the set?

35
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,536
How do you sleep at night,
young man?

36
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:31,939
Trust me, gang,
the show's gonna be huge.

37
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,141
But since I'm a VP
I get to watch it

38
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,245
at Binford HQ with the COO,
the CFO and the CEO.

39
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:41,682
Which one would be the SOB?

40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,186
Oh, I get it. You're doing
a fun thing with letters.

41
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,956
All right!
Break a leg, guys!

42
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:52,359
You know, I think starting
electrical fires is a stupid idea!

43
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,562
Heidi, Heidi, Heidi...
Shh. Come on, guys.

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,130
This is our last <i>Tool Time.</i>

45
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:57,669
Morgan Wandell's not gonna
tell us what to do.

46
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,334
- He's not?
- No.

47
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,602
<i>Tool Time's</i> going out
like we came in.

48
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,104
With no audience?

49
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,708
No. With style,
with class.

50
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:12,113
No stupid fires, no fake explosions
and no staged accidents.

51
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,314
Yeah...

52
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,061
See, it's much better
when it's real.

53
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,714
<i>Well, hidey ho, neighborette.</i>

54
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:24,953
<i>Oh, my! I see Al and Trudy's wedding
arrangements are progressing.</i>

55
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,387
Yeah. But
the seating arrangement,

56
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:29,624
it's all messed up,
just like my life.

57
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:33,093
<i>Now wait a second, Jill. I thought you
were gonna take that job in Indiana.</i>

58
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,496
<i>Tim told me it was all set.</i>

59
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,163
Yeah. Well, yeah.
That's what we decided.

60
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:39,433
But I haven't been able
to make the phone call.

61
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,403
It's a great opportunity.
The whole family's being real supportive.

62
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,740
You know, I just don't know
what's holding me back.

63
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,810
<i>Well, Jill, this has been
your home for 20 years.</i>

64
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:51,546
<i>You'd have to leave
your whole life behind.</i>

65
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:54,882
<i>You'd have to say good-bye
to all your old friends.</i>

66
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,318
<i>We'd have to say
good-bye to you.</i>

67
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:58,786
So you're telling me to stay.

68
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:00,020
<i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>

69
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:01,322
You're telling me to go.

70
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,457
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

71
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:06,094
Hello, not helping!

72
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,496
<i>Jill, this move is
a very difficult decision.</i>

73
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:11,098
<i>I can't be the one to make it.</i>

74
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:15,803
When I was a little girl
we moved all the time.

75
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,739
My mom never questioned it.
She'd just say,

76
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:19,277
"Whatever's good for your
father is good for all of us."

77
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:21,275
And we'd pack our bags
and follow him.

78
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:24,579
<i>So, basically, for 20 years
you've been following Tim.</i>

79
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:27,314
Yeah. Right to
the emergency room.

80
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:29,150
Now, see,
that was the beauty of it.

81
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:32,419
I married Tim, we moved
into this wonderful house,

82
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:35,223
and I got to put down roots
for the first time in my life.

83
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,861
And I've really cherished that.

84
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,831
<i>Yes. But on the other hand,
Tim is making a huge change.</i>

85
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,667
<i>He's willing to base
his life around you.</i>

86
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,902
<i>I really think
that's worth considering.</i>

87
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,038
What if we go to Indiana
and it all falls apart?

88
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:53,107
<i>Well, what if it doesn't
and you're a huge success?</i>

89
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:56,477
So, I should go, shouldn't I?

90
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:59,013
<i>Jill, there is no limit
to what you can accomplish.</i>

91
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,781
<i>But if you want me to stand here</i>

92
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,783
<i>and sell my best friends
on leaving,</i>

93
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,519
<i>I really cannot do that.</i>

94
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:09,490
Wilson, I'm really
gonna miss you.

95
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:10,858
<i>So I take it you are going?</i>

96
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:12,165
Unless you think I should stay.

97
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:13,761
<i>Jill!</i>

98
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:15,563
I'll make the call.

99
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,778
Thank you, everybody.
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

100
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,769
I am, and for the last time,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

101
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,074
And of course you all know
my assistant,

102
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:26,307
"Al be doing infomercials
for a living" Borland.

103
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:32,346
It should be a nice show.
It's our last show.

104
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:35,249
Of course, we all hope to be on
to bigger and better things.

105
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:40,488
As a matter of fact, Al here's
getting married this weekend.

106
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:43,157
We have a great
last show for you today.

107
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,300
Binford wants us to intentionally
overload a household outlet like this.

108
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:56,170
Thereby starting a fire and
burning the entire set down.

109
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:58,806
Instead, I'm gonna show you
the right way to do this.

110
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:02,844
Folks, just get
a surge protector. Duh.

111
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:04,546
End of segment.

112
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:08,616
Good night, everybody!

113
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,852
Oh, I know what you're thinking.
Come on! Last <i>Tool Time?</i>

114
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,788
Just plugging in a toaster?

115
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:17,091
Come on! Aren't you gonna
light anything on fire?

116
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,197
Of course we're gonna
light something on fire.

117
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,860
We're gonna burn
this place down, baby!

118
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:22,263
With everybody that
helped us build it.

119
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,136
These diehard fans dropped
whatever they were doing

120
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,606
to be on this
last <i>Tool Time</i> with us.

121
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,368
Let's have a warm
<i>Tool Time</i> welcome

122
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:30,037
for America's
favorite all-tool band!

123
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:31,538
The K & B Boys!

124
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,441
Rock, Dwayne, Pete and Duke!

125
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:42,283
And on handsaw,
the lovely Janine!

126
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:48,026
You guys are here
to play music, right?

127
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:51,092
Yes, sirree, Timmy! Pete!

128
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,994
That would be me.

129
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:58,332
One, two...
One, two, three!

130
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:23,091
Go get them, Pete!

131
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,994
Ladies and gentlemen,
on staple gun,

132
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,296
master upholsterer,
Sparky Henderson!

133
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,206
On shock absorber,
Eddie from Eddie's Body Shop!

134
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,812
On plunger, plumber Felix Myman!

135
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:52,453
And on horn, Mario Andretti!

136
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:04,998
One, two...
One, two, three, four!

137
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,312
Where's my can?

138
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,116
<i>The last time I looked it was below
your back and above your knees.</i>

139
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:57,422
Where am I supposed to put
the garbage?

140
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:58,853
<i>Hey, give it to me.</i>

141
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,922
<i>Jill moved all your trash
cans over to my side</i>

142
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:03,724
<i>so there'd be more room
for the wedding.</i>

143
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,100
If this fence weren't here,
we'd have so much more room,

144
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,933
we could push the chairs
all the way to one side.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,168
<i>You know, Tim, you're right.</i>

146
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,137
<i>We could have all the
chairs facing this way.</i>

147
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,173
<i>Right. And I would build
the arch in your yard.</i>

148
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,645
<i>Well, why don't we
take the fence down?</i>

149
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,877
Well, we certainly could.

150
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,480
Well, should we?

151
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:27,681
<i>We could always put it
back up after the wedding.</i>

152
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:30,121
How come we've never thought about
taking this fence down before?

153
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,219
<i>Oh, I don't know. Maybe
we didn't want to reveal</i>

154
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,422
<i>too much of ourselves.</i>

155
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,560
But we went ahead and
revealed everything anyway.

156
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:42,630
<i>Yeah. Let's take
this sucker down.</i>

157
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:44,098
I got a hammer.
I'll go get it.

158
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,368
<i>No, no, no. I got some tools over here.
Take what you need.</i>

159
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:51,004
<i>- You got a pry bar in there?
- Yeah.</i>

160
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,040
<i>Okay. Oh, boy!</i>

161
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:56,510
<i>- Oh, no.
- Hmm?</i>

162
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,680
What's that?

163
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,450
<i>How many times
do I have to bury you?</i>

164
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:09,456
- Wait till you hear the latest news.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

165
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:11,858
After the final show, Binford
was practically begging me

166
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:15,563
to come back to work. They offered
me more money, executive producer.

167
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,331
<i>So now you're thinking
about staying?</i>

168
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,199
<i>Please, Tim,
do not toy with me like this.</i>

169
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:23,103
<i>You people are wreaking havoc
on my emotions!</i>

170
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:25,072
Calm down. The decision is made.
We're moving.

171
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,875
It's just that they were dangling a
pretty big carrot in front of me.

172
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,010
<i>Yeah, well, you gave that
carrot up for Jill.</i>

173
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,013
<i>She must've appreciated
your generosity for that.</i>

174
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,148
Uh, actually,
she doesn't know about this.

175
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:37,585
I don't want this
to affect her decision, okay?

176
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,253
<i>You're a good man, Tim.</i>

177
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:41,756
<i>I'm gonna miss having you
as a neighbor.</i>

178
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,858
You've been a good neighbor,
too, Wilson.

179
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:46,327
An odd one.

180
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:52,099
Hey.

181
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,101
Yeah. All right.

182
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:00,140
Wow!

183
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,909
Now we can see everything.

184
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:06,146
<i>Does it look any different
than you thought it would?</i>

185
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:07,881
Your fly's open.

186
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:17,023
Well, it looks like it's
gonna be a great wedding.

187
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,293
- I'm really glad we're doing this for Al.
- Me, too.

188
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:22,262
This white wedding arch
you made is so beautiful.

189
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,835
You know, I was gonna
go with golden arches

190
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:27,300
but I was afraid we'd have to
serve over two billion Borlands.

191
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,269
Look, look!
Harry and Delores!

192
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:31,272
Welcome back.

193
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,774
Hey, guys. I saw Al getting
his picture taken.

194
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:35,576
Looks like he's gonna
go through with this.

195
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:38,712
Yeah? Well, I'm betting
it's gonna go the other way.

196
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,614
And he's not alone.

197
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,554
You guys are betting
on a wedding? That's sick!

198
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:50,190
Put me down for 100.
I say he gets married.

199
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:54,428
And I got 40 bucks says
he's wearing a flannel thong.

200
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,564
Hey, I want some of that action.

201
00:11:57,632 --> 00:12:00,234
I mean, you know,
I want to bet on it.

202
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:03,370
Hi.

203
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:06,273
Hello. Is this delivery
for Al and Trudy?

204
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:09,076
No. Delivery for
Tim and Jill.

205
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,977
- What?
- Morgan Wandell.

206
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:13,914
Binford VP of media production,
and you are even prettier

207
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:15,716
than the way Tim described you.

208
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:17,117
Really?

209
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:18,251
How did he describe me?

210
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,054
Okay, he didn't.

211
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,022
Look, I need to see Tim.

212
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,795
I've been trying to convince
him to stay with <i>Tool Time.</i>

213
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,458
He keeps turning me down.

214
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:27,327
He hated what you did
to his show.

215
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,730
No. That's all changed
since the last episode.

216
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:31,932
We offered to make him
the executive producer

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,101
and we offered to
give him a big raise.

218
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:38,072
But he won't budge.
Something about Indiana.

219
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,142
He turned you down
because of my job offer?

220
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:43,009
I guess so.

221
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:45,980
Must be hard for you to live
with that one on your shoulder.

222
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,349
Look, I resent you trying
to make me feel guilty.

223
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,222
Now, if you don't mind, we're
in the middle of a wedding.

224
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:52,519
To which you were not invited.

225
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:53,858
All right. But I'm
gonna lose my job.

226
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:54,992
I'm terribly sorry.
Please, go.

227
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:56,160
All right, I'm Morgan Wandell.

228
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,959
- Yeah.
- I'm Morgan Wandell.

229
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:13,440
So, how come your husband's not here?
Problems at home?

230
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,276
No. He's away
on an assignment.

231
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:19,413
Well, if you were my wife,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

232
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:23,484
Well, I'm not your wife and you
still won't leave me alone.

233
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:33,127
You are the most amazing
and wonderful man.

234
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:35,729
Well, hold that thought.
The wedding's starting.

235
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:38,666
And I got a lot of
money riding on this.

236
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:43,671
They make a lovely couple.

237
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:45,576
Well, they say when you live
together for a long time,

238
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:48,208
you start looking
like each other.

239
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:02,690
Oh, look. Trudy
looks so beautiful.

240
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,526
The minister's starting.
All bets are down.

241
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:08,929
Dearly beloved,

242
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:13,334
we are gathered here for this
joyous and deeply moving...

243
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:16,040
Are you gonna cry through this wedding
just like you did through ours?

244
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,272
Yes. But this time
I'm happy.

245
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:25,479
And I look forward to spending
the rest of my life with you,

246
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:29,350
and to someday hear the pitter-patter
of little Borland feet.

247
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:34,454
Do they make
a steel-toed work bootie?

248
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:38,859
And now Al would like to recite
the vows that he wrote for Trudy.

249
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,194
My darling Trudy,

250
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:46,834
what more could a man ask for than to
be with a magnificent woman like you?

251
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:51,905
You are my rock, my soul
mate and my partner

252
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:55,276
through this journey
I like to call...

253
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,380
Life.

254
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:06,253
Come, my sweet princess, and
we shall walk hand in hand...

255
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:08,688
Directly into <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

256
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:13,893
Cal, the rings, please?

257
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:22,102
Trudy, do you take Al to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

258
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:26,506
for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health,

259
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:28,008
till death do you part?

260
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,710
I do.

261
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:33,012
Al, do you take Trudy to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

262
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,618
for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health,

263
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:39,286
till death do you part?

264
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:40,854
You bet I do.

265
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:52,365
Now by the power vested in me
by the state of Michigan

266
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:55,202
and the Church of
the Celestial Moon,

267
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:03,176
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

268
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:05,679
Al, you may kiss the bride.

269
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:22,400
Jill, we're in
the middle of a wedding.

270
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,468
What do you want to talk about?

271
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:25,131
Please sit down in the hot rod.

272
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,201
I don't care what it's about.

273
00:16:30,204 --> 00:16:33,807
I can't believe that you
turned down Binford for me.

274
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,442
How did you find that out?

275
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,345
Morgan stopped by to bribe
us with a cheese basket.

276
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:41,515
What kind of cheese?

277
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,250
Giving up that promotion
was the sweetest,

278
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,051
most selfless thing
you've ever done.

279
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:47,558
It's the least I could do for you,
honey, after all you've done for me.

280
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:49,323
And you really deserve
this opportunity.

281
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,124
Yeah, I know I do.
But I don't want it.

282
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:52,592
I don't want to go to Indiana.

283
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,498
This is exactly why I didn't
let you know about this.

284
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:56,563
I knew you'd change
your mind because of me.

285
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,498
I don't want to leave here!

286
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:00,901
And this is an opportunity
that you have always wanted,

287
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,003
to executive produce <i>Tool Time.</i>

288
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:06,873
Look, if I can find a job like that in
Indiana, I can find one like that here.

289
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,446
But not with Dr. Lee.
You said yourself

290
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:11,044
this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

291
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,347
Where are you guys going?

292
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:17,451
Hop in. I'll tell
you all about it.

293
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:22,256
Wait. We're not going to
Indiana now, are we?

294
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,792
We're not going
to Indiana at all.

295
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,661
- All right!
- Oh, shoot!

296
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:29,563
- Yes, we are!
- All right!

297
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,164
Okay. We're gonna
think about it.

298
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:32,699
All right.

299
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,872
All right, everybody.

300
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,809
For the last 10 years, Al,
you've been my right-hand man.

301
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:48,548
And you've not only been a big part of
my life, in many cases you've saved it.

302
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,096
Trudy, you're getting
a hell of a guy.

303
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:52,252
I know.

304
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:55,622
It's a very special day. And if you're
wearing a certain kind of underwear,

305
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,558
a very lucrative one.

306
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,361
- To Al and Trudy!
- <i>To Al and Trudy!</i>

307
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:04,130
<i>- Health and happiness!
- Health and happiness!</i>

308
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:06,199
Hear, hear.

309
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,168
All right.
I just want to say...

310
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:11,204
I want to thank Tim and Jill

311
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:16,610
for opening up
their house to us, and...

312
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,213
Well, Tim, we've just...
We've gone through so much.

313
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:24,117
And I... Well,
I want to thank you

314
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:27,354
for giving me
my start on <i>Tool Time.</i>

315
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,292
This has been a difficult year,

316
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,628
and you guys have been there
for me every step of the way.

317
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,298
And no matter where you
go or what you do,

318
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:41,201
I just want you to know that
you'll always be my best friends.

319
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:43,904
Al... Al...

320
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:46,707
Oh, and, Trudy, thank
you for marrying me!

321
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:50,377
- You're welcome.
- Trudy and Al!

322
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:52,646
<i>- Trudy and Al.
- Trudy and Al!</i>

323
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,081
All right.

324
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:58,785
Oh, look. Al must've
dropped his wedding vows.

325
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,787
We should put them
in a special place.

326
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:02,656
Okay. Toss them in here.

327
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,460
Look, your wedding arch
didn't fall down.

328
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:11,131
Do you remember the last time
we were under one of those?

329
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:14,801
We had no money, we had no kids.

330
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:17,938
No idea how our lives
would turn out.

331
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:21,641
I think, so far, they've
turned out pretty well.

332
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,478
If you had to go back and do it
all over again, would you do it?

333
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:27,847
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

334
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:31,385
I mean, there's been
bumps along the road.

335
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,387
I haven't always known
where we were headed.

336
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:38,192
There was always a possibility
of a crash, but...

337
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,161
I wouldn't want to travel
with anybody else.

338
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,831
You?

339
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:46,071
As a matter of fact,
I would change things.

340
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,735
Yeah? What would
you change?

341
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:51,772
I don't think I'd propose to you
in the back of a '68 Dodge Dart.

342
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,373
273...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,

343
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,142
what kind of car
would you choose?

344
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,976
That's not what I mean.

345
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:00,347
If I had to do it again, I'd
pick a more romantic spot.

346
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,387
First time I looked at you,
I knew I wanted

347
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,318
to spend the rest
of my life with you.

348
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:09,089
Now 20 years later,
I have the same feelings.

349
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:13,193
Except this numbness
in my thumb I can't explain.

350
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,695
Jill Patterson,
would you marry me?

351
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,098
No.

352
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,734
No?

353
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:24,571
I'm already married
to the perfect guy.

354
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,651
I know you don't want
to go to Indiana.

355
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,654
It's not about me.
It's about you.

356
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:43,256
Do you want to give up
this opportunity?

357
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:44,625
Yeah, I am.

358
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,861
I don't want to
leave my life here.

359
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,965
I just can't imagine
leaving this house.

360
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,645
Well, if we ever decide to move,

361
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:08,515
maybe we wouldn't have to
leave the house.

362
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:14,221
What does that mean?

363
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,601
Are we gonna drive this thing
the whole way?

364
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,105
No. Don't be ridiculous. There's
faster ways to get there than by land.

365
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,941
Like what?

366
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:38,578
I didn't know
a tugboat could go this fast.

367
00:21:38,646 --> 00:21:40,713
It can if it's got more power!

368
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:53,427
So, instead, we're just gonna show
you the proper way to do it, folks.

369
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:56,029
Just get yourself a...

370
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:00,500
Well...

371
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:04,838
To Al and Heidi.
Health and happiness.

372
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,474
Heidi?

373
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,443
Who's Heidi?

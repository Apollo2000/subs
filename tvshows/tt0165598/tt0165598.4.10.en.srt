1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,660
So, what are you boys
doing tonight?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,260
Well, this evening, Miss Big Rhonda
returns from the dirt farms of Mississippi.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,420
I am off to the bus station...

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,940
and she will melt
into my loving arms.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,500
Well, you better wear a raincoat,
'cause she ain't small.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,460
She is big, isn't she?

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,260
Well, I'm taking
this chick up to the lake for some...

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,220
you know, bird-watching.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,180
Ooh, bird-watching.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,740
I think me and Jackie are going
to go "bird-watching" too.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,540
It's cool, 'cause they don't know
what we're talking about.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,940
Think they cracked it, Kelso.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,020
Well, I guess it's just us Three Musketeers
tonight, huh?

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,500
"All for one and one for all," right?

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>Well, um, actually...</i>

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,500
your father and I were
gonna do some reading...

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,860
upstairs...

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,260
together.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,820
What your mom's trying to say is,
"Go away for 20 minutes."

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,180
Forty-five minutes, Red.

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,540
- Thirty.
- Thirty-five.

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,340
Fine.
Get lost for 35 minutes.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,700
Fine. But you know what?
I got a little question for you.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,380
Why have kids if you ain't
gonna spend time with them?

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,820
I suggest you use your 35 minutes
to think about that.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,660
He needs a new girlfriend.

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,100
Come on, Kitty.
You're on the clock.

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,500
Oh, you know what? Just turn off your clock.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

29
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,740
You can't turn off the clock!

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,780
She doesn't understand the clock.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,074

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Cocoa Puff!

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Mashed potato!

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,520
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I wanted to see you...

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
because I wanted
to ask you something.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,880
- Will you go out with me this Saturday?
- Oh, my God.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Course I will!

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,800
Can't...

39
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,040
breathe.

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,800
- It hurts.
- Ah, suck it up.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,360
Wow, strong girl.

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,200
Crap-alula.

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,600
Fez just asked me out.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm so nervous, and I left
my asthma puffer in Mississippi.

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,360
I've never been on a real date.
What am I gonna wear?

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,880
Who cares?
You could be naked with a welding hat...

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,840
and Fez'd still be all over you.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,440
Well, that sounds fun.

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,320
But I want it to be special.

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,240
- You know what? We'll help you get ready.
- Really?

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,120
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, that'll be great. I wanna look pretty.

52
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,880
Pretty?

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,360
Oh, sweetie, maybe you can
learn some jokes or something.

54
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,240
Look, dropout, this coupon says
20 cents off the athlete's-foot cream.

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,480
- So pay up!
- Is there, uh, a problem here?

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,320
This sad little man
has fungussy feet but won't spend the 20...

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,480
Stacy.

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,280
Mr. Forman, his coupon expired.

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
Oh, that's all right.

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Here's your 20 cents.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,480
Now, you come again, huh?

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,400
- Mushroom foot.
- Stacy!

63
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Forman.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,800
It's just that he's such a dumb-ass.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,480
I like you.

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,600
Hey, you know who I like?

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,880
Nixon?

68
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
Stacy, that cute, new cashier at work.

69
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,640
You should ask her out.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,760
Sorry, Dad. I don't like to
dip my pen in the company ink.

71
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,800
Well, I don't like you being home
three Fridays in a row.

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
Look, if you don't have
the guts to talk to her...

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
- I'll pave the way.
- Hey.

74
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Listen, if anyone's
gonna talk to her...

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
I'll talk to her.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Well, then we know
no one's gonna talk to her.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,920
Hey, I might.

78
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,480
You...

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,920
You still like girls, don't you, Son?

80
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,520
No, Dad, they're yucky.

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, my God.

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,200
I know. She is seriously hot.

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,080
No, not her. This KISS alarm clock.
Check it out.

84
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,880
Wake up.

85
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,880
Yeah, this I like.

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,120
Forman, you have a responsibility
to all of us...

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,760
to find out what's
underneath that smock.

88
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,040
I bet it's boobs.

89
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,400
So, spying on her, huh?

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, that's mature.

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,520
Why don't you just
pull her hair and run?

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,640
- Yes, let's do that.
- All right. All right, all right.

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,560
All right.

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
All right.
I'm gonna go do this.

95
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,080
- Yeah, all right. I can't do this.
- Oh, geez.

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,480
- I'll go talk to her.
- No!

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,200
What? Now you're gonna
start listening to me?

98
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,920
Go!
Grease the wheels, pal.

99
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,760
Thanks for doing this.

100
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,720
I know you guys'll
make me pretty and stuff.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,920
Rhonda, it's no problem.
We'll just help you pick some nice clothes...

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,440
clean clothes... and...

103
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,400
maybe do your hair...

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,880
clean hair.

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,720
Okay,
the beauty ambulance has arrived!

106
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,520
So, first things first.

107
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,560
Let's get rid of those shoulder pads.

108
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,400
What shoulder pads?

109
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,240
Okay.

110
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,880
So, Stacy,
my son Eric is about your age.

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,000
And he's a real nice guy...

112
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,360
skinny but nice.

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,280
And I was thinking...

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,200
the two of you should go out.

115
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,440
What do you say?

116
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,360
Well, I kinda like someone else.

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,720
Oh!

118
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,160
Oh.

119
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,800
Oh...

120
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,800
no.

121
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Hey.

122
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,720
- So, did she like me?
- Who?

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
- Stacy.
- Who's Stacy?

124
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,840
- She's not interested.
- She's not interested?

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,800
How can she not be interested?
Who is she?

126
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,320
See? I knew I shouldn't have let you talk
to her. Great. Now she thinks I'm a freak.

127
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Oh, she doesn't think you're a freak.
Does she?

128
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes. Yes, she does.

129
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,880
- You better stay away from her.
- Well, your father's right.

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,000
If anyone's a freak, she is.

131
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
Did Stacy actually
use the word "freak"?

132
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
Why don't you just let it go?

133
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,000
Maybe the reason girls
don't like you...

134
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,600
is because you
just don't let things go!

135
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,000
Stacy was saying just that thing today.

136
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,680
I'm gonna go take a bath.

137
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,640
Well, now, who is this Stacy
who doesn't like my son?

138
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,240
I have half a mind to call her mother.

139
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,520
I tried to set Eric up
with this pretty girl at wor...

140
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Well... not pretty.

141
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,720
Decent.
Less ugly than most.

142
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Good enough for a young boy, but...

143
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,480
no man would be interested.

144
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,760
Red, what are you talking about?

145
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,240
Why can't anyone in this family
just let things go?

146
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,600
Red, you're blushing.

147
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,120
Don't tell me she has a crush on <i>you.</i>

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,960
Kitty, I don't wanna talk about it.

149
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,080
Okay.

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,520
So, do you...

151
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,560
like her back?

152
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,040
Hi. Stacy.
Hi. I'm Eric Forman.

153
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Look, I, uh, feel a little silly...

154
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,920
about my dad asking you out for me.

155
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
You probably thought I was, like...

156
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,600
ugly or... slow or something.

157
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,480
So, I just wanted to say hi...
you know, give you a chance to...

158
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
you know, take a gander
at the goods, so to speak...

159
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,560
and, uh, see if maybe, uh, tomorrow night
you wanted to have dinner?

160
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,800
At your house?

161
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
Will your dad be there?
'Cause I'll go if he's there.

162
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,800
Okay.

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
What, do you, like...

164
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,560
Do you, like, like my dad?

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,760
Oh, my God!
You like my dad?

166
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,480
Do you know
if he's seeing anyone?

167
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,440
Yeah.

168
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,800
My mom.

169
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,400
And they bought
furniture together, so...

170
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
yeah, I think it's pretty serious.

171
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
Ladies sit up straight.

172
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,680
Candy! Ca...

173
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,520
- Jackie, she doesn't have to sit like that.
- Yes, she does.

174
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,520
- Stop doing that!
- <i>You</i> stop doing that!

175
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,240
Hey! If I don't get a freakin' M&M,
I'm gonna start swingin'!

176
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,400
You stay out of this.

177
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,160
Jackie, try to be more sensitive.

178
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,760
Donna, I am not gonna send her
on her date looking like Sasquatch.

179
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,880
Huh?

180
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,280
She said you're very pretty... "atch."

181
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,720
Hey, guys.
I got news.

182
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Turns out Stacy doesn't even like me.

183
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,440
- Yeah, we kind of expected that.
- Ooh.

184
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
I thought you said you had news.

185
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Well, yeah.
Here it comes.

186
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,120
- She likes Red.
- Ohh!

187
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,560
- Oh, my God!
- Ohh.

188
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
You're gonna have to leave town!

189
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,800
- Why?
- Oh, 'cause we're gonna tell everyone!

190
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Tell me this.
How'd the 50-year-old guy get the girl?

191
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,360
Look at me.
I'm an attractive man.

192
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,480
Well, I got you.

193
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,520
Technically, I got you.

194
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,200
And then you blew it.

195
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,680
Which means you didn't lose it,
because you never had it.

196
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,960
See, there's your silver lining.

197
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,480
Eric, you have a lot of good qualities.
I mean, you're funny. Like...

198
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,840
Well, what just
happened to you is funny.

199
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,160
Look, that chick likes Red
because he's a tough guy, a hard-ass.

200
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
You? You're soft.

201
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,440
How soft is he, Hyde?

202
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,120
Softer than Liberace
at the Playboy Mansion.

203
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,440
Yeah!

204
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,560
'Cause he plays piano.

205
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,480
Wait.

206
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
Ohh!

207
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,600
Burn!

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You guys kill me.

209
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,960
Look.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,200
How come Red is such a hard-ass,
and I am so...

211
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,120
I mean...

212
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,240
Okay, when a bear has a baby...

213
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,680
it's a little bear, right?

214
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
My dad's a bear, but I'm like...

215
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
a duck.

216
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,280
Eric, you were a bear
when you were born...

217
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,520
but Red pounded you into
the duck that we know and love.

218
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,360
So, what are you saying?
It's... It's Red's fault?

219
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,800
Yeah. But the good news is,
as a duck...

220
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,480
you can move more easily
through the water.

221
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,680
And now back to <i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

222
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,360
Is everything okay over there, Stacy?

223
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,200
Come here, Mr. Forman.
I wanna show you something.

224
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,120
Holy crap!

225
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,360
You're a zombie!

226
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,640
I... want... Red.

227
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,400
Red!
How could you?

228
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,120
She's a sexy zombie!

229
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
She overpowered me!

230
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,960
I knew I couldn't trust you,
you cheater!

231
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,200
Kitty!

232
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,160
What the hell was that?

233
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,600
Oh, Kitty.

234
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,560
Oh, I need to talk to you.

235
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,800
I just wanna say...

236
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,880
with regard to this Stacy thing...

237
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,680
Look.

238
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,920
I'm bound to attract
a certain amount of attention.

239
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,760
I can't help that.

240
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,760
- But I would never...
- Oh, Red.

241
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,880
You wouldn't stray.
You've got too much character.

242
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,600
And who could blame her
for being interested?

243
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,000
You're certainly interesting to me.

244
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,760
Really?

245
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,720
Do you, uh...

246
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,640
have some spare time?

247
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,160
Why?
Am I on the clock?

248
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm thinking 45 minutes.

249
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,400
Ohh.

250
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,040
The scenic route.

251
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,560
I give you...

252
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,240
the new Rhonda!

253
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,640
First time in heels.

254
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,600
So, where's Fez?

255
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,320
Oh, he's nervous,
so he's in the "whoo-hoo."

256
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,920
Have you been working
on her all night?

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,320
She wouldn't even let me pee.

258
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,240
I'd squash her like a bug
if I could catch her.

259
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,040
But I do look pretty.

260
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,320
Rhonda, is that you?

261
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Boy, you look like a different girl.

262
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,000
Do you like it?
Oh!

263
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,160
Well, I thought
we would begin our evening...

264
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,840
with a hot dog eating contest.

265
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,160
Now, I realize
you're county champion...

266
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,600
but I think I could
make it interesting.

267
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,960
Sorry, Fez.

268
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,080
I don't eat hot dogs
for glory <i>or</i> money anymore.

269
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,960
It's not ladylike.

270
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,880
- Says who?
- Says them.

271
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,440
Them?

272
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,960
What have you meddling whores
done to my Rhonda?

273
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
- It was Jackie.
- It was Donna.

274
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Fez, she wouldn't let her pee or eat.

275
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,320
- Donna called her Sasquatch.
- That was you too!

276
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,480
Shut up!

277
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,600
Shut up. I just want her back like
she was the first night I met her...

278
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,520
on her knees, chugging beer
straight from the keg.

279
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,680
But, Fez, I threw up twice that night.

280
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,800
Yes...

281
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,960
all over my heart.

282
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,280
You big, lovable, clumsy galoot.

283
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,280
And now, it is time that you two left.

284
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,240
Good day.

285
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,600
- But, Fez...
- He said, "Good day"!

286
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,880
So, I'm a duck, huh?

287
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,960
Yeah, we'll see who's a duck.

288
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,680
Oh.
Hey, there you are.

289
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,880
Yeah, we need to talk, man.

290
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,880
I've been thinking out
this whole Stacy thing...

291
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,320
It's your fault.
Yeah.

292
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,480
You were too tough on me,
so now I'm soft.

293
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,320
Oh, boo-hoo.

294
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,960
You don't know
the first thing about tough.

295
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,040
My old man was tough.

296
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,640
When I was your age,
he shipped me off to the navy.

297
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,680
He sure as hell wasn't
settin' me up with cute cashiers.

298
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,640
Which I'm sorry I did.
Because now I've got this...

299
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,360
creepy little girl giving me
google eyes all day...

300
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,440
stickin' heart-shaped
notes in my locker.

301
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,120
And on top of it all...

302
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
I had to have a talk with
your mother about infidelity.

303
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,200
That was unpleasant!

304
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,040
So you just be grateful
that your dad...

305
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,000
doesn't yell at you 24 hours a day!

306
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,000
And don't give me that look,
because this isn't yelling!

307
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,880
When I yell, you'll know it!

308
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,800
Well, thanks.
Good talk.

309
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,180
Man, look at all this stuff.

310
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,580
I just realized how happy I am
not to be a girl.

311
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,340
Well, that should have happened
at a much younger age.

312
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,780
- How long was I out?
- Long enough.

313
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,500
You guys wanna get a burger?

314
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,060
Out in public?
Okay, I'll drive.

315
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,980
I'll buy.

316
00:20:50,305 --> 00:21:50,426

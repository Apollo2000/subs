1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,790
Where's the tunes, Forman?

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:05,980
Hang on, you guys.
Just one more wire here.

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:09,260
I learned how to speak English
faster than this.

4
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:12,840
Fez, it's not real English
when you speak it with a foreign accent.

5
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:14,919
Geez.

6
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,622
Aren't these the coolest?

7
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:27,022
I can't hear you.

8
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:29,706
I know. They're the
greatest speakers ever.

10
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,549
Eric!

11
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:47,118
Oh. Hey, Dad. Sorry.

12
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:51,047
Didn't see you there.

13
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,829
Well, I guess that's 'cause you were
too busy making an ass of yourself.

14
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:57,994
Uh, actually I was trying out
my new speakers. What do you think?

15
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:03,181
New speakers? What was wrong with the
old ones? Those were genuine G.M. parts.

16
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:06,445
Uh...

17
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,446
These are louder.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,651
Well, just keep your
monkey music turned down.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,575
Go grab your smock.
We gotta go to work.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,128
<i>Hey, Red. Is that you?</i>

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,054
Oh, cripes.

22
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,414
Hiya, neighbor.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,625
Can't hear ya, Bob.
I'm testin' out Eric's new speakers.

24
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,463
Not bad.

25
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:17,983
Boy, quite a day
at Price Mart, Kitty.

26
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,544
First, the price of lightbulbs
dropped two cents...

27
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,590
then Eric was made
employee of the month...

28
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:26,438
and to top it off, they added Cheez-Its
to the vending machine.

29
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:29,350
Are you serious?

30
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,350
Yep. Tiny little squares...

31
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:35,423
with the cheese flavor
baked right in 'em.

32
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:37,829
Am I really the Mart
employee of the month?

33
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,863
- You sure are.
- Yea!

34
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:44,481
And they even decided
to throw in a extra 25 cents an hour.

35
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,301
Oh, yes.

36
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:52,036
I gotta admit, Eric.
I had my doubts, but, uh...

37
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,071
Hell, you've hardly
embarrassed me.

38
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,916
Thanks, Dad.

39
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:02,148
Oh, this is great.
Whoo. Price Mart rocks.

40
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:06,400
Oh, Laurie,
tell everyone <i>your</i> good news.

41
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:10,083
I just finished my first
two weeks of cosmetology school.

42
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:12,159
And she didn't flunk out.

43
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,366
Isn't that great?

44
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,017
That <i>is</i> great, honey. Nice job.

45
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,942
Thanks, Daddy.

46
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,396
Yeah, but the next exam's
gonna kill me.

47
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:24,610
We're not allowed to practice
on dummies anymore.

48
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,883
And I have to style
a real person's hair.

49
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:29,733
Oh, honey, you'll do fine.
We're all here to support you.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,116
Great. So, you don't mind
being my model?

51
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:37,311
Me?

52
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,515
Oh, honey, no, no.
I... I go to the beauty parlor.

53
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,958
<i>Okay, well...
Well, maybe Eric can help out.</i>

54
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:49,025
Oh, sure. Laurie, first of all,
always run with scissors.

55
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:54,758
Boy, I never get tired
of your sarcasm.

56
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:57,758
Really?

57
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:00,548
Sorry.

58
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,583
Red, would you like
to be a hair model?

59
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,051
Kitty, I would like
to have hair, period.

60
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:18,018
But I don't, so... no.

61
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:25,316
Oh, forget it. I don't even know why
I picked this stupid career.

62
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:28,351
Maybe it's...
because you're stupid?

63
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:36,127
Laurie, no. You quit everything.

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,436
You are not quitting
cosmetology school.

65
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,358
Well, what am I supposed to do?

66
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:45,023
I will be your model.

67
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,877
But you just remember:

68
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:53,310
Men have their cars.
Women have their hair.

69
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:57,405
It's like a car. It's valuable.

70
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:08,540
So, not only are they gonna hang
my picture in the front of the store...

71
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:11,964
but I also get to represent our entire
district in the national Price Mart Olympics.

72
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,902
That's nice.

73
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,791
Do you think I would choke to death
if I swallowed my straw?

74
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,718
No, it's got a breathing hole.

75
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,406
- Fez, no!
- Fez, no!

76
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,070
Oh, my God. There she is.

77
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:35,004
<i>- Who's that?
- The new girl, Caroline.</i>

78
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,316
She transferred here
from Sacred Heart.

79
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,238
Or heaven. I'm not sure which.

80
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:43,198
We have gym together.
She barely sweats.

81
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,731
Someday, I will make her my bride.

82
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,068
Yep, no one likes a sweaty bride.

83
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,623
- Yeah, I hear you.
- So true.

84
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,695
Hey. Why don't you go talk to her, man?

85
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:10,948
You're the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

86
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:14,877
Thank you.
Your cocoa-brown skin makes me hot.

87
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,982
I know.

88
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:20,511
I am irresistible.
Would you like to dance?

89
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,308
Hey. Why don't you go
talk to her, man?

90
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,734
Oh, I don't know, Hyde. I can't.

91
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:46,662
I don't understand this.

92
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:49,989
Usually I am...
I am suave. I am silky.

93
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,014
But this girl makes me...

94
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:58,111
I have to go to the bathroom.

95
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,150
Anyway, getting back
to Price Mart...

96
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,517
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

97
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,583
Oh, my God. You guys are
never gonna believe this.

98
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,728
- Wait, no. Me first.
- Okay, go.

99
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,517
Okay. I, Eric Forman...

100
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,492
your boyfriend...

101
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,414
am Price Mart's newest
employee of the month.

102
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,327
Eric, that's great. Are you done?

103
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:24,548
Well, yeah. Top that, cupcake.

104
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:29,765
Okay. I just won two tickets
to the Led Zeppelin concert.

105
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:36,772
I was caller number seven, and I won, and
we're goin' to Zeppelin on Tuesday night.

106
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,424
All right!

107
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,796
She said two tickets, not four,
ya moron. We're not goin'.

108
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,252
Oh, my God, no.
Did you say Tuesday night?

109
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:52,899
I... I can't go Tuesday night.
It's inventory night. It's mandatory.

110
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,836
Skip it, Eric. You love Zeppelin.

111
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:59,424
Call in sick. Tell them your grandma died.
Burn down the store.

112
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:03,107
You're right. You know what? I'm going.

113
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:05,247
I can't go.

114
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,588
- Then who am I gonna take?
- No, Donna...

115
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,509
- You shut your filthy mouth!
- Donna, seriously...

116
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:11,909
- I'm practically his brother.
- I've been his friend way longer!

117
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:15,969
Hey, you know what? I am going.

118
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,374
Ah, crap.

119
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,872
- Still friends?
- Till death.

120
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:26,179
I can't go.

121
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,613
- I'm in! Shut up!
- Get killed!

122
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:31,329
Uh... Eric, are you sure
you can't come?

123
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,695
Yeah, I can't. You know.
Everyone has to work. No exceptions.

124
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,694
Plus, Red and I?
We're both kinda supervising.

125
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,800
- Mmm.
- Corporate America claims another victim.

126
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,038
Eric, it's okay.

127
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,972
I knew you weren't gonna go.
You're a really responsible guy.

128
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:49,535
I love and hate that about you.

129
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,258
Well, since, uh... Since Mr. Smock
here is being all logical...

130
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,115
I guess I'll have to take
one of you losers.

131
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,517
- Take a loser where?
- Zeppelin.

132
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,325
Zeppelin? Oh, my God.
That's a band, right?

133
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,396
Donna.

134
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:15,140
In the ninth grade, I did an oral report on
"Stairway to Heaven," and I got a B-plus.

135
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:17,345
You gotta take me.

136
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:20,317
Donna, in the ninth grade,
I wasn't a dork...

137
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,431
and I didn't write a report
on "Stairway to Heaven."

138
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:25,564
And you gotta take me.

139
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,949
God! She doesn't wanna take either one of
you, 'cause she's taking me. Donna, M-E, me!

140
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:32,063
Okay, you know what? I'm going.

141
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:35,423
I can't.

142
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:47,580
- You hate it, don't you?
- No, no. It's interesting.

143
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:52,226
I mean, just...
Just look at all this body.

144
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:01,667
I must... I bet I'm... I'm like...
I'm four inches taller.

145
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,108
I never should've gotten into this.

146
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:08,191
I'm not good at anything.

147
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:10,597
No, no, no.

148
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:15,398
- I like it, Laurie.
- Really?

149
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,097
Thanks, Mom.
Now all you need is a cut.

150
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:24,674
No, no. No, no. No. Length...
Length is good. Length is good.

151
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,494
Drop 'em.

152
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,718
Oh, hey, did you see this?

153
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:33,725
They gave me
a Price Mart key chain.

154
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,003
It's got a knife and everything.

155
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:39,519
Yeah, I keep it in my pocket.
Some of the other guys get jealous.

156
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,039
Look, Eric, I know you're very excited
about your raise and everything...

157
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,492
but I don't want you
to get too caught up in this.

158
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,421
Don't worry, Dad.

159
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:53,538
I'm not about to alienate my fellow
employees with my award-winning work ethic.

160
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,989
I read the signs in the break room.
There's no "I" in teamwork.

161
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,120
Here's your check, sir,
and thank you for eating at Smiley's.

162
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,805
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

163
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,148
You know what, Dad? I got this.

164
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:09,029
Take your hand off the check.

165
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:15,909
I'll come back.

166
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:20,354
Jackie, why do you wanna go anyway?
You hate Led Zeppelin.

167
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,430
I never said I hated them, Michael.

168
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:26,911
<i>For your information,
I think Led is hot.</i>

169
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:35,232
- Fez, is that her?
- Yes.

170
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,954
I wish I could go talk to her,
but I get so nervous.

171
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:41,252
Fez, you shouldn't
be nervous. You're awesome.

172
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,872
What girl wouldn't
wanna be with you?

173
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:48,383
Well, there is Jackie, Laurie...

174
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:51,302
this girl from gym,
another girl from chemistry...

175
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,782
uh, country-western star
Tanya Tucker...

176
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,710
who does not answer her letters.

177
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,958
- Um...
- Okay, stop.

178
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:04,959
Whatever happened
to suave, silky Fez?

179
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,090
You're right. I forgot about him.

180
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:12,958
He's hot.

181
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,965
Exactly. So... Go get her, Fez.

182
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,843
Caroline? It is Fez. May I sit?

183
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:36,638
Okay, thank you.

184
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,086
Great idea, Donna.

185
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:53,147
Well, excuse me for trying
to buy a coworker lunch.

186
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,318
I am not your coworker.

187
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:00,091
You're a high school kid
with a part-time job. You're temporary.

188
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:02,743
Uh-oh.

189
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:06,042
You know what ends fights?
Pudding.

190
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:08,860
Just give me seven minutes.

191
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,240
Eric, you gotta stop acting
like a big shot.

192
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,317
You're not the king
of the world, you know.

193
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:19,797
I'm employee of the month.
I don't have to take this.

194
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:24,661
This is no good, Kitty.

195
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:28,475
- What are you gonna do, Red? He's growing up.
- No, I mean your hair.

196
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,571
Hey there, Harpo.

197
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:08,089
Where's your horn?

198
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:13,755
Bob, are you making fun
of <i>my</i> hair?

199
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:20,732
No.

200
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:25,661
- Take me.
- No.

201
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:28,245
- Take me.
- No.

202
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:40,220
- Hi.
- Hi.

203
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,706
- You're Donna, right?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

204
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,611
- I'm Caroline. I think we have Spanish together.
- Oh, yeah. Hi.

205
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,554
<i>¡Hola!</i>

206
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:54,004
Um, you know that foreign guy
you're always hanging out with?

207
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:57,143
- Fez?
- Mmm, yeah. Fez.

208
00:14:57,213 --> 00:15:00,344
Um, is... Is he... Does he...

209
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,617
Oh, my God. You like Fez?

210
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:05,206
- Oh, my God. Come on. I'll introduce you to him.
- Oh, no, no, no.

211
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:07,578
That's okay. I just... wanted to...

212
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:11,061
I gotta go... use the <i>baסo.</i>

213
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,355
<i>Stupid, stupid, stupid!</i>

214
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:31,128
What's goin' on?

215
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,295
Cosmetology is too hard.

216
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,372
I'm quitting.

217
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:43,133
Laurie, don't you think I wanted
to quit nursing school a hundred times?

218
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:47,507
The first time I put in
a catheter, it broke off.

219
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:52,732
But what if I don't get any better?

220
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:55,644
Well, you will never know
unless you stick with it.

221
00:15:57,181 --> 00:16:01,556
- Oh, what do you care?
- I care because I'm your mother.

222
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,412
So, I care.

223
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:09,206
Well, we do start
doing nails next week.

224
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:11,187
That might be fun.

225
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:15,004
And I happen to know a few patients
down at the hospital...

226
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:17,370
who would love a manicure.

227
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:19,509
- Thanks, Mom.
- Uh-huh.

228
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:24,949
Yep. It's... It's... It's just gonna perk 'em
right up when they come out of their comas.

229
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:42,485
Hey, Dad. Good news.

230
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,412
Just got another raise.

231
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:48,667
Well, good for you,
you dumb bastard.

232
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:52,345
Yeah, I tell ya. If they keep
throwin' money at me like this...

233
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,802
I might be able to get my own
apartment soon.

234
00:16:55,997 --> 00:17:00,055
For God's sakes,
you're 57 years old.

235
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:05,427
- Ah.
- Eric, why didn't you listen to me?

236
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:09,014
If you'd gone to college,
you could've really been something.

237
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:11,573
Been something? Whoa.

238
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:16,565
You're talkin' to the interim assistant
weekend manager of housewares here, okay?

239
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,579
Yeah. Show some respect.

240
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:22,231
Well aren't you just
the president of Turd Town?

241
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:32,754
Dad.

242
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:36,244
I've been thinkin' about
why you went so crazy and yelled at me...

243
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,967
and I've come
to the conclusion that...

244
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,884
you're crazy
and you like to yell at me.

245
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:43,804
There's somethin' you gotta know.

246
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:48,124
You're... Well... You're an idiot.

247
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:51,538
Oh, great. A pep talk.

248
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,100
Look, sit down.

249
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,628
When I was your age,
I thought I had it all too.

250
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,418
Great job at the plant,
nice steady paycheck...

251
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:02,485
Just enough to, you know,
string me along for 30 years or so.

252
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:06,583
And for what? So they could toss me out
on my ass when things got tough.

253
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,996
- Dad, I'm not gonna...
- Look, don't get me wrong. I admire your work ethic.

254
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:14,745
But you deserve better
than Price Mart.

255
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:17,147
You're a smart guy.

256
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,060
And I'm, uh... I'm proud of you.

257
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,907
Whoa. Really?

258
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:28,309
- You... You think I'm smart? You're proud of me?
- Oh, geez.

259
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,650
What, you gonna
ruin this now by talking?

260
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:35,125
Listen, Dad.

261
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,612
If I'm still workin' at Price Mart
when I'm your... older...

262
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,032
please kill me.

263
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,522
- You don't have to ask twice, Son.
- Oh, that's...

264
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:49,209
- That's my dad.
- Come on. Let's go make fun of your mom's hair.

265
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:53,014
- Jerk.
- Wench.

266
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:54,085
- Tool.
- Dill-hole.

267
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:55,484
- Moron.
- Moron.

268
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:57,556
I already said moron.

269
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,540
Moron.

270
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,582
Don't touch. Those are for Donna.

271
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:11,573
- Kelso, Donna doesn't want a bunch of dirty cookies.
- They're not dirty.

272
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:20,184
They are now.

273
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,959
Hyde, you're dead.

274
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,878
Oh, my God.

275
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:33,745
Donna, where have you been? The concert
starts in an hour. I'm ready to go. Let's go.

276
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:37,302
The concert?
Oh, right. The concert.

277
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:40,668
Well, you guys were so busy fighting
over the tickets, I forgot to tell you.

278
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,620
I gave them away.

279
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:44,507
- What? No!
- To who?

280
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,638
See? Your cuticles
look better already.

281
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:48,807
Proper nail care is one of
the easiest things to overlook.

282
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:54,089
Uh-huh. Real good.

283
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:57,353
Oh, gosh, Daddy.
I didn't know you were a bleeder.

284
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,450
I'm not.

285
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:04,586
Um, could you apply
some pressure to this...

286
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,507
while I go get
some paper towels?

287
00:21:07,305 --> 00:22:07,797

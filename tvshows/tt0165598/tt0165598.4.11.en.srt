1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,220
Hey, hey.
Do you guys hear that?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,020
That was me.
I had hot dogs for lunch.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,380
Not that. I'm talking about
the sweet sound of no women.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,140
I never hear that.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,380
Jackie's voice is burned into my brain.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,700
I wish it would stop, but it won't.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,780
Remember back in the day when it was
just us guys? That was good times.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,260
More like desperate,
"I don't care if she has a mustache...

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,100
I'll take her anyway" times.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,500
You know what?
I say, who needs women?

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,860
Come on! Let's get crazy.
What was that?

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,700
Did someone say mini golf?

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,020
I'm still not allowed back in there.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,780
I mean, what's the point
of having a windmill you can't ride?

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,420
We could go beer bowling.
That's always fun.

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,060
I am in, because beer makes you a
better bowler. That's a proven fact.

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,740
Wait. Do I have to use
the pink ladies' ball again?

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,180
Now, Fez, why do you ask that question
when you already know the answer?

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,780
Pink ball only
until I lose my virginity.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,820
Sorry.
Them's the rules.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,140
All right, fellas. You know the rules.
You get a strike, you chug.

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,020
You get a gutter ball, you chug.

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,780
You get a 7-10 split...

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,980
seven to 10 chugs.

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,460
Hey, guys, look.
I got 10-pound balls.

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,180
Man, that joke never gets old.

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,060
Hey, guys, my balls have holes in them.

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,660
Now, why isn't that funny?

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,260
This is livin'.

30
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,180
A little bowling, a lot of beer,
and just us guys.

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,420
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,060
Man, bowling-alley chicks are easy.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,080
Jill.
Glad you could make it.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,520
Guys, this is Jill,
the girl I told you about.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,520
Oh, you're the one
that hasn't put out yet.

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Ay! Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,600
You too. So, who's up first?

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,680
Me.

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,200
Can I be next?

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,840
Hey, buddy? Hyde? Buddy?

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
Can I talk to you for a second, buddy?

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
Hyde, what's goin' on? I thought
this was supposed to be guys' night.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,960
Don't worry about it, man.
She's-She's cool. She's like one of us.

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,280
In three beers,
she'll be belchin' like a Kennedy.

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,800
This is "guys' night only," man.

47
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,080
Yeah, I say out with the whore.

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,680
Hey, I'll buy the next round of beer.

49
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
The whore stays.

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,320
Okay, good night, you two.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,360
Boy, that Joanne...
She's somethin', huh?

52
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,160
- Yeah, she's nice. I like her.
- Good. Good.

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,480
Me too. Not that I'm ready
to jump into anything.

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,040
I hate jumping.
Makes me jiggle.

55
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,960
But I won't like her
if it bothers you...

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,400
'cause I know you've had a tough time
since your mom left.

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,960
No, Dad, I think it's nice
that you have a friend.

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,320
I also think it's nice that you're
bathing and shaving again.

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,360
Yeah. That was a long
eight weeks, wasn't it?

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
So long.

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,560
Boy, Kitty,
you missed a great game.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,680
The Bucks made a last-second shot
and sent those Lakers home...

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,720
with their tails between
their California fruitcake asses!

65
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Go home, fruitcakes!

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,720
I've never seen old
Pastor Dave so excited.

67
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,320
He swore at the referee.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,480
"Son of a stitch."
I said, "Son of a stitch."

69
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,040
Oh, well, I'm sure that fooled God.

70
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,000
Hey, Dave, the Celtics are in town tomorrow.
You up for it?

71
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,040
- I'm in!
- Oh. Pastor Dave, tomorrow's Sunday.

72
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,360
You have church on Sunday.

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,440
Right, church.
Church, right.

74
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,840
Well, just get someone to sub for you.
Every Sunday...

75
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,240
I see six other guys
up there in robes...

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,600
who only shake themselves awake
when the wine comes out.

77
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,560
Any one of them could do your job.

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Well, if God didn't want me
to go to basketball...

79
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,160
he wouldn't have made
foam fingers so much fun.

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,480
Check it out.
The hand of God is pointing at you.

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,120
Okay, see you at church.

82
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,680
Yes!
Another strike for Forman.

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,440
Man, is there anything better
than bowling with the boys?

84
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,400
Yeah.

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,200
- Making out with a chick.
- Exactly.

86
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,000
But first... Hey, Kelso,
there are words on my balls.

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Let's go.

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
Fine. Go.

89
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,640
But they're gonna miss the finest game of
10-pin since "Marvelous" Marv Winkleman...

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,920
Wisconsin's "Velvet Thumb."

91
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
Yes!
It's another strike!

92
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,000
You guys, I'm in some kind
of... beery zone.

93
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
All right. That's it.

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Hey, Jill?
Hey, thanks for stopping by.

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,720
Hyde, wipe your mouth.
Let's go.

96
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,280
I was gonna go home with Jill.

97
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,280
Well, we came together, Hyde...

98
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,480
so I kind of think
we should leave together.

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,720
Fine.
Steven, call me later.

100
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,640
Forman, what the hell
are you doing, man?

101
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,040
Me?
You spent all night...

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,640
making out with
little Miss Can't-find-a-bra.

103
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,800
- Hey!
- Come on. You made me the third wheel.

104
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,560
Who cares, man? Her parents are out of town,
and they got a water bed!

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,720
But you killed that dream.
I'm out of here.

106
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,760
But... You don't get to storm out, okay?
<i>I</i> storm out!

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,160
Hiya, princess.

108
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,640
Rhonda?
What are you doing here?

109
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,000
Waitin' for Fez,
chompin' some cheese curls.

110
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,560
You know what?
Michael doesn't tell me where he goes either.

111
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,800
- I hate that.
- Kelso and Fez are on their way back from bowling.

112
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,560
They want to make out.

113
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,320
How'd you know all this?

114
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,440
Let's French, ladies!

115
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,800
Michael, <i>she's</i> in the loop!
Why am I not in the loop?

116
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,400
All right. Look, Jackie. I don't
know what loop you're talking about...

117
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,120
but...

118
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,160
if she's already in it...

119
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,160
I don't think there's
gonna be room for you too.

120
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,560
Donna.
Well, you're up early.

121
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,000
Surprisingly early.

122
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,880
You slept here?
Already?

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,920
You just met!

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,480
Listen, Donna,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

125
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,080
Your father and I have started an...
intimate relationship.

126
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,680
And, you know,
it's still a little awkward for us.

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,200
Emotionally, not physically.
Well, a little...

128
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,080
I think I might be sick.

129
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Look, I know this is a lot
for you to take in right now.

130
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,440
But I think it would be better
for all of us...

131
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,920
to just stop the charade
and get it all out in the open.

132
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,800
Joanne!
When did you get here?

133
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,960
Oh, my God.

134
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,560
Oh, look at the time.

135
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,520
And on a personal note,
I have an announcement to make.

136
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,200
I have always found happiness in serving
the good people of Point Place.

137
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,240
<i>But after talking to a dear friend...</i>

138
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,200
I realized that church is just not where
the party is, if you know what I mean.

139
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,320
<i>So I'm resigning as your pastor...</i>

140
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,960
thanks to my friend Red Forman.

141
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,880
Red, give the crowd a wave.

142
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, if you weren't going to hell before,
you're going first class now.

143
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,400
Go, Bucks!

144
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,960
Kelso, you should tell Jackie
where you go.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That way, when she wants to do it,
she can find you and do it.

146
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,960
Boy, do I want to do it.

147
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,400
Fez, the foundation of every
good relationship is three words:

148
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,920
"I don't know."

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
"Where are you going?"
"I don't know."

150
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,120
"What are you thinking about?"
"I don't know."

151
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,480
"Who's that under you?"
"I don't know."

152
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,600
You see, it's bulletproof.

153
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,720
Why are you friends with him?

154
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,680
I don't know.

155
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,680
Hyde, what the hell?

156
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,840
What is she doing in my seat?

157
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,760
I don't know.

158
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,360
That's a good one, Kelso.

159
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,800
Just sit on the floor.

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,760
The floor?
Why don't I sit on the floor?

161
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,320
Visitors get the floor, all right?
And that's you, Terri Tube Top.

162
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,640
Oh, and by the way, it's winter!

163
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,280
You're a drag.

164
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,240
Okay, well, sayonara, Yoko.

165
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,400
What?
We're kind of the Beatles.

166
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,410
So it's just supposed to be
guys' night out, right?

167
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,490
And in walks Hyde's skank of the week
to wreck it all.

168
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,090
Years of friendship trumped
by one pair of lopsided boobs.

169
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,650
Yeah, that's right.
I noticed, but I didn't say anything...

170
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,850
because I'm nice.

171
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:13,050
I had to talk to my dad's new girlfriend
about the sex they had last night.

172
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,650
Yeah, okay, you win.

173
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,170
You know, at first, I thought it was great
my dad had a friend.

174
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,090
But when I found out
they were doin' it...

175
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,810
it took things to, like,
a sick place, you know?

176
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,690
And it really made me realize
that my mom is gone.

177
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,210
- Like, gone.
- Maybe you should say something.

178
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,530
No. He's been through so much.

179
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,410
- I mean, I want him to be happy, you know?
- Yeah.

180
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,330
So Bob's sleeping with Joanne, huh?

181
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,890
God, am I, like, the only guy
in Point Place who's not gettin' any?

182
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,890
Yes. Yes, you are.

183
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,810
- And you think that's funny?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

184
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,050
Well, Mrs. Candiotti
just told me to shove...

185
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,290
a very holy book
in a very unholy place.

186
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,250
Nice going, Red.
The whole church hates us now.

187
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,970
Kitty, I had nothing to do
with Dave leaving the church.

188
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,290
You know, God works in mysterious ways.

189
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,930
- "Let he who is without"...
- Oh, can it.

190
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,890
<i>Well, the torch-carrying mob will be here</i>
<i>any minute. Better turn on the light.</i>

191
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,730
They won't need a light.

192
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,090
They've got torches.

193
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,170
Rhonda?
How'd you get in here?

194
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,410
I used my key.

195
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,010
Michael, why does she
have a key and I don't?

196
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:10,250
Well, it's not because everyone
doesn't want you to have one.

197
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,490
That's for sure.

198
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:24,130
- Don't sweat it, small stuff. We're all part of the gang.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

199
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,490
Uh, no.

200
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,170
I had to kiss butt for, like, a year
to be part of this gang.

201
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,290
That was you being nice?

202
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,850
Good God!
She thinks she was being nice?

203
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,170
Look, all I know is <i>you</i>
are not a part of this gang.

204
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,050
Really?

205
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,170
Well...

206
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,090
Snow White...

207
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,730
why don't we wrestle for it?

208
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,770
And if I win, I'm in.

209
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,690
Street rules.
No tap-outs.

210
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,490
- Okay, okay, you're in!
- Yea! I'm in!

211
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,890
That's nice, but...

212
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,650
maybe you should wrestle her anyways.

213
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,130
Oh, yeah!

214
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,010
All right. Shirts off!
Let's get it on!

215
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,890
Oh, good.
You're both here.

216
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,250
Look, I know you two are together...

217
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,690
and, Dad, I want you to be happy.

218
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,730
But I just don't think
I'm ready for this.

219
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,650
Joanne!
When did you get here?

220
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,730
- Dad!
- Bob!

221
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,770
All right. Donna,
what do you want us to do?

222
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,170
- You want us to stop seeing each other?
- No. No.

223
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,410
It's just that...

224
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,610
Well, could you go back to lying to me?

225
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,290
I mean, that seemed to work.

226
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,570
I am always in favor of lying
when it comes to children.

227
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,650
Bob, we were honest with Donna...

228
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,730
and now she's being honest with us.

229
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,890
We'll hold off on
the overnight visits for a while.

230
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,090
Thank you. Thanks.
That's really... Thanks.

231
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,730
Well, if you're not staying the night,
we'd better get upstairs.

232
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,370
Oh, hey, Hyde.
Is that you?

233
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,090
I didn't recognize you without
Skankarilla hanging off your face.

234
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,450
Are you still on this?
It's like having a wife.

235
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,290
Listen, don't flatter yourself. I'd only
marry someone who's nice to his friends.

236
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,290
Her friends. Shut up.
The... The point is...

237
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,530
Yeah, man, I get the point. And you
can drop it, all right? She dumped me.

238
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,130
- What?
- Yeah. She said she didn't like you.

239
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,210
I told her, "Too bad. We're friends."
And that was it.

240
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,330
Oh, man, I feel terrible.
Is there anything I can do?

241
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,170
I don't know, man.
I kind of really liked her.

242
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,130
Hey, how does 10 bucks sound?

243
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,610
Forman, 10 lousy bucks
can't replace Jill.

244
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,770
Yeah.

245
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,730
How about 20?

246
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,730
Jill who?

247
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,170
Okay.

248
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,770
- Hey, Red.
- Dave, what's with you?

249
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,930
You don't just
up and leave the church...

250
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,130
because I invited you to
a basketball game on Sunday.

251
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,290
Red, you said it yourself.

252
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,890
There are six guys who would take my place.
No one would notice.

253
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,610
Sit down, Dave.

254
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,810
Let me tell you a little story...

255
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,010
about three bags of dog crap.

256
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,250
One on my front porch,
one in my mailbox...

257
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,770
and one in the backseat of my car...

258
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,210
all from people who are
so upset about losing you...

259
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,130
that they are willing to find,
handle and bag dog crap.

260
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,930
Really?
My congregation...

261
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,170
has turned to vandalism
and petty harassment on account of me?

262
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,650
I am truly blessed.

263
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,610
- Then you're staying?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,570
Good.
Now, come on.

265
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,410
Let's celebrate by returning those bags
to their rightful owner.

266
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,050
Like it says in the Bible,
"As you sow, so shall you reap."

267
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,250
Jesus was talking about love,
but it works for doggy doo, I think.

268
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,970
- Jill, what are you doing here?
- All right. I confess.

269
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,530
'Twas me.
I asked Jill to meet us here.

270
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,290
Jill, Hyde's my friend.
That's no reason to break up with him.

271
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,770
What?
He broke up with me.

272
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,690
He said he had
to spend time with you...

273
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,490
because of some brain inflammation
that made you act like a dill-hole.

274
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,890
But I don't have a brain thing.

275
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,810
He forgets he has it.
It's part of the disease.

276
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,010
Why did you lie to me?

277
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,090
Yeah, and me.

278
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,490
Well, the thing is...

279
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,690
you like the Little River Band.

280
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,770
I mean, I... I can't be with a girl
who likes the Little River Band.

281
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,170
Yeah, take that, missy!

282
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,250
And you! You wouldn't shut up
about me making out on guys' night...

283
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,650
which wouldn't have bothered you
if you had a tongue stuck down your throat.

284
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,610
So for the love of God,
man, find a tongue!

285
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,290
I do need a tongue.

286
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,810
Hey, Jill, I like
the Little River Band.

287
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,170
You're both freaks!

288
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,130
Nice try.

289
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,850
- What are you guys doing here?
- Jackie and Rhonda are all mad at us.

290
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,250
We encourage one little
topless girl fight.

291
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,410
And then all the sudden,
we're the jerks.

292
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,730
- So let's bowl.
- Hey, guys, look. I got 10-pound balls.

293
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,130
Hey, guys, my balls are black and blue.

294
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,690
- Good one.
- That's nice.

295
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,610
- That's funny.
- That was good.

296
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,130
My balls are finally funny.

297
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,170
No, no, no, no.
No tap-outs, you girl.

298
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,330
Yes! We have a winner!

299
00:21:10,305 --> 00:22:10,531

2
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,680
Are you breaking up with me?

3
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:19,518
Well, are you giving back that ring?

4
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:25,023
- Yes.
- <i>Then...</i>

5
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,444
yes.

6
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,213
That first kiss.

7
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:52,840
Okay, well, I'm gonna call it a day.

8
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:55,050
Good night.

9
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:57,052
Night.

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,602
By the way, thanks for the ride.

11
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:12,900
God, I wish we'd never kissed.

12
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:15,236
<i>Geez, what a drama queen.</i>

13
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:20,282
- Who are you?
- Let's go.

14
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:23,994
- Go where?
- Well, you said you wished that you'd never kissed her.

15
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:27,747
- I can show you what would've happened if you never did.
- What are you, like, a genie?

16
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:31,042
Genies aren't real.

17
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,169
I'm an angel.

18
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:35,171
You're not an angel.

19
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,631
You don't even float.
Everyone knows angels float.

20
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:39,758
Fine.

21
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:45,555
Eric Forman...

22
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,808
God's favorite cherub...

23
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,768
come with me...

24
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:54,105
and I will release you
of your suffering.

25
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:56,148
Don't be afraid...

26
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:58,150
little one.

27
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:01,570
No offense, but...
are you coming on to me?

28
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:05,865
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, why not?

29
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,086
Okay, well, I'm gonna call it a day.

30
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:21,463
Good night.

31
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:23,423
Night.

32
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,385
And there you go.

33
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,263
You and Donna never kissed.

34
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:33,641
Well, thanks.
This was nice.

35
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:36,727
- Good night.
- No, no.

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,188
We're gonna follow her home
and see what happened next.

37
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,481
Are you an angel or a stalker?

38
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:43,817
Hey, let me do my job.

39
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:47,362
I'm gonna prove to you that it is
better to have loved and lost...

40
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,114
than never to have
loved at all, ya pansy.

41
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:29,060
Hyde was waiting for her that night?

42
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:31,020
- I didn't know that.
- Shh.

43
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:33,064
This is my favorite part.

44
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,234
- Hi.
- Hey.

45
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,363
- Thanks.
- So you with Forman now?

46
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,782
I guess not.

47
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,160
- I mean, he didn't make a move or anything, so...
- Huh.

48
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,120
Yeah.

49
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:57,002
- Hyde, what are you doing? Get the hell off her!
- Eric, they can't hear you.

50
00:03:57,086 --> 00:04:00,797
Don't you watch movies?
I mean, this is pretty basic stuff here.

51
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:08,596
Well, Eric, it's three months later.

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,601
<i>Donna's with Hyde, Kelso's with Jackie,</i>
<i>and you became... Just watch.</i>

53
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:16,812
Does anyone want to watch <i>Flipper?</i>

54
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:19,940
Anyone?

55
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:24,819
Eric, I thought I told you
to tar the driveway.

56
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:27,447
Yeah, but I'm hanging out
with my friends.

57
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:31,075
Oh, oh!
I'm so sorry!

58
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,536
Now get your ass up there
and get to work!

59
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,456
<i>You people, out of the basement!</i>

60
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:41,585
Oh, geez. I'm sorry, Dad.
Don't be mad.

61
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:46,840
This is made-up angel crap.

62
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,925
I wouldn't cave to Red like that.

63
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:52,303
Ah, you've already forgotten
what a wuss you were.

64
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,639
See, it was Donna who gave you
the confidence to stand up to Red.

65
00:04:55,723 --> 00:05:00,602
Oh, I'm gonna show you
a lot of neat stuff like this.

66
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,230
Well, I guess I have no choice.

67
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,861
Like everyone doesn't try that.

68
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:15,449
This can't be that bad.
I'm wearing a letter sweater.

69
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:18,494
Chess Club, loser.

70
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,330
Ah, checkmate!

71
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:30,171
Hey, I made the marching band.

72
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:34,633
Ooh, at last I will be accepted
by the cool kids and not get beat up.

73
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,720
Ay, no.
Not again, guys.

74
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:46,227
Hey, I got you a birthday present.

75
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:48,605
- What is it?
- A tattoo.

76
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:50,857
"Question Authority."

77
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,734
- Cool. I love you, man.
- Prove it.

78
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,907
My Donna would never get a tattoo.

79
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,200
No, but Hyde's Donna would.

80
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:05,120
Hi, guys.

81
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:08,164
Oh, hey, Eric.
We didn't see you there.

82
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:11,542
Yeah, most people don't.
Yeah.

83
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:15,212
Huh. So, do you
still live next door?

84
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:17,214
Oh, yeah!
You bet. Yeah.

85
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:21,551
So...
Hey, Hyde, how are you?

86
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:24,804
Great. My mom split, so...
droppin' out of school.

87
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,806
Oh, man.

88
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:30,726
Look, Hyde, you can stay at my house.
Then you won't have to drop out.

89
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,775
Okay, Mom.

90
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,776
Now get one of me
giving her the corsage.

91
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,487
Let's roll, Twiggy.
My bra's about to snap.

92
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,781
I went to prom with Big Rhonda?

93
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,783
Sweet, huh?

94
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,118
Real quick, real quick.
Now, Rhoda...

95
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,829
It's Rhonda!
Rhon-da! God!

96
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:56,208
Rhon-da. I'm so sorry, dear.

97
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,836
I told you he'd fall for
the first piece of tail that came along.

98
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,797
Shh! Okay...

99
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,049
Okay.
Now smile!

100
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,802
Big night!
Big everything.

101
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,013
I'll make you a copy.

102
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:16,602
Yeah, I want to remember this night.
Whoo!

103
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,021
Here, Son.

104
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,064
You'll need this.

105
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,525
Girls like her...
They like to eat before the prom.

106
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,237
Good luck, Son.

107
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,869
Hmm, another tattoo.

108
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:36,912
"Property of Hyde."

109
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,289
Classy!

110
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,422
What?
What's Fez doing?

111
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:51,926
- Step away from that stereo!
- But, Hyde, I got the new Leo Sayer album.

112
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:57,598
Hey, everybody! I just made Forman a man.

113
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,642
Well, as much of a man
as he'll ever be.

114
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,523
Kelso and Pam Macy?

115
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:11,444
- But Kelso and Jackie got back together on prom night.
- Never happened.

116
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:15,156
I wrote you a love poem, Pam.
It goes like this:

117
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:17,116
I love your rack.

118
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,117
I'd love to shack...

119
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,078
up with you and do it too.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,165
Oh, Michael.
That is so deep.

121
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:28,543
Yeah, I kicked that poem's ass!

122
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:32,213
It's all a domino effect, Eric.

123
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:36,592
You see, Hyde wasn't there to take Jackie
to prom, so she couldn't make up with Kelso.

124
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:38,135
See?

125
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,769
Oh, my God.
That's so sad.

126
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,231
It's like my relationship with Donna
touched everyone's life.

127
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:55,317
And I was just gonna throw that a...

128
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,905
Okay, you're unpleasant.

129
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:03,575
Just give it up. I don't care.
None of this is really that bad anyway.

130
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:06,327
Well, it gets a lot worse.

131
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:08,955
Come on.
We're going into the future.

132
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:12,208
That's right: The '80s.

133
00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,672
Hey, what the hell was that?

134
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,341
Oh, you'll find out.

135
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:32,737
Welcome to 1983...
Donna and Hyde's wedding.

136
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:36,616
<i>Man, did you have to make her pregnant?</i>

137
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,160
Good God, I wish I could just wake up.

138
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:43,622
Oh-Oh, you may never wake up.
This could be a coma dream.

139
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:47,959
Congratulations,
Mr. And Mrs. Steven Hyde...

140
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,754
from Cedar Rapids's
number one anchorman.

141
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,090
Kelso, man, glad you could make it.

142
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:57,218
- Hey, oh, man, can I kiss the bride?
- Sure.

143
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:03,098
Damn it, Kelso!
You don't French the bride!

144
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,103
Where's the food?

145
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:11,189
- Please, honey, for the love of God...
- Don't "honey" me.

146
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,441
I'm hungry, stick man.

147
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:21,657
Hey, Forman, so when are you
and Big Rhonda gonna tie the knot, huh?

148
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,617
Oh, I don't know.

149
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,121
You know, I'm so busy at Price Mart,
and, uh, she has her dog grooming...

150
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:30,957
and her cheating on me, so...

151
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:37,171
Jackie... Burkhart?
Is that you?

152
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,715
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

153
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:44,052
It's Michael. Kelso?

154
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:47,389
It rings a stupid, little bell.

155
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:53,269
You know, I bet if I wasn't so happy
as a globe-trotting stewardess...

156
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,647
I might actually remember the tiny effect
you had on me in high school.

157
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,025
- I'm on TV now.
- I've always loved you.

158
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:11,202
- Ow!
- Oh, oh, Jake, honey, honey. Be nice to your big brother.

159
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,579
He's not strong like you.

160
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,999
"Brother"?
What the hell?

161
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,336
Your parents finally had
the son they always wanted.

162
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:25,173
- Now, Son, what do we call Eric?
- Dumb-ass!

163
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:27,134
There's my boy!

164
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,679
Oh, what a wonderful wedding.

165
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:37,059
It's so nice when children get married and...
and move far away from their parents.

166
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:41,063
Or they don't get married
and stay at home with their mother...

167
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:43,023
who they just couldn't stand to be...

168
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:45,275
Away from.

169
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,612
Oh, God.

170
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:55,493
Hey, Kelso, man.
I just opened your wedding gift.

171
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:58,412
It's primo. What do you
say we go break it in?

172
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:01,123
All right!

173
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:04,501
You're leaving?
I hate you! Call me.

174
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,589
- Fez.
- Good night, Wisconsin!

175
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:18,097
This is really...

176
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,725
I've really missed...

177
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:25,604
We have breaking news.

178
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,606
I'm toasted.

179
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:32,569
Man, they pay me gobs of money
to talk like that.

180
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:38,908
Fez, do something with your hair, man.
It's making me paranoid.

181
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:47,874
Guys, I have discovered a band
that will change music forever.

182
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,890
I love to cook, you know?

183
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,852
I'm really good with sauces.

184
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:12,605
Guys, sometimes when I do the news...

185
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,274
I don't wear any pants!

186
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,236
Whoo!

187
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:23,198
You know, there are
some things about Earth...

188
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,368
I really miss!

189
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:36,002
Okay, welcome to your
10-year high school reunion.

190
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,800
All right!
I finally grew a mustache!

191
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:46,470
Actually, it's chocolate cake.

192
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,105
- What happened to Kelso?
- Oh, he got fired.

193
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:01,859
Yeah, he thought the news
would be funnier drunk.

194
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,152
Now he works for you,
selling water beds.

195
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:07,239
What a loser!

196
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,699
- Wait, I sell water beds?
- That's right.

197
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:17,081
Kelso, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to lock up the store tonight.

198
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,500
It's our reunion, man.

199
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,627
I'll lock it up tomorrow, I promise.

200
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:26,548
- Hello, Michael.
- Hello, Jackie.

201
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,176
Oh, I just want to let you to know that,
uh, I married Pam Macy.

202
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,013
She's one hell of a cook, a super lady,
and I'm really, really happy.

203
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:38,434
Good, 'cause I wouldn't
be with you anyway.

204
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:40,394
You're fat.

205
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:50,445
Okay, Michael. When you're done being a pig,
I'll be in the Le Car.

206
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:58,661
Uh, I'm sorry, Rhonda.

207
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:02,081
- Uh, yeah.
- Rhonda? Oh, my God, Rhonda!

208
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:05,250
Hi, Eric. Uh, I was hoping you'd be here.

209
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:08,336
- I just wanted to thank you.
- Thank me?

210
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,882
Yes. Um, after you broke up with me,
I was so disgusted with my life.

211
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:16,260
I mean, if someone like you
didn't want to see me... Whoo!

212
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:22,599
So, thanks to you and Jane Fonda,
I have this new, fabulous body...

213
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:25,811
and a successful aerobics studio.

214
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:28,146
Well, hey, you know what?

215
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,607
- I'm glad I could help.
- Yeah.

216
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,688
Oh, hey! Hi!
Hey, Donna.

217
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:16,816
It's... It's Eric Forman...

218
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,859
from, uh, Point Place High School.

219
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,987
Yeah, Eric, I know.
It's our reunion.

220
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:24,072
Right. Good one.

221
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:29,744
- So, how are you doing?
- Um, I was pretty lousy...

222
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:32,914
until I saw how fat Kelso got.

223
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,625
- It made the drive from Joliet worth it.
- Oh, right.

224
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,210
- I heard you guys moved. How's Hyde?
- Hyde's good.

225
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:41,171
Kids are good.
He's gone a lot.

226
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:43,132
Prison. Whatever.

227
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:46,676
So, Eric, uh, how... how are you?

228
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,637
I'm, uh, great.

229
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,848
I'm the number three water-bed dealer
in Wisconsin. So...

230
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:59,438
- Donna, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.

231
00:17:00,564 --> 00:17:04,401
You know, don't laugh, but...

232
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:09,322
- Actually, never mind.
- No, no. What?

233
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:11,658
I had a crush on you in high school.

234
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:13,951
I had a crush on you too.

235
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:16,287
You know, I almost kissed you once.

236
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:20,916
What might've been, huh?

237
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,797
So...
So are you... are you still writing?

238
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,051
Oh, God.
Well, I mean, permission slips.

239
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,054
- Three kids, you know.
- Right.

240
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,390
Well, you should start again,
'cause, you know...

241
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,268
you were really good at it.

242
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,437
Oh, well, it's too late for that.

243
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,357
It's too late for a lot of...

244
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,571
- Hey, so I'll see you, Eric.
- Yeah, I'll see ya, Donna.

245
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:55,781
- Okay.
- Okay.

246
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:05,207
Huh? Huh?

247
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,126
Start the waterworks.

248
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:12,005
- Sorry.
- Come on. You gotta feel something.

249
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:16,175
Yeah... envy.
He never had to feel the pain of losing her.

250
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,055
Oh, wait a minute.
You actually had a relationship with Donna?

251
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:24,433
- Wait, I thought you said he couldn't hear me.
- I'm loose with the rules.

252
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:28,395
- So sue me.
- No, seriously. You had Donna?

253
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,773
Look... We broke up.
You're much better off.

254
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,442
Says you!
Look at me!

255
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,402
I'm 28 years old.

256
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:40,155
I've only had sex with Big Rhonda,
and all three times, believe me...

257
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:42,699
she did not look like that!

258
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:45,911
Idiot! You're sad you were
never with Donna?

259
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:49,414
Well, you got off light, man!
I had her, and I lost her!

260
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:53,459
And believe me,
you don't want to know how bad that hurts!

261
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,592
So...

262
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:05,387
- you're an angel, right?
- Why, yes. Yes I am.

263
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,099
Can you, like...
Can you do anything to help me?

264
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,935
Listen closely:

265
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,895
No.

266
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:22,277
You know, Angel, thanks.

267
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:26,031
But I've got to go to sleep,
'cause I have a big day of...

268
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,992
misery ahead of me.

269
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,412
Okay, you win.

270
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,622
It was better never
to have loved at all.

271
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,582
Thank you!

272
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,126
And, hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

273
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,212
I'm gonna take it all away.

274
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:45,132
You won't feel a thing... good or bad.

275
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:49,552
Really?
Yes. Yes, do it.

276
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:53,097
Okay. Well, let me just remind you
what you're giving up.

277
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,099
Hang on.

278
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:19,205
Wait. No.
I want to keep it.

279
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:21,832
Please, just...

280
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:24,126
let me keep it.

281
00:20:25,305 --> 00:21:25,404

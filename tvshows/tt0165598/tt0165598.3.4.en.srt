2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,300
Boo!

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,900
Damn it, Fez!
[Sighs]

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,700
Oh! Damn, Fez.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,400
Fez, what the hell are you doing?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
Yeah, I don't know
if you know this...

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
but you're dressed like a girl.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,600
And not a nice girl.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Kelso, you spilled juice
all over your shirt.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,600
- You look stupid.
- [Eric] Yeah.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,700
Hey, Kelso, while you're over there, would
you Please, Please toss Fez a Pair of Pants?

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,600
Or at least a skirt.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,500
No, I am Dr. Frank-N-Furter from
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,700
You know, my Bible-thumping host
parents were really upset about my...

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
rock-hard ass.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
Fez, put it away
or take it outside.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
So, Eric, do you wanna
get out of here?

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,600
- Do something fun for Halloween?
- I do.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I gotta go to this stupid Halloween party
with Laurie's stupid friends.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,700
Not only do I have to
wear a suit...

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,500
but all of her guy friends act
like they've done it with her before.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
- Uh, Kelso-
- Leave it.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,400
Okay. Whatever.
There's nothing to do.

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,700
It's like we're too old to trick
or treat and too young to die.

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Oh, hey, we could take Fez to Chicago
and peddle his ass for beer.

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm game.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,600
No, Eric, I meant maybe there's something,
you know, we could do. Together.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,900
- [Snorts] I doubt it.
- Oh!

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,200
That is a burn.

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,000
- Wait. What?
- No, l-

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,100
No, I didn't- I didn't
mean it like that.

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,400
Nope, sorry, Eric,
that was a burn.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,400
And what's burnt is burnt.
And what's burnt is Donna.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,300
We're out of fun things to do?
You're already bored of your girlfriend?

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,600
No, I meant this town...

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,300
not you, pretty lady.

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Hey, you know what'd be fun?

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,700
Is if we were in an Alfred
Hitchcock movie right now...

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,000
and we didn't know it,
and then someone told us...

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,700
and we're like,
"Oh, man, I'm in a movie."

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,800
- Yeah, okay, I'm outta here.
- Wait, but I thought we-

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,600
- Get bent.
- Okay, I'll do that.

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,000
You know what will cheer you up?
A little trick-or-treating.

44
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,700
Hello? Stop bouncing that damn
ball and let's do something.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, you know, I can't, Fez,
'cause I can't even look at you.

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,400
I don't know whether to
throw you out or...

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,100
throw you down and
make sweet love to you.

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,200
You know, that says more
about you than it does him.

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, I'm not the one
dressed like a damn girl.

50
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Well, the damn girl has your ball.
[Chuckles]

Oh, these heels are killing me.

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,100
Okay, Fez, that's it. Give the ball back,
and no one gets hurt.

Hey, you guys, you wanna go outside
and watch Eric and Fez run around?

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Someone might get hurt.
It's funny when people get hurt.

59
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,300
Especially when they're
in their underwear. That's great.

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
The only person dumb enough
to get hurt around here is you.

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,500
[Snorts] Okay, Jackie,
I'm really starting to get sick-

[Screaming]

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,700
That's great.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,500
I'll give you the ball,
Eric. Just don't fall.

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,200
I don't want anyone to fall.
No falling.

Down the street

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
The same old thing

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
We did last week

71
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,900
Not a thing to do

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,200
But talk to you

73
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,500
We're all all right

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
We're all all right

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,900
Hello, Wisconsin.!

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,500
Okay, Fez. Well...

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,800
you got a bad sprain here.

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Not to- to mention a run in your stocking.
[Laughs]

79
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,100
So, you were running around
chasing him on the roof...

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,800
because he took
your little rubber ball.

81
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,900
It wasn't a ball.
It was a SuperBall.

82
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,700
Yeah, you should see
that thing bounce.

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,600
It's pretty super.

84
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,700
Dumb-asses.

85
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Steven, Eric, um, get Fez a blanket.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
He needs to cover his- He just-

87
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,400
He needs to cover up.

[Screaming]

90
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Get off me, you girl.

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,700
- What-What happened?
- Honey, you just-

92
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,100
you had a little touch
of vertigo there.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,900
So, just stay away from heights
for a while and you'll be fine.

94
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,300
Oh, see?
You see that, Jackie?

95
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,600
Fez hurt himself. There is
someone "stupider" than me.

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,100
It's not his fault
he's stupid. He's foreign.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,900
What's your excuse, stupid?

98
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,400
Well, I know one thing's for sure. There's
definitely someone bitchier than me.

99
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,300
Oh, you better not mean me.

100
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,400
Oh, I so mean you!

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,400
- Oh.
- Nice burn.

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,600
- Top shelf.
- Thanks.

103
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,200
Well, now, that's strange.

104
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,100
Midge's car's right there.
Bob said she wasn't home.

105
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
In fact, I haven't
seen her for days.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,100
Maybe she went to the store
and forgot where she lived.

107
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,500
Oh, that's- that's wrong.

108
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Okay, Fez, this'll cheer you up.

109
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
With these you can look into the
Pinciotti's house and frequently enjoy...

110
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,900
a naked Midge,
up close and personal.

111
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
That's exactly how I like
my naked Midges.

112
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Oh, but, Fez, be warned.

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
If Bob approaches
a naked Midge, look away.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh, for the love of God,
look away.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, let's practice.

116
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Naked Midge, naked Midge,
naked Midge...

117
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
- naked Midge, Bob.
- Ay.

118
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,200
- Okay, I think you're gonna be okay.
- [Chuckles]

119
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,200
No, okay. Sure.
Yeah. Bye-bye.

120
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,400
Red, I need you to take
this soup up to Fez.

121
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,800
No, Kitty. He's wearing
ladies' underwear.

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
So, uh, no.

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,300
Well, crazy bird lady
from next door called me.

124
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,000
Her bingo cruise got stuck
out on Lake Michigan...

125
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
so she asked me
to feed her birds.

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,900
So, you have a choice.
Feed the birds, or feed the Fez.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,500
Give me panty boy's damn soup.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hello, pretty birds.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,200
Hello, pretty...

130
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,100
damn big birds.
[Chuckles]

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,500
It's your Aunt Kitty.

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,300
Okay.

133
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,700
[Squawks]

134
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,600

[Cawing Continues]

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Hey.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, I've seen this one.

139
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,100
Those guys think that Cary Grant's
a secret agent, but he's not.

140
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
It's a case of mistaken identity.

141
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,700
Right, like you've mistaken me
for someone who wants you here.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
Right.

143
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
- [Chuckles] Wait.
- [Doorbell Rings]

144
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,900
- Oh, kick back. I'll get it.
- No, it's the paperboy.

145
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,600
- [Ringing Continues]
- Well, Mr. Forman, you have to answer the door.

146
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,400
Look, I forgot to pay him
for the last couple of weeks...

147
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,100
and I didn't pick up any cash,
so, just ignore him.

148
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,600
Red, I don't think
you understand, okay?

149
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,100
- L- I can't let a doorbell go unanswered.
- [Ringing Continues]

150
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,600
- Don't answer the damn door.
- I gotta.

151
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
- Don't.
- But I gotta.

152
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,100
All right. Fine.
You pay him, kettlehead.

153
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, Forman. I want my money.

154
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, l- Oh.
There's no Formans here.

155
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
See for yourself.

156
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Then why does it say
Forman on your shirt?

157
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,900
Oh, I borrowed the shirt.

158
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,900
That's a bunch of bullcorn,
Forman. Now, give me my money.

159
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm not Forman.

160
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
All right, look.

161
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,400
Don't you think you're taking this
paperboy thing a little too serious?

162
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm a very serious paperboy.

163
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Okay, you know what this is?

164
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,300
This is a case of mistaken identity.

165
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
See, you are mistaken...

166
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,700
about my identity.

167
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Fork it over, Forman!

168
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,900
Look, someone's
stealing your bike.

169
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,300
All right, there's two guys
stupider than me.

170
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,300
- Any sign of naked Midge yet?
- No.

172
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,000
Just Bob dragging in big,
heavy garbage bags.

173
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
What do you suppose is in 'em?

174
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Oh, I don't know.

175
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,200
- I'm guessing garbage.
- Or-

176
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,800
You know how Mrs. Kitty said she
hasn't seen Midge in a few days?

177
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,600
What if naked Midge
is in the bags?

178
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,600
Red. Red, I killed a bird.

179
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Oh.

180
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,800
And then-And then the
rest of them, they just-

181
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,700
they glared at me with this-
this birdie hate look.

182
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
I can't go back there.

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I have got to find somebody
else to feed those birds.

184
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,900
Somebody who won't flinch
in the face of evil.

185
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Oh, and there's Mommy's girl.

186
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,900
[Laughs]
Laurie, have I got a job for you.

187
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,100
- Not interested.
- It pays 10 bucks.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,300
All right, I'll do
anything for 10 bucks.

189
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,500
And-And for once,
that's a good thing.

190
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
Donna, what's wrong?
You look sad.

191
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,800
I think Eric thinks I'm boring.

192
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Do you think I'm boring?

193
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,500
Oh, Donna.

194
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,300
Yeah, a little.

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
But it's not like it's a bad thing.

196
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,800
The world needs people like you.

You're the gray that makes
the color- me- pop.

Jackie, I'm not boring.

199

Eric and I do lots of fun stuff together.
We go to movies-

Every Friday, early show.

- Mm-hmm.

[Eric]
That's not a hot blonde. It's Donna.

Where is she going?

211
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Maybe she's going trolling for
men who don't piss her off.

212
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,800
Oh. [Chuckles]
That's so funny, Hyde.

fits in your murder theory...

220
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,000
but Bob's wearing an apron with guts all
over it and holding a big carving knife.

221
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,000
He did kill Midge.

222
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,900

'cause I'm good.

See you next week, Forman.

I'm not Forman!

234
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,700
First of all, Mrs. Forman,
I'm using your shower.

235
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
And second of all,
you have to pay your paperboy.

236
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,200
So, how'd it go? Did-
Did you feed the birds?

237
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,400
Well, uh-Yeah.

238
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,600
I mean, I think I did.

239
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Well, either you did or you didn't.

240
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,800
Well, you didn't either, and
you didn't even get pooped on.

241
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,000
Now, go feed your own stupid birds.

[Thinking]
Oh, Hyde, please be careful.

I want you to catch some clues...

but I don't want you stuck in the
garbage bag with dead, naked Midge.

Oh, my goodness. A phone booth.
That's lucky.

Oh, thank God.

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,800
It was just a dream.
[Breathing Heavily]

330
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, I can't go back there.
I just can't. [Sighs]

331
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,500
So, you know, Donna,
even though my ankle's sprained...

332
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,600
I can still probably make it
up that water tower.

333
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,500
You know, finish what we started.

334
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,000
I would, but I don't know if I can.

335
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,200
I mean, something happened
to me up there too.

336
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,200
Oh, I know. Vertigo, right?
Fear of heights?

337
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,800
No, Eric. Fear of sex.

1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,950
Wow!
Donna, you look great.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,910
What could it be?

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,870
Oh, I know. You lost
80 pounds of ugly fat.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,430
Burn, Eric, burn!

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,990
Okay, first of all...

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,870
I weigh
a 130... 49... pounds.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,150
Yeah.
You look good too, Eric.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,670
You lost...
your one true love, so...

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,590
Looking good.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,150
Eric, I found these records of yours,
and I thought you might want them back.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,790
Ah, the unpleasant exchange of possessions
after the horrific breakup.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,910
Awkward for them,
entertaining for us.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,790
Whoa, whoa. Shut up.
Don Kirshner's starting.

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,630
Oh, right. Paul McCartney and Wings
are on tonight.

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,470
Okay, so... Okay,
we're all here now.

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,950
So... So, Donna,
you're staying?

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,950
Okay.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,630
What I meant to say was...

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,950
Look, Donna, I don't think
it's cool if you hang out here.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,190
So, what, you're,
like, kicking me out?

21
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,150
Wow.

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,190
Okay then. Bye.

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,430
Well, if you're kicking her out,
then you're kicking me out.

24
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,110
No, Jackie, no.
Oh, wait. I mean, bye!

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,074

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,430
So, it's just not fair.
He doesn't, like, get my friends...

27
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,710
'cause he has some stupid,
crappy basement.

28
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,430
Right! You helped make that
basement what it is today.

29
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,390
Right. No one would even
go over there before me.

30
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,350
It smelled like feet.

31
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,590
Donna, you have to fight back.

32
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,550
Okay, when a couple splits up...

33
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,830
the woman deserves her fair share
of the life she helped build.

34
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,150
- How much is that?
- All of it!

35
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,550
Donna, it's the law.

36
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,910
You know, normally, that statement
would really offend me.

37
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,190
But now that I'm single and pissed,
you're making a lot of sense.

38
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,590
<i>And then she just comes down</i>
<i>in the basement like it's no big deal.</i>

39
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,550
After what happened? And she's just gonna act
like everything's cool and everything's fine?

40
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,710
<i>You don't love me,</i>
<i>you don't get my couch... or my friends.</i>

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,230
<i>I'm a package deal, baby!</i>

42
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,190
<i>So, I just told her, "Fire up those walking</i>
<i>sticks, Big Red, because this ain't happening.</i>

43
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,270
<i>I'm not having it."</i>

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,870
Hey, Forman, we were all there,
and that ain't how it happened.

45
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,030
You wanna talk about it
some more?

46
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,670
Mmm, no.

47
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,910
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, Pastor Dave!

48
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,950
What a nice surprise.
How's... God?

49
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,870
Fine, thank you.

50
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,110
So, I was wondering if,
uh, Red was home.

51
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,750
Oh, no.
What did he do?

52
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,670
No. No, no, nothing.
I just thought...

53
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,950
he might like to, uh...
I don't know... goof off?

54
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,150
You want to
spend time with Red.

55
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,150
- Unless it's a bad time.
- Oh, no, no, no. This is a great time.

56
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,750
Oh, my God!
Red has a visitor!

57
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,630
Red, Pastor Dave's here!
For you! Hurry!

58
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,310
Oh, yeah. I ran into him
in the hardware store.

59
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,310
You know, he was gonna try to paint
his garage without priming.

60
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,430
That crazy bastard.

61
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,910
Oh, my.
Red has a friend.

62
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,830
Psst!

63
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,750
What are you guys doing today?

64
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,590
We're going to the basement.

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,470
Hmm. Sounds fun.

66
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,470
But you know what sounds
like even more fun?

67
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,230
Oh! Playing with a bunch
of monkeys?

68
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,270
Well, yeah.

69
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,870
But we got cable TV
at my house...

70
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,910
which we all know has the potential
for flashes of brief nudity.

71
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,190
Nudity!

72
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,550
Cable? Oh, you are so gonna
win this breakup!

73
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,150
Now, wait just a minute.

74
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,470
Eric is our friend,
our brother.

75
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,270
We cannot just abandon him for nude boobs.

76
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,270
Good point, Fez. This nudity you speak of,
are we talking full frontal?

77
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,550
- Does it matter?
- No. Let's go.

78
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,590
So, you have no idea
where everyone is?

79
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,350
Everyone who?

80
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,910
Hey, you got any Popsicles?
Donna's all out.

81
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,150
Oh, so that's how it is?
Everyone's over at Donna's?

82
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,310
Eric, man, I'm sorry.

83
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,870
And I know that we've been friends
for, like, a really long time...

84
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,310
but, uh, we were watching
<i>Barbarella</i> on cable.

85
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,150
Man, and I not only saw boobs,
but I saw boobs in space!

86
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,110
Yeah, space boobs, Eric!

87
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,870
There's no gravity!

88
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,190
She got cable?
That sneaky little wench.

89
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,310
No, no. And corn dogs.

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,150
Oh, dogs wrapped in corn.

91
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,190
Oh, sweet meat on a stick.

92
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,670
- Just go.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,670
"At Dave's.
Back around 5:00. Red."

94
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,590
Oh!

95
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,790
I hadn't realized before,
but the primer is like your emotions.

96
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,230
It's what's underneath
the surface.

97
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,470
And the rust
is like your anger.

98
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,590
Boy...

99
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,710
having a male companion
to talk to is changing my life.

100
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,790
I wish I could tell Kitty
exactly how I feel about her...

101
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,790
but I just
can't find the words.

102
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,710
I'll help you.
We'll find the words together.

103
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,310
Oh, sure...

104
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,910
sometimes I feel like crying,
but I just can't.

105
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,310
You can with me.

106
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,830
- Hey.
- Oh, hello.

107
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,470
So, how was your day?
What did you and your new friend do?

108
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,830
Well...

109
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,310
- So, that's all you did?
- Yep.

110
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,190
Well, you didn't talk
about anything?

111
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,390
Nope.

112
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,910
- Do you hate him?
- Kitty, don't start.

113
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,710
No, no, no. All I'm saying is,
people with friends live longer.

114
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,270
And you are not good
at keeping friends.

115
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,750
Bob's scared of you,
and Earl isn't speaking to you.

116
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,670
- What about Frank?
- Frank's dead.

117
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,670
Exactly.

118
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,990
It is time to replace
your dead friend Frank.

119
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,390
I win.

120
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,310
Oh, look,
there's a boob!

121
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,430
There's two.

122
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,790
Oh, wait. Four.

123
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,950
It's the mother lode.

124
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,750
Oh, man. Guy butt. Look away.

125
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,350
I feel kinda bad.

126
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,950
Hon, it's just guy butt.
It won't hurt you.

127
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,870
No! About Eric.

128
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,470
I mean, he was totally in the right
to kick Donna out.

129
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,790
Oh, he was not right.

130
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,790
Now, you agree with me!

131
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,630
No.

132
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,630
Agree with me.

133
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,390
No! Donna broke his heart,
and now she should have to pay.

134
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,550
- Chex Mix?
- Oh, thank you, Donna.

135
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,910
Oh, we are so not talking.

136
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,390
- All right, Jack...
- I said, not talking!

137
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,150
- Well done.
- All right, Fez. The...

138
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,150
I said, well done!

139
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,190
Oh, there are
all my friends.

140
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,150
Hey, Donna,
I found these socks of yours...

141
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,350
so I thought I'd just, you know,
run 'em right over.

142
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,670
Eric, you can't hang out here.

143
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,590
It's really uncomfortable, so...

144
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,590
Uncomfortable?

145
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,950
Who's uncomfortable?

146
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,710
Oh, fine.

147
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,990
Look, man, I'd go with you,
but, you know, it's cable.

148
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,910
Whatever.

149
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,350
Hey, want me to come by later
and tell you about the boobs?

150
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,110
No! Yeah.

151
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,030
It's Dave for you.

152
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,870
Yeah?

153
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,630
Fine. Right.

154
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,190
Okay.

155
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,590
You do not grunt
to a friend.

156
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,950
Friends don't grunt.

157
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,910
Okay, so I was over
at the Pinciottis'...

158
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,310
crouched behind the hedge next to the house,
and I distinctly heard laughter.

159
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,550
Laughter!
Well, I will tell you what.

160
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,670
I am not going down without a fight.
No, sirree, Bob.

161
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,430
Bob!

162
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,670
The kids really
like my jokes?

163
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,110
Oh.

164
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,190
Mr. Pinciotti, if you only knew
the number of times...

165
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,110
Donna's shared one of
your doozies with the gang.

166
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,230
Lordy, how we laugh and laugh.

167
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,670
And laugh.

168
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,310
Right. I'm goin'.

169
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,230
Okay.

170
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,710
But the tennis pro says...

171
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,550
"We don't serve
those kind of balls."

172
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,430
Welcome home, friends.

173
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,430
Who wants Popsicles?

174
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,030
Hey, I don't feel good
about this.

175
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,670
Well, would you rather be at Donna's singing
backup to "Cha Cha Di Amore"?

176
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,750
- Oh. Well, will you look who's here.
- That was a dirty trick, Forman.

177
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,710
Well, I'd love to stay and talk about it,
but we're on our way to the movies.

178
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,390
Yeah.

179
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,950
Fine. Then I'm taking them
bowling Saturday.

180
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,070
Yeah!

181
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,190
Fine.

182
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,470
Ooh, what a fun weekend.

183
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,950
Hey, look, you guys can't buy our loyalty
with these little field trips.

184
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,150
You're gonna have to start buying us
some stuff we can take home.

185
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,270
Well, look, I think it's stupid
to have to go day by day.

186
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,350
Why doesn't Donna
just get us on the weekends?

187
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not fair...

188
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,670
because then Eric gets
all the weekday headaches...

189
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,950
and Donna gets
all the fun time.

190
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,630
Fine. Then we'll make
a schedule. Eric?

191
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,390
Fine. Have a seat.

192
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,390
Make sure to schedule time
with Bob.

193
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,390
He takes me
to Chuckle Town.

194
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,830
So, um, what are you
and Dave gonna do today?

195
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,310
Go out to the garage and talk
friend to friend? That would be nice.

196
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,350
No. We're gonna turn on the fight
and watch two nice men...

197
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,670
beat the living hell
out of each other.

198
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,590
That's nice.

199
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,790
Oh. Oh.

200
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,270
Oh, come on in,
Pastor Dave.

201
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,470
Red and I are just so happy
that you are here.

202
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,470
- Especially Red.
- Kitty.

203
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,390
I want you to know that it is so nice
for Red to finally have a boyfriend.

204
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,510
For God sakes, Kitty!

205
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,230
Oh, lighten up, silly.
"Man friend." Whatever.

206
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,590
Someone to talk to,
share their feelings with.

207
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,670
Anyway, you are an important
part of Red's life.

208
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,470
Oh.

209
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,790
- Well...
- Wait. No. Don't listen to her.

210
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,390
I don't really want to share
my feelings with you.

211
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,990
Hell, I don't even think
I have feelings.

212
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,430
Now, let's just watch these two guys
beat the crap out of each other.

213
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,390
Sold!

214
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,150
Well, I don't care
what you say.

215
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,630
You're boyfriends,
and that's nice.

216
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,510
You know, Red, I am so glad
that I have someone to share with...

217
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,590
because I woke up this morning
feeling upset.

218
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,630
Ha-ha! I gotcha!

219
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,270
Good one, Dave.
Good one!

220
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,230
Don't ever do that again.

221
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,270
I'm just saying, Forman...

222
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,950
you really didn't deliver
on the afternoon like I was hoping.

223
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,870
Dude, I took you everywhere.

224
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,910
I bought everything.
It was a great day.

225
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,030
I don't know, man. I mean, I asked you for
a six-pack. You brought me out a tall boy.

226
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,590
I'm just saying.

227
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,790
Fine. Whatever.
They're all yours.

228
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,950
Twenty minutes late.

229
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,870
Sorry. We had to stop
so Fez could pee.

230
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,710
Yes, it was my fault.
Please do not fight.

231
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,870
Eric, listen, travel time should come out
of your time, not mine.

232
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,990
What's on Fez's face?

233
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,990
Nothing. Nothing.

234
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,790
Is that ice cream?
Now he won't want dinner!

235
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,310
I am sorry I ate
ice cream, Donna.

236
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,950
- Do not be mad.
- Oh.

237
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,590
Fez, I'm mad at Eric,
not at you.

238
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,350
This is not about you.

239
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,470
Listen, I'm not about to limit
our good time to help with yours.

240
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,150
- Why would you do anything to help me?
- Oh, you listen, missy.

241
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,550
- I'm not gonna...
- Stop it! Stop it!

242
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,310
You are tearing us apart!

243
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,310
I hope you're happy.
Now you've upset Fez.

244
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,150
Yeah, and your fighting is
making me and Jackie fight...

245
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,550
and that interferes
with us doing it.

246
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,710
And that ain't good.

247
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,870
So, until you guys fix this, we're not
hanging out with either one of you. Let's go.

248
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,390
Hyde, I'm sticky.

249
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,110
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

250
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,750
And I'm sleepy.

251
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,190
I know.
You had a big day!

252
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,390
This is your fault.
None of this would have happened...

253
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,070
if you hadn't been such a jerk
and kicked me out of the basement.

254
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,470
Well, you came in
and you were just so...

255
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,390
"Oh, we broke up, and I don't care,
and, hey, let's just watch TV."

256
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,630
Eric, I was faking it.

257
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,030
I'm miserable and uncomfortable,
and this whole thing sucks.

258
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,990
You're miserable?

259
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,790
Well, that's great!

260
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,950
I mean, I'm miserable too.

261
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,950
Okay, so, how about this?

262
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,590
We just hang out together
and pretend everything's fine...

263
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,230
for, you know...
for the sake of our friends.

264
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,030
I can do that.

265
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,030
Okay.

266
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,550
But, you know,

267
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,030
You have to stop trying to
look so hot when you come over.

268
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,750
I have not been doing that.

269
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,550
Red lipstick, no bra?

270
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,310
Okay, yeah, I did that.

271
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,550
And, Fez,
you sit on the dryer.

272
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,910
Okay. This new seating arrangement
should really work.

273
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,510
There you kids are.

274
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,110
I think I finally remembered the punch line
to the Italian midget joke.

275
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,830
- My mom made fish.
- I gotta register for the draft.

276
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,750
- Me too.
- I gotta go count my G.I. Joes.

277
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,590
I'll be in the oven.

278
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,550
Wow. Tough room.

279
00:21:10,305 --> 00:22:10,531

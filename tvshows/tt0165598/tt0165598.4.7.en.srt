1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,340
Hey, Mrs. Forman.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,780
My dad's making a cheese sandwich,
but he's missing some stuff.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,780
So, can I borrow
bread and cheese?

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,060
Oh, your dad's having a hard time
without your mom, isn't he?

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,020
Midge was the brains of that outfit?

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, Donna.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,060
- Sorry about what?
- You, get Donna bread and cheese.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,460
Okay.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,140
Wow. This is a really nice dress.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,780
I know. Isn't it fancy?

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,540
It's for the Price Mart Ball
tomorrow night.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,940
Oh, right, the Price Mart Ball.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,220
So who you takin'?
Who's the lucky lady?

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,060
Oh, well, I decided not to go.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,980
Personal choice.

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,420
You don't have a date, do you?

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,340
Okay. You know what?

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,260
It's not about, "Can I get a date?"

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,900
It's about this great book that I'm,
like, halfway through.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,340
Plus, you know, I could get a date.

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,700
I've got numbers, buddy.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,740
Sure you do, honey.
You're number one with me.

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,100
You're going tomorrow night.
And you'd better not go stag, Eric.

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,060
There's nothing worse than an 80-pound boy
dancing with his mommy all night.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,460
You know what?
I'll go.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,380
I told you I would,
like, months ago.

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,980
But that was before the...

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,900
ugliness.

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,060
Eric, I'm over it.

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,620
Hey, I'm over it.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,260
Oh, I'm... I'm over it.

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,060
Plus, I mean, last year they had
all-you-can-eat shrimp.

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,580
Well, I mean, you know, I'm over it.

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,500
Hey, I'm over it.
Yeah, I'm over it.

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,580
I was just worried that you might think
it was weird, us going out on a date.

36
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,740
So, I mean, you know,
the concern laid with you.

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,620
Eric, it's not a date.

38
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,580
It's not... I know. I know it's not a date.
It's not a date.

39
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,940
It's a...

40
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,100
shrimp fest.

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,980
A festival of shrimp, if you will.

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,820
- Exactly.
- Okay.

43
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,820
- I'll see you tomorrow night.
- 'Kay.

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,180
See, now, look.

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,580
My little prince is going to the ball.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,074

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,560
So, Forman, you break up with Donna...

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
but you still get to have sex
and go on dates with her?

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,960
Ride the big red wave, dude.

50
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I should break up with Donna.
"Donna, we are through.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,560
Let the sex and dating begin."

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,720
Oh, no. It's not a date.

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,400
We're just friends now,
because she's over it.

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,520
- Well, guess who else is over it?
- I am.

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,960
- Me too.
- So over it.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,400
Look, man, breaking up sucks, okay?

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,400
When Jackie dumped me,
you know what she said?

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,600
"Somethin' somethin'.
Never wanna see you again.

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,760
Blah, blah, blah."

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,200
Hey, you think that didn't hurt?

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Okay. You know what?

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,520
- I'm done talking about this.
- Good.

63
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,120
But I will say this.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,400
If she doesn't want it to be a date,
then it won't be a date.

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,040
I am so cool with that,
because as we all know...

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,400
I am very mature.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Now, if you would all
please excuse me...

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,480
my mommy has to iron my corduroys.

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,960
Ah, women.

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,880
Am I right, guys?

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Ah, who am I kidding?

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,880
There's no woman for Fez.

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,600
What must Fez do to get a woman?

74
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,200
Well, for one thing,
he's gotta cut out that third-person crap.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
It's weird.

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,080
You <i>are</i> Fez.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
You know somethin' else?

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,920
Shoes say a lot about a man.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,240
In your case, your chukka boots
are screaming "virgin."

80
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,840
Damn you, boots.

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
What else have you told them?

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,920
Hey, Fez...

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,680
seeing you wear those chukkas
makes me wanna up-chukka.

84
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,760
- Nice.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
It's like I ate too many
"chukkalate" chip cookies.

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,120
Okay.

87
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,240
Yeah, how much wood
could a "woodchukka" chukka...

88
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,160
Hey. Shut the chukka up.

89
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,960
How am I supposed
to afford new boots?

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,680
My Bible-thumping host parents won't give me
an allowance because I am a pagan.

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,640
You know, Leo's looking
for help down at the Fotohut.

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,280
The Fotohut, huh?

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,560
I can really "picture" myself there.

94
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,560
That job and I will really "click."

95
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,040
Oh, I am on a "roll"...

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,560
of film.

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,680
Ow.

98
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Don't be so... "negative."

99
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,160
I am the king.

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,680
You sure you wanna get in
the Fotohut game?

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,560
It can chew you up and spit you out
like a stick of gum.

102
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,200
Or something that seemed edible
till you put it in your mouth...

103
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,680
and then you realized it's not.

104
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
Or a stick of gum.

105
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
- What kind of gum?
- Big Red.

106
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,960
Oh, that's fine.

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,200
Okay, you're hired.
But you're on probation.

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,880
No, wait. I'm on probation.

109
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,560
Oh, wow. I gotta go see
my probation officer.

110
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,880
- So he's my new boss?
- Welcome to paradise.

111
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh, Red.

112
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
Don't the kids look nice
for their date?

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,440
Yeah. Nice as hell.

114
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
- Oh, well, thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Actually, Mom...

115
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,440
as Donna so thoughtfully pointed out earlier,
this isn't a date.

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
Well, I just...
I like seeing you together.

117
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,400
You just... You look so natural.

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
But we're not together.

119
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,160
Well, sure you are.
I'm looking right at you.

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,120
Let's spend the night in the driveway
looking at the kids.

121
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,680
That's what I wanna do.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,680
Oh, hang on one sec.
Oh, hey, Donna?

123
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,360
Why don't you make like a circle
and go round, okay?

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,320
That's right. Like a circle.

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
Slide over or I'll hit you in the head.

126
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,040
All right.

127
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,160
- You got yelled at.
- Shut up.

128
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Oh, okay, this is us.

129
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
See? This is great.

130
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,960
Being out together,
not on a date, just friends.

131
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,920
I feel, like, virtually nothing for you.

132
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,840
Me too. Here. Let's have a seat.

133
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,040
Here you go.
Oh, whoops. Not a date.

134
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,960
- Eric!
- I'm sorry.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,680
Okay, uh, minor glitch.

136
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,040
Let's let the good times roll.

137
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,760
Isn't this nice?

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,640
Okay, Kitty. Enough jawin'.
Drinks are only free for the first two hours.

139
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,640
Oh, do you think
they have peach schnapps?

140
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,480
Peach is my favorite schnapp.

141
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
Hi. I'm Lyle, Housewares manager in Oshkosh.

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,520
Hi. Eric, stock boy, Point Place.

143
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,200
And this is my friend...

144
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Donna.

145
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,400
We're not on a date, even though, I mean...
even though I did pay for her.

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,760
But what can you do?
Tell me, Lyle. Are you here on a real date?

147
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,400
Uh... Hey, that's Stewie. Stewie.

148
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,880
Nice going. Scared off Lyle.

149
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
Now we'll never meet Stewie.

150
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Eric, what is wrong with you?

151
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,480
Hey, guy. Put your arm
around your date.

152
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,320
- Oh, no, she's not my date...
- Oh, just shut up and take the picture.

153
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Ta-da!

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,840
Quittin' time, chief?

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,240
No.

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,240
I devised a system
to streamline our operations.

157
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,600
From now on, all orders
will be filed alphabetically.

158
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,160
So the size of a customer's boobs?

159
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
No longer a factor.

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,840
You see, it saves time.
And time, my friend, is money.

161
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,840
But money is not time.

162
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,320
You'd think it would go both ways,
but it doesn't.

163
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Hey, Moby Dick called.
He wants his shrimp back.

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,840
It's those hilarious jokes that
I miss so much since we broke up.

165
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
So, uh...

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
should I get us some punch or...

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,120
Wait. Do you get the punch? Oh, no.

168
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,280
How do we get the punch?

169
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,400
Eric, stop it. You're being an ass.

170
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,680
Well, why don't you just,
you know, get over it?

171
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,360
I only said that because
I wanna be friends again.

172
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,640
I mean, I wish we could pretend that
we were never boyfriend and girlfriend...

173
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
and just, you know, be friends.

174
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,520
Donna, it's hard.
It's not like being friends with Hyde, okay?

175
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,200
I haven't, you know...

176
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,960
touched his fun parts...

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,880
well, on purpose.

178
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,680
- We used to have a lot fun together.
- Yeah.

179
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,480
Just like there used to be
shrimp in the world.

180
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,240
- Okay.
- Hmm.

181
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

182
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,640
When I get back, we're gonna
have a lot of fun together.

183
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,960
Hello.

185
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,800
Hi, I'm Connie.
Pet Supplies, Sheboygan.

186
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,920
You, uh, wanna dance?

187
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,080
Oh, uh...

188
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah, I'm kind of here
with someone so...

189
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,960
Okay. Well, um,
maybe I'll see you around.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,880
Okay.

191
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,880
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Okay, you hurt my arm.

192
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,040
She was a real looker.

193
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,280
And for some reason
she talked to you.

194
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,400
- Now go get her.
- What? No.

195
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
Dad, Donna's here.

196
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,720
Well, Donna's off having fun
while you're sittin' here being a big lump.

197
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Okay, first of all...

198
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,120
you are way too involved
with my life, okay?

199
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,320
And second of all, Donna's not having fun.
She's in the bathroom.

200
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
That's not the bathroom.

201
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,280
Now, go talk to that girl
before she comes to her senses...

202
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,480
and wants nothing
to do with you.

203
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,840
Oh, God. Your mother's doing shots
with Gladys from Housewares.

204
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,240
Kitty, put it down.

205
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,360
My wife left me. I don't cook.
I don't shop. I'm hungry.

206
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,040
This place scares me,
and I like Salisbury steak.

207
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,520
So you don't cook or shop,
and your idea of a nice meal...

208
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
is gristly hamburger
smothered in goo?

209
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,600
What woman could
let all that go?

210
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,720
Hey, I've got an upside.

211
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Th-There are things.

212
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,360
I know. You're a good guy...

213
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,360
a good, old-fashioned,
out-of-touch, Stone Age guy.

214
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
But, you know, there's
nothing wrong with you...

215
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,880
that changing yourself
completely couldn't fix.

216
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,040
Thank you.

217
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,200
Here. In the meantime,
have a pretzel.

218
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,320
- I can tell you haven't eaten anything.
- I am pretty hungry.

219
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,480
Oh, never shop when you're hungry...

220
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,440
'cause you'll end up at home
with 15 Salisbury steaks.

221
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,360
Give me those.

222
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
See, the problem is
I have a daughter at home.

223
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,080
I think I'm gonna
have to start feeding her.

224
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,360
I don't think I can do this.

225
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,720
Of course you can't.
Lucky for you, I'm here.

226
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,920
Now we just gotta find everything
you need to make a meat loaf.

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
Wow. You're gonna
make me a meat loaf?

228
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,320
No. You're gonna
make <i>me</i> a meat loaf.

229
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,280
Okay, but sometimes
I burn myself on the oven.

230
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,120
- I'm, uh... I'm Bob.
- Joanne.

231
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,120
Now haul ass, Bob.

232
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,360
- Oh.
- Oop. Oh, sorry. Sorry.

233
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,880
Oh, Donna. Oh, oh.
So, are you having fun at the big ball?

234
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,600
Um, yeah. You know,
at first I wasn't.

235
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,880
- Eric was being really jerky and weird.
- Uh-huh.

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,560
Well, he does that.

237
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,920
If he gets me a glass of punch,
it's not like we have to sleep together.

238
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,480
Well, it would have to be
pretty good punch.

239
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,640
They have an open bar.

240
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,120
Uh! I just wish Eric could relax.

241
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,320
Well, um, I think he can.

242
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,360
<i>Oh. Oh. Oh, good for him.</i>

243
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm... I'm glad.
He's dancing with a beautiful...

244
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,800
skank!

245
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,140
Well, I will say this
about Price Mart:

246
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,500
They have wonderful balls.

247
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,220
Red, grab that centerpiece.

248
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,940
Oh, hey. Here's another.

249
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,140
Donna, honey, grab that centerpiece.

250
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,620
Kitty, how many centerpieces do we need?

251
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,620
Red, they are center <i>pieces!</i>

252
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,140
- Okay, so don't lose my number, all right?
- All right.

253
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,420
Eric, what the hell?

254
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,780
- What?
- Why are you kissing her?

255
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,940
- You're on a date with me.
- It wasn't a date.

256
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,580
Well, it is now, you bastard!

257
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,500
Now come open my car door for me
before I kick your ass!

258
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
The Fotohut's cool.

259
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,060
Hyde, your job kicks ass.

260
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,780
Yeah. I never thought
I'd be a workingman, man.

261
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,820
But, man, here I am...

262
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,860
working for the man.

263
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,100
And you know what, man?

264
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,540
I like the man.

265
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,620
Hey, thanks, man.

266
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,900
So, my probation officer
was sure happy I came by.

267
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,540
He even wants to see me
for some additional years.

268
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,900
He's a good guy.

269
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,540
Ugly, fat, whorey, old...

270
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,340
whorey, old, four-eyes, ugly, fat.

271
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,060
Oh, this one's kinda cute.

272
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,460
I mean, for a fatty.

273
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,460
I mean, for a whore?

274
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,180
Damn, Jackie! What do you want me to say?

275
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,860
That's it. I cannot work like this.

276
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,980
Anyone who doesn't
have to be here must leave.

277
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,420
- Fez...
- I said, leave.

278
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,020
Damn, Fez. You've only
been here one day...

279
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,860
and you're already trying
to change everything.

280
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,300
Yeah. It's like we crossed into
some different dimension...

281
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,780
where we're in some kind of...

282
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,700
Fotohut.

283
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,460
It's eerie, man.

284
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,340
And then you encourage him
and what happens?

285
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,780
He ends up kissing a girl
while he's on a date with another girl.

286
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,540
Once again, an open bar spells disaster
for the Forman family.

287
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,340
Red, I am not drunk.

288
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,260
I am upset...

289
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,180
and drunk.

290
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,500
All I know is that is not the way
to behave on a date.

291
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,060
It wasn't a date.

292
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,060
Oh, please.

293
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,740
Good morning.

294
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,020
No. It was morning
when I got here, on time.

295
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,740
Now, put this on.

296
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,540
Clever, huh? Yes, very.

297
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,940
Fez...

298
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,580
Working here is about goofing off...

299
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,580
you know, creating a model of inefficiency.

300
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,500
You're ruining the Fotohut, man.

301
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,460
And if you think I'm gonna stand idly by...

302
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,420
you're right, 'cause that's what I do here.

303
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,540
Oh, Hyde, you're here early.

304
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,020
Oh, slick uniform, man.

305
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,940
Is that how you spell Fotohut?

306
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,900
Yes, but Hyde won't wear it.

307
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,740
- Something's gotta change around here, man.
- Amen.

308
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,060
I don't like what's goin' on here, man.

309
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,380
That little dude's
making us all look bad.

310
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,340
- I'm afraid the boss is gonna fire me.
- Leo, you are the boss.

311
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,700
Did you fire him yet?
I'll take his shifts.

312
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,540
Hey, dude, man.

313
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,100
I think we decided
that <i>you're</i> fired.

314
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Oh.

315
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,340
Well, that's a cold slap in the groin.

316
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,300
How am I supposed to afford
my new boots?

317
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,780
Here. Just do what I do, man.

318
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,420
Just get some money out of the register
when the boss isn't lookin'.

319
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,780
Once again, Leo, you are the boss.

320
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,900
And I'm not lookin'.

321
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,660
- Hey, kissy-face.
- Ah, well.

322
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,900
If it isn't...

323
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,500
Kooky McShrimplover,
who doesn't know how she feels.

324
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,420
Comin' over here like everything's normal
and nothin' happened last night.

325
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,060
Yep. That's my Kooky McShrimplover.

326
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,300
I know. I freaked out. I'm sorry.

327
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,820
Well, that's a first.

328
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,780
Well, this is complicated, okay?
I mean, we do wanna be friends, right?

329
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,580
Yeah. I don't wanna be nothing.

330
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,580
Okay. Well, then,
maybe some rules will help.

331
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,260
Like, when we're out on a date
that's not a date...

332
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,780
- we can't make out with slutty girls.
- Uh-huh.

333
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,900
Or that could just
be a rule for me.

334
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,540
Yeah, I mean, Donna, feel free...
No. Feel encouraged...

335
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,100
to make out with all
the slutty girls you want.

336
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,140
What is this?

337
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,540
Is this...
Kissy girl's phone number?

338
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,380
Uh-huh.

339
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,340
Okay, see ya.

340
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,240
I got it. Her phone number is 729-36.

341
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
I think there are a couple
more numbers than that.

342
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,600
Really? Oh, yeah.

343
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,640
It's 729-36...

344
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
ampersand?

345
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Maybe, but I just don't
really know how to dial that.

346
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,680
Just... Oh, yeah. That'd be hard.

347
00:20:49,305 --> 00:21:49,253

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,300
So, everyone
enjoying dinner?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,800
- [All Muttering]
- Good.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, um, I want to talk to everyone about
helping me with the church fund-raiser.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,800
Freeze.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
Okay, so-
[Laughs]

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,100
God's Magic Circle is our
church's women's auxiliary...

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,200
and I volunteered to help
organize their next fund-raiser.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,200
And bravo, I say.
Bra... vo.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,400
Now, if you'll please excuse me,
I have to attend a meeting.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,100
It's, uh- It's
very important, so-

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,400
Okay.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,600
Now, as you all know, um,
I'm stuck in a rut. [Laughs]

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,400
And, um, I'd really-

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,300
l-I just need to get out of the house
and-and experience new things.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,200
- But, Mom, I think you should-
- And I want your support...

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,400
which, by the way,
I always give you...

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Mr. "I want to be a jazz guitarist."

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,000
[Laughing]

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Eric, if your mother wants you...

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,700
and Archie and Jughead here
to help her...

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,900
then you're going to help her.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,500
- You'reJughead.
- [Scoffs] You'reJughead.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,700
- You're soJughead, it's not even debatable.
- You are so- Ow!

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Steven, stop hitting Jughead.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,900
- See?
- Hey.

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,700
This is important to her...

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,200
and we should
support her for this.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
So you guys'll help out.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Well, thank you, Red.
And you're coming too.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, no, Kitty. I, uh-
I have a meeting.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,300
With you... at church.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,500
- Nice save, Dad.
- Shut up.

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,200
Hangin'out

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,100
Down the street

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
The same old thing

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,400
We did last week

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,100
Not a thing to do

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,400
But talk to you

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
We're all all right

40
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,800
We're all all right

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
Hello, Wisconsin.!

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,100
No, see, Fez, Bazooka Joe
wanted to see time fly...

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
so Mort threw the clock
out the window.

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,500
So time flew. Get it?

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Did the clock break?

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,100
I don't know.
That's not really the point.

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,700
It's still a pretty big
waste of a clock.

48
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,500
Okay. Well, I gotta go.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
- See you later, sweetie.
- See you.

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,500
You guys
are such a cute couple.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,300
- Yeah, I know. I really like Caroline.
- Me too. She's nice.

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,800
For a psycho.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Hyde, take that back.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
[Hissing]
Psycho.

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,300
You are a gifted mime.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
But that hurts.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Hyde, Caroline's not a psycho.
You just don't get women.

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,600
We have emotions. We're ruled
by the moon and the tides.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,900
And pretty clothes.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Yeah, we should hang out with her,
you know, make her feel welcome.

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,200
Yeah, you can never have
too many friends.

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,100
Sometimes you feel like a nut;
sometimes you don't.

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,500
Hey, you guys,
you know who was crazy?

64
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,400
This camp counselor I once had who
used to make everyone do turbo sit-ups.

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,700
But he'd put a towel over your face,
and then when you went to do the sit-up-

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,000
He'd pull the towel away, and you'd
have to put your face in his butt.

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,100
Donna, you stole the funny part.

68
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,900
Well, Eric, I've heard it like eight times.

69
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, I'm sorry.
Tell the story again.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,300
I'll laugh.

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
But it'll be fake though, right?

72
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,100
Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,600
- Okay, guys, I once had this camp counselor-
- [Rumbling]

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Oh, my God, you guys.
The Petersons just got a new dog.

75
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,400
Let's go!

76
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,100
Okay, now, I have
work assignments for everyone.

77
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,500
- Red, you're selling raffle tickets.
- I'm your man.

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,900
And don't yell at the customers.

79
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm kinda your man.

80
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,700
- And smile.
- You need another man.

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Okay, Michael, Steven,
you're in charge of bingo.

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,600
And, Eric, I thought
you could run the cakewalk.

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,700
Sure. What's cakewalk?

84
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,600
It's cake and walking.

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,800
What are you, on dope?

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,100
So, uh, Pastor Dave,
what do you think?

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,900
Gosh, Kitty, I'm impressed.

88
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,700
I can't remember the last time a God's Magic
Circle fund-raiser looked so gosh darn wonderful.

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Hiya, gang.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,800
[Together]
Hi, Pastor Dave.

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Say, God's Magic Circle-That sounds
like an Eric Clapton song, doesn't it, kids?

92
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,400
[Together]
Yes, Pastor Dave.

93
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,900
Rock on, kids.

94
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,200
[Together]
Rock on, Pastor Dave.

95
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,300
["Turkey In The Straw"]

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Come on, string bean.
Will you stop the record already?

97
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,700
Hey, I'm in charge.
I'll stop it when I'm good and ready.

98
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,400
And that's not because of you.
It's just 'cause I was ready.

99
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,600
Okay, congratulations, Ed.
You win a chocolate cake.

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,300
But I'm allergic to chocolate.

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,700
Then why are you
in the cakewalk, Ed?

102
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,000
I thought this was the line
for the bathroom.

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,500
Now, don't you screw this up.
I want that marmalade cake.

104
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,600
Sure, yeah, all right, pumpkin.
I was just talking to this guy over here-

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh, just forget it. You're gonna
screw it up. You always do.

106
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,500
Just go stand over there.

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
All right, my turtle dove.
Right over here.

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,500
For the love of God,
let my wife win the cake.

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Well, it's in the hands
of the Lord now, sir.

110
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Okay, everyone, get ready
for another exciting round of cakewalk.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,400
- [Continues]
- Would you believe she was once the sweetest...

112
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,400
most beautiful girl in high school?

113
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,800
Of course she was.

114
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,300
A word of advice, kid.

115
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,200
Never marry your
high school sweetheart.

116
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
Why not?

117
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,700
Oh, that's it, Glen.
Just keep slouching.

118
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,500
- You're not mousy enough.
- That's why.

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,700
- [Laughing, Cheering]
- [Man] Hot as a Pistol.!

120
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Boy, did I take thesejerks
to the cleaners.!

121
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,700
Hey! That's a craps table.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Yep. Except here it's called "cripes."

123
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,300
Would you like to be
the next holy roller?

124
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,100
Are you kidding? Next to prayer,
craps is my favorite thing about church.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,100
Well, enjoy yourself. I gotta
go check out the Last Supper bake sale.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Free cupcakes for anyone
who doesn't deny the Lord!

127
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,900
We gotta win
the Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

128
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,800
These are the most
technologically advanced...

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,500
of all the plastic,
spring-loaded boxing robots.

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get lucky.

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,800
Or... we could cheat.

132
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,800
Kelso, man, you're willing to cheat?

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,700
Here in the house of the Lord?

134
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,400
You're coming along nicely.

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Yeah, I mean, it's not that bad.

136
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,300
Because technically
we're only in the basement of the Lord.

137
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,700
And I'll bet
he never comes down here.

138
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,800
Yeah, good point.

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,900
Plus what old lady wants
Rock'em Sock'em Robots...

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
or a box of Pop Rocks
or a SuperBall?

141
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,700
Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
they could hurt themselves.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,500
You give the elderly Pop Rocks,
and they could get all foamy and stroke out.

143
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,700
- So we're helping.
- We're helping.

Gosh, that's lucky.

- That's Donna.
- Oh, look at that. A carrot top, huh?

149
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Ah, that's great, kid.
Just great.

150
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,200
You know,
I was a lot like you-

151
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,200
a milky-white loser
with a cheap haircut...

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,300
and less muscle tone
than a canned ham.

153
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,500
Okay, first of all, Glen...

154
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm wiry, okay?

155
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
Yeah, I was dating
the hottest looking girl in the school.

- So what happened?
- I don't know really.

158
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,700
One day we just realized
that she had heard all of my stories...

and I had heard all of her stories...

and, well, that's when she stopped
being nice and started eating.

Oh, God, Donna eats.

Better watch it there, kid.
It starts small.

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,400
A few wise-ass comments, and then they're
puttin' you down in front of your friends.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Donna, you stole the funny part.

Well, Eric, I've heard it like eight times.

Um, okay, the twins.

Two people trapped in one body.
So you're like a split personality.

- Jackie, don't make me blush.

183
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,500
No, she's only asking because when she
kissed him, he did this thing with his tongue.

184
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,700
- You kissed Fez?
- Oh, my God. It was so nothing.
He had this stupid crush on me.

it feels so good to get out of the house
and do something important.

You know who else got out of the house

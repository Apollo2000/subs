1
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:05,289
Okay, here comes Kelso.

2
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:07,208
Oh, this is going to be so good.

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,761
But plug your nose, because
it's also going to be foul.

4
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:16,996
- All right, somebody put a stink bomb in my backpack!
- Oh!

5
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:20,644
And when I find out who,
I'm gonna kick some ass!

6
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:22,982
Why must people be cruel?

7
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,537
Yeah, 'cause now I gotta
go see Jackie smelling like a skunk.

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,344
And Jackie hates skunks,
except for Pep×™ le Pew.

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,060
And, you gotta admit,
for a skunk, he's pretty romantic.

10
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:43,273
Okay, guys, I've got
five stink bombs left.

11
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:45,989
Let's go ruin
someone else's day.

12
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:48,840
Sorry, guys.
I'm going to the movies with Donna.

13
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:52,483
It's like we hardly see each other, now
that she got that job at the radio station.

14
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,034
Yeah, you're the wife of
a famous radio personality.

15
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:58,561
Go bake me a pie, Martha.

16
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,416
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:04,548
Donna's on the radio.
She's doing the farm report right now.

18
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:08,392
And in pork belly news...

19
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:11,010
prices have risen to nearly
54 cents per pound.

20
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:14,246
Mmm-mmm, bacon!

21
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:18,470
Pork belly prices.
How cute is that?

22
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,669
<i>And I'll be back at 3:00, 4:00 and 5:00</i>
<i>with more updates.</i>

23
00:01:21,738 --> 00:01:24,072
Until then, keep on farmin'.

24
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:27,486
Is that okay? I just added that.
I <i>did</i> hit the button.

25
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:30,311
Oh!

26
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:34,207
She's staying late again?
Oh, God.

27
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:39,038
How much fast-breaking pork belly news
can there possibly be?

28
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:41,318
That's it.
I'm goin' down there.

29
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,137
- Well, that conversation's going to go badly.
- How do you know?

30
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:50,176
I put a stink bomb in his back pocket.

31
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:55,462
You're doin' the rest of the farm reports?
Come on.

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,384
I thought we were goin'
to the movies.

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,002
Well, Janice called in sick, so...

34
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:02,790
Why do you smell like butt?

35
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:06,338
That is none of your business, okay?

36
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,776
Okay, Donna, look.
I think we need to talk.

37
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,208
I think this job is really
cutting into your Eric time.

38
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,280
My "Eric time"?

39
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:18,087
And I'm very concerned
about your diminishing Eric time...

40
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:20,575
because it directly affects me,
you know.

41
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:24,487
I'm Eric.

42
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:27,488
Hey, thanks for
staying late again, Donna.

43
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,700
You know, you might just
turn this into a full-time gig.

44
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,544
Hey, I'm her full-time gig.

45
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:38,082
No offense.
You stink, dude.

46
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:41,187
Here's those tickets.
Enjoy the show.

47
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,024
- Tickets?
- I know I've been working a lot lately.

48
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,944
I wanted to make it up to you,
so I got Max...

49
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,213
to hook us up with Ted Nugent tickets
for everybody!

50
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:54,023
The Motor City Madman?
No way!

51
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,740
Oh, my disappointment is melting...

52
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:00,257
into a mixture of
excitement and guilt.

53
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,751
- Great. That's what I was going for.
- Oh!

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,074

55
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:42,424
As soon as I saw that skunk,
I knew...

56
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:45,308
<i>that I had to capture it</i>
<i>and return it to the zoo...</i>

57
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:49,629
where it could maybe,
just maybe...

58
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,482
fall in love like you and I.

59
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,477
- Oh! Michael, that is so sweet.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,331
That's me... sweet.

61
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:01,594
So, here we are.

62
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:07,127
What to do.
What to do.

63
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,336
Oh, I know what we can do.
It.

64
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:14,009
No, Michael,
I'm not doing "it" in a car.

65
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:16,925
Now that we're back together,
I want it to be special.

66
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,372
I want our second first time
to be magical.

67
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:23,577
I can do magic.
Check it out.

68
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,849
Hmm? Hmm?

69
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:30,968
Michael, I'm serious.

70
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,372
Jackie, I just removed a finger!

71
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:38,682
All right, how about this?

72
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:40,636
We'll have a special day...

73
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:43,898
just dedicated to all the romantic magic
you want.

74
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:47,707
That's a great idea.
But you know what would be even better?

75
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:50,588
If we did it right now?

76
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:53,436
No!
That instead of one day...

77
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,356
we have a whole week
of romantic magic.

78
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,386
Well, that would be seven times longer.

79
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,396
And seven times better.

80
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:05,244
And seven times longer.
Yea.

81
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,690
You know,
our anniversary's comin' up.

82
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,612
Eighteen years.

83
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,165
I can still remember
the first time I saw Midgie.

84
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:16,855
She was the tallest girl
in chemistry class.

85
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:20,341
And Bob was the shortest boy.

86
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:24,669
But what he lacked in height,
he made up for in shortness.

87
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:33,593
Red, um, remember when we first met?

88
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:37,013
Like it was yesterday.

89
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:44,092
<i>It was 1952 at a U.S.O. dance.</i>

90
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,059
<i>Me and my buddies</i>
<i>were blowin' off steam.</i>

91
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,416
<i>And, suddenly, I saw her.</i>

92
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,169
<i>She was the most</i>
<i>beautiful girl in the joint.</i>

93
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:07,060
Hiya, dame.
Wanna shake a leg?

94
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,621
No, thanks.

95
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:12,660
- It wasn't a question.
- I think it was, mister.

96
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,805
Mind if I cut in?

97
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:16,699
It's none of your business,
bell-bottom.

98
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:19,482
I think you could use
a little punch, leatherneck.

99
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:28,636
Oh, you're in big trouble,
Red Forman.

100
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,963
Huh?

101
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:34,931
I said, you're in big trouble,
Red Forman.

102
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,558
You're thinking of some other girl.

103
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,516
That's not how we met at all.

104
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:42,876
Oh.

105
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:44,796
Oh!

106
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,404
Uh-oh.

107
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,276
Fez, what's in the box?

108
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:55,708
Counterfeit concert T-shirts.

109
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:57,627
Me and Hyde are going to
sell them after the show.

110
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:01,052
Oh, how entrepreneurial of you.

111
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:04,314
You see, I figure with the original
concert T's going for $15...

112
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:07,993
we sell ours for 10,
I turn a $50 investment into 250 bucks.

113
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,752
Where'd you get 50 bucks?
I thought you were broke.

114
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:12,985
I sneaked it from
your Candy Land stash.

115
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,474
So if you think about it,
it's all profit.

116
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:19,735
Okay, fine.
Can I borrow $50?

117
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,957
Hey, you wanna see what
50 stolen bucks can buy?

118
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:30,940
Fez! It's "Ted" Nugent!

119
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:33,460
Uh-huh.
Tad Nugent.

120
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,216
No, man.
I'm saying "Ted."

121
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:38,652
I'm saying Tad too.

122
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:41,051
- No, you're not. It says "Tad."
- I know it says "Tad."

123
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:43,157
I'm the one who put it on there.

124
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,084
I don't know why we're fighting.
What's the problem here?

125
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,516
Because the shirt says "Tad."

126
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,556
Exactly.

127
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,425
- But the "A" should be an "E."
- That's not how you spell "Tad."

128
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,923
No.
That's how you spell "Ted."

129
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:00,247
Oh.

130
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:04,757
These shirts are useless.
Now Forman's out 50 bucks.

131
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:25,042
You know, it's hard enough trying to
remember this without you two staring at me.

132
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:27,506
Hey, I could hypnotize you.

133
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:30,548
I know!
You could retrace your steps.

134
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,508
What did you have for breakfast?

135
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:38,805
Oh, hi, Kitty.
Uh, you know...

136
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:42,423
I was just thinking
about how much I love you.

137
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:47,282
- So, you remember yet?
- Yes! No.

138
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:52,439
It was November 17, 1953
at a U.S.O. dance.

139
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:57,179
I remember because it was the most
important moment of <i>my</i> life!

140
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,278
Really, Kitty?

141
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:03,927
Because in November 1953...

142
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:06,779
I was in Korea.

143
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:10,456
So I'm pretty sure that
you were talking to someone else.

144
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,350
Are you sure?

145
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,236
Maybe-Maybe you came home
for the weekend.

146
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,717
Not from Korea.

147
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:24,690
Oh, great. Now,
neither one of us knows how we met.

148
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:29,621
Well, you better get
your thinking cap on, mister.

149
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:40,019
<i>Thank you, Wisconsin! Good night!</i>

150
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:44,184
- That was the coolest, most bitchin' concert!
- That was so cool!

151
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:46,108
- Totally!
- That was cool.

152
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,540
All right, let's go try and sell
these stupid T-shirts.

153
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:51,900
God, Michael,
this was the most magical night.

154
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:55,707
You know, during the concert, I rewrote some
of Ted Nugent's songs with your name in it.

155
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,140
Okay, which one do you like better...

156
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:03,835
"Cat Scratch Jackie"
or "Jackie Scratch Fever"?

157
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:06,006
I love them both!

158
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:09,971
- What do you wanna do now?
- Uh...

159
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:13,656
Ooh! We can go around back and watch the
tour buses from behind the chain-link fence.

160
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:17,206
- Great idea!
- Hiya, kids. Enjoy the show?

161
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:20,822
Are you kidding?
I'm deaf!

162
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:25,140
You can say that again, Max.

163
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:28,213
Well, you know,
I'm startin' to come down.

164
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:31,448
I mean, I'm getting tired.

165
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:33,883
Uh, why don't you take this?

166
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,982
Oh, my God.
A backstage pass.

167
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:42,519
Oh, yeah!
Oh, too bad there's only one, huh?

168
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,858
I'll be back in five minutes, I swear.

169
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:48,241
- You're going?
- Well, don't you want me to?

170
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:51,732
Of course I do.

171
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:55,285
That's why I said,
"Oh, you're going! Yea!"

172
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:56,950
You're the best!

173
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:04,788
Yeah, that's... Yeah, that's good.
That's nice for her.

174
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:09,237
You'll never see her again.

175
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:12,342
That's how I lost my first wife.

176
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,096
Damn you, Donny Osmond!

177
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,976
T-shirts!

178
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,830
Get your crappy, misspelled T-shirts!

179
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:32,014
Can't enjoy the after-party without
your crappy, misspelled T-shirts!

180
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:36,839
I rue the day I took you
under my wing, my foreign friend.

181
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,985
I'm sorry you feel that way, Hyde...

182
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,227
but I think that the time
we spended together...

183
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:44,363
has taught us each
a little bit about tolerance...

184
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:47,280
humanity, friendship.

185
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:49,199
Whatever.

186
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,399
Ew! Michael,
someone blew chunks.

187
00:11:56,848 --> 00:12:00,426
May I escort you
across the vomit, my lady?

188
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:02,885
Why, thank you, good sir.

189
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:09,003
I hate them.

190
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:12,585
You just bought yourself
a barfy Todd Nugent T-shirt, mister!

191
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:16,525
Fez.

192
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:19,243
It's Ted!

193
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,101
Hey, who ordered the redhead?

194
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:33,384
Oh, my God.
You're looking at me.

195
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:35,496
Ted Nugent is looking at me.

196
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,471
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Stop looking at me!</i>

197
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:41,294
I'm Donna.
I am, like, your biggest fan.

198
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,248
Hi, Donna.
Meet the other groupies.

199
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,167
<i>This is Blonde Girl,</i>
<i>the Other Blonde Girl...</i>

200
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,915
Tall Girl,
and the Tall Blonde Girl.

201
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,839
Well, actually, I'm not a groupie.

202
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:52,490
I mean, I love you,
but I work at a rock radio station.

203
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,309
WFPP, "The Sound."
I do the farm report.

204
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:58,443
It's, like, a huge day
for pork bellies.

205
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,367
You don't care.
Sorry.

206
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,978
You work for a radio station?
You wanna do an interview or somethin'?

207
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:07,082
Oh, my God.
An interview would be amazing.

208
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,487
Do you have, um,
a piece of paper, one of those, uh...

209
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,625
Pens.

210
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:14,795
Pens. Exactly.
You are the best.

211
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,719
Okay, first question.

212
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:19,916
Um... Uh... Oh, my God.
Why are you so great?

213
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,865
Hey, guys, have you seen Donna?

214
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,725
Look, Forman, no offense.

215
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,858
We got more important things
to worry about here.

216
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:34,277
Right.
Good luck in jail, guys.

217
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,695
You know, I had
a dream like this once.

218
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,477
Only I was handcuffed
to Cheryl Tiegs...

219
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:45,064
and you weren't wearing
your sunglasses.

220
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:58,379
It's not just tonight, you know.

221
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,197
Yeah, she's been blowing me off
more and more.

222
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:04,428
And she thinks I'll take it,
but I won't. Uh-uh.

223
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:10,127
Can you lift your feet, please?

224
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:14,377
Sorry.

225
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,587
And I'm not listenin'
to your little story...

226
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,511
so you really need
to stop talkin' to yourself.

227
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,055
What is wrong with you people?

228
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,732
Come on! That was great!
What, are you on dope?

229
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:56,937
Oh.

230
00:14:57,008 --> 00:15:00,902
Well, uh, I better go.
My boyfriend's waiting.

231
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:03,365
Thank you so much
for the interview, Ted.

232
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,255
You're very welcome. You wanna stick around?
I'll let you touch the guitar.

233
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,077
Really?
All right!

234
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:13,094
Wait, you mean
your <i>guitar</i> guitar, right?

235
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:14,826
Yeah.

236
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:18,441
All right!
Ooh!

237
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,034
Michael, I have to say, this has
really been a magically romantic day.

238
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:28,104
Actually, it's after midnight.

239
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:32,398
So it is now officially day two...

240
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,076
of magical romance week.

241
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:41,159
- Ta-da!
- Oh, Michael!

242
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:47,086
And I've got some great stuff
planned for the rest of the week.

243
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:50,632
We're gonna have a picnic,
and I'm gonna cook for you.

244
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:53,966
Oh, and we're gonna go
for a ride on a rickshaw.

245
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,502
You know what? You are
the most romantic man in Point Place.

246
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:06,951
Yep.

247
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,701
You know, at first,
I thought this was gonna suck.

248
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:13,157
But now I've really gotten into it...

249
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:15,567
and I'm glad that we're waiting
seven days to do it.

250
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:18,479
God, Michael,
you really have changed.

251
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,806
You're so different.

252
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:25,582
And we're different.

253
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:28,463
Okay, let's do it.
Now!

254
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:31,430
Whoa. I-I thought you didn't
wanna do it in a car.

255
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:33,675
No, Michael, you're so irresistible,
I can't wait.

256
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,599
What about the rest of the week?

257
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:39,788
I mean, I rented a tux
and patent leather shoes!

258
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,867
Okay, you guys, come on.
Open up. I've had a really bad night.

259
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:49,067
We need the car, Eric.

260
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,591
We're gonna do it,
and it's gonna be magical.

261
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:01,770
Oh, Red, it's killing me
that I can't remember.

262
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,695
Huh?

263
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,542
Oh, yeah, yeah, me too.

264
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,877
But I'll tell you
one thing I remember.

265
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,457
I remember that
you loved Manhattans.

266
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:14,600
Oh, that's right.

267
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:17,290
That's what I used to drink.

268
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,557
Oh, I haven't had
a Manhattan in 20 years.

269
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:35,270
Oh, boy, that takes me back.
Oh!

270
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,491
Oh!

271
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,706
Keep 'em coming.
Oh, my. I'm as loose as a goose.

272
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,318
Okay, let's do it.

273
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:58,603
Upsy-daisy.
I need to use the ladies'...

274
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:05,645
- You all right?
- I bumped into your butt and fell down!

275
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:08,746
Sorry. My pants were, uh...

276
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:12,394
Hi. I'm Red Forman.

277
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,668
How do you do, Red Forman?

278
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,591
I'm Kitty Sigurdson.

279
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,680
You bumped into my butt
and fell down?

280
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,174
And that's how we met?

281
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:28,938
I'm afraid so.

282
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:32,713
Well, what do you say
if Eric ever asks...

283
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:35,784
we go with the
"I punched out a marine" story?

284
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:39,151
And I wasn't drinking.
I was reading to the blind.

285
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,103
Sounds good.

286
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,228
Oh, my God, Eric.
I have so much to tell you.

287
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:51,600
I actually met Ted Nugent,
and I got an interview.

288
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:56,268
And I know I said I'd be right back, but...
It was so exciting!

289
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,151
Oh.
Yeah, my night too.

290
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:03,210
I met the janitor.

291
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,629
And then, I got to see Kelso
take his pants off.

292
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:08,776
Rock and roll!

293
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:13,354
Eric, you're mad at me for going backstage
to meet Ted Nugent?

294
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:16,904
No, no. I'm mad at you
because you ditched me.

295
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:19,180
I didn't ditch you.

296
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:22,663
This was Ted Nugent.
This was a huge opportunity for me.

297
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:25,932
So, come Monday, I don't have
to just talk about the farm report.

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,895
I can talk about the interview,
like... an interviewer.

299
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,335
Well, you know what, Donna?

300
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,848
All I can say is that my mom never
would have bailed on my dad like that.

301
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,116
Yeah, I know.
But they're married.

302
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:42,763
Okay.

303
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,686
Okay, forget it.

304
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,967
Let's just forget it.

305
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:55,658
You're sorry.
Everything's fine.

306
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:58,959
I never said I was sorry.

307
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:02,188
But... you are, right?

308
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,939
I shouldn't have to be.

309
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:08,804
We are free!
At last, we are free!

310
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,655
Yeah. They tried to charge us
with selling counterfeit merchandise.

311
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,607
But since Ted Nugent was misspelled,
it wasn't really counterfeit.

312
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,526
It was just stupid.

313
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,019
My ignorance of American youth culture
finally paid off.

314
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,030
Hey, Donna, did you get
to meet the Nuge?

315
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:28,487
Yeah, it was awesome.
I was right there with Ted Nugent.

316
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,374
The Nuge!

317
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,479
So, can we go now?

318
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:37,829
Excuse me!
You're ruining the magic!

319
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:52,046
You going to a clown funeral?

320
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,327
Shut up!
I'm romantic.

321
00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:01,255
- Nice rental, Kelso.
- Joke's on you. I bought it.

322
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,335
Yeah, that's right.
It's mine.

323
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:05,928
Well, I think
you look handsome, Michael.

324
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:10,506
Thank you, Jackie.
Hey, Fez, you ever pull a rickshaw?

325
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:12,234
What's a rickshaw?

326
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,638
Come on. It's fun.

327
00:21:15,305 --> 00:22:15,661

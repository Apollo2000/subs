1
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:10,441
- Oh!
- Oh! That's 16 for me and Hyde...

2
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:13,257
and four for the losers!

3
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:16,422
You guys ought to get a mascot...
a big, green, furry loser!

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,409
That's...
That's not even a thing.

5
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:25,445
Come on. Take it to the hoop. Or maybe you're
afraid, 'cause you know I'm gonna slap it down.

6
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:28,898
Oh, yeah? Well... Yeah?

7
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:31,142
You tell her, Eric!

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,241
Ooh!

9
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:38,699
Oh! How can he stand
the embarrassment?

10
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:43,050
She told you what she was gonna do.
You gotta listen, man.

11
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:49,825
Eric, why don't you just give me the two
points? Save yourself the humiliation.

12
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,445
Well, why don't you just save yourself
the two points, and then the humiliation...

13
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:55,425
will... be...

14
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,667
J... Whatever! Come on!

15
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:01,481
Oh, I'm comin', and there's nothin'
you can do to stop me.

16
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,772
Eric!

17
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,601
Oh, my God!
Donna's wearing granny panties!

18
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,969
Nice panties, Granny!

19
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:23,783
Oh, come on. You have to admit,
that was some killer "D."

20
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,884
Oh, no.

22
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:05,752
Okay, Fez, I got you some
Valentine conversation hearts.

23
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:08,283
Oh, thank you, Caroline.

24
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:12,830
"Be mine." Okay.

25
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,594
"Sweetheart." It really is.

26
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:23,610
"Kiss me."
Well, I'm not about to argue with candy.

27
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:29,728
<i>Fez, is there one in there that says,
"Get a room"?</i>

28
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,355
No, but here's one that says,
"Kiss my brown ass."

29
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,411
Sorry you had to hear that,
Caroline.

30
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:43,298
It's okay. She asked for it.

31
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,047
Ooh, I gotta get going.

32
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:48,603
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,568
Well, well, well.

34
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:55,032
Look who has a lady.

35
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:59,297
And to think, I was about
to settle for you.

36
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,616
Talk about dodging a bullet.

37
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,376
Hey, hey.

38
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,655
Check out this article in <i>Boys' Life.</i>

39
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,927
"The Square Knot:
Not Just For Squares"?

40
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:16,126
No, this one,
about being an astronaut.

41
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,945
I think I'm gonna do that.

42
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:21,881
Michael, I think there's a prerequisite
for being an astronaut.

43
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,028
You have to be not dumb.

44
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,520
Uh-uh.

45
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:31,002
If they can send a monkey into space,
they can send me.

46
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,369
I don't know.
Monkeys are pretty smart.

47
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:36,508
All right. Fine, fine. Make fun.

48
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,580
But when you see my shoe prints on the
moon, what are you gonna say then?

49
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,947
Probably, "Hey, some monkey's
wearing Kelso's shoes!"

50
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:45,913
Hey, hey, astro-chimp.

51
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:48,769
When you come back down to Earth,
if your parachute doesn't work...

52
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:51,770
you could always use
Donna's monstrous panties.

53
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:55,618
Hey, hey, hey, you guys.
None of that when Donna gets here, okay?

54
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,017
I don't need her mad at me
on Valentine's Day.

55
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,058
All right, Forman, relax.

56
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,553
Wearing granny panties
is a very sensitive issue...

57
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:05,923
that I don't find funny,
and I refuse to exploit.

58
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:07,994
Good.

59
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,386
Hey, everybody, look.
It's Granny Panties!

60
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,721
- Hyde!
- Wha... Oh, sorry, man.

61
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,827
It's in my nature to burn.

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,794
Granny Panties understands.
Don't you, Granny Panties?

63
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:25,275
Okay, look. I didn't have anything
else to wear. It was laundry day.

64
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:28,413
I didn't know they made a washing machine
big enough for those panties.

65
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:32,444
Hey! Hey, you guys can
all just shut up, okay?

66
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:35,831
So she wears big panties.
So what?

67
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:41,122
Donna, look, I am...
really, really, really sorry.

68
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:43,773
Eric, I'm fine.
Let's just forget about it.

69
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:48,993
Really? 'Cause when I saw your sweats
around your ankles, I thought I was dead.

70
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,507
- Eric, I said, I'm fine.
- Oh, my God.

71
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:55,775
Oh, my God. You are so cool.

72
00:04:55,843 --> 00:05:00,251
- You... I... You are seriously, like, the coolest girl ever.
- Wow.

73
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:02,811
Chicks must really dig astronauts,
'cause it says here...

74
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:05,338
that astronauts get
all the Tang they want.

75
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:17,021
Oh, Donna is gonna love
you making dinner for her.

76
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,906
There's nothing sexier
than a man who cooks.

77
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:23,549
Unless that man is Burt Reynolds.
Then I don't give a darn what he's doing.

78
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:25,888
He's just sexy!

79
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,345
Ooh-hoo, Mom has a thing for the Bandit.

80
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,648
Ten-four. Go set the table.

81
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:40,351
Oh, no, no, honey,
use the special china.

82
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,681
You don't want to mess up a good thing
with everyday dishes.

83
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:47,043
Okay, but, Mom, it's not like
I <i>can</i> mess this up.

84
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:49,441
I mean, Donna is cool
no matter what I do.

85
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:52,824
Like, earlier, I pulled down her pants
in front of everyone in the driveway...

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,834
- and she just stood there...
- You did what?

87
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:59,704
No, it was cool.
She just... She said she was fine.

88
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:07,897
- Oh. Then I guess she's fine.
- Yeah, 'cause she said she was fine.

89
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,746
Yeah, she wouldn't say she was fine
unless she was fine. Would she?

90
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,455
- What are you talking about?
- What do you think I'm talking about?

91
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,760
I don't know.
Why are you doing this to me?

92
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,194
- Doing what?
- I don't know!

93
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,569
- Well, all I meant was, have a happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh.

94
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:28,698
Oh, okay. Thanks.

95
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,212
Although I doubt you will.

96
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,192
Stop it!

97
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,297
Hello, Michael.

98
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:45,371
Hi, Mrs. Forman. Is Laurie home?
I got a little surprise for her.

99
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:50,975
Oh, you brought her flowers.
Isn't that just... a waste of money.

100
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,953
No...

101
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,969
she deserves them.

102
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:58,175
I mean, not many people get me, you know?
I'm a complicated guy.

103
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,414
So when everyone
starts in on me...

104
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:03,582
I just like to be with my girlfriend,
'cause she's nice to me.

105
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,049
- Who are we talking about?
- Laurie.

106
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,669
- Laurie Forman?
- Yeah, so I just want to tell her...

107
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:16,667
that I'm happy we're together on this,
our nation's day of love.

108
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:20,994
Oh, well, how patriotic of you, Michael.

109
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:24,507
Yeah. I wanna be an astronaut.

110
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:31,647
Oh. Well, I...
I think you'd make a fine spaceman.

111
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:35,361
Thanks.

112
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:42,621
You know, I gotta say, I think Laurie gets
a lot of her sweetness from you.

113
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:45,657
Laurie Forman?

114
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:56,473
Bye, Laurie.

115
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:59,481
Hey, man, what the hell
are you doing?

116
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,857
What? Oh, yeah.

117
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:05,272
I should, uh, probably go out
through the window.

118
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,777
Oh, would you look at this?

119
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,721
Ooh, a nice, romantic dinner for two.
Donna's gonna love it.

120
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:24,217
Why, is she bringing a date?

121
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:28,447
- Red!
- I'm sorry, but that's funny.

122
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,500
- Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Forman.
- Oh, my.

123
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:37,183
Look at this vision of lovely.

124
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,986
Oh, this is just like when you two were little,
and you... you used to eat pretend supper.

125
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:46,841
Only now it won't end up with
Donna sitting on Eric's head.

126
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,449
Oh.

127
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,419
Oh, Red, let's go.

128
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:59,103
- Kitty, that was just awful.
- I know. Keep walking.

129
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:03,584
Wow, I was... afraid that
was gonna be awkward.

130
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:07,263
Yeah. Eric, this looks so great.

131
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:10,626
Yep. Shaked, baked and maked
especially for you.

132
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:15,393
And this here is a little somethin'
I like to call... "a little somethin'."

133
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,045
You got me a present?
That's so sweet.

134
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:22,458
I didn't get you anything,
and you got me... panties?

135
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,441
What the hell?

136
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:27,362
Yeah, panties!

137
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,384
- Get it?
- No.

138
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,466
To replace your ugly ones.

139
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,533
Eric, when I said I didn't get it,
I meant I didn't like it.

140
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:41,435
No, see,
you forgave me earlier...

141
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:47,071
and... I figured if I brought it up,
we could just, you know, share a laugh.

142
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:53,882
Your turn.

143
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,857
You know what?
You're the one who doesn't get it.

144
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,339
- Well, maybe you should explain it to me.
- <i>I heard that!</i>

145
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:09,985
This is the worst
Valentine's Day ever.

146
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,909
It's Donna's fault. Okay?

147
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,118
I didn't make her wear
that big, goofy underwear.

148
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:20,576
I'm sorry, but if you're
hanging out with this crowd...

149
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:23,269
you gotta know that eventually
your pants are gettin' pulled down.

150
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,728
Am I right?

151
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:29,599
I am so glad I did not pull down
Caroline's pants.

152
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:32,392
I mean, if she asked me to,
I would...

153
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,532
because I respect her wishes.

154
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,435
And, also, I am so horny.

155
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,780
Forman, when I told you it'd
be funny to give Donna panties...

156
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,698
I meant it'd be funny to me.

157
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:48,673
And it was.

158
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:52,041
This is what happened
to my heart...

159
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:54,595
when I found out Laurie
was cheating on me.

160
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,369
It's lemon.

161
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:06,090
I mean, how could she do this?

162
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:08,010
I really thought
we had somethin'.

163
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,655
Probably the same way
you did it to Jackie.

164
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:14,473
Only this time it's even funnier,
'cause it's you.

165
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,506
This is a good day.

166
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,802
Tonight, I am going to ask Caroline
to go steady with me...

167
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:25,762
because that is the last step
before you can do it, right?

168
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:28,071
Oh, how I want to do it.

169
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:33,794
I am so horny.

170
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:38,242
So Michael cheated on me with Laurie,
and Laurie cheated on him.

171
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:42,177
Hmm! There is a God,
and he's on my side.

172
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,382
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
My boyfriend's a giant baby.

173
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:49,029
"Ooh, underwear is so funny.
Poo-poo, pee-pee, caca."

174
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:53,383
You know what'll
make you feel better?

175
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,688
Let's go make mean jokes
at Michael's expense.

176
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:57,860
How will that
make me feel better?

177
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:01,160
'Cause then I'll feel better,
and I can cheer you up.

178
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:05,450
On what planet did Eric think it was okay
to pull down my pants?

179
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:10,632
There are some things that are private, Jackie...
for instance, everything under my pants.

180
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:13,317
I agree. Keep it to yourself.

181
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:17,478
Why doesn't Eric understand that when I said,
"I'm fine," I meant, I will <i>be</i> fine...

182
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:22,762
so long as he kisses my ass
for two weeks until I'm actually fine?

183
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,965
He's, like, brain damaged.

184
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,930
Look, he's just not
a good boyfriend.

185
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:33,378
You should dump him, and then we
can move to Dallas and be weathergirls.

186
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:39,526
- So, how was your night?
- He blew it.

187
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,618
Well, what a surprise.

188
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:47,912
- Wait, you're saying that like it's <i>not</i> a surprise.
- Okay then.

189
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:55,016
You know, Son,
there's a time and a place...

190
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,472
to pull down a lady's pants.

191
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,912
And a pickup game in our driveway
is not one of 'em.

192
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:05,059
Look, Dad, I know it was dumb...

193
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:09,888
but Donna said it was fine,
and... apparently it wasn't fine.

194
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:14,948
Sit down. Eric...

195
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:18,117
there's a pair of shoes up
in your mom's closet.

196
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:21,602
And one day, I accidently stepped on
one of them and scuffed it.

197
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,123
"Don't worry," your mom said.
"Everything's fine."

198
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:28,456
But every now and then,
she takes them out of the closet...

199
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:31,370
and she puts them on,
and she does this.

200
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:35,168
"Ohh."

201
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,879
Then she takes them off
and puts them back in her closet.

202
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:44,768
Eric, this has been going on
for 14 years.

203
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,963
So why doesn't she
just get new shoes?

204
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,056
Oh, Eric...

205
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,781
you are so young.

206
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,054
You see, women are...

207
00:13:58,122 --> 00:14:01,319
What's the word I'm looking for here?
Crazy.

208
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:06,785
Oh. So, overall,
you and Mom are okay.

209
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,225
So Donna and me,
we'll be okay, right?

210
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,251
No. I scuffed your mom's shoe.

211
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:17,119
I didn't pull her pants down
in front of God and the foreign kid.

212
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:19,977
So, what are you saying?
I'm screwed with Donna?

213
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,654
Hey, if it makes you
feel any better...

214
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:26,762
I'm surprised you lasted
this long.

215
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:46,503
- I like popcorn. Do you like popcorn?
- Yes.

216
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:51,076
- I like candy. Do you like candy?
- Yes.

217
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:54,081
I like soda. Would you like
to go steady with me?

218
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:57,569
- Oh, yes, Fez!
- I think I might have tricked you.

219
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:01,222
You do know we <i>are</i>
going steady, right?

220
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,711
Yes!

221
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,917
- What a magical night.
- Yes.

222
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:09,538
I dreamed of this
since the moment we met.

223
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,682
Me too.

224
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,853
You know, this is my favorite movie of
all time. I've seen it, like, 16 times.

225
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:22,948
That woman keeps calling Clint Eastwood
and asking him to play "Misty" for her.

226
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,927
Isn't it romantic?

227
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:32,840
Romantic? But she is following him
and bothering him and threatening him.

228
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:36,931
Yeah, that's what I mean.
If she can't have him, nobody can.

229
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,021
Okay then.

230
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,702
Oh, you're so cute.
I love being your girlfriend.

231
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,348
If you ever left me, I'd kill you.

232
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,299
O... Okay then.

233
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:10,018
What's up with
Eric's head anyway?

234
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:14,050
It's completely out of proportion
to that skinny body.

235
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,194
He looks like a Blow Pop.

236
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:24,543
You know, I bet Michael's gonna
want me to feel sorry for him.

237
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,367
But I'm gonna be all, like...

238
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:31,296
"Aww. Bite it, Casanova!"

239
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:37,412
- Hey, Jackie, Donna.
- Hey, Michael. I heard what happened.

240
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:42,664
- Yeah. Me and Laurie are done.
- Doesn't Eric look like a Blow Pop?

241
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:46,112
- Uh, yeah, I guess.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

242
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:50,692
Uh, listen, uh, Jackie,
can we go somewhere and talk?

243
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:55,017
No! Look, anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Donna.

244
00:16:57,962 --> 00:17:00,329
Well, okay.

245
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,979
Uh, listen...

246
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:05,766
what happened with me
and Laurie got me thinking.

247
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,576
And what she did
was really a betrayal...

248
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,195
and it hurt so much.

249
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:15,332
So you want me
to feel sorry for you.

250
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,751
- No, don't feel sorry for me.
- Wait, what?

251
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:21,640
No, I deserve this.
After what I did to you?

252
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:25,383
I don't know if you've made the connection,
but there are a lot of similarities...

253
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,344
between what Laurie did to me
and what I did to you.

254
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:33,029
Except... you and I
were really in love...

255
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,903
and you trusted me.

256
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:40,390
Jackie, I let you down,
and I'm sorry.

257
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:45,957
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you just saying
this stuff so I'll give you Valentine sex?

258
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,767
'Cause this is a holy day,
Michael...

259
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,354
and you should be
ashamed of yourself.

260
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:54,531
No.

261
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:57,918
I just said what
I wanted to say, and...

262
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,289
I don't blame you if you never
want to speak to me again.

263
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,933
That's it. Good-bye.

264
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:12,895
Jackie, are you okay?

265
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:17,028
Sure. Great.

266
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:21,855
I'm just... sitting here alone
on Valentine's Day.

267
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:26,119
- Hey, I'm here.
- Yeah, why are you here?

268
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:28,226
You should be with
the one you love.

269
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:30,240
And you love Eric...

270
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:32,932
for some reason.

271
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:36,035
Shut up.
There's a lot of reasons.

272
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:39,751
He's not a Blow Pop.

273
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,727
He's a sweetie pie.

274
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,444
Then you should be with him.

275
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:49,888
Look, take it from someone
who has loved and lost.

276
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:54,696
Whatever he did isn't worth
being alone on this holiest of days.

277
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,681
Jackie, are you actually thinking
about me instead of yourself?

278
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:04,328
Yeah! God, I've had
<i>way</i> too much sugar!

279
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:11,682
Look, Eric, we need to talk.

280
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:14,175
Before, I told you everything was fine
when it wasn't.

281
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,039
So, I'm sorry for not letting you know what
a colossally insensitive bonehead you are.

282
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,135
Oh, apology accepted.

283
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,097
That's... very big of you.

284
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,079
No, I'm serious.

285
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:32,390
So from now on
when you piss me off...

286
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:36,069
I will do you the courtesy
of blowing up in your face.

287
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:39,617
Oh, Donna, that's all I ask.

288
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:43,268
And as for my part, I've realized that
somewhere along the way we crossed a line...

289
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:47,396
where... pulling down your pants in public
is really no longer that funny.

290
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,604
And I suppose
that point came when...

291
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:54,409
- you started letting me pull them down in private.
- Exactly.

292
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:57,157
So...

293
00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:59,135
are we good?

294
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,271
Yeah. No.

295
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:06,208
- Are we good now?
- Gettin' there.

296
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:14,278
- Just... Come on. Let me put my pants on.
- Nope.

297
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:18,568
But... it's really cold. And...

298
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:22,430
You know, I'm freezing off parts of my body
that I know you've expressed appreciation for.

299
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:30,277
Eric, for God's sakes,
no one wants to see that.

300
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:34,368
Yeah, now we're good.

301
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:00,498
Ohh.

302
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,734
- Something wrong, honey?
- No.

303
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:06,191

1
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,271
Hey. What are you guys up to?

2
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:07,198
We're spending the weekend
at a hotel.

3
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:10,613
What, car sex isn't
good enough anymore?

4
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:12,542
I would love car sex.

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,501
Or just sex.

6
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:20,277
Or just a car.

7
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,123
I have to get out of town.
Ever since my dad lost the store...

8
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:27,803
he just shuffles around
in a not-completely-closed bathrobe.

9
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,846
It's really depressing.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,473
"The Wisconsin Dells'
most romantic hideaway.

11
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:35,359
Hunters and truckers
always welcome."

12
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,091
- That's nice.
- Sounds awesome. I'm gonna go pack.

13
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:46,552
You guys. The weirdest thing
just happened with Pam Macy.

14
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:49,787
Kelso, man, she'll do that
with any guy standing in front of her.

15
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,553
Okay. So, I'm making out
with Pam in the orchestra pit...

16
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:57,973
and everything is progressin'
like normal until...

17
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,693
- What?
- You know...

18
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,069
the really, really bad thing that can
happen to guys when they're with girls.

19
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:10,968
Oh, did Mr. Cooper come in
to buff the floor?

20
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:18,843
No.

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,951
Okay.

22
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:22,878
Let me put it this way.

23
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:26,042
The buffer wouldn't buff.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,564
Poor Mr. Cooper.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,062
No, Fez. I think
what he's tryin' to say is...

26
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:38,037
the rabbit wouldn't
come out of the hat.

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,502
The weasel wouldn't pop.

28
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,771
The alphabet soup
never spelled "go."

29
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:47,359
Okay! All right! Enough!

30
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:49,758
Actually, not quite.
There are a lot of Amish people...

31
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,678
but they never raised a barn.

32
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,365
Forman, man, that was awesome.

33
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:01,279
Hey. It just came to me.

34
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:04,442
Oh, I get it.
The barn is Kelso's pants.

35
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:08,922
Okay! You guys, this is not funny!

36
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:12,439
- This is, like, a nightmare.
- Yes. Eric, stop teasing.

37
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,472
Kelso, I want you to know
that I feel bad for you...

38
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:19,543
and that I am sorry...
you are not a man!

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,074

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,015
So, looks like I'm gonna spend the
weekend with Kelso... tutor him in math.

41
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:14,057
Really.

42
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,982
Hmm.

43
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:21,417
So, you're allegedly
tutoring Kelso in math.

44
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:26,053
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Are you good in math?

45
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,414
What's the square root of "x"?

46
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:33,672
- <i>Um, I really can't answer that.</i>
- Aha!

47
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:36,526
No. See, "x" is a variable,
so until you define its parameters...

48
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,657
the only possible answer is a variable...
or "x" if you prefer.

49
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,096
Is that right?

50
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,949
Sounds good.

51
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:50,317
- Will Michael's parents be home?
- <i>Yes.</i>

52
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:53,766
Are they as dumb as he is?

53
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,978
I can't lie. Yes.

54
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,435
Yes, they are.

55
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,024
Right answer.
That was a trick question.

56
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,832
I know they're dumb.

57
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:11,435
So, I can go?

58
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:14,951
You can go,
but I'll be watching the news.

59
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,077
And if anything is vandalized...

60
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,998
or explodes...

61
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:24,202
or catches on fire...

62
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:27,588
"x" is gonna equal me
kicking your ass.

63
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:45,068
So, anyway, Jackie's, uh,
havin' trouble in school stuff...

64
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,950
and, uh, I thought I should
stay with her this weekend...

65
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:50,437
tutor her in, you know, stuff.

66
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:55,492
- Anyone?
- I'm sorry, honey.

67
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,437
I can't concentrate when
your father's robe is open.

68
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,826
Leave me alone. I'm ventilating.

69
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,803
Okay. See ya Sunday.

70
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,878
<i>Jeannie, I'm home.</i>

71
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:19,016
Oh.

72
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:20,681
Hello, Genie Jackie.

73
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:23,621
Hello, Master Major Michael.
How was your day?

74
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:26,728
Pretty good, pretty good.
But I'm starvin'.

75
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,843
I've been on the moon all day,
and I missed lunch.

76
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,751
I can fix that.

77
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:36,392
Damn. I love havin' a genie.

78
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:38,984
- Well, let's eat.
- Okay.

79
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:43,016
Unless you're hungry for
something besides food, Master.

80
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:50,276
Actually, I'm havin' a little problem
in this department lately.

81
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,293
Not anymore.

82
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:57,802
Ho-ho! You're
the best genie ever!

83
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:13,482
Hello? Pam?

84
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:16,453
I'm back!

85
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:25,611
You know, Red, with the house
empty this weekend...

86
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:29,673
it might be a... a nice opportunity
for a little romance.

87
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:32,902
Uh-huh.

88
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:39,110
Is that, "Uh-huh,
my passion burns for you"...

89
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:42,958
or "Uh-huh, you're
as exciting as an old hat"?

90
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,786
Well, what kind of old hat?

91
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:50,855
How about a hat that's about
to be super P.O.'d?

92
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,927
Oh. Then the passion one.

93
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:59,770
Okay. I'm gonna sneak some beer
outta the fridge. You go be lookout.

94
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,897
You can count on me.

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,145
Hyde, the Formans are home.

96
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,302
- A little late, Fez.
- It's funnier this way.

97
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,676
Okay, you two, out.

98
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:37,092
Here. Here, you can each
have a Snack Pack.

99
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,525
Thank you, Mrs. Forman.

100
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:48,518
Ooh. Chocolate.

101
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,316
Okay, Kitty.

102
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:56,772
I'm gonna cook you
a romantic dinner.

103
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,756
So, you go put on
something pretty...

104
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:01,678
and I'll warm up the toaster oven.

105
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:06,499
Oh, wow. Dinner from
the toaster oven. Ha ha.

106
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:09,804
Well, whoop-de-do.
I'll put on my fancy dress.

107
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:13,166
Okay. I'm gonna work
on Plan "B."

108
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,020
Oh, I would.

109
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:22,088
This place is awesome.

110
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,278
I know. There's gotta be,
like, 17 pillows on this bed.

111
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,286
What's this?

112
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:33,034
Oh, my God.
It's a tiny fridge...

113
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:36,169
with, like, a million bottles
of tiny liquor.

114
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:40,909
And tiny cookies.

115
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:45,765
Oh, yeah? Well, in there...
tiny shampoo and tiny soap.

116
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,228
Donna, I think elves work here.

117
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:52,744
I feel so classy.

118
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,725
I'm stealing all of it.

119
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,756
Look, Pam, I'm really sorry
about what happened...

120
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,894
again.

121
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,829
I must have the flu or something.

122
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,034
Well, it's not like any flu
I've ever heard of.

123
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,470
Well, there's lots of kinds
of flu, Pam!

124
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:24,043
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,566
Oh, well, don't take it so <i>hard.</i>

126
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,548
Oops. Sorry.

127
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,802
Look, just don't
tell anybody, okay?

128
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:39,272
Oh, Flopsy, I'm not
gonna tell anybody.

129
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,253
I'm gonna tell <i>everybody.</i>

130
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,759
Eric.

131
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:52,494
Do you know that if you mix Kahl×ªa and
scotch, it tastes just like Dr. Pepper?

132
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:59,080
You're cute.

133
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,878
Okay.

134
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:09,704
I think you're cute too...
and a little drunk...

135
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:13,252
which is gonna make my job
a whole lot easier.

136
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:18,957
What's that?

137
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:23,398
- I guess the guy next door thinks we're being too loud.
- Oh, yeah?

138
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,991
What...

139
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:30,052
Oh, my God.
He just pounded right back.

140
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,956
Uh, okay. You know what?
Let's just be quiet.

141
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:35,885
But then he wins, Eric.

142
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,438
We need to get the last pound.

143
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,897
See? We won.
We're not gonna take crap.

144
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,822
We're gonna give it,
'cause we're fearless.

145
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:52,622
Oh, my God. He's at the door.

146
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:54,923
Okay, you know what?
I think I have a little fear.

147
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:58,701
So, let's just, uh, be really quiet
and pretend we're not here.

148
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,156
- And maybe he'll just think we're not here.
- Okay.

149
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,589
Will you cut it out!

150
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,642
Okay, look, just
stay in here and shush.

151
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,653
<i>Okay.</i>

152
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:20,238
- Eric!
- Dad.

153
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,054
Hey, it's Big Red.

154
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,376
Son of a bitch!

155
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,508
What the hell
are you doing here?

156
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,649
Wait. What are <i>you</i> doing here?

157
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,108
Oh, my God. Who are you with?

158
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:47,957
Your mother, you dumb-ass.

159
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,079
Okay. I'm gonna make
a deal with you.

160
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,672
I never saw you.
I don't know you're here.

161
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:56,401
Wait. So we're good?

162
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:59,056
No, no. You're gettin'
your ass kicked on Monday.

163
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,777
But for now,
you shut up and stay here.

164
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,881
If your mother sees you,
my fun time is over.

165
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:12,653
Oh, this is just awful!

166
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:16,075
Oh. No, hey, cheer up.

167
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:19,185
I've been in trouble with Red before.
It's okay.

168
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,972
No, it's not that.

169
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,657
It's just seeing your dad
reminded me of my dad.

170
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:28,043
Your dad's going away
on nice weekends and having fun...

171
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,737
and my dad's out of work and sad.

172
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,774
Plus your robe's not completely closed,
and that reminds me of him too.

173
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,226
Okay. Okay, you know what?

174
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:42,677
Let's turn that frown upside-down.

175
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:46,223
That's right. Let's have
super-hot sex, baby.

176
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:52,529
And by super-hot sex, I mean...

177
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,453
let's talk about your sad feelings.

178
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:01,940
Okay, Jackie, I have some really
terrible news about Kelso...

179
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,862
that will make us both laugh a lot.

180
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:06,742
Yeah. I already know. Pam Macy
made this big announcement in gym.

181
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:19,891
Jackie, this is where
we both laugh a lot.

182
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,598
Actually, Fez,
I don't find it that funny.

183
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:26,573
I kinda feel sad for him.

184
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:29,330
But you hate him.
He totally screwed you over.

185
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,082
Yeah, but he's grown up
a lot since then.

186
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,223
And he's suffered,
and I'm over it by now.

187
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,110
Poor Michael.

188
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,564
Poor Michael?

189
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,152
Well, I see I have wasted my time
talking to you. Good day, miss.

190
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:48,305
- Wait, Fez.
- I said good day.

191
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,341
What should we do
with all of this time alone?

192
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,716
I'll get that.

193
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:01,328
I ordered you a special surprise.

194
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,788
Ta-da!

195
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:07,725
Donna? Donna is my surprise?

196
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,654
Donna? What the... heck
are you doin' here, Donna?

197
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,493
What the heck?

198
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,283
Mrs. Forman, Eric is being a jerk,
and I wanted to talk to my mom.

199
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,587
But since she's not here,
can I talk to you?

200
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,620
<i>Eric's here too?</i>

201
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:28,753
What on earth is goin' on?

202
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:30,895
What the heck?

203
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:34,315
- Red, what is going on here?
- Oh, I'm just as surprised as you.

204
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:36,846
Oh, all right!

205
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,814
- Eric and Donna are the noisy people next door.
- And you didn't tell me?

206
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:43,342
Hello, Mommy?

207
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sad!

208
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:55,086
Donna, where have you...

209
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,581
Your mother kicked me out.

210
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,110
Oh, no.

211
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:11,573
I said no.

212
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,600
Guys, I gotta tell you somethin'.

213
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,582
I'm omnipotent.

214
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:41,584
Huh. This does taste
like Dr. Pepper.

215
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,461
Told ya.

216
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,599
Hey, you know what?
I think I might puke.

217
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,810
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

218
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,661
Honey, nobody gets sick
in Mr. And Mrs. Forman's room.

219
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,352
You know, it is a lovely room.

220
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,496
Red just saw the brochure
on the counter...

221
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,956
and then he whisked me up
and he brought me here.

222
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:05,813
It was very Humphrey Bogart.

223
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,213
Eric did the same thing for me.

224
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,767
- Sometimes he's really sweet.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

225
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,694
Do you have a bucket?

226
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,930
<i>Room service.</i>

227
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,716
Honey. Honey, pretty girls
do not throw up.

228
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:26,612
Oh, no, no. No, no.
I didn't order this.

229
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,028
Oh, uh, it was ordered by
a Mr. Red Forman.

230
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:36,110
Oh, my gosh.
This must have been his surprise.

231
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:40,013
Oh! Flowers, champagne.

232
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:41,974
Cashews.

233
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,708
The most expensive nut,
you know.

234
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,682
Oh, dear, sweet Red.
I have to go see him.

235
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:52,020
- Are you feeling better?
- No.

236
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:54,127
Okay, good. Nighty-night.

237
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:07,029
Why is everything doing that?

238
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:13,783
Hey, Michael.

239
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,952
I heard what happened with Pam.

240
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:20,016
And I want you to know, that according to
<i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine, you're not a freak.

241
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:21,614
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:24,054
They say that, lots of times
when it happens to a guy...

243
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,731
it's not that he can't, it's just that
he secretly doesn't want to.

244
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,654
Okay, well, not to criticize...

245
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,915
but <i>Cosmo's</i> never seen
Pam Macy naked.

246
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:36,114
Michael, just think about it.
Do you like Pam?

247
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,288
Well, I like parts of her.

248
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,807
Well, maybe that's not enough.

249
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:46,581
And maybe your body's mature enough
to realize that even if your brain isn't.

250
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,174
Okay, well, you know,
if this is about maturity...

251
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,287
then I want nothing
to do with it.

252
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:59,248
Look, Michael,
don't worry, okay?

253
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,424
When you find the girl
you're meant to be with...

254
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,633
you'll be able to do
all the stuff you want.

255
00:18:03,703 --> 00:18:05,808
I promise.

256
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:09,108
I hope you're right.
Thanks, Jackie.

257
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,869
- I'm back.
- What?

258
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:24,366
Nothin'. Good hug!

259
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:32,918
Out.

260
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,396
But it's my room.

261
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:39,317
Love ya, sweetie.

262
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,277
Donna.

263
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:51,026
Donna, are you there?

264
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:54,869
<i>Donna, please open the door, please.</i>

265
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,837
Great. I'm locked out
of both rooms.

266
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:07,724
Well, at least I don't have any pants.

267
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,377
I want you to open that door right now.
Our daughter's in there, and she's drunk.

268
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,709
I really shouldn't be doing this.

269
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:18,070
Okay. Then I'll just sue you...
until you're dead.

270
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,844
<i>- You get off my daughter!
- Bob! What the hell?</i>

271
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,765
<i>Red?</i>

272
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,278
<i>Ooh! Kitty, what a pretty nightgown.</i>

273
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:33,206
<i>Thank you, Midge.</i>

274
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,196
<i>Could you hand it to me, please?</i>

275
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:46,995
Look, I'm sorry about
getting all tipsy last night.

276
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:49,234
Oh, no. Please, I'm sorry.

277
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:51,823
- The fight was all my fault.
- Fight? We had a fight?

278
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:56,499
No.

279
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:59,088
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

280
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:03,349
Obviously you did something. I want to know
what it is in case I'm still mad about it.

281
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:07,317
Well, okay.

282
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:10,929
I had said that you were
the most beautiful girl in the world...

283
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:13,868
and then you got all mad
and said, "Get bent."

284
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:19,246
Not your finest hour,
but... I still love you.

285
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:23,372
Wow. You must be really
upset about this.

286
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,716
Um...

287
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:28,051
kind of, yeah.

288
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,836
Well, come on, Eric.
Let's turn that frown upside-down.

289
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:33,423
That's right.
Let's have super-hot sex, baby.

290
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,743
Oh, crap.

291
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:43,312
Well, Genie Jackie,
I am in the mood...

292
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,420
for some hot master-genie lovin'.

293
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,498
Oh, I'm sorry,
Master Major Michael.

294
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:51,440
But what we are going to have
is a warm master-genie friendship.

295
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:54,165
In fact, I am the master now,
and you are the genie.

296
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,906
Except you will not have
any genie powers.

297
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,826
You will just do as I say.

298
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:07,280
Now, do my math homework, Genie.

299
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,546
<i>No!</i>

1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,435
So if "x" equals seven,
then "y" equals...

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,467
- Two?
- Wrong. Kelso?

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,394
Uh...

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,402
"L"?

5
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:17,372
Also wrong.
It's a pretty simple equation, guys.

6
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:20,193
Just think about it
for a second.

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,707
You're so pretty.

8
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,682
You don't even need
to know math.

9
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:30,498
That's so weird.
I was just thinking the same thing.

10
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:34,754
Steven, you're so pretty
you don't need to know nothin'.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,976
That's good, 'cause I'm stupid.

12
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:41,597
Oh, real mature, guys.

13
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:50,109
- Fez, what happened?
- I was walking back from the pep rally...

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,475
flush with school spirit...

15
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:57,314
when-when-when some boys
from Fort Anderson, they jumped me...

16
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,129
and they slapped me,
and they beat me...

17
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:04,123
And look at what they did
to my pom-poms.

18
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:09,665
Hey, that's not funny, man.

19
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:11,968
It's really not.

20
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:15,297
They spray painted me on my ass.

21
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:22,850
I want revenge against those
Fort Anderson Snapping Turtles.

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,771
Look, Fez, I'll tell you what.

23
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:27,324
Let's go to the garage,
and I'll get you some paint thinner.

24
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:30,210
- Ay, no.
- I'm sorry, Fez. It has to be done.

25
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:33,571
Yeah, and the three of us
have to watch.

26
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,984
Fine. But this time, no smoking.

27
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,604
Great. Now maybe
we can get some work done.

28
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:43,643
Michael's so sweet.

29
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:45,570
Uh-oh.

30
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,643
- He's just so...
- No!

31
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:50,650
- Do you think that Michael and I...
- Don't even say it, Jackie.

32
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:54,072
- I think maybe...
- I'll kill myself, I swear to God.

33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,034
He and I should get
back together.

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,896
Jackie, do you remember
how Kelso cheated...

35
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:03,266
and hurt you and lied to you?

36
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,186
Listen to yourself, Donna.

37
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:09,245
"Cheat-ed." "Hurt-ed."
"Lie-duh."

38
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:13,186
It's all ancient history.

39
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,106
But when we look
into each other's eyes...

40
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:17,276
I know we're both thinking
about the same thing.

41
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,835
Your hair?

42
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:23,104
No. That we're meant
to be together.

43
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:25,026
Look, I need to know
that he's really changed.

44
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,263
I need to test him somehow.

45
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:29,186
- I agree.
- You do?

46
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:32,383
Absolutely. If you get back with Kelso,
you better have him tested.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,074

48
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:13,421
Okay. I want to see
if Michael is ready...

49
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:15,658
to be in a healthy,
adult relationship...

50
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:18,629
so I've come up
with five psychological tests.

51
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:22,183
Damn, Jackie.
He can't even spell "psychological."

52
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:25,419
Look, besides, he only has
to get three out of five.

53
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,171
And the first test
is on maturity.

54
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,462
Oh, man.

55
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:35,823
So we're trying to get the paint
off of Fez's butt, right?

56
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,702
So I started to spray
lighter fluid on it.

57
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,320
And Fez gets all mad, right?

58
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:45,253
<i>And then he started chasing me,
but he had his pants around his ankles.</i>

59
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,498
So then he tripped and fell,
and I think he hurt himself...

60
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,934
but I don't know, 'cause I was,
like, out of there.

61
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,934
So what's going on
with you guys?

62
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:54,949
Donna and I were discussing
our careers.

63
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:57,030
I'm going to high-end cosmetics...

64
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,300
and Donna thinks she'll make
a great lumberjack.

65
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,773
Stop telling everybody that.

66
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,433
So what kind of career
do you see yourself in?

67
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:14,951
Okay, well, I was considering
becoming a doctor.

68
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,838
Ooh. A doctor? That's so mature.

69
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:21,253
Or... a rodeo clown.

70
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,875
Rodeo clown?
You want to be a rodeo clown. Why?

71
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,391
Rodeo clowns are the unsung
heroes of the new West.

72
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:35,659
And you know I've always
enjoyed being inside of barrels.

73
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:43,467
Cheese puffs! Ow!

74
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:45,390
Well, see, they're not for you.

75
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,975
They're for Bob and Midge's party.

76
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,055
Oh. Bob and Midge
are having a party?

77
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,982
Well, I can't go.

78
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,902
I'm very, uh...

79
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,822
busy.

80
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,571
Oh, wait. Bob didn't invite you?

81
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,054
No, but thanks for the heads-up.
I'll be sure to avoid them.

82
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,974
Huh. Midge didn't
invite me either.

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,894
But I'm sure
they're having a party.

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,375
I saw them bring a keg
and a lot of chairs into the house.

85
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,651
Well, you don't know
that they're having a party.

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,804
Bob's out of work. The two of them
might be starting some weirdo church.

87
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,689
You know, the kind of church
where you, uh...

88
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,509
sit around on chairs
and drink beer.

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,094
I'm sure Midge will be over
any minute...

90
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,455
the last minute, like always,
to invite us.

91
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,374
I tell ya.

92
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,505
I like the sound
of a beer church.

93
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,506
Hi, neighbor.
I have something I want to ask you.

94
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:49,325
- Oh, really?
- Can I borrow your big punch bowl?

95
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,301
A big punch bowl?

96
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,263
Oh, my, what would that be for?

97
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:57,581
Uh-oh.

98
00:05:57,647 --> 00:05:59,501
I should have
thought this through.

99
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,022
You know, forget about it.
I'm gonna get someone else to bring it.

100
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,444
And by "someone else," I mean Bob.

101
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,374
Midge, I...

102
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,382
I already made
your cheese puffs.

103
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:12,270
Ooh, thanks. Mmm!

104
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:16,110
Boy, all these cheese puffs
are really gonna come in handy.

105
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,826
'Cause Bob's so hungry.

106
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:21,677
We're not having a party.

107
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,869
Okay, this next test
is about consideration.

108
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:31,310
I want to see if he'll choose
my interests over his.

109
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,506
This is gonna be so funny.

110
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:40,422
- Grape.
- So Michael...

111
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:42,437
There are two events
occurring this weekend.

112
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:44,366
One that you might like...

113
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:46,887
and one that I would really,
really, really...

114
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,814
really want to go to.

115
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:53,805
Now, should we go see
the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders...

116
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,327
Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.

117
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,393
- Yes, or...
- No. Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.

118
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:05,646
- But Michael, I want...
- No. Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders!

119
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,677
See? Funny.

120
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:19,043
Kelso, what are you doing?

121
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,966
We're just tossing
around this egg...

122
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,071
Jackie gave me to take care of.

123
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,962
Don't you think it might break?

124
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,366
Yeah, uh, well,
we just thought...

125
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:34,562
we'd have some fun with it
before I threw it at somebody.

126
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:36,486
You are such a moron.

127
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,406
You are so gonna fail Jackie's test.

128
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:41,089
Test? What test?

129
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,134
I'm not supposed to say anything,
but Jackie's testing you...

130
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:45,062
to see if you're ready
to get back together.

131
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:46,982
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

132
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:51,302
- Do you think I have a chance?
- Not a good one.

133
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,855
You've already failed two tests
and you're about to fail the third.

134
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:56,131
That egg is a test
of your parenting ability.

135
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,290
So what you're saying is
if I break that egg...

136
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,661
then I fail the test,
and lose Jackie...

137
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,208
the girl I love more
than anything in the world?

138
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,596
- Hyde, give me the egg.
- Okay, catch.

139
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:34,818
Whoops.

140
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:37,188
I mean...

141
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:52,510
Okay, you guys...

142
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,438
let's do this for Fez.

143
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:57,983
Finally my butt cheeks
will be avenged.

144
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,093
Voilא.

145
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,996
Guys, I feel like we
accomplished something today.

146
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,813
I feel like
we made a difference.

147
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,189
Oh, I'm not done yet.
Taste my wrath, Snapping Turtles.

148
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,206
That was a close one.

149
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:46,149
Crap! The janitor locked us in.

150
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:49,630
Yep. No good deed
goes unpunished.

151
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:52,932
Oh, my God.
How could this get any worse?

152
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,171
Okay, guys...

153
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:58,883
we have 20 seconds until
the cherry bomb in the toilet goes off.

154
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:21,670
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

155
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:25,248
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just this little...

156
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:28,134
crib-like thing I made for Eggy.

157
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,707
- Eggy?
- Yeah, I named him.

158
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:39,011
I don't know, this egg is,
like, bringing out...

159
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,632
all the parental stuff in me.

160
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:45,347
Michael, what happened to the pencil mark
I made on the bottom?

161
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,166
Oh.

162
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,297
Must have come off when I was
giving him his gentle bath.

163
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,165
Nice.

164
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,205
Michael, I knew
you had this in you.

165
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,214
- You are gonna make a great dad one day.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:05,029
Uh-oh. Somebody needs a change.

167
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,286
Oh, I just can't believe
Midge would do this...

168
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,563
after all the years
we've been friends.

169
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:22,363
She took the cheese puffs.

170
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,773
All the cheese puffs?

171
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,188
What the hell?
I wanted some of those.

172
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:30,946
Red, this isn't
about the cheese puffs.

173
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:34,146
Well, maybe not for you.

174
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:37,030
They're so light and fluffy.

175
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,234
- This is all your fault.
- What?

176
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:41,158
You're always mean to them.

177
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:43,078
Now you've driven them away.
I hope you're happy.

178
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:45,510
Actually, Kitty, I am happy.

179
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,430
Them not inviting us
to the party...

180
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,146
is not the end of the world.

181
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:55,103
In fact, it's the start
of a beautiful new world...

182
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:59,812
a world where we don't
get invited to the Pinciottis'.

183
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,465
There's no talking to you.

184
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:05,185
You're just sour.

185
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:09,597
You're an old, sour crab apple.

186
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:13,505
Why are you yelling at <i>me?</i>

187
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:16,390
I'm not the one that didn't
invite you to a party.

188
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:20,830
If you've got something to say,
you say it to the Pinciottis.

189
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:25,824
Well, you talked me
into it, Red Forman. Let's go.

190
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:28,284
Oh, no.

191
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:31,846
Look at us...

192
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,278
locked in a locker room.

193
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:38,566
Oh, the irony is not lost on me.

194
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,828
Why do you mock us, Fate?

195
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,213
Okay, you guys, we gotta think
about a way to get out of here.

196
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,831
Okay, guys, I've just gone through every
escape-from-prison movie...

197
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,488
- I could think of, and I came up with something.
- What?

198
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,039
Steve McQueen
is a total bad-ass.

199
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:58,559
Okay, thanks, Hyde.
That's not helping.

200
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:02,111
If we don't get out of here, a bunch of jocks
are gonna come in here and kick our asses.

201
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,508
Why did I put a cherry bomb
in the toilet?

202
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,227
It doesn't smell
like cherries at all.

203
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:10,400
Come on, guys, think.

204
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:14,148
Yeah, yeah. Right.
Gotta be something we can do.

205
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:17,926
I got it.

206
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,920
Much better.

207
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:34,181
Yeah. Now instead of feeling
scared and anxious...

208
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,832
I feel relaxed and...

209
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:40,418
relaxed.

210
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,658
I know we're probably
gonna get beaten...

211
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,581
but it was worth it
because we've shown...

212
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:47,494
we have tremendous
school spirit.

213
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,884
Go Vikings.

214
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,777
School spirit
is for losers, man.

215
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:05,701
You're just, like,
floating along...

216
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,938
on a conveyor belt
of conformity.

217
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,658
Pep rallies,
extracurricular activities...

218
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:13,858
washing your hair...

219
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,742
It's all just a trap, man.

220
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:20,517
Yeah, Fez. It's one thing to root
for a football team...

221
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,438
but to confuse
the Point Place Vikings...

222
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:25,798
with a sense of personal
identity, that's just...

223
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,717
relaxing.

224
00:14:30,343 --> 00:14:33,060
We're all gonna die tomorrow.

225
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:45,572
Michael, I have some bad news.

226
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,697
- I just found out I have B.H.D.
- B.H.D.?

227
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:52,833
Yeah. Brittle Hair Disease.

228
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,710
I have to go
to the hospital tomorrow...

229
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,630
and get all my hair shaved off.

230
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:02,946
- So you'll be...
- Bald, Michael.

231
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:06,910
B-A-L-D, no hair,
shiny head, bald.

232
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:09,023
And my hair won't
ever grow back either.

233
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:12,477
Will you still love me
when I'm bald?

234
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:16,896
You could wear a wig.

235
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:20,033
So, Michael, are you saying
that you would not love me...

236
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,852
if I didn't have a luscious,
full-bodied head of hair?

237
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:28,220
Oh!

238
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,974
No, Jackie.

239
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,624
I would love you even more.

240
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,550
You know, I would shave off
my hair...

241
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,470
and paste it to your head.

242
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,039
Michael, that's beautiful.

243
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,966
Nice job.

244
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:55,650
Thanks. That was a test, right?

245
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:59,068
'Cause bald chicks are gross.

246
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,774
Look at that.

247
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,327
They closed the blinds,
so we couldn't see the party.

248
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,570
But I can hear them.

249
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,014
I can hear you, Bob and Midge!
I can hear your party!

250
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:18,303
Ooh. Kitty and Red.

251
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,863
We've very busy in here.

252
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:23,968
Yes, we're very busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.

253
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,519
You're having a party,
and you didn't invite us.

254
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,501
And I thought we were friends,
and we're not.

255
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,484
And I'll tell you
something else.

256
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,985
You're naked.

257
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:41,634
You have no clothes on.
Why don't you have any clothes on?

258
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:45,347
Well, we're having a nudist party
with our fellow nudists.

259
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:48,579
We're, uh, nudists.

260
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,710
And we're not.

261
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:58,462
So, you didn't invite us.

262
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:02,244
So, thank you.

263
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,645
Come on, Red. Let's go.

264
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:08,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Kitty.
What are you saying?

265
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:10,884
You really wanted
to attend this party.

266
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,601
- Stop it, Red.
- No, no, no, no.

267
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:18,046
Now get in there and have yourself
a good old naked time, huh?

268
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,356
Who knows?
They might play Twister. Could be fun.

269
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:36,228
Okay, guys,
they can't be mad at us now.

270
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:39,678
Yeah, Fez, I don't think
that's gonna help.

271
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,947
All right, here they come.

272
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:45,935
Okay, you guys, here's the plan.
Fez, you beg for mercy in broken English.

273
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:48,325
Hyde, you insist that this whole thing
was a big setup.

274
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,111
And I'll just curl up in the fetal position
and think about pancakes.

275
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,238
- Got it.
- Got it.

276
00:17:57,831 --> 00:18:00,319
Oh, my God.
We're in the girls' locker room.

277
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:03,839
Yeah. They're girls.

278
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:08,101
Phew! And I thought we were
going to get beaten up for sure.

279
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,952
Hey, baby.

280
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,999
- Hi, Kelso.
- Hi, Tiffany.

281
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:31,682
I'm so glad I ran into you.
I've been meaning to ask you something.

282
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:35,166
- Yeah? What's that?
- Will you take me back to your house and make out with me?

283
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:39,614
Well, I...

284
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:42,337
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm here to meet Jackie, so...

285
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:45,221
I promise she'll never find out.

286
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:48,734
It'd be an afternoon
of secret make-out fun.

287
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,677
You can drink grape juice
from my belly button.

288
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:56,422
All right, this has
got to be one of Jackie's tests.

289
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,342
I mean, Tiffany
never comes on to me.

290
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,578
But what if it's not?

291
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:03,778
I mean, let's face it,
I look good today.

292
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:06,334
That new conditioner's
really working out.

293
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:09,538
All right, but the real question is,
should I risk it?

294
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,535
And my body says yes,
and my head says yes...

295
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,422
but my heart says no.

296
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,334
Aw, my stupid heart's right.

297
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:22,814
I can't. I mean, I appreciate
the offer and all...

298
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:25,537
'cause you're, like,
really hot...

299
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:31,138
but the only girl I want to make out with
is Jackie, so...

300
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:33,924
Oh, Michael, you did it! You did it!
You passed the last test!

301
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,892
- Did you believe me, Michael?
- Yeah, sure.

302
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,106
Oh, good, because
I'm in drama club, and I really want...

303
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:41,444
Yeah, thank you, Tiffany, bye-bye.

304
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:46,018
Michael, now I know I can
honestly trust you with all my heart.

305
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,159
Ooh!

306
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,173
Um...

307
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,735
Jackie...

308
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:55,294
Donna told me about the test.

309
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:59,622
So I knew what was going on,
and I didn't say anything.

310
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,858
So maybe I don't deserve
to be with you...

311
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:05,058
because that wasn't
very honest of me.

312
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:07,330
But telling me that was.

313
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:11,073
Damn.

314
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,623
You're right.
So you'll take me back?

315
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:16,582
Yeah, Michael.

316
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:23,553
I love you, Jackie Burkhart.

317
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,201
I love you too, Michael Kelso.

318
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:48,835
What the hell happened
to you guys?

319
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,329
We got beaten up.

320
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,258
By men.

321
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,625
By big, strong men.

322
00:20:57,163 --> 00:21:00,458
Hey, guys,
as I was getting beaten...

323
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:02,562
I think I got to second base.

324
00:21:03,305 --> 00:22:03,296

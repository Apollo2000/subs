1
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:09,359
All right. They didn't
even check our fake I.D.'s.

2
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:13,645
And I wasted a whole day
thinking up my fake name.

3
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,487
Yeah. Sorry, "Pez."

4
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:21,454
Let's drink.

5
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:25,069
- So, fellas, school let out early?
- Yeah. We're just...

6
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:28,041
- Kelso, shut up.
- Uh, I mean, no.

7
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:30,930
No, we're old.

8
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:33,865
We're workers.
We're all construction workers.

9
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,809
Hey, fellas, did you
see that brick today?

10
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:40,015
- Whoo!
- Relax, guys.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,312
It's "Serve a Minor Night" at the old
"Don't Have a Liquor License" Saloon.

12
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,177
You look familiar.
Do I know you?

13
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:50,187
I should hope so... Dad.

14

00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:32,848
- Hey! Steven!
- Wow!

16
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:36,265
- So you're Hyde's Dad?
- Well, that's what his mother says.

17
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,412
Kidding.

18
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:42,892
Hello, Mr. Hyde's Dad. I am Pez.

19
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:45,069
- I've heard much about you.
- Good things, I hope.

20
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,395
Well, if running out on your family
and becoming a drunk is good, then, yes.

21
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:54,994
Okay, guys.
Let's... look over here.

22
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,300
Wow! Look at you!

23
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:08,266
You're... bigger...

24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,122
and you got your mom's hair...

25
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:13,194
and her sideburns.

26
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,054
- So, how long has it been?
- Eight years, 51 days.

27
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:22,287
Wow!
Time really flies when you're...

28
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,744
- Drunk?
- Y... Well.

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,235
I was gonna say "havin' fun,"
but... same thing.

30
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:31,209
Yeah, so, uh, how long
you been back for?

31
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,579
Well, let's see.
Ah, that must be about a year.

32
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:37,065
- A year?
- Yeah! Hey, I was gonna call ya.

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,238
Oh, you were gonna call me?
Oh, man, that makes you, like...

34
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,544
I don't know, what,
father of the year?

35
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:46,216
I'll see you around, Dad.

36
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:51,114
Oh, man, Hyde's upset.
Better go see how he is.

37
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:54,155
Yep. One more round,
we'll go see how he is.

38
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,351
Hello!

39
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:06,839
She is just my type: Naked.

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,968
I, too, like the naked ladies.

41
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,651
I find them so... naked.

42
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,942
Yeah, that's realistic. I think I'm
gonna change the oil in my car...

43
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:23,230
but first I'm gonna take off everything
but my cowboy boots.

44
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,815
Sure, I mean if you're in bare feet,
you could slip in the oil.

45
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:27,742
Come on, Donna. Safety first.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,564
Whoa! Surefire ways
to pick up women.

47
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:37,428
What kind of lonely losers
read this stuff anyway?

48
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,702
Gimme.

49
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,925
"Look deep into her eyes,
and use her name often...

50
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,952
showing that this conversation
is just for her."

51
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:52,154
Hey, Donna.

52
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:55,704
I think they're onto something, Donna.
What do you think, Donna?

53
00:03:55,775 --> 00:04:00,314
Oh, my God. I'm taking off my shirt.
Stop it, hands! Stop it!

54
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:10,839
Well, Steven, honey,
you haven't touched your sandwich.

55
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:13,846
- You feel okay?
- Yeah. I'm just not hungry.

56
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,621
Oh, Steven. Are you finally
tired of freeloading?

57
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:21,208
- Can it, Laurie.
- All I'm saying is Daddy works really hard...

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,254
and nothing here is cheap.

59
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:25,564
Except you.

60
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:34,549
- Believe me. I'm not cheap.
- Fine. "Free." Whatever.

61
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,453
Hey, honey, I'm home!

62
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,356
Oh, good. The hippie's here.

63
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:46,009
Hyde, man, your dad
come by lookin' for you, man.

64
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,428
Which is really freaky 'cause I thought
this bald dude was your dad.

65
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,382
Thanks, Leo.

66
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:00,315
Steven's father is in town?

67
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,253
Yeah, right. Like he
even knows who his father is.

68
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,549
- Eric, you know something about this?
- She's a bitch.

69
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,548
Right. Okay. Uh, yeah.

70
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,663
We bumped into Hyde's dad
last night.

71
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:20,347
He'd been back in town, like, a year...
hadn't even talked to his own son.

72
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:22,684
Cool. Egg salad.

73
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:25,686
Well, I'm gonna
talk to Steven...

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,800
and see how he's
feeling about this.

75
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:31,548
You know what, Mom? I wouldn't do that.
Hyde likes to bottle those things up.

76
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:35,293
Good for him. That's where
those feelings should be kept.

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,971
Well, what is he gonna do?
Pretend he doesn't have a father?

78
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,829
Kitty, this is a family issue, and,
for once, it's not about our family.

79
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:47,547
Look, the bond between
a father and a son...

80
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,299
is complex and subtle.

81
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,945
You wipe that damn smirk
off your face!

82
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,422
Red, when we took
that boy into our home...

83
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:01,310
it became our job to see him
through thick and thin...

84
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:04,637
and now it's thick...

85
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:08,184
or thin... I don't know,
but he needs us.

86
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,142
Cool egg salad, man.

87
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:13,655
Fine. Stick your nose in
where it doesn't belong. Go ahead.

88
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:15,734
Okay. Will do.

89
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,946
Bud's comin' over
for drinks tonight.

90
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:21,844
Uh, Mom, do you really want to invite
an alcoholic over for cocktails?

91
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,050
Oh, right. Okay, well,
I'll just, um...

92
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,738
I'll make him a nice
Shirley Temple...

93
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,716
and he can fill up on cheese.

94
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,013
You keep a stack of dirty magazines
under your bed?

95
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,113
What? No! God, not a stack.

96
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:56,126
You know, what is
a "stack" really?

97
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:59,093
- Why do you have these down here?
- Now, wait, Donna...

98
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:02,102
downstairs you were laughing
and cracking jokes about this stuff.

99
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:04,247
Eric, that was
in the basement...

100
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,686
with our idiotic friends.

101
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,297
- Why do you need them? Aren't I enough?
- No... Yeah, you're enough.

102
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,734
God, you're... you're plenty.

103
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,646
<i>It's just, uh, that, uh...</i>

104
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,027
you see, Donna, you see,
what I do with dirty magazines...

105
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,721
is...

106
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,766
really only interesting to me...

107
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,145
with the reading of the articles
and the solving of the puzzles and whatnot.

108
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,171
You know what? I don't wanna know
about the whatnot.

109
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:33,402
I'm outta here.

110
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:41,786
Oh, no, girls. She's onto us.

111
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:44,855
Hello, Jackie.
How are you, Jackie?

112
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:49,531
- Fine.
- I'm glad, Jackie. I, too, am fine, Jackie.

113
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,926
Do I have a sty?

114
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:57,269
No, Jackie. You, Jackie,
do not have a sty...

115
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,474
- Jackie.
- Okay...

116
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,430
Fez.

117
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,764
I don't know what
you're doing, Fez...

118
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:07,220
but stop doing it, Fez.

119
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,422
Oh, no. Now <i>I</i> am turned on.

120
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:21,174
Oh, wow, man. Look at all these
different nuts intermingling in one bowl.

121
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:25,111
It's like "Nutstock," man.

122
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:29,085
Kitty, I think
we should rethink...

123
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:32,151
our "Don't Throw Leo
Out On His Ass" policy.

124
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:40,147
No, no. Leo stuck around
because he cares about Steven.

125
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:43,071
And, plus, I can't
find my shoes, man.

126
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:46,713
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- Oh, good news, Steven.

127
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,653
- Your dad's coming over tonight.
- Screw that!

128
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:52,029
No, Steven, it's a good thing, I think.

129
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:54,997
- I got nothing to say to him!
- Well, we have fancy nut mix.

130
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,030
Hey, Red! Remember me?

131
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:03,640
Of course. I wasn't the one
passed out in the gutter.

132
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,882
Yeah, I have this weird condition...

133
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,926
where I drink a case
of beer and fall down.

134
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:12,734
Hey, Red. Man, you're lookin' good.

135
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,832
Have you lost, um... hair?

136
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,871
Steven'll be right out.

137
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:20,917
Hey, man, nice shoes.

138
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,293
Are those mine?

139
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,646
- Hello, Bud.
- Hi.

140
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,851
- Can I go now?
- It's "May I go" and no.

141
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,926
So, Bud...

142
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:34,749
can I get you a drink?

143
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:40,830
A drink! A drink of soda.

144
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:45,946
A nice drink of soda,
Bud. Plus, we have cheese.

145
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:47,957
Soda sounds great, Kitty.

146
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,933
- Yeah, I'm off the hooch.
- Oh, really?

147
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:56,125
- So, no more boozing?
- I heard him.

148
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:59,835
Yep. I can finally see clearly.

149
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:03,165
Isn't it great, man?

150
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:07,773
It is. I got a job
and an apartment.

151
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,425
- Color TV.
- Ooh, color TV. That's nice.

152
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:13,310
Wow, Bud, you're doing
great now, huh?

153
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,415
Color TV? Man.

154
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:18,105
I remember when I was a kid,
I didn't even have a father.

155
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,260
Well, well.

156
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:30,394
- Who could have foreseen this terrible...
- Can it.

157
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,345
Jackie didn't give me
the time of the day.

158
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,317
I hate this stupid magazine.

159
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:45,398
Oh, no. I didn't mean it.
I love you.

160
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:49,366
Hey, Fez. Check this out.

161
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,333
"Tight pants turn a man's derriere
into a lady's dream...

162
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,796
"and an open shirt
shows a sexy chest...

163
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,166
and an irresistible
joie de vivre."

164
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,446
Really?

165
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,624
I always thought
my joie de vivre was in my pants.

166
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,380
Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking you guys this...

167
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,724
but if any of you losers
had a girlfriend...

168
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,246
would you still
look at those magazines?

169
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:21,785
Hey, I had two girlfriends...
and a little action on the side...

170
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:24,222
and I still looked
at those magazines.

171
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,215
You had action on the side? Who?

172
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,391
You don't know her.
She went to Sacred Heart.

173
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:34,718
Okay. Anybody here
have an opinion who's not a skeevy pig?

174
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,298
I'm glad you asked, Donna.

175
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,229
If I had Jackie, I would never
look at those magazines...

176
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:46,613
Unless she's on the phone
or went shopping...

177
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:49,403
or took a short nap.

178
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,564
Look, Donna...

179
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,876
this is just the way
guys are. Okay?

180
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:59,864
I mean if Forman was actually dating the...
the "Naughty Campus Coeds"...

181
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,717
he'd be locked in a bathroom
looking at naked pictures of you.

182
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:07,542
He's right, so...
Are there naked pictures of you?

183
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,092
My leg!

184
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,469
- Hey, knee him in the groin!
- <i>Oh!</i>

185
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,674
Oh, my, God! She did it!

186
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,964
So...

187
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,103
how's your cocoa?

188
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:32,597
Chocolaty good. Thanks.

189
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:35,638
That's good 'cause I think
your father has really changed.

190
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,816
He is not the same man
I used to know...

191
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,992
and the marshmallows
make it extra good.

192
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,378
Well, at least you knew him,
Mrs. Forman, 'cause I never did.

193
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:47,229
Okay, well, here's your chance.

194
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,434
Maybe now you can make
some new, happy memories.

195
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,477
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

196
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,219
Yeah!

197
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,085
Yeah, you know what,
Mrs. Forman?

198
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:47,901
No.

199
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:51,098
Are you sure? 'Cause I kinda think
you're bottling things up.

200
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,207
I'm not bottling anything!

201
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:08,244
Well, hi, there, beautiful.
And how are you?

202
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,002
Not good, you dirtbag.

203
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:14,300
That's what I thought you'd...
Excuse me.

204
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:18,807
I am not going to help you cheat
on your girlfriend.

205
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,483
But I don't have
a girlfriend, you...

206
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:25,973
silly librarian.

207
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:30,902
Don't you lie to me. I heard everything.
I was right under that mattress...

208
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:33,047
and that Donna
sounded really upset.

209
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:36,697
No! No, no.
Sh-She's okay. Really.

210
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,676
Excuse me.

211
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:41,206
My turnoffs include
unfaithful men.

212
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,253
Didn't you read my biography?

213
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:45,693
Um...

214
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:48,409
I... You know,
I was just getting to it.

215
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:54,710
Sorry, but Donna
is a nice girl...

216
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:58,263
and you are a...
filthy, filthy boy!

217
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:02,775
You filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy...

218
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:06,938
filthy, filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy, filthy boy!

219
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:17,371
Hey! You can't ditch me, then walk
back into my life eight years later...

220
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,511
and expect everything
to be okay.

221
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,168
- You screwed me!
- I did. You're right. I know.

222
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,311
And...

223
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,612
You what? You know?
What do you mean you know?

224
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,818
I got no excuse. I was a jerk.

225
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,083
I've been a jerk my whole life.

226
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,663
And all I can do is tell you I'm sorry...

227
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,709
and hope that you'll believe me.

228
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:43,515
You jerk! How am I supposed
to yell at you now?

229
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,754
I was gonna yell!
I was gonna tell you off!

230
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:48,244
I think you should. I mean, you wanna yell?
Go ahead.

231
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:51,253
- I deserve it.
- You're ju... You're caving?

232
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,669
That just makes it worse!
Come on, man. Give me something!

233
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:59,452
- You want a beer?
- Yeah!

234
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,283
Give me a beer!

235
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,597
- Well, hello, Jackie.
- Hey, Fez.

236
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,974
Hey, Fez.

237
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:20,436
Nice ass!

238
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:24,119
Why, thank you, Kelso.

239
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,557
Oh, my God.
What the hell's that smell?

240
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,623
Well, Jackie,
it's a combination of musk...

241
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:33,110
and a little thing
I like to call "Fez."

242
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,517
Whoa, Fez! What are you doing?

243
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,525
Showing off my joie de vivre.

244
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:40,894
- You like?
- No!

245
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,057
So, what? This was all a waste?

246
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,981
The pants, the chest,
the manly smell...

247
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,348
the "Jackie, hello,
Jackie, Jackie..."

248
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,066
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie,
Jackie"... Worthless?

249
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,266
Not worthless... Hilarious.

250
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,061
Okay, look, Fez,
you're not bad-looking.

251
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:02,483
I mean, some girls like
that exotic, grimy look...

252
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,047
but only the cheapest,
most sluttiest girls will like that.

253
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:07,453
I see.

254
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:18,359
Damn, Fez! Looking good.

255
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:25,726
Hey, so, thanks for the singles
at the nudie bar, huh.

256
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,954
Hey, hey, hey! You gotta tip the girls
or they ignore ya.

257
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:31,673
- Yeah.
- So, they takin' care of you here?

258
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:33,815
Yeah, yeah.
It's good. It's great.

259
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,156
- It's a nice place.
- Oh, yeah.

260
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,677
That's nice.
I like my place too.

261
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,238
It's good.
It's got an extra room.

262
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,133
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

263
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,784
So, if you ever wanna,
you know, come by or whatever.

264
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:47,764
You know? I'm not
usin' the extra room.

265
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,668
Hence, the term "extra room."

266
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:54,841
Yeah. Yeah,
the rent's due, but...

267
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,853
they don't evict you
for, like, three months...

268
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:59,131
so, I still got... two days.

269
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,620
So, you lookin' for a loan, Bud?

270
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:07,796
Well, will ya look at that?

271
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,554
A father and son
brought together by...

272
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,525
Oh, my goodness!
I think it was me!

273
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:21,018
- Don't gloat, Kitty.
- Mr. Wrongie!

274
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:25,236
Fine.

275
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:28,572
Once in 26 years!

276
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:31,322
Live it up, Kitty!

277
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:39,032
Oh, crap.

278
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:42,713
Ta-da

279
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:46,328
Wow, Eric. It's a room.

280
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,050
Not just any room. See?

281
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,323
No more dirty magazines.
I threw 'em all out.

282
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,846
And you know what, Donna?
I don't miss 'em.

283
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,057
Eric, you didn't
have to do that.

284
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,232
I mean, I understand
why you need them.

285
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:02,165
- You do?
- Yes! You're disgusting!

286
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,180
- What?
- It's okay.

287
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:07,418
All guys are.
You're a revolting gender.

288
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:10,203
You know, we really are.

289
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,329
But you're disgusting
in a cute, harmless way...

290
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:16,307
and I guess I love you for that.

291
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,866
I love you too.

292
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,785
Let me make it up to you. I can have
a naked girl in here in 10 seconds.

293
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:29,979
- Oh, great. Send her in. I'll see you later.
- Shut up!

294
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:38,101
Steven, good. I wanted
to have a talk with you.

295
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:40,825
- What are you doin'?
- Oh.

296
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:43,644
- I'm movin' in with Bud.
- You're movin' in with Bud?

297
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,485
- Yeah, Red. It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay.

298
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,845
Steven, your dad is not...

299
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,206
good.

300
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,067
Yeah. I know, but,
you know, he's my dad.

301
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:03,064
- Yeah. He's your dad.
- Yeah.

302
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,829
Anyway. Red, thanks for everything.
You know? Really.

303
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:11,098
Hey, do me a favor.
Would you tell Mrs. Forman?

304
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,876
- I don't want to have to deal with the whole crying thing.
- You think I do?

305
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,331
Nah, I'll just tell her
that, you know...

306
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,610
Anytime you need a place to stay,

1
00:00:02,607 --> 00:00:05,160
Okay, guys. Road trip checklist.

2
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:07,403
Car: Check.

3
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:10,505
Okay. We're good.

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,095
Is there anything about Canada
we need to know before we get there?

5
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:18,601
Well, the beer is stronger, and as a
result, their women look prettier.

6
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:20,940
Then let's haul ass to Canada!

7
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:25,644
Okay. Shh. Fez, if my dad finds out
that we're going to Canada...

8
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:29,454
uh, for beer, no less,
he's gonna start killing people, okay?

9
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:34,629
People like us. So keep it down.

10
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:39,886
All right! Canada!
Whoo-hoo! Beer!

11

12
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:52,968
- Kelso, you're not going.
- What? Why not?

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,106
Because this is a risky mission.
You tend to screw these things up.

14
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:59,623
- Yo, that is a damnable lie!
- Okay.

15
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:03,143
Kelso, remember that time we were
gonna put a flaming bag of dog poop...

16
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,125
in front of Principal Pridwell's door...

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,094
and you lit it in the car
on the way over?

18
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:14,182
Yeah. I wanted
to see it all flame-y.

19
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,517
And then you panicked
and stepped on it.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,814
Eric, it was on fire!

21
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,694
Okay. You're not going.

22
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,142
No, no, no. Fine.
I won't use the air horn...

23
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:30,925
and I'll pay for the gas
and the beer.

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,498
I can't stay mad at you.
Come on, you big lug.

25
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,090
Hey, dudes.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,226
- Leo, man, what are you doin' here?
- Sittin'.

27
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:48,165
- What are you doin' here?
- We're goin' to Canada to buy beer.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,891
Canada? Cool, man.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,156
I spent some time up there
during 'Nam.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,222
Oh, conscientious objector, huh?

31
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:00,230
No. I didn't mind.

32
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:06,885
Hey, a road trip sounds good, man. But I
don't want nothin' to do with that beer.

33
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,993
That stuff will mess
with your mind, man.

34
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,181
Okay. Let's get goin'.

35
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:20,039
Oh, don't tell me
Crap Shoes is comin'.

36
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,741
The bag was on fire!

37
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:04,502
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Donna...

38
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,288
Glamourella Modeling Agency
got the pictures I sent in.

39
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:11,316
They want me to audition!
My dream is finally coming true!

40
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:15,762
I thought your dream was to be
the world's first flying lady scientist.

41
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:20,723
No. No, Donna. That was a dream <i>I had,</i>
not <i>my</i> dream.

42
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:24,276
- You're a weird little girl.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:29,912
If I become a model, I wouldn't
have to work or study or think ever again!

44
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:33,427
That's great. I mean,
what's thought done for anyone anyway?

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,921
Nothing!

46
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:40,949
But modeling has made people rich
and famous.

47
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:09,397
Come on, Donna! We're going
to the world modeling headquarters.

48
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:11,857
It's in Sheboygan.

49
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:19,130
Guess who got a bonus today?

50
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:23,025
Oh, my golly.
They gave you a boxful of money.

51
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,286
- Better.
- Ohh.

52
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:30,258
"A videocassette recorder."

53
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:34,041
What's videocassette,
and why do we need to record it?

54
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,791
It records TV.

55
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,675
You know how we don't
get to see Johnny Carson?

56
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,122
Well, he's on so gosh-darn late.
Who can stay up past 10:30?

57
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:46,905
No one, but now...

58
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:51,543
we can record Johnny while we sleep
and then watch it the next day.

59
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:54,873
- Oh.
- And you know how you wanted to watch the rerun of <i>Roots?</i>

60
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,584
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, we can tape it, and then you can watch it over and over.

61
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:01,717
Well, I think just watching it tonight
should do the trick.

62
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:05,267
Well, we will watch it tonight,
after we tape it.

63
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,551
But we don't stay up to watch Carson.
Why would we stay up to watch this?

64
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:15,921
Because it's conven...
Oh, you just don't understand technology.

65
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:22,736
No. But I sure know how to tell time.

66
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:30,162
Wow. What a view.

67
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:32,569
Just like a postcard.

68
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:36,181
It is so beautiful I could cry.

69
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:42,258
Oh, sure.
Drinking <i>looks</i> like fun.

70
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:46,423
And all the cool kids do it.

71
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:51,892
But it leads you down
a sad, lonely, confused path, man.

72
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:54,810
- You know why they call it beer?
- No. Why?

73
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,428
I'm just curious, man.

74
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:04,440
Guys, guess how many countries
I've whizzed in.

75
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,962
Two.

76
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:10,134
All right. Let's get goin'.

77
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,237
We're almost at the border,
so everyone's got their I.D.'s, right?

78
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,177
- Yep.
- Oh, no.

79
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,829
- I think I lost my green card.
- Damn, Fez. Where's the last place you had it?

80
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:23,576
If I knew that, I would have it now,
you son of a bitch.

81
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:26,261
- All right, Fez. Take it easy.
- No. You take it easy.

82
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:29,266
They're gonna throw me
in Canadian jail.

83
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,568
Have you seen <i>Midnight Express?</i>

84
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:35,930
Well, it's like that,
but with hockey sticks.

85
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,068
Great. Now we're screwed.

86
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:45,525
- What if I can't breathe?
- Just take a deep breath, man...

87
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:50,102
And visualize yourself breathing.

88
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:54,001
All right. Now, when we get
to the checkpoint, everyone just act cool.

89
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,779
And by everyone,
I mean Mr. Crap Shoes.

90
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,721
It was on fire!

91
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:08,336
- Wow.
- Hi. I'm Michelle Ray...

92
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:12,186
President of
Glamourella International.

93
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:15,251
- And you must be?
- I'm Jackie Burkhart.

94
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:18,454
Jackie Burkhart. Exactly.

95
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,425
- And you are here for?
- My audition.

96
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:24,663
Your audition. Exactly.

97
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:28,560
- And you must be?
- Yeah. She doesn't matter. Okay. Let's start.

98
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:31,319
- Okay. Let's do it.
- Okay.

99
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:33,427
Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,801
Uh-huh. Let's see the hair.

101
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:40,919
<i>Well, you are a remarkable talent.</i>

102
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:43,704
- Are those your real teeth?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:46,160
Great. Welcome to
the superior world of modeling.

104
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:49,104
- Oh, God. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Sure.

105
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:52,921
Now...
You're going to need to cover a few costs.

106
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:56,565
Of course. Oh, you know,
I left my checkbook at home.

107
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:58,523
Um, can I come by tomorrow?

108
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:01,107
Oh, tomorrow.

109
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:06,646
No. No. Tomorrow I'll be in Paris,
you know, for the big show.

110
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:08,602
Okay.
Then I'll bring it by tonight.

111
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,983
- Good. Okay. Administrative costs are 200.
- Uh-huh.

112
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,841
And publicity shots are 150.
And we're gonna need beauty supplies...

113
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:18,256
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Are you an agent or a saleslady?

114
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,641
Oh, I'm an agent.
I represent models like Cheryl Tiegs.

115
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:26,130
- You represent Cheryl Tiegs?
- No. Models <i>like</i> Cheryl Tiegs.

116
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:32,378
Red, it's starting. It's starting.

117
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:37,178
And press "record" and done!

118
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:40,658
We are now recording.

119
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:46,608
Two hours from now,
we'll be watching <i>Roots.</i>

120
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:48,592
Well, I just...

121
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:52,922
I just don't see why we can't
watch it now like normal people.

122
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:57,776
Kitty, we have a Betamax.
We're better than normal people.

123
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:02,042
So, what do you wanna do
for the next two hours?

124
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:05,042
Watch <i>Roots.</i>

125
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:12,593
Fine.

126
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,667
I'm gonna go make
some instant pudding...

127
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:19,055
and you can't eat it
for two hours.

128
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:25,682
All right. Just act cool.
We got nothin' to hide.

129
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:28,144
You got something to hide, eh?

130
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:32,278
No, no. He said,
"We've got <i>nothing</i> to hide."

131
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,616
Around here, we don't make a point
of saying we've got nothin' to hide...

132
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:36,723
if we've really got nothin' to hide.

133
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:38,999
Wow.

134
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:42,963
Cultural differences. Wow.

135
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:46,777
We're all Americans,
every one of us.

136
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,426
- All right. Move along.
- Thank you.

137
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,557
Cool.

138
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,943
Stop right there.

139
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:06,807
Hey, you found me!

140
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:10,932
You win a beer.

141
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:22,424
You see, beer <i>is</i> evil.

142
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:26,488
I'm not gonna say I told you so, man,
but I will say this:

143
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,145
I told you so, man.

144
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,997
Beer never hurt anyone, my friend.

145
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,583
You're well
within the legal limit on that.

146
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:40,285
But you're over the limit on foreign kids
you can smuggle out of this country.

147
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:43,133
Well, what is
the legal limit on that?

148
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,882
We only had one foreign kid.

149
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:50,174
The limit is zero, you hoser.

150
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,221
- Damn it.
- Hey, I'd keep a civil tongue in my head if I were you.

151
00:10:56,287 --> 00:11:00,891
We could throw you in jail right now.
We're the Mounties; we answer to no one.

152
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,694
Look, Fez just lost his green card.
We just... We didn't want any trouble.

153
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,036
Lost green card?
Seems a little convenient, eh?

154
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,533
You got us.

155
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:15,989
We're here
to take over your country.

156
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:21,595
Hyde, I know it seems funny
when you say stuff like that...

157
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:24,478
but, um, don't.

158
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:28,629
No one leaves
until we get answers, eh?

159
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:30,645
Eh?

160
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,207
Eh?

161
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:40,761
- What are you doin' in Canada?
- What are <i>you</i> doin' in Canada?

162
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:51,485
We're part of an elite,
high school terrorist team...

163
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:54,333
Strike Force Wisconsin.

164
00:11:56,447 --> 00:12:00,986
Uh, we just came here
to get the beer, and I love Rush.

165
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:05,948
"Fly by night!" Ow!

166
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,165
Well, if ham's Canadian bacon,
then what the hell do you call bacon?

167
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,704
Me no "speakaz" English.

168
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:19,518
What's your business in Canada?

169
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,518
What's <i>your</i> business in Canada?

170
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:29,402
What? Getting beer.

171
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:35,387
Every once in a while, do you
ever get an American nickel in your change?

172
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,540
Me no "understando."

173
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,918
<i>What's your reason
for coming to Canada, eh?</i>

174
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:52,220
- What's <i>your</i> reason...
- Shut up!

175
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,829
Yeah. I'm here
to nail Margaret Trudeau.

176
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,502
Been there.

177
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,647
Done that.

178
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:15,541
Beer. Beer. Beer!

179
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:26,168
Are those snowshoes hard
to walk in?

180
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,654
They're tennis rackets,
aren't they?

181
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,280
Wee foobie deebie doobie.

182
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:41,975
Woobie deebie doobie?
Woobie deebie...

183
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:47,132
Jackie, can't you see? This woman
is just tryin' to make money off you.

184
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,436
Donna, she deserves her cut.
She discovered a remarkable talent.

185
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,412
Donna, don't hate me
'cause I'm beautiful.

186
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:03,862
Jackie, I pity you
because you're dumb.

187
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:08,889
Administrative fees?
Publicity shots? Beauty packages?

188
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,813
It's a scam.

189
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,741
This is the most important thing that's ever
happened to me, and you're trying to ruin it.

190
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:18,095
- Look, Jackie, I'm sorry, but...
- And to think I was gonna make you my assistant.

191
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,508
Our nail care package is optional,
but if you're really serious...

192
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,544
Oh... Oh, I am. I am fully committed
to both fame and fortune.

193
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:36,536
You are going places.
That'll be another $200 then.

194
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,902
Excellent. Hi, I'm Michelle Ray.

195
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,683
- I know. I was just here.
- Of course you were.

196
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,784
I told you to stay in the car,
you dream killer.

197
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:49,532
Jackie, I'm here for you.
And, as a matter of fact...

198
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,738
I've decided to be a model too.

199
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:56,825
Oh, Donna, you're so funny!

200
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:01,084
Donna, you're gonna need $200 for publicity
costs. And then there's administrative fees.

201
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,526
- Wait, wait. You didn't even ask her to shake her hair.
- Oh, yeah. Shake your hair.

202
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,462
You are a remarkable talent.

203
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,469
Wait, wait, wait. What?
You think Donna here can be a model?

204
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,510
This <i>is</i> a scam.

205
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,609
How dare you
soil the pure and noble art of modeling?

206
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,875
I like your passion.
Have you ever considered acting?

207
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:25,758
Oh, my God. That's my dream.

208
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:28,692
- We're going.
- Oh.

209
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:35,322
And... time!

210
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:42,135
Let's watch <i>Roots.</i>

211
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,809
Oh, Red, I'm sleepy.

212
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,984
Can we watch it in the morning?

213
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,957
In the morning?
But I just taped it.

214
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:57,115
Well, I know, but I thought the whole point
was we can watch it whenever we want.

215
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:01,885
- But I just taped it.
- Fine. Let's watch it now.

216
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:06,206
Great. Now, I just punch "play,"

217
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,296
and, voilא... <i>Roots.</i>

218
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,805
Where's <i>Roots,</i> Red?

219
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:23,700
Oh, that's right.
I forgot to rewind the tape.

220
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:28,115
The tape.

221
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:36,093
This tape?

222
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,974
How do they get the movie
onto the tape...

223
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,901
when it's way the heck
over here, Red?

224
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,238
- It's complicated.
- Good night, Red.

225
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,134
Damn!

226
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:57,655
I should've got the microwave.

227
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:00,061
- Thanks for looking out for me.
- Sure.

228
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:04,185
And I've thought about it,
and you could be a model. Hmm.

229
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:25,146
Thanks, Jackie. That's nice.

230
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:35,196
You guys are in real trouble
if you did what we think you did.

231
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,419
- What do you think we did?
- What do you think we think you did?

232
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,319
What do you think
we think you think we did?

233
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,930
Something involving a foreign kid
in the back of a car.

234
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:52,603
- That much is for sure.
- And now we're gonna get some answers.

235
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,525
- What are you gonna do? Torture us?
- Yeah.

236
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,885
You gonna make us listen
to Anne Murray records?

237
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:02,707
<i>Hey, she's a wonderful performer,
and you're not funny.</i>

238
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:08,314
No. I think what we're gonna do
is call your parents.

239
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:11,678
Oh, Red is going to kill you.

240
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:15,223
I mean... obie deebie doobie.

241
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:20,435
No! We had to smuggle Fez.

242
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,193
It was the only way for him
to see this great country...

243
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:28,762
with its spacious skies
and fruited waves of... plain.

244
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:34,460
And... Oh, Canada

245
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:37,625
Our home and native land

246
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:42,037
- Nice try, kid.
- True patriot love

247
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,925
In all thy sons' command

248
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,503
- It's not gonna work.
- With glowing hearts

249
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:52,917
We see thee rise
the true north strong as...

250
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:56,253
From far and wide

251
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,076
Oh, Canada
we stand on guard for thee

252
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,525
God keep our land

253
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:08,500
Glorious and free

254
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:11,706
Oh, Canada

255
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:16,663
We stand on guard for thee

256
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,156
Oh, Canada

257
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,697
We stand on guard for thee

258
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:34,743
- You sure are good kids.
- Thanks, man.

259
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:38,230
You know, there must be
some way to put this all behind us.

260
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,619
Yeah, but there's not.

261
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,881
We'll give you our beer.

262
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,536
Oh, God bless you, son.

263
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,814
My green card.

264
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:58,588
I hid it in my right shoe
for safekeeping.

265
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:01,305
I even made up a rhyme
so I would remember.

266
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,262
My green card in my right shoe

267
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,360
Something, something right shoe

268
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,773
So, see, it was just
a big misunderstanding.

269
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:15,221
Thank God we got that cleared up.

270
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:17,564
We're just gonna
grab our beer and head on out of here.

271
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,281
Yeah. But you're not
gettin' your beer back.

272
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,700
Now... leave Canada, please.

273
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:35,483
- <i>You</i> leave Canada, please.
- Get...

274
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,700
Filthy hippie.

275
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:43,657
Guys, I have to admit something.

276
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:48,937
I love Anne Murray.
She puts me in the mood.

277
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:55,657
So, guys, next time,
instead of goin' to Canada...

278
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:59,018
let's just stay here
and pretend we're in Canada.

279
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:02,857
So, how's it goin', eh?

280
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:06,697
Hey, you know, if Fonzie
ever played a Mountie on <i>Happy Days...</i>

281
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:09,577
he could go, "Aay, eh?"

282
00:21:10,305 --> 00:22:10,531

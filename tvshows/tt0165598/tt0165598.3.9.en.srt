1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,608
All right, Hyde! Your dad's apartment
is the perfect place for a party.

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,167
It's already trashed.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,582
Hey, even if half the people we invited
show up, this party's gonna rock.

4
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:14,760
- Did you find the cups?
- Nope. Even better.

5
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:17,646
A plastic tube and a funnel.

6
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:20,843
All this and a dirty funnel?

7
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:23,279
Merry Christmas to me.

8
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,384
Yeah, we don't even
have to worry about germs...

9
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,659
because even though our spit
backs up in the tube...

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,735
the alcohol kills 'em.

11
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:32,591
- We're leaving.
- So leaving.

12
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:34,477
- Wait. You're leaving?
- Yeah, see...

13
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:36,999
when I was a little girl,
I made a promise to myself.

14
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,308
"Self," I said, "if you're ever
about to suck beer...

15
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,058
out of a funnel
that might give you mono, don't."

16
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:45,161
So bye-bye.

17
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:48,810
All right. Kelso, I'm gonna nix the funnel
on account of I think it repels women.

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,596
Hey, any woman who doesn't appreciate
a nice funnel isn't much of a woman.

19
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,832
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey.

20
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:00,970
- What's with the keg?
- Throwin' a little party.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,040
You know, 'tis the season
to get sloppy.

22
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:06,478
- Well, uh...
- You're cool with this, right?

23
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:09,708
Sure. Yeah. Cool dad. That's me.

24
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:12,710
Totally cool dad.

25
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:15,653
Hey, listen.
Have a merry, uh, keg party.

26
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:18,662
Mr. Hyde, you're the best.

27
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,590
Yeah, you're the best.

28
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:24,779
Will you be my daddy?
I'm not kidding.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,705
Seriously.

30
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:32,012
- Oh, hey, Fez, can you grab this for me?
- Sure.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,074

32
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,531
You know, Kelso,
four times is not funny.

33
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:52,619
Um, yes, it is.

34
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:55,502
<i>Guess who?</i>

35
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:58,469
Eric, it's your mom!

36
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:01,446
Oh, I'm not...

37
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,890
Oh, you're caroling.

38
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,742
That is so... odd.

39
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:14,346
Well, um, happy holidays.

40
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,717
Look what I brought. Mistletoe!

41
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:18,824
Uh-oh.

42
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,001
Uh-uh.

43
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,926
Uh-oh!

44
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:24,715
Uh-oh!

45
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:32,617
Now, Steven, I brought some
beautiful Christmas ornaments...

46
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:36,779
to hang on your... antenna.

47
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,008
Ah, Mrs. Forman, you're not
checking up on me, are you?

48
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:43,366
No, no, no. I'm just spreading
a little holiday cheer.

49
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,349
Dusty.

50
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:49,515
Oh. Oh, and this blanket,
it needs a nice Christmas washing.

51
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:54,536
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
That's Bud's Christmas stool.

52
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:58,699
Very sentimental. If anybody
touches it, he just goes nuts, so...

53
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:04,431
Huh. Well, um, I don't
quite believe you, but okay.

54
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:06,699
Okay.

55
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:12,234
So, um, Bud left you boys
here unsupervised?

56
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:14,638
Oh, salami in the couch.

57
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:19,144
Now, that's... sanitary.

58
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:27,341
Okay! Okay, then, um,
why don't you boys hang up those angels?

59
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,709
And, um, Eric, come in here...

60
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:34,729
and help me with the traditional
holiday floor wax.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,622
Mom, seriously, we're okay.
You can go, really.

62
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,573
<i>Oh, good. Fez is making ice.</i>

63
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,651
Ooh. Listen to this.

64
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:34,578
"Corner Him Under the Mistletoe:

65
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:36,782
Eight Ways to Trick
a Guy Into a Relationship."

66
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:38,990
I love the holidays.

67
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:43,664
Yeah, hanging your stocking, putting
cookies out for Santa, setting a man trap.

68
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:46,766
Mmm, Christmas.

69
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,914
You know, this'll be the first year I
celebrate Christmas without a boyfriend.

70
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:54,027
And Jesus wept.

71
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:57,810
So here's my new plan
for the year:

72
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:02,382
Buy some really cute tops,
fly to Hollywood and marry Lee Majors.

73
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,622
Make fun of that. I dare you.

74
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,113
Jackie, there are so many ways
to make fun of that...

75
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:09,259
I don't even know
where to start.

76
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,186
It's like choosing
your favorite jelly bean.

77
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:15,408
Donna, be nice to me.
I'm lonely.

78
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:18,410
I mean, okay, if there were
mistletoe over me right now...

79
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,393
who would kiss me?

80
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,703
No one. That's who.

81
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,357
Being alone isn't that bad.

82
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:27,434
It's a great opportunity
to get to know yourself...

83
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,362
and be comfortable
with who you are.

84
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,282
Donna, I already love myself.

85
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,420
I just wanna French someone.

86
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,680
I miss my funnel.

87
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:45,875
Eric, drink.

88
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,794
Okay.

89
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:50,925
If I was Tattoo,
and I lived on Fantasy Island...

90
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:53,362
my fantasy would be
to not be a midget.

91
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,336
Am I right?

92
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:58,446
Hmm.

93
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:01,417
Eenie, meenie, miney, Forman.

94
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:06,572
You know, Hyde, at first I thought
your dad was a real dirtbag...

95
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:08,498
but I've come to realize
that there's a fine line...

96
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:12,273
between dirtbag
and Father of the Year!

97
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:16,425
Damn!

98
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:21,806
Fellas, I have to be honest.

99
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,704
I've never played quarters before,
so I probably stink.

100
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,041
Oh, happy day! Eric.

101
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:32,591
Man, this is the worst game
in the world.

102
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,343
I'm so thirsty.

103
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:38,160
Damn it! Eric, drink!

104
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:43,432
I mean, he lives
on Fantasy Island, man...

105
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,417
and he's a midget!

106
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,401
It's so obvious.

107
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,834
Hmm. Mmmm, Forman.

108
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:58,217
Does anyone else
feel kind of woozy?

109
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,959
Oh, what the hell, man?

110
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:08,970
If I make this shot,
I promise I will not pick you, Eric.

111
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,257
I pick you, Eric.

112
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,201
It's fun to lie.

113
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:21,202
Donna, that's Fireman Rob
and Fireman Dean.

114
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:25,010
- They're firemen!
- Jackie, they're, like, 40.

115
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,758
Whatever. They're firemen!

116
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:29,999
Two hot firemen in a bar.

117
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,896
This is just like that play I wrote.
Okay, give me five minutes.

118
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:35,826
I'll pick the one I want,
and you can have the other.

119
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,891
Hello! I'm dating someone. Eric.

120
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,134
Donna, Dean can
bench-press a keg.

121
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:45,905
- Eric can't even bench-press a cup.
- He can too.

122
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,082
Rob, Dean, this is Donna.

123
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:02,379
So, what do you girls do?

124
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:06,161
That's funny you should ask.
We, uh, go to high school!

125
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:12,395
- Any outside interests?
- Uh-huh. High school guys!

126
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,932
Kelso, it's fine.
I'm not that drunk.

127
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:29,552
I just...

128
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:33,100
I just can't walk... or see.

129
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:37,964
Man, that was...
That was a great party!

130
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:41,035
You know... You know who
doesn't like parties? Red.

131
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,633
"I'm Red!"

132
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:53,522
I don't like parties...

133
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:56,882
"'cause I'm a big,
bald, party pooper!"

134
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,378
Uh-oh.

135
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:13,386
Uh-oh.

136
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,009
Son of a bitch!

137
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,798
Eric, when did you
eat spaghetti?

138
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,283
I knew something
was going on at Bud's.

139
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:40,206
When I went over there,
the only thing in the fridge... olives.

140
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,944
And poor Fez had ice
in his pants.

141
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:48,851
My head hurts.

142
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:52,399
That's your brain trying
to comprehend its own stupidity.

143
00:09:57,302 --> 00:10:01,164
I mean, what kind of parent leaves
a bunch of teenagers alone with a keg?

144
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:03,507
A fun one?

145
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:07,830
Hey, Jim Beam, can it.

146
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,837
Red, you need to have
a talk with Bud.

147
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:12,366
No.

148
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,348
Eric's home now.

149
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:19,986
And what goes on between Bud and Steven
is between Bud and Steven.

150
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,997
He's just not a good dad.

151
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,372
Well, you know what? I agree.

152
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:27,188
So, I think we should
get in the car...

153
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:31,051
pick up Steven and move him
back in with us and feed him...

154
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:35,313
and... and clothe him...

155
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,238
and love him.

156
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,212
No.

157
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm not loving anybody
that I'm not legally required to.

158
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:54,165
Fine. I'll call Bud.

159
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,085
And, Eric,
I'll deal with you later.

160
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,059
Thank you.

161
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,675
Mommy, I don't feel so good.

162
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,816
If you're gonna get sick again,
why don't you throw up under the tree...

163
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:11,537
because Christmas is ruined!

164
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:18,321
Oh, no.

165
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:25,428
So, tell me more
about the big ladder thingy.

166
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:28,561
Oh, the cherry picker?
Funny story. True story.

167
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:35,053
Okay, Jackie, this is a nightmare,
and we're leaving.

168
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:39,760
Okay. Look, Donna,
you have a boyfriend, I don't.

169
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,219
And maybe I don't want
to sit home alone every night.

170
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:46,353
And if somebody doesn't tell me I'm cute
in the next five minutes, I'm gonna scream!

171
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,927
Hi. Sorry. My friend
was being a wet blanket.

172
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:54,032
Well, maybe I
should talk to her.

173
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:56,274
I mean, a wet blanket's
a fireman's best friend.

174
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,828
Boy, something about you
is so familiar.

175
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,757
I get that all the time.

176
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,677
See from the right,
I look like Gidget...

177
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,782
and from the left,
I look like Elizabeth Taylor.

178
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:11,888
- Neat, huh?
- Nah. It's...

179
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,846
Oh, it's your laugh!

180
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,739
You know, I used to date a girl with the
same laugh, but, uh, it was 20 years ago.

181
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:20,596
She dumped me and married
some rich lawyer.

182
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:22,997
Burk... Burkhart! That was it.

183
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:27,764
Oh, my God, that's my name!
And my dad's a rich lawyer!

184
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,740
Oh, my God!

185
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,695
So, Jackie, was this
in the play you wrote?

186
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:48,302
Kitty, why are you smoking?

187
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,750
It's my Yuletide cigarette.

188
00:12:55,126 --> 00:13:00,309
To celebrate all the children who spend
black Christmases with bad parents.

189
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,026
Kitty, put that out.

190
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,180
Back off, Grinch.

191
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:16,459
Hey, Red. Hey, Kitty.

192
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,738
Bad parent.

193
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:22,677
- Is she all right?
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.

194
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:25,230
Uh, sit down, Bud.

195
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:27,343
Kitty, sweetheart...

196
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,445
why don't you leave us
alone for a minute?

197
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:33,995
A boy can't live on olives.

198
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,268
Bud...

199
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,622
Eric just came back from your place
falling-down drunk.

200
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,790
He threw up on my shoes.

201
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:52,590
Now, what were you thinking,
leaving kids alone with a keg?

202
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:57,550
Look, Red, I've never
really been a dad before.

203
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:01,681
I-I'm just trying to...
I don't know...

204
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,605
take it easy, be his friend.

205
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,387
Why would you be friends
with a 17-year-old?

206
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:09,867
They're idiots.

207
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:15,376
Bud, being a teenager
is like being in combat.

208
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:17,617
One minute you're
crawling around half blind...

209
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,207
the next, you're looking
for your own foot.

210
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:25,590
- Follow me?
- Not really.

211
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:29,396
I was a conscientious...
Canadian.

212
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:34,541
Well, if you weren't chicken
and you did fight...

213
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:36,622
who would you want
as your lieutenant, me or you?

214
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:40,950
Well, you, 'cause you're mean and scary.

215
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,397
That's right.

216
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,089
Steven doesn't need
another friend, Bud.

217
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,296
Steven needs somebody
to ride his ass.

218
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:53,169
He may not like it.
He may not thank you for it.

219
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:58,573
He may... do impressions of you
behind your back.

220
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,896
He thinks he's so damn funny.

221
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:13,648
But the point is, he'll know right
from wrong because you did your job.

222
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:15,409
Huh.

223
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:23,724
Bread, ham, bananas, milk. Because
there are four food groups, Bud! Four!

224
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:36,621
I am so grossed out.

225
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:41,451
I need a Calgon bath, a facial,
some Tater Tots and some Jean Natי.

226
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,219
- This night was the worst.
- I know.

227
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,945
I mean, I am not
gonna find love in a bar.

228
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,658
All I'm gonna find there
are guys who used to French my mom.

229
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,724
Just this morning, I was playing
with My Pretty Ponies.

230
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,699
Look what you've done to me!
Look!

231
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:03,727
Me? I'm not the one who hooked up
with the volunteer fire department.

232
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:06,897
I am never gonna meet anybody...

233
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,261
and I'm never, ever
gonna feel better, ever.

234
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,935
Jackie, when you're sad, you look
exactly like Mary Tyler Moore.

235
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:24,531
Oh, my God! Donna, I do.

236
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:26,802
I am gonna make it after all!

237
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,116
Damn!

238
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:38,636
Okay, everybody, here we go.

239
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,191
Now, if I catch on fire,
you promise to put me out?

240
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,683
Well, I'm sure someone will.
Right, guys?

241
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:49,804
Okay, great.

242
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:52,780
Steven, I gotta tal...

243
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:55,724
- What the hell are you doing?
- It is complicated.

244
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:59,114
All right. That's it.
Party's over. Everybody out.

245
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,077
What the hell
are you doing, Bud?

246
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:03,793
Steven, this place
is a madhouse.

247
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:06,961
There are kids all over the place,
and this guy could've burst into flames.

248
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:10,795
We'll never know now,
will we, Bud?

249
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:18,931
Look, Eric went home so drunk,
he threw up all over Red's shoes.

250
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,306
- That's good stuff.
- No, it's not good stuff.

251
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,229
And you know what else?
It's forbidden.

252
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,236
So, what, are you trying
to play father now?

253
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,612
I'm not playing.
I am your father.

254
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,565
You wanna stay here,
you're gonna do what I tell you.

255
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:34,996
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really!

256
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:40,299
I'll be damned if you're gonna end up
looking for your own foot on my watch!

257
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:47,851
Now, clean up all this crap, take the
trash out and eat a banana, dumb-ass!

258
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:02,895
Now he's all strict.
I gotta do my homework...

259
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:05,748
and he keeps talking
about nutrition.

260
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:11,692
So, I guess what I'm
hearing from all this is...

261
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,612
Hyde loves his daddy!

262
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:19,118
- Shut up, Forman. I do not.
- Yes, you do!

263
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,099
Yes, you do!

264
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:23,989
And Daddy loves his little Hyde!

265
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:28,080
And that's why he yells at him
and tucks him into bed...

266
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,452
and puts on his little
footsie pajamas...

267
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,722
and reads him bedtime stories!

268
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,579
Hey, thanks, Steven.
I'll take over from here.

269
00:18:42,518 --> 00:18:44,656
- Now, about last night...
- You know what, Dad?

270
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,061
Uh, before you get started,
I know what you're gonna say.

271
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,803
Oh, really? What do you know?

272
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,533
Um, that I was
irresponsible and stupid.

273
00:18:56,598 --> 00:19:01,933
And I have it on good authority that I...
may have called you something.

274
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:09,904
Like, um,
"big, bald party pooper?"

275
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:14,836
For instance.

276
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:18,862
But the point is, Dad,
I'm really ashamed and sorry...

277
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:22,127
and afraid.

278
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:25,460
Hmm.

279
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:28,275
Okay.

280
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,251
Well, that covers it.

281
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:34,164
Okay. Good talk.

282
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,081
That's it?

283
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,005
I get off scot-free?

284
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,980
I mean, I learned
a valuable lesson?

285
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,688
Look, Son, you're grown up now.

286
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,667
You know what you did wrong.

287
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:59,499
And I am too tired to keep thinking up
new and exciting ways to punish you.

288
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,106
So... Merry Christmas.

289
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:07,182
Are you kidding me?

290
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:10,188
I don't get in trouble, and you're
giving me a Christmas present?

291
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:14,352
Oh, boy, this is
the best Christmas ever!

292
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,942
Actually, you know,
this really smells.

293
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,348
Yeah, those are my shoes
from last night.

294
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,380
Clean 'em,
buff'em and shine 'em.

295
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,897
Ho, ho, ho.

296
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:35,212
Dumb-ass!

297
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,903
Damn.

298
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,432
Damn it!

299
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,999
Oh, come on!

300

1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,920
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
Hey, Red.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello, boys.
You're up bright and early this morning.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,320
Yeah.
We're going to Funland!

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,840
It's super fun!

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,040
Oh, Red, remember how we used
to take Eric there when he was little?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,800
Remember how I used to get on
the roller-coaster with him...

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,120
and then, just before we took off,
I'd jump out and wave good-bye?

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,840
Boy, did he scream.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,600
Well, it sounds like fun.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,520
Super fun!

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,840
And we figured Eric could use some fun,
you know, since he and Donna broke up.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,840
- What?
- Broke up?

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,720
Yeah, I heard Donna
dumped his ass.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,320
That's funny.
I heard Eric was the one who dumped Donna.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,760
- Sure, he did.
- Yeah, right.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,440
Well, Eric must be just a wreck.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,074

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,520
Fine.
I'll just listen to A.M.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,960
That's just cruel.

20
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,380
Come on, Forman.
Get out of bed.

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,660
Yes, we have to go to Funland
before all the fun is gone.

22
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,060
I'm not going.

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,500
- Geez.
- Forman, man, snap out of it.

24
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,420
So you had one of the hottest chicks
in Point Place and you blew it.

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Could be worse.

26
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,100
No, it couldn't.

27
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,260
Eric, it's not all bad.

28
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,140
Think about Bob being
your father-in-law.

29
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,060
That guy'd be in all
your wedding pictures.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,860
Guys, I don't want
to talk about Donna...

31
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,300
and I don't want to go to Funland.

32
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,540
Fine. If you're not going with us,
we'll stay here with you.

33
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,540
We're not going to Funland?

34
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,580
Don't...

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,700
touch the G.I. Joes.

36
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,460
- Hey, Eric, did you...
- Hey, buddy, can we not talk?

37
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,980
Thanks.

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,620
Fine.
We're going to Funland.

39
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,460
Good. Go.

40
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,340
You know what?
I'm glad you are not going to Funland...

41
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,020
because you will suck the fun
right out of it.

42
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,780
And then... And then it would
just be called "Landland."

43
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm sorry. I'll get you
a candy apple, okay?

44
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,700
Okay, okay, I got Eric out of bed.
He's on his way down.

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,580
Now remember,
don't say anything about Donna.

46
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,540
He'll talk
when he's ready.

47
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,580
Okay.

48
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,100
Gee, Son, you look like
you've just been dumped.

49
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,740
I wasn't dumped, okay?

50
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,580
We broke up.

51
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,580
Yeah, well, run it off.

52
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,820
Do you want to
talk about it, honey?

53
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,420
No.

54
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,380
Okay.

55
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,540
Are you sure?

56
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,980
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

57
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,820
Okay. Let's not talk.

58
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,540
Eric, you are a handsome young man
with a lot to offer.

59
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,060
Okay.
Can I go now?

60
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,580
No, no, no.
Not until you eat.

61
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,780
You look like you
haven't eaten for a week.

62
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,020
Oh, come on, Kitty.
He always looks like that.

63
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,940
Well, maybe so.

64
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,500
But he won't have the strength
to get over Donna if he doesn't eat.

65
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,500
Fine!

66
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,180
I'll eat.

67
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,620
Just no more
talking about Donna.

68
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,660
For one minute,
I'd like to not...

69
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,580
think about Donna.

70
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,260
No Donna.

71
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,380
- Red, you should go talk to him.
- What?

72
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,780
Why me?

73
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,860
Because I don't really know
how to mend a broken heart.

74
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,300
I've never been dumped.

75
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,820
Oh, I don't believe that.

76
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,780
Why not?

77
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,140
Well, there are certain things
about you that are annoying...

78
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,340
that other people might not
have been as tolerant of.

79
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,060
You're bald!

80
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,180
See? Like that!

81
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,140
Okay, Michael,
we have to stay together.

82
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,060
Every time we come here
you get lost.

83
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,740
Damn, Jackie,
there's fun around every corner.

84
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,420
Michael, what are the rules?

85
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,140
Uh, no hitting you from
behind with the bumper cars.

86
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,860
And?

87
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,140
And...

88
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,180
no riding the goats
at the petting zoo.

89
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,140
And?

90
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,900
- We have to stay together, Michael!
- Fine!

91
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
- Balloons!
- Stay!

92
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,420
Hey there, kids!

93
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,820
I'm Woofy, the Funland Dog, and I'm here
to make sure that you have fun, fun, fun!

94
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,620
Touch me like that again...

95
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,020
you're gonna eat your Alpo
through a straw, straw, straw!

96
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,940
Oh. Okeydokey.

97
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,380
Well, I'm going down to the saloon
to look for the guy who shot my paw.

98
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,700
Oh, my God!
That was Woofy, and he talked to us!

99
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,140
Guys, we gotta pick a place to meet
in case we split up.

100
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,020
How about the corner
of Fun Street and Fun Boulevard?

101
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,260
I mean, that should be easy enough
for even Michael to remember.

102
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,820
Michael?

103
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,020
- Great. Now we'll never find him.
- Sure we will.

104
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,620
All we have to do is show people his picture,
and they'll help us find him.

105
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,340
You have a picture
of Kelso in your wallet?

106
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,460
Of course.
I carry pictures of all my friends.

107
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,380
You're friends
with Nipsey Russell?

108
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,340
I want to be.

109
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,660
I know he's in there.
Go talk to him.

110
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,180
- I don't want to.
- Fine.

111
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,260
But when I broke up with Archie Wilkins,
he lived with his parents until he was 40.

112
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,860
Good God, Kitty.

113
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,180
That's another 23 years!

114
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,220
All right.
I'm going in.

115
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,700
Hey, Eric.

116
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,660
How you doin'?

117
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,620
Dad, I'm really not
in the mood for conversation.

118
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,700
Good. Then I'll talk
and you listen.

119
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,060
I ever tell you the story...

120
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,100
about Larry "No Foot" Mulligan?

121
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,900
Well, I can guess.

122
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,860
He had no foot?

123
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,740
Larry was a buddy of mine
who lost his foot during the war.

124
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,340
And then, on his way
back to the States...

125
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,260
ol' One Foot...

126
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,620
at that point
we were calling him One Foot...

127
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,100
had his ship go down...

128
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,660
and a shark
ate his other foot.

129
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,620
But he made it
all the way back home.

130
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,900
And do you know what happened to him
when he got here?

131
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,740
He overcame his handicap...

132
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,340
and, ironically,
became a shoe salesman?

133
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,540
No.

134
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,500
His girlfriend dumped him.

135
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,300
Well, thank God
it had a happy ending.

136
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,460
Look, the point of the story is,
you've got both feet.

137
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,660
You'll be fine.

138
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,220
Now, put some shoes on,
go on down and trim the hedges.

139
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,820
Yeah. Well, you know,
I think I'm just gonna stay up here.

140
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,460
Yeah. Well, you know,
I think you're <i>not.</i>

141
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,940
Hi.
Have you seen him?

142
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,900
His name is Kelso.

143
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,740
Kelso's trapped in a box?

144
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,060
Hey!
Fez, check it out.

145
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,020
"Fun University."

146
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,980
Now check out the back.

147
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,860
"F.U."

148
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,900
I don't get it.

149
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,460
F.U., man.

150
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,460
F.U.!

151
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,660
Oh, right.
"Fu."

152
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,700
That's a good one.
That's a good one.

153
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,460
I tried to look for Michael,
but I can't see over the crowd.

154
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,300
I wish Donna was here.
She's a giant.

155
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,100
Don't remind me.

156
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,980
I asked her and asked her and asked her
to come, and she just kept saying...

157
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
"Get out of my bathroom, Fez!"

158
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,980
Well, we still have to find Michael.
What time is it?

159
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,100
Did someone ask
what time it is?

160
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,900
Why, here in Funland,
it's always "Fun o'clock!"

161
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,540
Yeah, yeah,
thanks a lot, you morons.

162
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,620
Hey, you guys wouldn't happen
to know what time it is, would you?

163
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,620
Oh, yeah!

164
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,060
Rock on!

165
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,980
I thought we were in love.

166
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,980
Oh, God.

167
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,420
And then it all
just blows apart.

168
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,500
And all that's left
is this big hole, you know?

169
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,580
Uh, no, I don't.

170
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,860
Oh! But there is
a gopher hole out back.

171
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,940
And if you shove the hose down
and flush him out...

172
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,700
I'll stand at the other end
and hit him in the head with a shovel.

173
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,460
Uh-huh.
Just go, Dad.

174
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,420
Thanks.
Thank you.

175
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,500
Well, I see sunshine outside,
but I don't see sunshine inside.

176
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,660
Wanna talk about
the breakup, Bambi?

177
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,500
No, Dad, I don't
want to talk about it.

178
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,420
You know, we were happy.

179
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,340
But he had to push me.

180
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,220
He had to define everything
and get his little ring on me.

181
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,100
By the time it was over,
we weren't even together anymore.

182
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm fine.

183
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,260
Son of a bitch.

184
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,140
Listen, when you're done...

185
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,380
I know, I know.
Put the bags on the curb.

186
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,020
- Hey.
- "Hey"?

187
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,660
Is that all you have
to say to me?

188
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,060
Well, what do you
have to say to me?

189
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,980
Huh.

190
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,380
How about this?
"Hey."

191
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,180
- I'm not wrong!
- You <i>are</i> wrong, you dill-hole!

192
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,860
Oh, great. That's nice.
That's really mature.

193
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,060
Double dill-hole!

194
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,860
"Double dill-hole"?

195
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,020
Oh, geez! You were outside.
You were happy.

196
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,300
Why are you back in bed?

197
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,780
Well, I guess all
that fresh air...

198
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,460
got me thinking
that I'd rather be in bed.

199
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,340
Yeah, well, get up.
It's time to go to work.

200
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,340
Fine.

201
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,460
Oh, and, uh, you don't have
to worry about that gopher.

202
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,740
It's as dead
as you and Donna.

203
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,940
Too soon, huh?

204
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,220
I can't believe you two.

205
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,020
Poor Michael is lost, and all you've done
is gone on rides and have fun.

206
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,980
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
The Funland Princess!

207
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,020
The Funland Princess?

208
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,660
I haven't been
on that ride yet.

209
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,420
So, I figured this is the lost and found
and I lost my friends...

210
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,340
so they're bound to show up here
sooner or later.

211
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,660
Right?

212
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,940
I miss my friends.

213
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,180
"I miss my friends."

214
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,980
- What?
- "What?"

215
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,220
- Stop it.
- "Stop it."

216
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,540
- Stop copying me!
- "Stop copying me!"

217
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,740
- I'm stupid.
- You're stupid.

218
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,700
Damn it!

219
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,020
Hey, how about
that new cashier at work?

220
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,980
Not bad, huh?

221
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,500
Single too.

222
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,500
- Dad, I'm not...
- What?

223
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,500
Is it the braces?

224
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,460
Well...

225
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,820
you know what helps a fella
get over a gal?

226
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,740
Pimiento loaf.

227
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,660
What happened here, Red?
I thought you were gonna help him.

228
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,900
Kitty, I yelled at him all day.

229
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,500
I don't know
what else to do.

230
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,900
Well, how did you get through
your first breakup?

231
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,940
What's to get over?

232
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,860
It happened.
I took it like a man.

233
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,300
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

234
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,540
Oh, Eloise.

235
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,660
Oh, Eloise!

236
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,260
My life is over!

237
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,900
Yup.
Took it like a man.

238
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,740
<i>That</i> was
the House of Mirrors?

239
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,700
I have more mirrors
than that in my purse.

240
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,060
Why is everyone leaving?

241
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,980
Oh, my God.
What time is it?

242
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,940
Did someone ask
what time it is?

243
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,060
Yeah, we know.
It's fun o'clock. Get killed.

244
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,500
No, it's closing time, kids.
Time for you to go.

245
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,620
But, Woofy,
we still haven't found our friend.

246
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,140
Yeah? Well, golly gee, that's just too...
Come on! Get out!

247
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,900
Except for you!

248
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,580
- All right. Let's go.
- What about Michael?

249
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,460
Look, there's been lost dogs
who've traveled hundreds of miles...

250
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,860
to be reunited
with their families.

251
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,740
Now, Kelso
is not as smart as that...

252
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,500
but I'm sure he can make it
the 12 miles back to Forman's.

253
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,220
So, me and this girl Eloise
were together for a while.

254
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,140
Everything was great.

255
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,420
But when things started getting serious,
she dumped me.

256
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,980
Man, that...
that hurt like hell.

257
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,060
- Did you cry?
- No!

258
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,020
No, no.

259
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,260
But there were times when I thought
I would never get over it.

260
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,100
But time passed.

261
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,700
I moved on.

262
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,820
And then the day came when
I didn't think about her as much.

263
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,860
Then a couple more days came along,
and, why, I thought about her even less.

264
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,420
Then one day,
I didn't think about her at all.

265
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,580
And then <i>that</i> made me sad.

266
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,220
We've got a little Irish in us,
don't we, Dad?

267
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,380
Yes, we do.

268
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,780
It's just...

269
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,180
It hurts.
You know?

270
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,380
Listen, I'm gonna give you a few days
to pull yourself together.

271
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,460
You can stay in bed and sleep.
Watch TV.

272
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,540
Whatever you need to do.

273
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,540
Thank you, Dad.

274
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,500
And, you know...

275
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,940
not that it matters,
but Donna didn't dump me.

276
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,180
I broke up with her.

277
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,380
Whatever you need to tell yourself
to make it better.

278
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,440
Thanks a lot for the ride,
Mrs. Anderson.

279
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,040
Hey, Einstein,
you gonna eat that ice cream?

280
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
My name's not Einstein.

281
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,240
It's Kelso.
And, yeah, I'm gonna eat it.

282
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,080
That's it.

283
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,120
Get out!

284
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,480
- They started it!
- Get out!

285
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,080
See ya, Einstein.

286
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
It's not Einstein!
It's Kelso!

287
00:21:13,305 --> 00:22:13,507

1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,375
- I had a great time on our date tonight.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,604
When do you think Red's gonna
give you back the keys to the Cruiser?

3
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:14,526
You know,
so we could actually...

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,446
leave the property?

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:20,062
I don't know. Maybe never.

6
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,942
In fact, you're my only contact
with the outside world now, Donna.

7
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:27,001
Do... people still laugh out there?
I miss the laughter.

8
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:30,711
Well, Eric,
it's your own stupid fault.

9
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:35,769
I mean, before you opened your big mouth, Red
actually believed that smell was incense.

10
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,978
Yeah, I know. It's just...

11
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:41,463
He was gonna kick Hyde out,
and I wanted to help, and...

12
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:44,765
Oh, helping never helps.

13
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:47,165
Eric, let's not waste time
talkin' about this.

14
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:49,086
How long to the curfew?

15
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,486
Uh, about one minute.

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,656
Now, Donna,
I'm not bragging, but...

17
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:56,793
if you're properly motivated, I can
actually do it in that amount of time.

18
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:00,503
You don't have to tell me.

19
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,518
Okay, so...

20
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:06,748
Buckle up, Donna, 'cause the next...
12 seconds are all about you, babe.

21
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:08,670
<i>Five, four...</i>

22
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,645
- three, two, one.
- No, wait. But I... Damn.

23
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,029
Curfew, hophead.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

25
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:50,059
Geez, I wish I had a quarter...

26
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:53,226
for every time I caught you
makin' out with the neighbor girl.

27
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:58,567
I wish I had a quarter for
every time you embarrassed me.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,349
I wish you did too, 'cause
then you'd be a millionaire...

29
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,750
and you could find
someplace else to live.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,120
What? And... leave all this?

31
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:15,241
Okay, fellas. Who wants brownies
and a nice glass of milk?

32
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:17,319
Oh, geez.

33
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,249
Daddy, I think it's great
you gave Eric and Hyde a curfew.

34
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,174
These boys, they need structure.

35
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,127
Well, I'll see ya.

36
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:28,232
Where do you think you're going?

37
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:30,791
To... night church?

38
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,982
Sorry, honey.
Curfew's for everyone.

39
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:39,624
But, Daddy, it's me!

40
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,589
Look, what they did is bad...

41
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,493
but you sneakin' around with Kelso,
that's just... unpleasant.

42
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:51,309
But, Daddy,
I'm not seeing Kelso.

43
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,547
- Untrue!
- A damnable lie!

44
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:58,286
A curfew?

45
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:01,385
I'm stuck in this house
with you people all night? This sucks!

46
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:04,205
Well, we're just
<i>thrilled</i> about it.

47
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,890
All right. There's an upside to all this.
I took her down with me.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,814
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

49
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,702
Well, isn't this a happy house?

50
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,637
Yeah.

51
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,652
This is <i>not</i> a happy house.

52
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,858
Well, you just said
this was a happy house.

53
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:30,601
Well, that's not what I meant.
It was sarcasm.

54
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,053
Who the hell knows what you mean,
when you won't say what you mean?

55
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,654
I don't like how you're
treating the children.

56
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:42,280
Look, Kitty.

57
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:45,831
I'm not gonna let our kids
go down the wrong path.

58
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:49,700
- But if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.
- Okay.

59
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,965
Maybe you could be a little less strict
and a little more loving.

60
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:02,606
Okay, Kitty.
Enough with the sarcasm.

61
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,981
Stop looking at me.
Stop looking at me. Stop looking at me.

62
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:20,421
Please look at me. Hey! Psst.

63
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:24,107
I love you, Steven.
I have secret love powers.

64
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:26,030
Look at me!

65
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:30,187
Hmm. I have 29 teeth.

66
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:34,346
No, that can't be right.
One, two, three...

67
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:39,494
Jackie's in love with Hyde,
and I have nothing.

68
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,477
Oh, look. I found an M&M.

69
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,038
Oh, no.

70
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,664
My life sucks.

71
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,022
Okay, I really hope
no one smelled that.

72
00:04:56,975 --> 00:05:00,685
All right!
I'm the best-looking person in this room.

73
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:04,680
No. In this whole town.

74
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,336
No! No, in this whole state.

75
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:10,310
No.

76
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,918
Dumb-asses.

77
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:19,180
So, how's it going?

78
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,102
Real good.

79
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,486
The foreign kid just
ate somethin' off the floor.

80
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:33,893
Okay, well, um...
Your father's gonna drive me to work.

81
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,782
That's right. And if you do
anything wrong, I'll know...

82
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,847
because one of you is a snitch.

83
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,748
<i>You just think about that
while I'm gone.</i>

84
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,863
Well, they're not gonna do
anything wrong...

85
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:50,059
because I brought a box of activities
to occupy their time.

86
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:54,153
So, um... Be good and have fun.

87
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:56,263
Do crafts, not drugs!

88
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,102
Ooh, a model airplane and glue.

89
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,582
Where's Steven and Eric?

90
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:20,168
Um... Your hair is very pretty.

91
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,491
Oh, they can't leave the house.
They're grounded.

92
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,763
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're at The Hub.

93
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,464
Oh, no. I am the snitch.

94
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:34,318
Oh, Red is gonna be furious.

95
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:36,838
Mrs. Forman, may I tell you
a little story about oppression?

96
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,398
Okay.

97
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,608
Once I had an ant farm.

98
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,719
And they would not
build their tunnels.

99
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:52,907
I was furious, so I became
very strict and stern with my ants.

100
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,033
First they feared me,
and everything was fine...

101
00:06:57,103 --> 00:07:00,420
but eventually the ants
broke out and attacked me.

102
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:07,145
So I had to kill them.

103
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:11,659
So, um, you think we're being
too hard on the kids?

104
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:14,637
Well, I don't know about that.

105
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:17,964
I just wanted to let you know that
I'm really sad because my ants are dead.

106
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,598
Okay. Well, Fez, thanks.

107
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,085
You're a good boy.

108
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,308
All the ladies want a piece of Fez.

109
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:36,365
What are you doing?

110
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:38,918
Oh, just a little
security measure...

111
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,479
in case anybody tries to escape.

112
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:46,570
Red, no. Those are my Christmas bells.
Those are happy bells.

113
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,539
Well, then they're
doing their job...

114
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:52,462
because I'm happy.

115
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,439
Let's have some cake.

116
00:07:55,503 --> 00:08:01,002
Okay. And let's watch some TV,
because that makes us all happy.

117
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,542
Okay, here we go.
<i>The Brady Bunch Variety Hour</i> is on.

118
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,454
Oh, who the hell gave those
people an entire hour?

119
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,023
Well, I think this program
is fun for the whole family.

120
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:19,213
They've got... They've got Charo and...
and the rock band KISS.

121
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,446
Okay, see? Now, this is nice.

122
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,545
A nice family who gets along
<i>and</i> sings <i>and</i> dances.

123
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,878
Yeah, I love the Bradys.

124
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,626
Oh, remember that episode
where Mr. Brady went completely insane...

125
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:38,509
and put bells on all the doors?

126
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:52,870
Hey, did you see the one
where Greg was a real wiseass...

127
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,355
and Mr. Brady took him outside
and cleaned his clock?

128
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,697
Did you ever see the one
where I hated living here?

129
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,281
That one's my favorite.

130
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,732
Well, I hope you're happy,
because now you've upset your sister.

131
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:14,026
Oh... You know what?
Forget it, Dad.

132
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,233
Enjoy yourself.
Get your shots in now.

133
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:19,173
Because when I'm gone,
oh, I'm gonna be long gone.

134
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,557
I got no place to go, so...

135
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,054
I'm gonna stay here.

136
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,957
But the tension's nice.

137
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,365
Reminds me of home.

138
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,949
Finally.

139
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,054
Now I can enjoy
the show in peace.

140
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:51,370
Oh, this show is crap.

141
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,078
- Feel funky
- Whoo!

142
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:01,998
- Feel good
- Whoo!

143
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:05,641
Gonna tell you
I'm in the neighborhood

144
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:09,289
Gonna fly
like a bird on the wing

145
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,582
Hold on to your hat, honey
Sing, sing, sing, sing

146
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:17,225
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

147
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:20,678
I got the music in me

148
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:24,744
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

149
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:27,019
I got the music in me

150
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,974
Yeah

151
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,049
Thank you. Thank you.

152
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:38,218
And welcome to
<i>The Forman Bunch Variety Hour.</i>

153
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:43,557
And, boy, do we have
a great show for you tonight.

154
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:46,794
Sorry, Mom.
We can't stay for the show.

155
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:49,612
<i>No!</i>

156
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,686
Why not?

157
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,429
Living at home is unbearable,
so we've decided to... run away.

158
00:10:56,495 --> 00:11:00,838
- <i>No!</i>
- Yea!

159
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,733
So, thanks for everything,
Mrs. F.

160
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,774
Well, you boys can't run away.

161
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:07,661
Who's gonna do the square dance
with Shields and Yarnell?

162
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:11,785
Well, let Laurie do it.
She's been makin' out with Shields all day.

163
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:14,797
That's a lie!

164
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:20,811
Well, when will I see you again?

165
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,334
Don't worry, Kitty.
I'll take care of them.

166
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:31,044
Ladies and gentlemen,
star of stage and screen, Shirley Jones.

167
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,032
Hi, Mom.

168
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:40,299
- Mom?
- That's right, Kitty.

169
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,530
- We're Partridges now.
- This is gonna be great.

170
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,021
I'm pretty sure
I can nail Susan Dey.

171
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:53,124
No. Partridges?

172
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:56,745
You can't live in a bus.
There's no toilet.

173
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:02,412
Well, it may be inconvenient, Kitty, but
we do get to spend a lot of time together.

174
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:05,643
That's right. Mrs. Partridge quit her job
to form a family band.

175
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,850
Yep. It's all a matter
of choices, Kitty.

176
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,268
I guess you just
chose to be a bad mother.

177
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:16,679
Hey, Shirley. Can I come?
I play the tambourine.

178
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,453
Oh, I'm sorry, Laurie.
No whores on my show.

179
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,737
Oh, fine. Hey, Shields. Wait up!

180
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:34,343
Aaah! Cuchi-cuchi-cuchi!

181
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:37,317
- Whoa, whoa...
- Can it, Charo.

182
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah!

183
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,869
Well, I am not gonna
let that happen.

184
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:51,910
Oh, no. This <i>is</i> crap.

185
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:11,629
Oh, no. Honey.

186
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:14,861
Yep. He thought
he could sneak out.

187
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:18,309
So. What now, Ho Chi Minh?

188
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,895
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Playtime is over.

189
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,267
Your friends are no longer
allowed in the house.

190
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:27,847
- Wait. What?
- No, no. We'll talk about it in the morning.

191
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,471
Fine, we'll talk about it
in the morning.

192
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:35,723
We'll talk about how your friends
are no longer allowed in the house.

193
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:41,090
You know,
I have an interesting idea.

194
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,271
Why don't we <i>not</i> punish him?

195
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:47,171
Why don't we try a little of that forgiveness
that Jesus was always talking about?

196
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,162
No, no.
This is for his own good.

197
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,328
Look, in order for Eric to be
a happy, well-adjusted adult...

198
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,667
he has to be miserable now.

199
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:06,507
That's just good parenting.

200
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:08,516
If I was to be
Mr. Nice Guy now...

201
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,493
do you know what would happen
to Eric in a few years?

202
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,185
Do you?

203
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,621
Oh, Eric. Breakfast.

204
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,190
Well, there's
my sweet little baby boy.

205
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:30,502
Why oh why
didn't I discipline you?

206
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:32,581
Shut up and eat your cornflakes.

207
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,931
That's what.

208
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:45,795
Never surrender, Kitty.
Never retreat. We're winning.

209
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,318
The fact that Eric was desperate enough
to climb out his window...

210
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,692
shows that
everything is working.

211
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,443
Surprise.

212
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:06,955
This is so great.
I didn't... know you delivered.

213
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,828
<i>Bed check, dumb-ass.</i>

214
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:12,748
Holy crap.

215
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,202
No, it is not a bed check.

216
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,125
We just wanna say good night...

217
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,841
and... and we love you very, very much.

218
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,398
What are you doing?

219
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,325
Oh, just nailing
his window shut.

220
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:29,509
- For his own good.
- What if there's a fire?

221
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:34,438
Well, then I guess you can just
light your dope with it, dopehead.

222
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,085
Donna!

223
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,216
- Get out.
- Whoa. Not so fast, Laurie.

224
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:53,835
Oh. Ow! Ow!

225
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,040
You idiot!
Red's doing bed checks.

226
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,052
<i>Bed check.</i>

227
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:11,368
And bless Mommy
and bless Daddy...

228
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,772
and bless Grandma...

229
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,641
Oh. Hi, Daddy.

230
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:20,515
Sorry to bother you, kitten.

231
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:28,293
Kelso, get your hand off my ass.

232
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,221
- It was an accident.
- Shh!

233
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:33,581
- It's still there.
- It's still an accident.

234
00:16:33,646 --> 00:16:35,556
- Kelso, it's still there!
- Yeah.

235
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,653
You know, Steven...

236
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:43,882
this hatred thing you have for me
is just you protecting yourself.

237
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,187
- Okay.
- It's true.

238
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:48,109
You're afraid to reach
the peaks of love...

239
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,148
for fear of
being dropped off a cliff.

240
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:55,658
Well, I'm your
safety line, Steven.

241
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:59,628
So grab me.

242
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,540
Go grab yourself, freak.

243
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,630
<i>Okay, bed check. Here we come.</i>

244
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,905
- Get out!
- <i>Kitty, you're warning him.</i>

245
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:11,624
<i>I'm not warning anybody. Getting closer!</i>

246
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:16,844
Okay, um...

247
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:18,884
We just... We wanted to say good night...

248
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,813
<i>And, um,
that you're a good boy...</i>

249
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:25,133
and even though you do some things
that we don't like, we still love you.

250
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:27,237
And I'm watching you.

251
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:32,613
And I'm cherishing you.

252
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:40,422
Oh, no, Jackie. They're still out there.

253
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,651
What was that?
Oh, and they want our pants.

254
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,460
You hear that?

255
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:54,914
I don't hear anything.

256
00:17:56,462 --> 00:18:01,830
That's right. Nothing.
That's the sound of discipline.

257
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,398
No, that's the sound of jail.

258
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:11,845
This house used to be fun,
until you made it miserable.

259
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:15,017
Well, I'm sorry, Kitty,
but I think it's working.

260
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:23,242
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, I do.

261
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,500
- Oh, you do?
- I just said I did.

262
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,421
Red.

263
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:31,624
Oh! Hell's bells!

264
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,760
It's Red! Run for it!

265
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:38,694
Freeze!

266
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:41,449
Daddy, thank God you came.
They were kidnapping me!

267
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,572
Oh, shut up. That's it.
I have had it.

268
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,849
You know what this means?
More discipline.

269
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:52,358
- No. No.
- Oh, yes. Playtime is over.

270
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,601
Oh, stop saying that.

271
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,149
Your cracking down
is not working.

272
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,010
Hell, I could've
told him that a week ago.

273
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:04,771
Now is not the time
to be a porky mouth.

274
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,518
Red, I want my house back.

275
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:13,483
- I once had an ant farm...
- Oh, honey, no. Not now.

276
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,597
Okay. Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

277
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:22,564
You are going to remember
that he's a good son...

278
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:25,987
and you are going to remember
that he's a good father...

279
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,712
because I am not happy
with the way this house is running.

280
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:32,556
- Now you see what you've done? You've made your mother unhappy.
- No, he didn't.

281
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,621
I'm not happy with everything.

282
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:38,476
I'm not... I'm not happy
with windows being nailed shut...

283
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,858
and I'm not... I'm not happy
with people sneaking around...

284
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:45,163
and... and I'm not happy with
my Christmas bells on the front door.

285
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:50,149
Well, Kitty, what do you want me to do?
Pretend that nothing happened?

286
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,971
Yes.

287
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,012
- No.
- Fine.

288
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:57,290
Then... Then that's it.
Then I'm staying home.

289
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:59,213
I'm staying home full-time,
and I am...

290
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:01,863
I am taking back my house,
and that's the way it is.

291
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:05,578
Now, you get upstairs and take
those nails out of the windows...

292
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:09,094
and <i>you</i> stop being such
a sneaky smart mouth...

293
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,508
and you... Honey, you've gotta
stop eating stuff off the floor.

294
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:16,877
Now, everyone, let's just...

295
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:19,975
Let's go back to happy.

296
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,310
So, I guess... playtime is over.

297
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,917
I'm sorry, I...

298
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:46,097
I don't remember growing older

299
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,966
When did they

300
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,049
- Sunrise
- Sunset

301
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:54,260
- Sunrise
- Sunset

302
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,778
Swiftly fly the years

303
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,811
One season following another

304
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:05,678
Laden with happiness and tears

305
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:09,615
Give it to me one more time, cuchi!

306
00:21:10,305 --> 00:22:10,531

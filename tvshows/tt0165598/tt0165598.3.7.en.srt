1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,589
Hey. Check it out.
I got my first story in the school paper.

2
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:09,566
Neat. Oh. They spelled
your name wrong.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,389
Apparently you're
"Donna Pincipotti."

4
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:17,151
That's funny 'cause it's got
the potty sound in it.

5
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:19,809
Hey, you know what else
is a funny sound?

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,294
Where the hell is Jackie
with your van, man?

7
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,716
- I want to get out of here.
- Ah, she had to help her aunt move a couch.

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,060
Why did you lend Jackie your van?
She hates you, man.

9
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:31,844
Well, I'm trying to
get on her good side, Fez.

10
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,464
I mean, this is a small town
with a limited number of women.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,732
And I've already gone all the way through
'em once, and now I'm back to Jackie.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,575
Oh. And I love her.

13
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:46,944
- Hey.
- Hey. So, how'd it go, baby?

14
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:50,431
- Oh. Great.
- Cool.

15
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,154
Yeah. Oh, except for
when I crashed your van.

16
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,870
But other than that, cool.

17
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,924
How did this happen?
Jackie, how?

18
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,388
- Michael, like I said...
- How?

19
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:11,009
- Coming out of the drive...
- How?

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,178
Kelso. Come on, man. Relax.

21
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,614
Let those of us who aren't you
enjoy this moment.

22
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:21,084
Besides, it's not all that bad.
This door still works.

23
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,254
Hey, Jackie.
What happened to the other door?

24
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,190
Other door?

25
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,719
Yeah, you know,
the thing that always got in the way...

26
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:38,108
of this giant, gaping hole.

27
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,255
Jackie, what are these?

28
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,174
Uh...

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,628
Van sticks.

30
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:50,439
No. Jackie, these...
these are not van sticks.

31
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:53,057
These are drumsticks.

32
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:55,037
Whose drumsticks are they?

33
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,118
Oh, wow, Jackie. What's up?

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,029
Okay. Fine. You know what? I used your van
to drive Chip and his band to a gig.

35
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:07,430
Jackie...

36
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,535
is Chip a girl?

37
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:15,363
Uh, no.

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,854
You had other guys in my van?

39
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,894
You're dating a band?

40
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,406
It wasn't a date. It was a gig.

41
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,676
Whatever it was,
it was a gross misuse of van.

42
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:32,417
And, uh... And you owe me money...
big-time!

43
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,375
<i>I</i> owe <i>you</i> money?

44
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,058
What about all the stuff I bought you
while we were together?

45
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:40,641
That does not count. You gave me
those things so I would love you.

46

Look what I've got.

48
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,608
Ew. What's that?

49
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:28,530
That is Marissa.

50
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,050
Carol's baby.

51
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:34,025
And you promised me last night
that you'd babysit her.

52
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,238
Last night? But I was drunk.

53
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,051
Why can't you do it?

54
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:41,611
Because you promised.

55
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:44,017
And besides...

56
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,662
Your father and I are having fondue
and Parcheesi at the Pinciottis'.

57
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,706
Oh?

58
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,634
Then I'll do it.

59
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,088
No. Laurie can watch this baby tonight.

60
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,050
Oh, golly, Laurie, a baby.

61
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,603
And just in time
for your Black Mass.

62
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,450
Hey. What did I tell you about
calling your sister the devil?

63
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,477
That it's offensive
to the devil?

64
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:14,413
No, Laurie. You can't
feed a baby bacon.

65
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:18,859
Okay, okay.
What color is the baby?

66
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:23,469
Well, good.
Now, if that changes, call me.

67
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,835
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,966
We have just got the cutest little baby
over at our house right now.

69
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:33,832
- Isn't she cute, Red?
- Yeah, I just can't get over it.

70
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,762
Geez, Bob.

71
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:39,089
You got your fingers
in the cheese.

72
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:42,451
Remember how cute Laurie and Eric were
when they were babies?

73
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,719
They used to just
laugh and play.

74
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:48,136
Well, every time I was around
all they did was scream.

75
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:51,146
I just think it would be nice
to have a baby around the house again.

76
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:53,041
Oh, damn it, Bob.

77
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,553
Get your fingers
out of the cheese.

78
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:15,946
Do you think it would still do
this if I stopped feeding it?

79
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,361
Oh, Laurie, let me do that.

80
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:32,082
Wow. How'd you do
that last move?

81
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:34,514
It's all in the wrist.

82
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,816
See?

83
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,792
Hey.

84
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:41,584
- Look at the wrist on my girl.
- Shut up.

85
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,703
Let's go.

86
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:51,147
Wait. Wait, no. Donna, wait.
I think it really likes you.

87
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:53,325
Ooh. I think it just
said your name.

88
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,599
Donna!

89
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:59,274
Hey, you know, you were
really good in there.

90
00:05:59,347 --> 00:06:01,387
Well, it's not exactly
brain surgery.

91
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,110
I know, but it was so cool.

92
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:06,350
It's just...
I think it's really, really...

93
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,394
cool that you can do that.

94
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:11,250
Eric, you're, like,
over the moon...

95
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:13,170
'cause I changed
a poopy diaper, but...

96
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:15,177
when I got my story
in the school paper...

97
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,618
all you said was,
"Yeah, they called you Donna Pincipotti."

98
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,952
It's a funny sound. "Potti."

99
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,962
Come on. Try not to laugh.

100
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,437
That's good.

101
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,743
Come on, Donna.
About the diaper thing...

102
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,699
I was just paying you
a compliment.

103
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:35,538
- What was the compliment?
- That you are gonna be so...

104
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,490
great staying home
with our kids.

105
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,465
What?

106
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:42,987
Eric, how exactly
do you see our future?

107
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:10,385
Okay, okay. That could work.

108
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:13,070
I would just like to adjust
one little thing.

109
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:34,569
Okay. The businesswoman
idea is good.

110
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,449
But what about this?

111
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,840
Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah.

112
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,915
I would just change one thing.

113
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,474
That seems more
hurtful than sexy.

114
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:44,140
Jackass.

115
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,513
So does that.

116
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:52,749
- You owe me money.
- Michael, your uncle gave you that van for free.

117
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:56,115
Yeah? Well, I put a lot of money
into that van.

118
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,066
The shag carpeting...

119
00:08:58,131 --> 00:09:00,105
uh, eight track...

120
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:05,099
strobe light, black light,
red light.

121
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,789
- I hate you.
- Well, I hate you more.

122
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:10,248
- I hate you most.
- Well, I hate you the...

123
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:12,232
Damn it!

124
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,040
All right. All right.
Let's just act like adults...

125
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:19,759
and treat this like
what it really is: A divorce.

126
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:23,215
Oh, Jackie, you get
custody of me.

127
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,194
All right. Let's just figure out
what you guys owe each other.

128
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,555
Fine. I'm not afraid.
I'm right, and he's a total moocher.

129
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:38,125
I'm not afraid either. There are
laws to protect a man and his van.

130
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:41,261
For instance,
the Man-Van Act of 1847.

131
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,228
Right.

132
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,552
All right. All right.

133
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,473
Jackie...

134
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:56,176
in your opinion, what are the goods
and services that Kelso owes you for?

135
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:59,112
Everything.
He was a total doofus before I met him.

136
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:02,154
In fact, I bought you that belt.

137
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,137
So hand it over.
And the shirt too.

138
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:08,368
Fine. You know, this shirt has bad memories
of you buying me stuff anyway.

139
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,432
Here. Let me do the math.

140
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:16,394
Okay. Now, Kelso...

141
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:19,314
Uh, Kelso owes Jackie the price
for breaking her beautiful heart...

142
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,313
and stealing her innocence.

143
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:25,202
Now, Kelso, what do you believe
Jackie owes you?

144
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,715
Well... Uh...

145
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:31,275
W... One time I told her
that she looked pretty...

146
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,234
when really she looked
pretty skanky.

147
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,448
And...

148
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,517
And...

149
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:47,245
Hyde, help me out here.

150
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,224
Okay. Let me think.

151
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,306
Oh. Don't forget
he burned your house.

152
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:55,470
- Hyde.
- Dude, you burned her house.

153
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:03,953
Oh, and that clean baby smell.

154
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:07,346
Yes, but when we had babies...

155
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,680
we couldn't go to
the movies or out to dinner.

156
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:13,292
Oh, Red. When was the last time
we went to the movies or out to dinner?

157
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:16,210
Exactly. Who needs to leave the house
when there are no babies in it?

158
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:21,743
I gotta thank my lucky stars
I got the old snippety-snip.

159
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:25,673
<i>Bob, you mean you just
let some quack remove...</i>

160
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,852
On, no. Nothing's removed.

161
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:31,152
Okay. That's enough of that.

162
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:34,961
Yeah, well, I guess it's okay if it means
you don't have to have any more babies.

163
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,376
Oh, Red, it was fun having babies.
Remember fun?

164
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,298
Yes, Kitty, but it was also
a large responsibility.

165
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,632
Or burden, if you will.

166
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:47,311
Red Forman, I don't want to hear another
word out of you unless it's "I love babies."

167
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:53,519
- Kitty, you're making a scene.
- That is not "I love babies."

168
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,659
Kitty, what's the matter
with you?

169
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,585
Oh, well, I... I don't...

170
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,625
I don't want to ruin
our nice night out...

171
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:05,329
because, boy, Midge, you can really
melt a super pot of cheese, but, um...

172
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,249
I think I want another baby.

173
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,496
Really?

174
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:13,710
You like my cheese?

175
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,843
This is Aqua Net.

176
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:25,216
<i>The same stuff Farrah uses.</i>

177
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:28,828
And she's got a big TV show,
and she's married to Lee Majors.

178
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,281
So, Aqua Net, very important.

179
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,777
Oh, come on, Red.

180
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,593
Oh, look how sweet this baby is.
Just hold it.

181
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:43,198
Look, Kitty. I didn't touch our kids when they
were babies, and I'm not touching this one.

182
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:46,463
- Red Forman, you touch this baby.
- Nope.

183
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:47,992
- <i>Touch it.</i>
- Not happening.

184
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:56,924
Is this child wearing lip liner?

185
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:09,661
So, turns out my supersensitive guy
boyfriend wants me to be a baby machine.

186
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,836
What a dill-hole.

187
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:17,569
Donna, I'm sitting right here.

188
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,436
That's why I said it,
you dill-hole.

189
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:24,474
Donna, the only reason I thought
you'd stay home with the babies...

190
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:28,409
is because only every woman has done it
for the entire history of time.

191
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:32,639
So, don't be mad at me.
Be mad at your... foremothers.

192
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,512
Yeah.

193
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,561
That is so typical.

194
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,831
As if every woman wants to spend
her life as a pampered housewife...

195
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,194
raising kids
and organizing the help.

196
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,145
Wait. Isn't that
what every woman wants?

197
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,025
Donna, man...

198
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:52,058
Forman's just limited
by his experiences.

199
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,775
As the voice of a new generation
of smart, independent women...

200
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:59,617
you need to make this dill-hole realize
that a mind and spirit like yours...

201
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,690
has more options
than your mothers had.

202
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,299
Yeah.

203
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:08,640
Sorry. What?

204
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:11,074
All right, Donna. So...

205
00:14:11,138 --> 00:14:13,047
are we cool?

206
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:27,288
I'm not wrong.
Women take care of babies.

207
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:29,915
- <i>They do.</i>
- Listen to him, Marissa.

208
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:32,669
He whines like a girl,
but he's not a girl.

209
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,735
Or maybe he is.

210
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,844
The thing is,
Donna's really good at it.

211
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:42,297
I mean, I could understand you not wanting
to stay home with your children.

212
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,272
You already have
such a fulfilling career as a whore.

213
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:51,073
Listen, twerp.

214
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,302
Did you ever think maybe it's not that
she doesn't want to have babies?

215
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:57,088
Maybe she just doesn't want to have
your skinny, whiny...

216
00:14:57,155 --> 00:15:00,286
girl-trapped-in-a-boy-body
babies.

217
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,696
Okay. That's one for you.

218
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:19,453
I'm cold.

219
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:21,759
That must be why
your nipples are so pointy.

220
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,697
Oh, pointy nipple man is mad.

221
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:40,091
I hope he doesn't poke me
with his pointy nipples.

222
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:47,329
All right.
That was really disturbing.

223
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:49,980
Okay. Here we go.

224
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:53,695
According to my calculations,
for repairs to the van...

225
00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:55,671
Jackie, you owe Kelso $65.

226
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,267
Aha! Justice!

227
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,623
Yeah.

228
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:09,952
And, Kelso, you owe Jackie...

229
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,474
$8,265.

230
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:14,587
Pay up, moocher!

231
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:17,342
Wha... Wha... No, no.

232
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,352
This is...
That's totally unfair!

233
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:21,281
Hyde, you suck.

234
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:25,023
You could have been a man and forgiven her.
But no. You wanted to do the math.

235
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,439
Man, math has never
been my friend.

236
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:31,613
Wait. No. But she had
other guys in my van.

237
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:35,195
Michael, you had other girls
in your van <i>while</i> we were dating.

238
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,154
So, give me my $8,000.

239
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:42,299
Okay. I change my mind.
I forgive you.

240
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:52,287
See, if we had
a baby right now...

241
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,242
we could be giving it a bath.

242
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,924
We could be putting it
in its warm little jammies.

243
00:16:56,994 --> 00:17:00,791
Yeah. It's a shame that
we have to crawl into bed...

244
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:04,412
for eight hours of
uninterrupted sleep instead.

245
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,370
Come on.

246
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,507
You don't really want
another baby.

247
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,433
Well, I don't know.

248
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:13,433
I only have a few years left
where I even have the option.

249
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:18,460
Well, just because you can have a baby
doesn't mean you should.

250
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:23,287
I have a snowblower,
but I don't use it in July.

251
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,499
Red, it just...

252
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,327
It feels like maybe we've done everything
important there is to do.

253
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:38,199
We saved up.
We got our house. We had our kids.

254
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,314
Now what's left
to look forward to?

255
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:42,296
Peace and quiet.

256
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:49,281
Well...

257
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:52,794
I just can't believe we're never gonna hear
that sound in our house again.

258
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,714
Well, until we have
grandchildren.

259
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,378
Grandchildren!

260
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:08,411
Oh, I forgot about
grandchildren!

261
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:15,386
So did I.

262
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:22,175
Oh, boy.

263
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:26,912
I like the looks of that.
My baby with a baby.

264
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:28,888
It's not that hard.

265
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:31,613
I heard her crying,
and I figured she needed a bottle...

266
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,624
and it turned out that she did.

267
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:37,431
<i>So, um...</i>

268
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:41,143
you think you might want
a baby of your own?

269
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:45,495
Well, yeah. I mean, once my looks
start to go, why not?

270
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:51,769
All right. So, how many kids
are we talking here?

271
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:53,915
One? Two? Six?

272
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:56,801
Whoa, Mom. Ease up, okay?

273
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,004
I'm not even down to
one boyfriend yet.

274
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,241
But... But you will be
soon, right?

275
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:06,049
Well, Zeke gets out of jail
in three months.

276
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:08,001
Okay.

277
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:10,270
Uh, I'm... I'm... I'm gonna
go talk to Eric.

278
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:16,061
Mom...

279
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,552
are you happy?

280
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:21,496
Sure. What's this about?

281
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,741
I don't know. It's, like...

282
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,298
Eric said this stupid thing about me
not working when we're married...

283
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,552
and I just want to do something more meaningful
with my life than have kids, you know?

284
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:34,106
- No offense.
- No. No. That's okay.

285
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:37,113
It's not like I never wondered
what my life could have been like...

286
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:39,041
if I hadn't married your father.

287
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:41,659
I mean, I...
Well, I could have been a doctor.

288
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,315
- Exactly.
- Or a dancing girl.

289
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,739
Right.

290
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,144
Oh, honey. Don't worry
so much about what Eric said.

291
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,894
You're probably not even gonna
have to deal with this anyway.

292
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:56,988
- How do you figure that?
- Well, you and Eric are so young.

293
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:59,480
The chances are you're not gonna
end up together anyway.

294
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:07,575
All right, Donna. That's it.
We gotta figure this out.

295
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,905
Because this is just hanging over our heads
like one of those huge, awful hanging things.

296
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:16,511
Let's not worry
about this anymore.

297
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,520
Let's, uh...
Let's go for a drive, okay?

298
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:21,655
Okay.

299
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,991
I'm sorry.
Did you want to say something else?

300
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:31,197
No. Just...

301
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,121
I love you.

302
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:35,553
Oh.

303
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:37,506
- Enough to strip for me?
- All right.

304
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,188
No. I mean I love you too.
I'd strip for you.

305
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,390
Laurie, her mother is waiting.

306
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:46,429
I don't care. I love her,
and I'm not giving her back!

307
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:51,523
- What are you doing with that?
- Give me back the baby, missy, or, so help me...

308
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,445
the dryer goes down.

309
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:56,635
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

310
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,484
Fine, fine. Take her.

311
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,085

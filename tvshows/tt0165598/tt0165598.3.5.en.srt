1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,069
Oh, don't put Batman
in the clam of death, Riddler.

2
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:08,045
That's just gonna make him mad.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,085
God, you're stupid.

4
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:15,699
Fez, for the last time,
the Riddler can't hear you.

5
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,436
Riddle me this, Riddler.

6
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:21,421
When Batman escapes
from the clam of death...

7
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:24,179
who will kick your riddle-telling ass in?

8
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:27,597
Hey, Fez. Riddle me this.

9
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:32,845
Then riddle me this.

10
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:42,001
Oh, but, Fez,
only if you riddle me this.

11
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,788
Ow!

12
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:47,027
Riddle me this,
you son of a bitch!

13
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:55,723
- Oh, my God! Guess what!
- Stop! Fez!

14
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,101
This could be important!

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,709
You guys, the Roller Disco Doo-dah
is coming to Kenosha next Friday!

16
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:08,501
Oh, my God! Guess what!

17
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:15,347
See, now, that's the kind of thing the judges
really frown upon during competition, Steven.

18
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:17,652
Excuse me?

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,607
We're gonna be partners!

20
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,950
Skating partners.

21
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:29,293
Hey, how about instead, you hit me in
the face with a wrench, and I black out?

22
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:32,819
Steven...

23
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:35,921
this is not just a last chance
at roller disco.

24
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:38,479
It's a last chance at love...

25
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:42,097
our love.

26
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,429
Now, will you or will you not
skate with me?

27
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,350
I would, Jackie...

28
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,612
but seeing you there
in your cute little skating outfit...

29
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,527
with all your tassels and sequins...

30
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:55,763
I might be tempted to...

31
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,806
push you down a flight of stairs.

32
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,805
All right.

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,873
Jackie, what do you say...
you and me, roller disco?

34
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:09,358
I mean, we used to have some good moves,
you know, like, when we did it...

35
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:13,108
so it would be like that...

36
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:17,070
except for with lights and skates.

37
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:21,299
Okay. Um, first of all,
you make me sick. Okay?

38
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:23,375
Second, you're lame,
and you make me sick.

39
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:25,684
Third, you make me sick,
and any one of these guys...

40
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:28,053
would be a better partner
than you, even Fez.

41
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,428
Really? Then I am in.

42
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,861
Um, no, I didn't really mean it, Fez.

43
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:40,845
Oh, then I am out.

44
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,806
Damn it. Let me in.

45

46
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:29,312
So, who will Jackie choose
as her roller disco partner?

47
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,062
Who, who, who?

48
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:34,204
No freakin' way.

49
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,172
Hmm, how very sad.

50
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:40,153
No one to disco with.

51
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:45,369
Now, where did I leave
my potato chips?

52
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:48,061
Oh, there they are.

53
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:03,707
Look at that.

54
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,714
I left my soda back
in the other side of the room!

55
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,361
Refreshing.

56
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:30,232
God, my arm is sore!

57
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,178
Wow, Fez!

58
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,667
Oh, come on, Jackie!

59
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:38,812
You're gonna pick him over me?

60
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,792
All right. Watch this.

61
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:54,144
Jackie, I'm just
a roller disco machine...

62
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:58,553
and I don't work
for nobody but you.

63
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:06,240
Okay. Okay, fine.
We'll be partners.

64
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:09,122
But hear me now.
I want first prize.

65
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:11,708
If I lose and some stupid,
spoiled rich girl wins...

66
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,234
I'll scream.

67
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:16,609
<i>I am really hurt!</i>

68
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:23,512
- Hi, sweetie. How was work?
- Oh, pretty good...

69
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:26,751
except for the fact that Dad's getting sued
for firing a Price Mart employee.

70
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,138
Okay. Well, good.
Have a cupcake.

71
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:33,504
Mom, did you hear what I said?

72
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:36,702
Uh-huh, and it's just so very unpleasant,
I'm ignoring it.

73
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,959
So, have a cupcake.

74
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:43,842
Earl is suing Dad
for wrongful termination.

75
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:47,801
Earl? He didn't do his job.
He was always late.

76
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,657
He was a complete dumb-ass...

77
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:54,650
person.

78
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:56,632
Mom, you said "ass."

79
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:01,976
Well, now so did you.
Give me back the cupcake, foul mouth.

80
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,080
I can't even imagine the mood
your father's in.

81
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:08,930
Actually, he doesn't know yet.
I got the news after he left.

82
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:11,995
God, Dad is gonna freak.
I don't know how we're gonna tell him.

83
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,914
- Tell me what?
- That, uh...

84
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,467
Mom said the "ass" word.

85
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:22,274
Well, now...

86
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:25,023
actually, um...

87
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:27,163
Red, um...

88
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:30,399
You know, Mom, I got this one.

89
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:34,362
Okay, uh, everyone here who's not being
sued by Earl for wrongful termination...

90
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,344
raise their hand.

91
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:43,869
I don't get Jackie, man.

92
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:48,161
I mean, picking Fez over me? Me?

93
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:50,780
I have the three things
that women want.

94
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:53,405
I'm-I'm hot, and I'm smart.

95
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,015
That's two things, moron.

96
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,058
No, it's three.
I count hot twice.

97
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,106
I mean, come on.

98
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,743
Kelso, who cares?
It's a stupid roller disco thing.

99
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,793
Yeah, I guess you're right.

100
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,256
It's silly for me to be jealous.

101
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:17,698
- You're a good friend, Donna.
- Yeah.

102
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:20,894
'Cause when you think about it, I mean,
what does Fez have going for him...

103
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:24,280
except an incredibly sexy accent
and an extremely hot body?

104
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,528
Okay. Now you're being
a bad friend, Donna.

105
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:32,418
I mean, come to think of it,
if Fez helps Jackie win a roller disco...

106
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:35,615
she might rip his clothes off and have
sex with him right there on the rink.

107
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,592
That's how hot he is.

108
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,009
Bad friend, Donna! Bad!

109
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:47,544
Oh, look at this guy's complaint.

110
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:51,994
"Red Forman was habitually ill-tempered."
Am I ill-tempered?

111
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:57,919
No, sir.
You're like Mary Poppins.

112
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:02,848
Okay, honey. Well, it says here
you have to go to the labor board.

113
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,948
You know what, Red Forman, you have
to go in there and defend yourself.

114
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,929
I'll defend myself.

115
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:10,338
I'll go in there,
and I'll tell those morons...

116
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:14,364
that they're wasting my time
with this stupid crap!

117
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,143
Or...

118
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:20,600
you could control your temper.

119
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:23,774
No offense, Mom, but what's plan "B"?

120
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:27,712
Hey, shut it, pal.

121
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,041
Okay, now, see, that's the kind of thing
that's gonna get you in trouble.

122
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:33,824
Now, when... when I get
really angry, I just...

123
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,379
I laugh it off... like this.

124
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:41,054
- See?
- Oh, geez, Kitty. That'll never work.

125
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,359
That's dumb.

126
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:04,510
Oh, my God. I think
Jackie and Fez are next.

127
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,489
Look! There they are!

128
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,930
Hey! The next contestants
are cheaters.

129
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:11,067
The brown guy is a robot.

130
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,048
- Robot? Shut up.
- <i>Ladies and gentleman...</i>

131
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:15,490
<i>welcome to the rink
our last contestants of the evening...</i>

132
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,647
<i>from Point Place, Wisconsin,
Jackie Burkhart and, uh...</i>

133
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:22,016
<i>Jackie Burkhart's partner!</i>

134
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,155
Boo!

135
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,662
This is so cool.

136
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,293
- Oh, my God. They're amazing!
- Oh, did you see that? Fez just tripped.

137
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:42,526
- No, he didn't.
- The foreign guy tripped. That's a deduction right there.

138
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,667
You're gonna lose!

139
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:47,357
Kelso, shut up.

140
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:52,409
That's it.
They're doing too well.

141
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,376
What the hell is that?

142
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:58,360
- It's my secret weapon.
- A marble?

143
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:00,923
Yep. I'm gonna chuck it
out there so they trip.

144
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,067
You moron, it's one marble.

145
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,945
- Give me that. Give me that.
- No! No!

146
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,541
Boo! Boo!

147
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:18,466
- Boo!
- Whoo!

148
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:20,768
Oh, no.

149
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,039
They were good.

150
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:25,081
I swallowed my marble.

151
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:30,557
Boo!

152
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,248
- Oh, my God. You guys were so great.
- I know. I know.

153
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:37,509
And even when I almost tripped,
my natural grace totally saved us.

154
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:41,600
Well, I saw plenty of mistakes out there,
especially from Fez.

155
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,393
Shut your hole.

156
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,813
Here come the scores.

157
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:51,076
<i>And the winner of Kenosha's
Annual Roller Disco Doo-dah is...</i>

158
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:54,012
- <i>Jackie Burkhart and...</i>
- Oh, my God!

159
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:55,995
- <i>Friend.</i>
- Fix! Fix!

160
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,372
I can't believe it!
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

161
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:02,845
You... You are my hero...
my... my hunky, sexy, foreign skating hero!

162
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:07,108
And you are my... my spoiled,
whiny skating princess.

163
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:09,988
Oh, Fez, thank you!

164
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:14,402
- Yea, champagne! Yea!
- Yea!

165
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,325
- Yea!
- Get off me.

166
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,140
Kelso, you booed us
the entire time.

167
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,555
What? No!
That was some rude guy.

168
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,525
So I popped him one,
and then I was goin', "Ooh,"

169
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:29,467
because I hurt my hand
when I popped the rude guy.

170
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,160
So... you're welcome.

171
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:35,964
You wanna kiss it?

172
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:39,803
Let's go, Fez.

173
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,419
Hmm. Come on, Kelso.
Look at the bright side.

174
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:45,349
What's the bright side?

175
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,651
The bright side is
there isn't one.

176
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:50,435
Fez has Jackie, and you have
to squeeze out that marble.

177
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:58,202
Now, Mr. Forman, at any point
did you ever berate Earl Arthur...

178
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,449
<i>by calling him
any of the following names:</i>

179
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,722
<i>Candy-ass...</i>

180
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,856
<i>dumb-ass, lazy-ass...</i>

181
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:08,381
Uh, it... it just goes on like that.

182
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,032
Well, that sounds like just
good-natured ribbin' to me.

183
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:14,949
Doesn't sound that way to me.

184
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:26,783
Are you callin' me a liar?

185
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,985
'Cause it's funny if ya are.

186
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:34,843
Well, you know, Eric worked
with him too. Eric, tell him about Earl.

187
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:38,332
Actually, I'd be more interested in hearing
what Eric thinks about working with you. Eric?

188
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:41,276
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm-I'm here...

189
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,929
just to answer questions
about Earl... old, dumb Earl.

190
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:49,188
So, you know, you fire away
with the Earl questions.

191
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,156
I think we know
all we need to know about Earl.

192
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,386
Oh, then good. I'll just
step out then. Good.

193
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:58,876
- This was good.
- No, no, no, no. Eric, just a few more questions.

194
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,627
Is your father ever
unnecessarily angry?

195
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,675
Unnecessarily angry.

196
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:24,475
Well... you know,
what does "unnecessarily" mean really?

197
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,616
I mean, my sister likes
to put salt on roast beef...

198
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:29,595
but I think it's unnecessary.

199
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,971
I mean, why cover up the flavor
of such a delicious meat?

200
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,590
Just answer the question,
dumb-ass!

201
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:41,083
<i>I mean... Good work, Son.</i>

202
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:50,466
Oh, my God. I love champagne!

203
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:54,306
Yes. Was it any good?

204
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:57,570
Great. Just great.

205
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:01,250
Hey, Fez, I just made up a poem.

206
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,227
- Do you want to hear it?
- Okay.

207
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:07,557
There once was
a guy named Fez...

208
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:10,524
who had a really cute butt.

209
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:12,834
Ta-da!

210
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,812
Well, I have to say
I don't hate it.

211
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:19,515
Hey... Psst...

212
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,005
Fezzie...

213
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,459
do you want to know a secret?

214
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:29,917
If you try to kiss me right now...

215
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,291
I probably wouldn't stop you.

216
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,595
In fact...

217
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:37,083
I'd probably let you
do more than that.

218
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:44,349
- Fez...
- Huh!

219
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:46,495
Good God, man. Don't do it.
She is drunk.

220
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:49,118
But, Batman, she is so hot.

221
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,808
But she's drunk.
There is no honor in this.

222
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:55,333
Ah, screw honor.
Take her pants off.

223
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:57,951
Ay!

224
00:15:58,022 --> 00:16:00,193
Riddler, nefarious fiend.

225
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:02,236
Don't do it, Fez. It's a trap.

226
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,882
Riddle me this, Fez. Why would Jackie ask you
to make out with her if she didn't want you to?

227
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:11,106
Seriously, he makes
an excellent point.

228
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:13,661
It's the dastardly
alcohol talking.

229
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:17,280
If you and Jackie get together,
you want it to be real, not like this.

230
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:20,445
Honestly, I was
rooting for you...

231
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:24,030
but imaginary Batman
makes a lot of sense.

232
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,956
Then riddle me this.

233
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:27,931
What does Batman know
about girls?

234
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:31,584
Slides down a pole and lives
with a teenage boy. Enough said.

235
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:36,123
Okay. Now I have to say,
advantage Riddler.

236
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:38,915
What are you trying
to say, Riddler?

237
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:42,659
I think you know what I'm trying to say.
Ooh-la-la.

238
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:45,115
Oh, you want to go,
question dork?

239
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,579
Oh, bring it on, bat-wuss.

240
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,451
So...

241
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:05,533
are you gonna kiss me, Fez?

242
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,452
No, I am sorry, Jackie.

243
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:10,754
That's okay.

244
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,927
You still have a very cute butt.

245
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:18,564
Come on, Kelso.

246
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:22,208
So Jackie likes Fez. Big deal.
You're going out with Laurie.

247
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,284
I know. It's just, you know...

248
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,179
seeing her with another guy just made me
remember all the good times we had together...

249
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:31,523
and it just made me sad.

250
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,652
Yeah.

251
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,443
Come here.

252
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,899
You know, Kelso...

253
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:42,691
I guess underneath it all
you're kind of a good guy.

254
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:44,613
Sometimes.

255
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:46,914
Sort of.

256
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,495
- Things'll work themselves out.
- Yeah, I know.

257
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:52,954
What the hell are you doing?

258
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,779
We can't fight these
feelings anymore, Donna.

259
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:58,715
- What?
- What? We've been doing this dance all night...

260
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,894
and, oh, God,
I'm tired of dancing.

261
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,394
You moron!

262
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:07,072
Nobody likes a tease, Donna!

263
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:12,740
I'm sorry. You're not a tease.
Come back.

264
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:15,107
Tease!

265
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:18,021
I'm sorry. Donna!

266
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:21,762
I guess "violent"
is the wrong word...

267
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:25,125
but, you know, it's definitely
some kind of rage.

268
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,602
Although, I mean, you know,
Earl had it coming.

269
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:33,533
I love you, Daddy.

270
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:36,453
Oh, hey. Sorry I'm late.

271
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:39,420
Hour and 10 minutes late.
I can only assume you're Earl.

272
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,403
Yeah.

273
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:46,268
So, um, sorry.
My, uh, dog got hit by a...

274
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,829
a guy in a...

275
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:51,837
- Car?
- Thanks, Red.

276
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,463
- So, what'd I miss?
- You missed everything.

277
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:59,803
Okay. I'm not gonna lie. Mr. Forman, you...
you scare the living hell out of me.

278
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,950
- No offense.
- None taken.

279
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,931
That's kind of his thing.

280
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,853
But, Earl, in light of your failure
to show up for your own hearing...

281
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,536
we have no choice but to rule
in favor of Mr. Forman.

282
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,850
- Yes, sir!
- Way to go, Dad!

283
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,773
Damn... dog.

284
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:17,507
And Mr. Forman, even though
this hearing did go your way today...

285
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,428
in light of some
of your son's responses...

286
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:23,072
I would strongly encourage you
to go to anger management classes.

287
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,720
Sure, I'll...

288
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,961
I'll do that.

289
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,923
Neat! Anger management...

290
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:41,057
That sounds like it could be
kind of fun, right?

291
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:46,787
We... We won. Hey!

292
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,763
You and me...
We're such a good team.

293
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,829
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah.

294
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,756
We did it. How about us, huh?

295
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,676
Stickin' it to the man.

296
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,197
I'll see you at home.

297
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,198
Wait. But, Dad, we...

298
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,244
we drove here together.

299
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:08,768
Then she fell asleep,
and I stroke her hair.

300
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:13,153
You did the right thing, Fez,
but a word of advice.

301
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:16,353
Next time you tell the story,
ya nailed her.

302
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:20,477
Yeah, but, you know,
it's better you didn't...

303
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,063
'cause scammin' on another guy's woman...
That's totally breaking the code.

304
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,523
Donna told me what you did,
you dill-hole!

305
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:29,150
No, she's lying!

306
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,637
Oh! That's my nipple!

307
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:45,806
Hello...

308
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,049
buttercup.

309
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,327
Fez, you're drunk.

310
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:53,489
Madam, I may be drunk,
but you should have sex with me.

311
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:55,663
That's crazy.

312
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,091
But you have to, because last night...

313
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,459
I made a big mistake.

314

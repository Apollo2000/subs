1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,060
- Good morning. I have terrible news.
- Are we out of bacon?

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,780
- No. I was outside, and...
- Remember that time we were out of bacon?

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,580
Do I?
Nearly tore this family apart.

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,380
Listen to me!

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,380
Midge left Bob.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,460
Are you sure? I mean, maybe
she's just lost in the backyard.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,220
This is serious. I was up early, and I saw
Midge getting into her car with a suitcase.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,980
And I said, "Where are you going, Midge?"
Because I'm concerned, not nosy.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,860
And she said to me, "I am leaving
Bob, and I am never coming back."

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,100
And I said, "Okay."

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,700
And then I... I... I laughed like I do
when I'm uncomfortable.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,074

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,700
But... what about Donna?

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,060
I mean, what are they gonna do?

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,140
Well, okay.
They are going to depend...

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,940
on the kindness of their friends
and neighbors...

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,020
which is why we need to go over there
as a family to comfort them.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,980
- Yikes. No.
- I don't think so.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,820
- Why not?
- Well, it just seems like it'd be...

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,300
like there'd be an awful lot of...

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,300
- Crying.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,420
- So, no.
- Yeah, no.

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,020
Well, fine.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,700
Then I will go myself.

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,340
Hey! Where are you
going with my food?

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,500
To Bob and Donna.

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,260
When your wife or mother leaves you,
you need a good breakfast.

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,900
I need a good breakfast.

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,540
I didn't leave you.
Eat a Pop-Tart.

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,060
When I woke up, her bag
was packed and she left.

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,820
Didn't even say where she was going.

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,820
On the other hand...

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,940
we have pancakes with egg eyes
and bacon smiley faces!

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,620
The hash-brown hair is nice.

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,180
I can't believe she would just take off
without even a hint or a warning.

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,420
No warning?

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,660
Dad, she was always saying,
"I'm unhappy, and I'm gonna leave."

38
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,340
Honey, that's just
what married people say.

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,300
Did she say where she was going?

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,900
Well, she said she was
going to California to...

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,780
to be a star on Broadway.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,620
So...

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,700
Oh, Midgie.

44
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,420
She may not have been smart...

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,700
but she sure was sweet.

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,700
And built too, boy.

47
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,620
Okay.

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,060
Thanks, Mrs. Forman,
but I'm really not hungry.

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,220
Oh, what a nightmare.

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,300
She was unhappy, Bob.

51
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,180
No, she took the Eldorado.

52
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,840
So Midge just took off?

53
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,280
Ah, poor Donna.

54
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,520
Yeah, this is really bad.

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,560
Yeah, not only did Donna
lose her mom...

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,480
we all lost Midge's sweet, uptown rack.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,840
Oh, good God, man,
what a marvelous set of kittens.

58
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,520
- Remember that sweater?
- Oh.

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,800
Remember the other sweater?

60
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,280
Yeah. Remember that time
she ran up to us in a sweater?

61
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,240
Remember the week
she took up jump rope?

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,480
In a sweater?

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
Eric!

64
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,480
What are you boys
thinking about so hard?

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
- Nothing.
- Homework.

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,520
- Jesus.
- Kittens.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
Okay, um, Eric, I need you
to take a casserole to the Pinciottis.

68
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,600
So run upstairs and put on
a nice, clean shirt and a sport coat.

69
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,800
What?
No, I'm not going over there.

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,360
Donna and I broke up,
and things are weird with us.

71
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,480
Well, that's too bad.

72
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,120
Because I went over there,
and Bob's a crier...

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,280
and a hugger.

74
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
And when you get caught
in a crying-Bob hug, there is no escape.

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,240
And I cannot go back over there!

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,920
I don't know.
I like to be hugged by Bob.

77
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
He makes me feel safe.

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,480
Okay, okay, there he is.
Go talk to him.

79
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,400
No, Kitty.
It's a personal matter, and I... Oh!

80
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
That's mature.

81
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,440
Oh, hey there, Red!

82
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
Hi, Bob.

83
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,680
What a day, huh?
What a day to be alive.

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,640
I feel great.

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,440
You do?

86
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,400
Well, then...

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,640
I can go back inside.

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,640
Bye.

89
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,240
Yup, Midgie's been on me
for weeks to weed the garden.

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm finally gettin' around to it, so when she
comes back, she's gonna see that I did it.

91
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,880
You think she's coming back?

92
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,680
Well, why shouldn't she?
I did all the right things.

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,720
We had an open marriage,
experimented with drugs.

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,480
I even threw nudist parties.

95
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah, what more could a husband do?

96
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,160
All right. Let's not get
bummed out, guys, okay?

97
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,480
There are a lot of other hot older women
out there besides Midge.

98
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,360
And they deserve our respect,
'cause they can teach us stuff.

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,480
Yes, I would love to make love
to an 80-year-old.

100
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,560
They must know everything.

101
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,160
And not just about sex,
but history and trivia too.

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,680
Yeah.

103
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,600
The young ones are too timid,
but the older ones...

104
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,880
They know it won't break.

105
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,200
How could it break?
It is invincible.

106
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,920
Yeah, and plus,
they're, like, grateful...

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,640
you know, so they'll do it with,
like, almost anybody.

108
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,600
Anybody?

109
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,600
Well, that's me!

110
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,640
Let's find Fez
a dirty housewife to love.

111
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,760
Yeah, man, I'm in.
Hyde?

112
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,920
I don't know, guys.
I was gonna go watch <i>Donahue.</i>

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,360
What do you think the chances are
of Fez gettin' burned?

114
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,400
- Pretty good.
- Damn good.

115
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,080
Then I am in.

116
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

117
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,640
So...

118
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,200
hey, look, I'm really
sorry about your mom.

119
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,560
<i>And, uh, I mean, are you okay?</i>

120
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,440
I don't know.
It's weird.

121
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,360
Yeah, well, you know,
it won't make you feel any better...

122
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
but for some reason
I brought you a casserole.

123
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,080
I mean, why is it that...

124
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,960
every time something bad happens,
grown-ups always think you need food?

125
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,920
You lost your job?
Congratulations, you get a bucket of chicken!

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,240
I mean, the last thing you want is to...

127
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,200
Are these crushed potato chips?

128
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,840
Look...

129
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,240
Donna, look.

130
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,440
I know we broke up...

131
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,080
but I still, you know...

132
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
I still care about you.

133
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,960
Okay. Okay.

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,920
So...

135
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,440
Eric, in the bedroom.

136
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,120
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

137
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,560
I'll just...
I'm gonna...

138
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,160
Is that a tennis getup?

139
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
Yup.

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,880
Yeah, I'm out.

141
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,960
What's his problem? This is the perfect
outfit for picking up older ladies.

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,040
Uh-huh.
How's that?

143
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Well, everyone knows that horny older ladies
hang out at tennis clubs.

144
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, well, see, Fez...

145
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,320
Point Place doesn't have a tennis club,
or even a tennis court.

146
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,560
We do have that concrete wall
behind the gym...

147
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,000
but people mostly use that just for
smoking weed and beating up freshmen.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,920
And foreign exchange students.

149
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,520
You were new, okay?

150
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,000
No. You know where we gotta go
to get the ladies is the grocery store.

151
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,440
Oh, the Piggly Wiggly?
I love the Piggly Wiggly.

152
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
They have candy.

153
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,320
Yeah.
And older ladies.

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,280
And candy.

155
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,520
Yeah, but the important thing
is the older ladies!

156
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,920
And candy.

157
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,640
All right, Fez. What do you want,
the older ladies or the candy?

158
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,920
Fine, you win.
The older ladies.

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,320
- Thank you.
- And candy.

160
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,000
It was the sport coat, right?

161
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,720
- Again?
- Yes, please.

162
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
So, you don't want to cuddle?

163
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,400
That's cool.

164
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,640
Bob thinks Midge is coming back?

165
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,480
That is the saddest thing I ever heard.

166
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,080
Oh, come on, Kitty.
Let him think it. Who does it hurt?

167
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,520
It hurts Bob.

168
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
Well, who else does it hurt?

169
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
Steven.

170
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Red, Bob has to grieve
so the healing can begin.

171
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,400
But, Kitty, then he'll grieve all over me.

172
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,320
Hey, remember that time Bob ate a bad taco
and grieved all inside your car?

173
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,920
Thank you.
Case closed.

174
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,600
Why would you bring that up?

175
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,720
Well, sorry, Mrs. Forman.

176
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,960
It's just that it was gross,
so I think about it a lot.

177
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,760
Hi, kids. Good to see you.
Good to see you.

178
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,480
Someone is looking lovely today, Mom.

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,600
What's with you, man?

180
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,360
I guess a little thing like
getting back together with your old gal...

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,360
puts a spring in a man's step.

182
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,280
You and Donna
are back together?

183
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,280
That is wonderful!

184
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,400
So, did you talk things through?

185
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,400
No.

186
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,960
Then how do you know
you're back together?

187
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,280
Yeah, we talked things through.

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
Talked or grunted?

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,040
Stifle.

190
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,280
Okay, well, good.

191
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm gonna need details.

192
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
Oh, there will be details aplenty...

193
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,960
in my steamy letter to <i>Penthouse.</i>

194
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,680
Okay, my mom's still behind me,
isn't she?

195
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,280
So, you guys did it?

196
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,480
Twice.

197
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,800
Five times!

198
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,720
Nice.

199
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,960
Yech!

200
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,960
And you're back together?

201
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,320
Oh, yeah.

202
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,280
God, no.

203
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,600
It was like... magic.

204
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,040
Oh, I feel sick.

205
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,160
Yup, we're back together.

206
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,120
And, Hyde, more than this, much...

207
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,920
more than this...

208
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,440
I'm sure he's forgotten all about it.

209
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,080
Man, back when
I was cheating on Jackie...

210
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,040
I used to meet a ton
of older ladies here.

211
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,320
Hello, Michael.

212
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,920
Hey, Joyce.

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
That's Coach Ferguson's wife!

214
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,040
Yeah.
She's lonely, and she drinks.

215
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,720
Oh, you're a Piggly Wiggly god.

216
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,600
Yeah.

217
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,640
Ooh la la!

218
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,600
Oh, me like.

219
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,920
Well, make your move, man.

220
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,600
Ay, no.

221
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,280
After I painted
Midge's bathroom pink...

222
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,280
sprinkled a little lavender water
in her toilet like she likes...

223
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,240
I went out and got these chocolates.

224
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,520
I hope she likes 'em. I guess we'll find out
when she comes back, huh?

225
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,880
Bob, she... I...

226
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,640
Aw, Bob, you poor,
dumb son of a bitch.

227
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,720
That's mean.

228
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,840
Bob, she's not comin' back.

229
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,480
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.

230
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,720
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.

231
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,720
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not!

232
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,840
- Yes, she is!
- Fine!

233
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,360
These chocolates are for Midge, Bob?
They're for Midge? Fine!

234
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,360
Let's give 'em to Midge!

235
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,320
Here you go, Midge!

236
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,600
You're throwing away
Midgie's chocolates.

237
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,720
And why would I do that, Bob?

238
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,200
'Cause you're mean!

239
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,080
And why else?

240
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
She's not coming back, is she?

241
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,240
I knew that.

242
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,080
Listen, you wanna go get a beer?

243
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,960
You're a good friend.

245
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,960
I might cry.

246
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,920
And I might hit you.

247
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,400
Michael, how could you bring poor,
sweet Fez to the Piggly Wiggly?

248
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,560
There are a lot of
footloose women in that store.

249
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,520
Do you know Joyce Ferguson?

250
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,760
Who? No!
That's a lie!

251
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,640
- What?
- What?

252
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,800
- What?
- What?

253
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,920
And you! Grabbing strange rear ends
is no way to meet a nice girl.

254
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
It's rude, ungentlemanly behavior...

255
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,560
that will not be appreciated
by a woman of class.

256
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
And thank you for the compliment.
It made my day.

257
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,360
You know what I just noticed?
Mrs. Forman is hot.

258
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,960
Yeah, she's a cutie.

259
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,920
And firm.

260
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,840
You know, maybe we should
get her a sweater for Christmas.

261
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,840
She actually doesn't want
to be with you at all.

262
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,160
Isn't that hilarious?

263
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,200
Yeah, he thinks
you're back together.

264
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,600
It's really sad.

265
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,600
Hold on. What?

266
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,520
Look, she said she would've
done it with anybody.

267
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,560
No, no.
Donna wouldn't say that.

268
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,320
I mean, it was like I would
have done it with anybody.

269
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,880
Anybody?

270
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Damn, and I was just over there
watching stupid <i>Donahue.</i>

271
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,440
Hey, let's do it right now.

272
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,440
Eric's gonna be so mad.

273
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,400
- Are you mad?
- So mad.

274
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,880
Yeah, I'm just kidding
about the "do it" stuff.

275
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,040
- I'm sorry about your mom.
- Thanks.

276
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,000
You know what?

277
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,120
That's it.
She can't use me like this.

278
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm goin' over there
to yell at her right now!

279
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,960
With yelling!

280
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Seriously, let's do it right now.

281
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,120
Okay, listen. You need to tell me
what the hell you think you're doing!

282
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,800
What am I doing?
Well, my mom left us...

283
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,720
so I'm boxing up her clothes,
because I can't look at them anymore.

284
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm sorry for needing you, but I did. So if
you have something to say to me, just say it.

285
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay, thank you!

286
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,600
I did have something to say,
and it was good!

287
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,320
But that was before you said your mom stuff
and your sad clothes stuff...

288
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,360
and now my s-sex stuff...

289
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,800
sounds...

290
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,800
sucky.

291
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,640
Look, I'm sorry if you thought that we...

292
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,600
No. No, I'm sorry.

293
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,320
Let's just... What...
What, do you need some help or something?

294
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,560
Yeah, thanks.

295
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,320
Oh, my God.

296
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,960
Oh, my God.

297
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,960
This is mine.

298
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,200
Midge borrowed it, and
she never gave it back.

299
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,920
I bet my bra's here too.

300
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,860
I miss my li'l Midgers.

301
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,620
Bob, you know the rules.
You cry, you buy.

302
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,460
Three pitchers, please.

303
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,780
Hi.

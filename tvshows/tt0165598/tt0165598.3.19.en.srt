1
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,988
Oh, my first X-rated movie.

2
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:15,525
I don't know what's going on,
but that is the luckiest pizza boy ever.

3
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:21,293
Yeah, I'll say. There's at least
nine boobs in this shot alone.

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,036
Guys, I feel bad.
I mean, Jackie finally takes me back...

5
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:28,998
and I reward her by sneaking off
to see some trashy porno babes.

6
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,526
Oh, wow!

7
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,283
That seems like it would tickle.

8
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:38,148
Oh, nothing's going to happen in
this scene. It's just two ladies.

9
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,534
Oh, bravo, nice plot twist.

10
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:50,860
All right, guys, I gotta go.

11
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:53,099
I don't think Jackie would
like me being here.

12
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,589
And you should pick up
your dress on the way out.

13
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,406
Oh, wow!

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,781
Does everyone do that?

15
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:08,459
Because I don't do that.

16
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,494
I just stick to
two or three key moves and...

17
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:15,369
God, they don't even
come close to that.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,374
Oh, Eric, I have not
done anything...

19
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:22,342
but even I, had I done anything,
would have already done that.

20

21
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,192
Jackie, you know I love you...

22
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,653
and you know how much
I've changed, right?

23
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:05,444
Yeah?

24
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:08,261
Oh, what'd you do?

25
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,237
I went to a stag film.

26
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:13,246
But then it turned out
that there weren't any stags at all.

27
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,378
It was just naked people
having sex.

28
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,782
Go ahead and punish me.

29
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,629
No, Michael,
I'm not gonna punish you.

30
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:25,063
You were honest with me,
and honesty should be rewarded.

31
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:29,151
Wow. I'm not in trouble
and I get a reward?

32
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:33,855
Is it a cash reward?

33
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:37,505
No, Michael, the reward
is feeling better about yourself.

34
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,397
Oh.

35
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,446
Mmm, smells good.
Whatcha making?

36
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:47,682
Oh, a little lemon meringue
and pot roast...

37
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,370
and my sister Paula is coming
and seven-layer salad.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,368
Ahh. Seven-lay...
Hey, wait a second.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,669
Red, now please, be nice.
We haven't seen her in almost six years.

40
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:02,208
- Yeah, not since she got arrested.
- No, not arrested, detained.

41
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:07,906
She showed up in the backseat
of a police car with lights flashing.

42
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:12,286
I had to tell the neighbors
that she was the mayor of Cincinnati.

43
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,726
Oh, there she is.

44
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:18,370
You wait. She's gonna hit me up
for money like she always does.

45
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:35,326
That's gonna cost me.

46
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,350
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- Kitty!

47
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,278
Oh, my God! Look at you!

48
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:49,026
I know, I know, I'm fabulous.

49
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:54,975
- Look, huh, at me.
- Oh, my God.

50
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:57,502
You're wearing stockings.
Red, she's wearing stockings.

51
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:01,154
Oh, oh, and matching shoes!

52
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:05,730
Oh, come on, Red.
I know you're dying for a nibble.

53
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,115
Paula, you're so pink.

54
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:14,690
Oh, well, sure, sure.
I gotta match my brand-new car.

55
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,614
Go ahead, pet her.

56
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,826
Well, ooh, ooh,
I wanna pet her too.

57
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,991
Why did you paint it
with Pepto-Bismol?

58
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:31,968
It's not Pepto-Bismol.
It's Luscious Blushes.

59
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,512
And only the top Kathy May
salesperson gets one of these babies.

60
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,623
So you stole it from her?

61
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,721
I have all the money that I owe you.
Here it is.

62
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:47,014
Oh, my God. You have cash.
Red, she has cash.

63
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:52,673
Honey, Red, Red, Red,
really, you don't have to count it.

64
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:55,493
Oh, well, of course.
You're family.

65
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:59,104
Oh, honey, honey, honey!

66
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:03,201
Honesty's cool, man.
It's like I can do anything wrong...

67
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:06,403
and then ask for forgiveness,
and then I'm good again.

68
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:08,707
I mean, someone should invent
a religion like that.

69
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:13,756
Okay, so did anyone besides me think
that some of the guys in that movie...

70
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:17,661
were not completely... average?

71
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:22,277
Like, you know,
they were way, way...

72
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,198
above average?

73
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:29,532
Well, you don't go into that line of work
when you're below average.

74
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:34,047
You just pray some hot, redheaded neighbor
girl likes you for your personality.

75
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:39,294
What are you talking about?
Those men were completely average.

76
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,433
In fact, I found the guy
with the mustache downright puny.

77
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:47,548
See now, Fez, that's not honest.

78
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:51,365
I mean, we all know
you're small in the pants.

79
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:55,294
What I'm saying is, is from here on in,
I'm only telling the truth.

80
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:58,401
In fact, I'm gonna come clean
to Jackie about everything.

81
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,032
Fine. You want honesty?
I'll give you honesty.

82
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:06,405
We are all small in the pants.

83
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:13,765
Kelso, this might be your best idea ever.
You know what?

84
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:18,086
You should make a list of all the lies you've
ever told to Jackie, and I'll help you.

85
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:21,413
'Cause all's I really want
is for you to be happy.

86
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,846
Hey, you guys, honestly...

87
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:27,905
you don't think Donna's,
you know, bored, right?

88
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:31,291
'Cause those guys in the movie,
they didn't do the same move twice.

89
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:34,084
And I've done
the same move, like...

90
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,006
always.

91
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,742
I'll bet they go to a special school
or something.

92
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,703
I mean, they're like
doctors at doing it.

93
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,029
<i>Eric, dinner.</i>

94
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:48,989
Oh, no.
Now I have to act normal.

95
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:53,669
But I get to eat, yeah!

96
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:07,169
- Aunt Paula, you look great.
- Oh.

97
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,727
And so pink.

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,622
Oh, Eric, you're so cute.

99
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:14,556
Here's 20 bucks.

100
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,704
Aunt Paula is awesome!

101
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:21,859
So, Paula, tell me more
about the ship captain.

102
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:23,934
Oh, that was just
a fling, you know.

103
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:26,428
Didn't you have a fianc×™
the last time we saw you?

104
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:29,886
Red, now there is no reason
to rehash ancient history, is there?

105
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,913
No, it's okay. It turned out he lived
on some sort of commune...

106
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,990
where everyone called him God.

107
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:39,332
And there were... there were guns.

108
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,906
And I really could never figure out
why God would need a gun.

109
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:47,291
But there were
some fun parties. Whoo!

110
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:57,084
That's hilarious!

111
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:01,436
Life has gotten so much better
since I moved to Indianapolis.

112
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:05,188
I mean, things move
so much faster in the big city.

113
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,622
One day you're wondering
if you'll ever find happiness...

114
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:12,194
and the next, you're waving
the starting flag at the Indy 500.

115
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:16,998
- You waved the Indy flag?
- Mm-hmm.

116
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,641
Oh, God, you're the coolest.

117
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:24,770
Mom, how funny is it
that while Aunt Paula was at Indy...

118
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,905
you were probably
at, like, Price Mart.

119
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:37,629
Ooh, ooh, ooh, who wants pie?
It's meringue.

120
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:42,373
Well, enough about me.
Kitty, dear, what have you been up to?

121
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,675
Well, you know,
it's funny you should ask...

122
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:47,230
because we have been
super, super busy.

123
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:50,686
Oh, no, she quit her job. She's not
up to anything. It's kind of boring.

124
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,298
So, did you meet Dick Trickle?

125
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,374
Eric!

126
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,537
What? He's a race car driver.

127
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,836
His name is Dick Trickle.

128
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:12,514
Oh, my God, listen to my voice!
I'm so loud!

129
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:26,467
Oh, well, will you look at this?
Here's me, captain of the cheerleaders.

130
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:30,113
"Most likely to succeed."
"Best laugh."

131
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,461
Oh, here's Paula.

132
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,437
What's that on her cheek?

133
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:42,016
Oh, she had a little sledding accident
with her face that year.

134
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:44,956
- Typical.
- I know.

135
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:48,994
Things were so different then.

136
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:56,001
Kitty, oh! You so deserve this.
You're the best.

137
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,919
Oh, aren't you sweet?

138
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:03,932
Boy, oh, boy,
Chet sure is lucky.

139
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,917
He's got the keenest girl in school.

140
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:08,194
Oh, stop!

141
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:11,012
- Congratulations, Kitty.
- Thanks, Paula.

142
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,021
I knew you'd win. You always do.

143
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:16,357
- No, not always.
- Well, I want a kiss from the queen.

144
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:21,279
Well, Chet, you have been
an awfully loyal subject.

145
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:24,133
You guys, I'd like you
to meet my date, Marvin.

146
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:29,477
Marvin? Sweetie? Sweetie?

147
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,486
Okay.

148
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:34,820
Okay.

149
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,381
And now, I'm a housewife...

150
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:50,018
and she goes on cruises
with Dick Trickle.

151
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:53,729
You don't know
what she's not telling you.

152
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,188
I mean, just because
she's more successful than you...

153
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:58,335
doesn't mean that she's happy.

154
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,333
More successful?

155
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,246
Well, it's just
that she has so many...

156
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:10,877
And she's... she's very...

157
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:13,853
Look, money.

158
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:21,118
I love it when you do that.

159
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:23,296
Good to know. Good to know.

160
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,328
And how about when I do this?

161
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,991
<i>Geez, Eric, what the hell?</i>

162
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,583
Okay, okay, I'll just
go back up to the ear.

163
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,176
Get away from me, you pig!

164
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,221
Where are my pants?

165
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:48,867
Wait. Wait, it was an accident.

166
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,877
Look, I have a feather.

167
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:01,117
He did?

168
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:03,037
What the heck for?

169
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,957
I don't know.

170
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,302
In like what universe
is that sexy?

171
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,840
Only one... the skinny,
pervert universe.

172
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,450
It was just so strange.

173
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:22,518
I mean, usually he just sticks to,
like, two or three key moves.

174
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:27,255
You know, I bet it's because
of that nudie flick they saw yesterday.

175
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,814
They went to an X-rated movie?

176
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,115
Didn't Eric tell you?

177
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,906
No.

178
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,177
God, why would Eric
go see something like that?

179
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,221
I mean, is our sex life
so boring...

180
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:46,643
that he has to sneak around
and watch other people do it?

181
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:49,402
Donna, of course it is.

182
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:52,122
It's okay.

183
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:04,117
So, um, what's going on here?

184
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,794
Packing a picnic lunch
for your next African safari?

185
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:12,539
No, I thought I'd make
my strudel for the boys.

186
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:16,185
It feels nice
having people to cook for.

187
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:19,350
Huh.

188
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,692
Well, um...

189
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,613
Sounds like your, uh...

190
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,264
jet-set life
gets pretty lonely, huh?

191
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,822
- Oh, no, I have lots of friends.
- Oh, right, right.

192
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:31,709
But, um, all the friends
in the world...

193
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:35,702
don't make up for having to come home from
the Bahamas to an empty house, do they?

194
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:39,069
I actually enjoy my privacy.

195
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,037
Hmm, privacy.

196
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:45,787
Loneliness.
It's a fine line, isn't it?

197
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,604
Okay, Kitty, is something wrong?

198
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,899
Yeah, something is wrong.
Why are you here?

199
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,909
Because I missed you.

200
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:58,041
And I wanted you to see
that I'm finally okay.

201
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,631
Okay or better than me?

202
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:04,314
Better than you?
Oh, Kitty, you're my sister and...

203
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:09,336
Fine. I'm finally a success, and I wanted
to come back and rub your face in it.

204
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,025
And I did, and I liked it!

205
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:23,293
Well, good for you.

206
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:27,864
It must have been hard living in my shadow,
because I was popular and you weren't.

207
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,230
And I had a life and you didn't.
That's right. I said it.

208
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:34,872
You heard me.
You were a schlub. A schlub!

209
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:44,860
Oh, I am so sorry.

210
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,294
Oh, I'm sorry too.

211
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:50,740
Oh, I just... I don't know
what is the matter with me.

212
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:53,236
- I know.
- I should be just thrilled...

213
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,798
that you're finally on your feet,
and instead, I'm just...

214
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,237
I'm acting like
a jealous little ninny.

215
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:01,750
Kitty, would you like a makeover?

216
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:04,986
Oh, I really would.

217
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,745
Okay.

218
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:09,945
I-I won't look like a whore, will I?

219
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:14,584
No, no, I promise.

220
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,725
Okay, Jackie.

221
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:21,206
There are some things I haven't been honest
about that I feel like you should know.

222
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,547
Okay.

223
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:25,949
Why are they here?

224
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:29,691
Well, Hyde helpfully pointed out
that it's not really honesty...

225
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:32,508
unless your friends
are allowed to watch.

226
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,967
So, anyway, I made a list.

227
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,373
The list was my idea.

228
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,348
Thank you for that, Hyde.

229
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,943
Okay, so let's just get started.

230
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:49,048
Um, that picture you saw
of me in kindergarten?

231
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:52,730
Those weren't puffy pants.
It was a big boy diaper.

232
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,991
And that time you came out of the shower,
and you thought you saw a flash?

233
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:01,916
I did take your picture.

234
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:08,443
This one time you asked me
if you had anything in your teeth?

235
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,674
And you did, but I said no,
'cause it's funnier that way.

236
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:21,234
When we were about to fool around,
and I said that I washed my hands?

237
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,474
But really I just got done
playing with like six dogs.

238
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,556
- But that's not as bad...
- All right, Michael, stop!

239
00:16:34,622 --> 00:16:38,844
Okay, Michael, I think we need
to work on selective honesty.

240
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,918
Yes, that and basic hygiene.

241
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,865
Seriously, good God, man.

242
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,789
Okay, Michael...

243
00:16:49,854 --> 00:16:54,262
unless one of your secrets involves kissing
a girl, I don't need to know about it.

244
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,437
Okay. All right.

245
00:16:57,502 --> 00:17:01,364
Oh, science fact.
Dogs are cleaner than humans.

246
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:08,244
Oh, you poor pink bastard.

247
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,483
<i>Well, well!</i>

248
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,851
What have we here?

249
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:24,279
<i>All right. I got 20 minutes
till my wife comes back...</i>

250
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,205
so, uh, pucker up.

251
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,508
Okay, you two lovebirds.

252
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:34,429
I'm off.

253
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,567
Oh, bye-bye, Red. Oh!

254
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,060
Oh, Paula, thank you so much.

255
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:41,109
Oh, oh, Kitty.

256
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:43,124
What are sisters for, huh?

257
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,303
I'll talk to you
in a couple of days.

258
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,349
And you remember what I said.

259
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,761
<i>Oui, oui, ma soeur.</i>

260
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:05,368
So what's with all the French?

261
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:09,180
- Did she call me something?
- No.

262
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:12,792
She said, "Search for life to live life,"
which is my new motto.

263
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:14,717
Paula made me see
that I have been in a rut.

264
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:19,005
But the good news is, from now on,
I am just going to explore life.

265
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:22,013
But you're...

266
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,336
You're all pretty now with your
big red lips. Isn't that enough?

267
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:32,472
Oh, I love you, Red Forman.

268
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,397
And no.

269
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:40,724
All right, fine.
But if you paint my car pink, it's over.

270
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:52,248
Oh, hey, I was
just looking at... Hey!

271
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:57,336
Okay, where did you
get the idea to...

272
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:03,643
do what you did?

273
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,427
I went to see this movie...

274
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:08,916
and it was a...

275
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,964
Well, I guess you could
call it an art film.

276
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,813
- Eric!
- Okay, fine, Donna. It was an X-rated film.

277
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:17,780
And it just...
There were all these people...

278
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,571
and they were doing all these things
that we've never done.

279
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:25,723
And it seemed like they really
enjoyed doing this one thing especially.

280
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,093
And I just thought, you know, who would
enjoy doing that one thing especially?

281
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,173
My lady.

282
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,604
Eric, listen to me...

283
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,579
because this is
gosh-darn important.

284
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:43,128
You don't do that,
not without asking.

285
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,932
So, if I had asked...

286
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:50,234
The answer's still no!

287
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,481
Are you bored with our sex life?

288
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,300
Oh, God, no. Just the opposite.

289
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,221
I figured that you
had to be bored.

290
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:04,509
And it was our hundredth time,
and I just wanted to do something special.

291
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,021
Oh, my God, you count?

292
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:11,357
No.

293
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,867
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.

294
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,699
But do me a favor. Next time
you're gonna do something weird...

295
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,733
gimme a little more warning,
so I can brace myself.

296
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,078
Or tell you to back the hell off.

297
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,905
- Right.
- Because no matter how much I love you...

298
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:37,211
that was unpleasant.

299
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:45,217
I'm sorry, you guys.
I can't hang out. I gotta go meet Jackie.

300
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:49,656
Don't look at me like that.

301
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:52,994
All right, five more minutes,
but that is it.

302
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,320
Come on. Who wants to
show me their belly, huh?

303
00:20:56,386 --> 00:21:00,128
Come on. Come here, buddy!

304
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:07,709
Come here, baby.
Who's my little baby, huh?

305
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,648
Who's my little baby?

306
00:21:11,305 --> 00:22:11,582

1
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:06,838
Hey, whatcha doin'?

2
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:08,791
Just countin' my secret stash.

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,855
- I'm gettin' something special for Donna.
- Something special, huh?

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,132
Oh, is it firecrackers?

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,694
No.

6
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:18,801
No, no, 'cause if it's somethin'
that blows up, I'll go halfsies.

7
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:25,301
It's a promise ring.

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,302
'Cause, you know, Donna and I
have been fighting a lot lately.

9
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,263
Forman, you get
mushy with Donna...

10
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:33,044
she's gonna see
the secret girl inside the man.

11
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:38,353
Now, trust me, you don't
want to let Erica out.

12
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,321
Erica.

13
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:44,563
That's a good burn.

14
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:47,860
You can't do that
with Michael. I'm lucky.

15
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:50,099
Oh, really, Michelle?

16
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:53,687
Oh, I forgot about Michelle.

17
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:58,477
Look, Hyde obviously doesn't
understand mature relationships...

18
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,439
but I do.

19
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:03,220
And a promise ring is not only
a gift from the heart...

20
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:06,255
but it also means more sex
and less mouthing off.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,839
I'm gettin' one for Jackie too!

22
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,602
Great. Let's go.

23
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,224
All right.
See you later, Hyde-a...

24
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:16,150
alicia.

25
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,733
What's a good
girlie name for Hyde?

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,669
Uh, Hyde...

27
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:24,882
drangea?

28
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,893
It's Heidi, you morons! Heidi!

29
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:33,868
Okay, is it me, or is
this not a ring store?

30
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:39,697
Will you trust me?
I know a guy who knows a guy.

31
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,622
He'll be here any minute.

32
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,472
Hey, dudes.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,539
Leo's the guy?

34
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:53,713
Kelso, I thought you knew
a guy who knew a guy.

35
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:55,726
Yeah, I do.

36
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,181
But I know Leo.

37
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,869
Fine, so you're the guy!

38
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:08,749
So, Leo, you sell promise rings?

39
00:02:08,823 --> 00:02:11,671
Promise rings, concert T's...

40
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:13,590
other stuff.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,109
- Really?
- That's nice.

42
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,038
Yeah.

43
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:25,559
Okay, we'll take
two rings and...

44
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:27,795
a misdemeanor's worth
of the other stuff.

46
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,147
Ah, the ring of love.

47
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:09,346
Just holding it makes me feel
mellow and content.

48
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:12,924
Actually, that might
not be the ring.

49
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:17,569
Why is everybody
but Fez in love?

50
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,770
If I don't get some romance soon,
I'm going to give myself a blister.

51
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,676
Well, another blister.

52
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:28,093
Tell you what, Fez.
I'm going to take you...

53
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,109
cruising for chicks
in the El Camino.

54
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:32,965
And I'm gonna let
you buy the gas...

55
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:35,366
and buy my dinner.

56
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,668
And if we meet a chick...

57
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:39,590
I'm gonna let you walk home.

58
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:46,211
Guys, what if Jackie doesn't want
a ring from a guy like me?

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,695
I mean, sure, I'm good lookin',
but I can't be trusted.

60
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,966
No, you guys are
the perfect couple.

61
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,333
You do the bad stuff,
and she tries to catch you.

62
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,214
She's... Smokey to your Bandit.

63
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:02,082
God, it's like that movie
applies to everything!

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,975
I just... I wish there was a way
I could give Jackie a thing...

65
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,934
that wasn't actually the ring.

66
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,676
You know, like a... a test gift
just to see what she would say.

67
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:15,711
And then if it went bad,
I could just walk away.

68
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,109
Hey, am I talking in rhyme?

69
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,280
I wish I could do that
all the time.

70
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,740
Oh! Oh, man!

71
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:31,297
That was fun, huh?
It was a good movie.

72
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:34,564
It was one of those love movies
like you like, huh?

73
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:38,564
And who took ya?

74
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:40,770
This guy.

75
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:47,653
- Yeah, it was great.
- You know what else this guy did for ya?

76
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:51,013
Got you a present.

77
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:57,473
"To Donna. Love, This Guy."

78
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,472
Yeah. That's me.

79
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,956
Oh, my God!

80
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:08,030
It's a promise ring.

81
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:10,372
Eric, it's... it's beautiful.

82
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,716
I'm so glad you like it.
'Cause look...

83
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,694
- even though things have been a little weird lately...
- <i>Oh!</i>

84
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,840
Look how cute on the car!

85
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,109
Here, look what Eric got me!

86
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:29,216
Oh, my! Red, go get the camera.

87
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,229
- Kitty...
- Mom, I...

88
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:34,303
Go! It's in the drawer
near the cheese grater.

89
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,350
Mom... No.

90
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:40,099
Hush. Donna, now...

91
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,556
make the face you made
when Eric gave you the ring.

92
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,751
Oh, now, see, I don't think
you rolled your eyes!

93
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,444
Kitty...

94
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:56,032
I cut myself on
the cheese grater.

95
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:02,111
Oh, now you get back here
and smile, damn it!

96
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,955
Can you believe it?

97
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:11,878
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.

98
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:15,391
I really need to introduce you
to my good friend nail polish.

99
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,054
And a promise ring
is sacred, Donna.

100
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:25,218
- Why aren't you wearing it on your left ring finger?
- I don't know.

101
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,676
'Cause I like it on this finger.
What's the difference?

102
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:31,810
<i>Donna, if you don't wear your
promise ring on your left ring finger...</i>

103
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,781
it totally cancels out the promise
that you will be together forever.

104
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:37,222
Wait. That's what I promised?

105
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,686
Hey, ladies.

106
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,126
Oh, nice ring, Donna.

107
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,264
Jackie, let me see yours.

108
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,153
- I don't have one.
- Oh, no, of course not.

109
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,143
Because Kelso has not
given you one yet.

110
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:00,452
I mean, ever. I mean...

111
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,311
Look away.

112
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:13,377
Donna, did you hear that?
Michael's giving me a promise ring.

113
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:16,829
- Yeah, that's great.
- I wonder how he's gonna give it to me.

114
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,943
I hope he hides it in food.

115
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,598
I told him if he ever
gives me something nice...

116
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,216
he should put it in food.

117
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:27,142
It's classy.

118
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,470
All right, man, be cool.

119
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:37,920
These chicks
are checking us out.

120
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,574
Cool, gotcha.

121
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:46,398
Hello, ladies!

122
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,872
No, man, that's not
how you do it.

123
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:53,699
You gotta be aloof.

124
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,922
Did you just call me a "loof"?

125
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,719
Because if so,
I'll have to kick you in your 'nads.

126
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,454
No, man. Aloof.

127
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,406
Distant.

128
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,326
Zen.

129
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:19,523
Well, that's not what
loof means in my language.

130
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:25,278
Look, I don't care what you think it means,
that's what it means here.

131
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,043
You're the loof.

132
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,493
- Fez, it's not...
- I said loof!

133
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,194
Hey, sweetie.
I got you something.

134
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:42,205
It's a gift.

135
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,996
A token of my love.

136
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,609
- Do you accept it?
- A sundae?

137
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,965
Oh.

138
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:55,909
Yeah.

139
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,291
Mmm! Michael, this is good.

140
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,590
Uh...

141
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:10,372
You could, uh...

142
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,538
Uh, y-you could close your mouth
if you... if you wanted.

143
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,811
What the hell, Michael?

144
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,596
This is ice cream.
Stupid ice cream?

145
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:21,510
No, it's stupid
ice cream of love.

146
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,965
Oh, there you are.

147
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,031
The movie's about to start.
Come on. We're...

148
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:39,780
- Where's your ring?
- Oh, I put it on a chain so I could wear it around my neck.

149
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:43,110
Burn!

150
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:48,411
Oh, super burn.
The wedding's off!

151
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,904
Kelso, shut up!

152
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,496
Yeah, Michael, you don't know
anything about anything.

153
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:59,558
I do too!

154
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:04,193
Now I don't know
which fight's the funniest.

155
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:08,198
Wait, fight? We're...

156
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,238
Okay, I'll be right back.

157
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,486
Donna, why aren't you wearing
the ring... on your hand?

158
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,730
I don't know. I didn't think
it was a big deal.

159
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,312
That is not true! I told you.
I told her it was a big deal.

160
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:29,441
Look, Eric, why don't we
talk about this later?

161
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:32,064
Well, I... You know, there's not really
anything to talk about.

162
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:33,990
Unless... you don't
wanna wear the ring.

163
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:35,910
Ouch!

164
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,600
Sorry. I'm sorry.

165
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,546
It's great. The ring is great.

166
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,037
See?

167
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:53,980
- It's great.
- So we're good?

168
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:56,510
Yeah, fine.

169
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,405
Okay, good.

170
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:06,342
It's my God-given
right as a mother!

171
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:18,161
Oh, Mrs. Forman,
that is a wonderful picture.

172
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,511
You can really see
how unhappy Donna is.

173
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:26,386
Okay, all I know is...

174
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,485
when Donna said she was fine,
she didn't seem that fine.

175
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:33,353
Eric has never been good at knowing
when fine isn't fine.

176
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,068
It runs in the family.

177
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,737
Oh, it does not.

178
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,618
- Fine.
- Okay, good.

179
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:51,023
I don't know.
She doesn't look that unhappy.

180
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:53,328
She kinda looks like you.

181
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:56,014
I'm unhappy, Bob.

182
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,481
I'm just so worried
about Eric and Donna.

183
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,594
Ah, fine.

184
00:12:25,907 --> 00:12:28,144
<i>Welcome to</i> Let's Make A Deal!

185
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,034
All right, Donna,
which is it going to be...

186
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,488
your future behind door number one,
door number two...

187
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:38,418
or door number three?

188
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,971
Oh, my God! I don't know! Um...

189
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:45,131
- Okay.
- Yeah?

190
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,374
- Door number three.
- Door number three.

191
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:51,055
All right, let's take a look at what you
didn't choose behind door number one!

192
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,186
<i>It's a leather jacket
and a typewriter...</i>

193
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:57,292
<i>which you could have
used when you became...</i>

194
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,949
a globe-trotting
rock-and-roll journalist.

195
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,564
Wow, that would've been nice.

196
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,545
Yeah, too bad.

197
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,833
All right, let's take a look
at what was behind door number two.

198
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:14,834
<i>The U.S. Constitution,
which would come in handy...</i>

199
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,682
when you became
the first woman president!

200
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,976
Oh, Monty,
these prizes are bitchin'!

201
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:22,931
Yeah, truly bitchin'.

202
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:28,176
Now let's take a look at what
you did choose behind door number three.

203
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:35,593
<i>It's your boyfriend
and a promise ring!</i>

204
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,925
I love you!

205
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:51,090
Hyde, when I cruise a girl...

206
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:54,287
how long do I have to talk to her
before she will French me?

207
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:59,985
That depends on what kind of girl
you're cruising for.

208
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,961
Which is why I'm gonna aim low.

209
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,448
Real low.

210
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,555
Just this side of gross.

211
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:15,116
Where is Michael Kelso?
I want my ring!

212
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,042
He's in the toilet.

213
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,496
Jackie, wait, wait.

214
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:22,572
Kelso wants to
give you the ring...

215
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,847
- but he's scared.
- Why is he scared?

216
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,803
Because you're scary.

217
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:34,033
No, because Kelso
is delicate, sensitive.

218
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,067
Girlish even.

219
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,816
You cannot push him into this. You gotta
be gentle. He'll do it when he's ready.

220
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,005
Where's my ring, you idiot?

221
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:49,611
Or yell at him.
It's more fun for us.

222
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:53,939
Look, you, I want my promise ring,
and I want it now.

223
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:55,913
Give it.

224
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,598
Really? Okay, just wait.

225
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,740
'Cause I... I just...
I wanna do this right.

226
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:09,486
Jackie...

227
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:12,457
from the first minute
that I saw you...

228
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,768
I knew that I wanted to
fool around with you.

229
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,919
And then, after we did that...

230
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:27,053
and I still wanted
to talk to you?

231
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:31,564
I knew that I never wanted
to be without you.

232
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,866
So...

233
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,746
will you accept my ring?

234
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,193
Yeah. Yeah, Michael, I will.

235
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,796
Oh, God.

236
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,006
I know.

237
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,562
Hey, what's up?

238
00:15:56,628 --> 00:16:00,075
- So, how was cruising?
- Unsettling.

239
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:05,035
When a girl is in a car,
you can only see her from the neck up.

240
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:12,591
Talk about the tip
of the iceberg! Oh.

241
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:18,413
- So where's Donna?
- Ah, she said she had to study.

242
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,905
Oh. So everything's cool?

243
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:24,050
Okay...

244
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:26,921
Look...

245
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:29,101
I don't know what everyone
thinks is going on...

246
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:32,401
but Donna and I
are not only fine...

247
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,322
we're great.

248
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:36,656
Everything's
finally settled, so...

249
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:38,894
we're happier than ever.

250
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:41,811
Well, one of you is.

251
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,941
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Look, Forman...

252
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:46,866
I get what you're trying to do.

253
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:50,761
You know, you're trying
to lock her up, seal the deal.

254
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:54,665
And... all I'm saying is...

255
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,714
Maybe Donna's not
that kind of girl.

256
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:03,699
Okay, you don't know
as much as you think, Hyde.

257
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,770
So you need to just shut up.

258
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:14,639
Now, that man is a loof.

259
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:26,418
Hey! What are you
doing out here?

260
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:29,352
Um... I wanted to talk to you.

261
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:36,558
Look, this is gonna be hard.

262
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:38,537
Um...

263
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,674
Eric, I love you.

264
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,714
A lot.

265
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:47,089
But I have to give you
your ring back.

266
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:50,668
What? Why?

267
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,281
Okay...

268
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:59,436
How do you see
the next 20 years?

269
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:04,171
I don't know.
I guess I always figured...

270
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:07,374
we'd go to college together,
then come home...

271
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:09,778
Yeah, but, Eric, you know
that's not what I want.

272
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,948
I mean, I've told you that.

273
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:15,019
And who knows? I might want
to go to school back East.

274
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:17,742
Or... maybe in Paris.

275
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:22,187
Okay, well, you know what,
Donna, whatever. Okay?

276
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,416
The important thing is when you
see yourself in Paris or wherever...

277
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,393
I'm there, right?

278
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,106
Right?

279
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:35,473
I don't know.

280
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:38,930
Not always.

281
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:41,002
I mean, it's not like
there's anyone else...

282
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,497
but sometimes I'm by myself.

283
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:47,466
I mean... All I mean is, I don't know.
Neither of us does.

284
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,696
And this ring is just a stupid
high school promise.

285
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,855
If we're meant to be together,
then... we'll end up together.

286
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,945
No.

287
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,314
The way we end up together
is by saying we'll be together...

288
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,827
and then, being together.

289
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:08,874
Eric, come on.

290
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,785
We're together now.

291
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,747
Isn't that enough?

292
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:16,145
No! I mean...

293
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:19,474
I mean, damn, Donna.

294
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,249
If you can see a future for yourself without
me and that doesn't, like, break your heart...

295
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,803
then we're not doing what
I thought we were doing here.

296
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,592
And you know what?
Maybe we shouldn't even be together at all!

297
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,514
Wait a minute.

298
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:38,226
Are you breaking up with me?

299
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,179
Well...

300
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:42,153
are you giving back that ring?

301
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,698
- Yes.
- <i>Then...</i>

302
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,146
Yes.

303
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:43,096
- Leo, I... I need to return this.
- Hey, man...

304
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:46,745
I only said it was gold,
not real gold.

305
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:49,204
No, it's...

306
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,254
Donna and I broke up.

307
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,181
What?

308
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,483
What happened to the love, man?

309
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,755
Well, I don't really
feel like...

310
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,882
No! If you kids
can't make it, who can?

311
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,733
Tell me, who?

312
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,134
Why, God, why?

313
00:21:08,305 --> 00:22:08,757

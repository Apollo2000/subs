1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,120
Elke Sommer to block.
Elke Sommer to block.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,920
Oh, you stupid son of a bitch.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,560
Donna... loved <i>Hollywood Squares.</i>

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,240
Ah, Forman. Come on, man.
Give it a rest, huh?

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,520
So you're single now. That's a good thing.
Now you're like me, man.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,600
You're free to be with lotsa subpar,
somewhat sleazy chicks.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,000
It's Christmas, baby.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, you disguise your heart, Hyde, but...

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,720
I know you need love.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,800
- Why is that?
- 'Cause I need it.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,560
All right. I'm goin' to work before you two
start braidin' each other's hair.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,720
You know what? I wish for once Hyde
would fall in love, you know?

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,640
So we could make fun of <i>him.</i>

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,800
We'd be all, "Hey, everyone"...

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,800
"Hyde's in love."

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Burn.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, I know.
Let's get Hyde a woman.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,760
We can have
a "Let's Get Hyde a Woman" party.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,280
And... And we can have food
and music and, um...

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,120
- Women?
- That's it.

21

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,520
Hey, this party is a great idea.
I am gonna find the perfect match for Steven.

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,120
After all, my nickname
is "The Queen of Romance."

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
No one calls you that.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,840
Now, we will each bring
no less than two...

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,880
and no more than five girls
to the party for Hyde, okay?

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,520
I will console the rejects
with a hot oil massage.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
I will be nude.

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,960
Well, I'm outta here. The radio station's
giving away a van, and I gotta work.

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,880
I will be clothed.

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,880
Well, I think it's a great idea.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Steven is almost a man,
and he needs to meet a girl...

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
who will help him find his way.

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,480
Yeah. A girl helped me find
my way... to hell! I'm in hell.

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Oh, you're not in hell.
If you're too hot, take off your sweater.

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
- So, it's settled. We'll have the party here.
- No, Kitty.

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,080
I don't know
what you're talkin' about, but, no.

38
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes. We're... We're havin' a little party
for Steven, so he can meet his Miss Right.

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,480
Why is it here?
Why is it always here?

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,480
Well, what do you want them to do,
have the party in the street?

41
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,920
Yes.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,560
They puke in the street,
the city cleans it up.

43
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,360
Oh-ho, man!

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,360
Oh, I hope I win this van.
I really need a place to do it with Jackie.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
Okay. Listen up everybody.
The rules are simple.

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,360
You place one hand on the van.

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
If you remove your hand for any reason,
you're out.

48
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,520
Last person to remove his hand
wins the van.

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,920
Any questions?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,280
You're out.
Any other questions?

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,400
- Don't start without me, Max.
- Oh, God.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,760
Hello.

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
My name is Daniel...

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,080
and I have won every WFPP contest...

55
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,200
since the Weber Gas Grill
Trampoline Bounce of 1972.

56
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,240
I am unbeatable,
so the choice is yours:

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,840
Joy or despair...

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,040
pleasure or pain...

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,680
life... or death.

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,200
I am Daniel!

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,920
And I cannot be beaten.

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,600
Look at what I brought.

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,120
- Big Rhonda?
- Uh-huh.

64
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,680
There goes the keg.

65
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,120
Everybody, look who's here...

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,160
a caring, intelligent, snazzy young man...

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,440
Ste-e-even Hyde!

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,440
Um, thanks.

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,160
Hey, man. What's goin' on? I thought
we were watchin' <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,720
Yeah. Change of plans.
We're havin' a party with girls, a keg...

71
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,120
and girls.

72
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,840
- For no reason whatsoever.
- Great.

73
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,320
- And there's no agenda.
- All right.

74
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,840
Stop grilling me, you bastard!

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,080
Oh, hey, Melissa.

76
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,160
- How's the contest going?
- Lame. But at least the boneheads are entertaining.

77
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,960
Check out that idiot's 'fro.

78
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,800
Hey, that's my dad.

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
- Oh! Uh...
- No.

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,920
Okay. Yeah. You're right.

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,920
- So, hey, what are you doin' tonight?
- We're in Wisconsin...

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,880
so nothing.

83
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,240
Well, I'm goin' to this party. It's in a stinky
basement, and they'll have a stolen keg.

84
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,440
- I'm in.
- Cool.

85
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Hey, Dad. I brought you some mints
and your afro pick.

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,360
Oh, thank God, Donna.
My hair was startin' to look silly.

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,880
Hey, check out the redhead.

88
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,680
That redhead is my baby girl Donna.
I'm her dad.

89
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,800
I want Donna to call me "Daddy."

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
- That's it!
- Ah! Bob.

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
You took your hand off the van.
You lose.

92
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,480
This isn't over.

93
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,600
It is for you.
Get outta here.

94
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,520
And so begins the battle of wits.

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,080
Oh, man.
I've never been good at wits.

96
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,720
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,560
So, chips and dip, huh?

98
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,120
Yeah.

99
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,200
And the words kinda sound alike,
so that's always fun.

100
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,520
Look. No offense,
but I'm really not in the mood for talking.

101
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,080
I just... broke up
with my girlfriend, so...

102
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Oh, you poor thing.

103
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,600
You know, you have these sad lips
that are just so hot.

104
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,360
Really?

105
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,720
I may not be popular, but if given the
chance, I'll put out somethin' fierce.

106
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,960
Psst!

107
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,360
Psst! How's it goin'?

108
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,280
Great, great, great, great. 'Cause, see,
at first, I thought I should wear my hair up.

109
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,320
But... let's be honest.
My hair is one of my top five features.

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,840
So, voilא! It's down.

111
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,200
Psst! Psst!

112
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,560
Hyde, allow me to introduce you
to a special lady.

113
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,640
So we meet every week to pray
and discuss Scripture. You in?

114
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,560
I used to date your dad.
Isn't that a turn-on?

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,880
It's not like head cheerleader's
always the most talented...

116
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,640
but in my case, it's true.

117
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,160
I have to date guys who aren't as good-looking
as me, otherwise, I'd never date.

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,560
You gonna eat that?

119
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
I know you're really angry
and emotionally crippled...

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,080
but that's okay,
'cause my boyfriend's in jail.

121
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,960
My turn-offs include people who are mean
to puppies and people who smoke...

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,920
or... don't smoke?

123
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,840
Or smoke?

124
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,920
Wait. Do you smoke?

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,760
Okay. So guess which leg's real.

126
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm so glad I finally got to meet you, 'cause
I've, like, always been afraid of you...

127
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
and I like to be scared.

128
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,200
So? What do you think?

129
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
You know, I think, if I time this right...

130
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,080
I can nail
every single one of these girls...

131
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,000
tonight.

132
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,320
No, no, no, no, no. You're supposed
to pick just one... to love, not nail.

133
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,080
Love.

134
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah. Right.

135
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,560
Okay. Listen to me, Johnny Cool.

136
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,120
I threw this party for you, so you can find one
girlfriend to love you. And that is all. One.

137
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,840
- You set this up?
- Yeah. We all thought you needed help finding a quality woman.

138
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,760
What?

139
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,520
Man, you sit around and talk about me?
Is that what's goin' on?

140
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,920
Look. I don't want your help.

141
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,280
I give and I do,
and I do and I give.

142
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,320
And for what?

143
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,360
For nothing.

144
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Well, I'm done. Go.

145
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,320
- But, Fez...
- I said, <i>go.</i>

146
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,360
- Hey, Hyde.
- Hey.

147
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,120
This is Melissa. She just moved here from
Chicago. Work at the radio station together.

148
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Melissa, this is Hyde.

149
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,560
You're not leaving already, are you?

150
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,720
- Uh, no. I came out to get some fresh air.
- <i>Oh.</i>

151
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,160
It's, uh...
It's fresher out here... the air.

152
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,560
I like air. How 'bout you?

153
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,520
Air's okay.

154
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,680
You know what's really good? Water.

155
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,400
That's really...

156
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,360
This summer I'm gonna visit
my aunt in Mississippi.

157
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,560
Oh, you're goin' away?
That is sad.

158
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,480
Hey, you should come with me,
chocolate milk.

159
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,080
When I looked across the room,
I saw a guy who was wounded...

160
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,000
a guy who sits in the dark
waiting for the light to find him again.

161
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,600
If only I could find
this light you speak of...

162
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,720
then maybe... just... maybe...

163
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,840
my pain might go away.

164
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,880
Would it help if I held you?

165
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,680
I doubt it.

166
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,720
But let's try, Katie.

167
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Yeah. Lower. Yeah.

168
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,640
I am so disgusted.

169
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,640
Oh, I know.
There are way too many girls at this party.

170
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,800
I can't even smell my own perfume.

171
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,400
Well, you're the only one.

172
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,880
You know, you may not even be
the prettiest girl here.

173
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,080
You shut your hole.

174
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,080
I... am... pretty!

175
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,000
Unsure.

176
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,320
Must... find... Michael!

177
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,120
Hi. You know...

178
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm a guy who's... wounded.

179
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,920
- So I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- Thanks. Get one for yourself too.

180
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,160
No. I...

181
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,120
Ca...

182
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,440
- Can I get you a beer?
- There you go.

183
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,560
- Thanks.
- Right.

184
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,880
A toast...

185
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,840
to all my good friends.

186
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,040
I will miss you
when I blow out of this burg...

187
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,240
with the beautiful Big Rhonda.

188
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,560
Now it's off to "Missis-syphilis"!

189
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,920
Oh, no. Red, they've been drinking.

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
Well, well. What do ya know?

191
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,360
Here, Kelso. Thought you might need
some coffee to keep you goin'.

192
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,720
Hey, you know what would be fun?

193
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,560
- Seein' which one of us could drink the most coffee, huh?
- Uh-huh.

194
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,480
Oh, no.

195
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,320
- You'll just lose.
- Wha... No. I would not.

196
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
- I could so beat you.
- Well, I doubt that.

197
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,080
- Oh, you're goin' down.
- Hmm.

198
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,160
- That's my six to your one!
- Yeah. Ya really whipped me.

199
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
Kelso, have you ever been
to Niagara Falls?

200
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,680
- Uh-uh.
- Hmm. Don't you like the soothing sound of water?

201
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,600
- Yeah. I guess.
- Hmm. You ever sat beside a babbling brook...

202
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,720
listening to the beautiful,
steady stream of water?

203
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
Well, I... Okay.
I don't know if you realize this, but...

204
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,880
a-all this talk about water
is really making have to go pee.

205
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry. Yeah.

206
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,040
I can see that "urine"...
a lot of pain.

207
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,760
Yeah. Well, y-you better shut up,
'cause you're gonna have to go too.

208
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,560
That's where you're wrong.
I <i>am</i> going.

209
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,160
I know I just met her, Mr. Red...

210
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,760
but I love her.

211
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,880
She is sturdy.

212
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,920
I want to climb her.

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,600
You're just desperate to give it away,
aren't you, son?

214
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes. Yes, I am.

215
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,920
Look.

216
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,280
There are two things that you need
to learn about women.

217
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,400
Oh, finally, the sex talk!

218
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,560
First: If a woman outweighs you
by 30 pounds...

219
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,600
you're in for trouble.

220
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,280
But I'll put on weight.
I'll bridge the gap.

221
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,720
Which brings me
to my second point.

222
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,760
When used separately,
women and alcohol can be a lot of fun.

223
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,320
But if you mix 'em,
they can turn you into a dumb-ass.

224
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
- Michael!
- Jackie.

225
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
- I thought you were at the party.
- No, no, no. It was awful.

226
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Do you know what it's like
to be the prettiest girl at a party...

227
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
and not have anyone acknowledge it?

228
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,640
Yes, I do.

229
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,680
- Michael, am I pretty?
- Oh, come on, cupcake.

230
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,480
You are the prettiest girl in Point Place.

231
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,400
No. You know what? In Wisconsin.

232
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,480
Nice one, Pinocchio.

233
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,640
- Am I prettier than Pam Macy?
- Of course.

234
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,520
Am I prettier than Farrah Fawcett?

235
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,320
Oh, all right. Come on.
She's like a perfect 10.

236
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
And you are an 11.

237
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,920
- Am I prettier than...
- Oh, my God!

238
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,160
Am I prettier than the girl
with the feathered hair at the supermarket?

239
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,440
Okay, okay, the blonde-haired one
or the brown-haired one?

240
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,400
Well, does it matter?

241
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,720
No, 'cause ya smoke 'em both, baby!

242
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,080
- Am I prettier than...
- Oh, my God!

243
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,320
I can't take it anymore!

244
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,800
Am I pretty? Am I pretty?

245
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,960
Am I pretty? Shut up!

246
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,680
And we finally have a winner.

247
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,720
I did it!

248
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,720
Oh, my God. I won!
Who's the best? I'm the best!

249
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,640
Loser!

250
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,600
I'm not a loser, okay?

251
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,920
I win everything.

252
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
I don't lose. I win!

253
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
Because I'm a winner!

254
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm a winner!

255
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
So, Michael Kelso,
tell Wisconsin how it feels...

256
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,000
to be WFPP's new
Hand 2 Van winner!

257
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,400
Well, I guess I have to say it
like this, Max:

258
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,880
If this van's a-rockin'...

259
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,840
we're in there doin' it!

260
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,200
- Michael!
- Oh. Um, I'm sorry.

261
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm doin' it with Jackie Burkhart!

262
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,200
If you really think putting my head
on your lap will make me feel better...

263
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,800
I mean, I guess...

264
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,800
I should try.

265
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,760
All right. That's it.

266
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,520
Excuse me, girls.
I have some information...

267
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,560
No. Don't listen to what she's...
I'm... She's the one who hurt me.

268
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,200
Uh-huh. Yeah. He dumped <i>me.</i>

269
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,160
You dumped her?

270
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, I had to. She wouldn't...
She wouldn't take my ring.

271
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,240
You wouldn't take his ring?

272
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,000
This is none of your business.
And you...

273
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,200
are a sad little man.

274
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,960
Tsk. Oh, poor baby.

275
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,720
- Do you want my number?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

276
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,360
- So, you havin' fun?
- That reminds me.

277
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,360
I have to go.

278
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,640
Uh, Melissa...

279
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,280
um, I was wonderin' if maybe
you wanted to do somethin' sometime.

280
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,440
Sorry. I did something last night,
and I already made plans for sometime.

281
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,480
No. Wait, wait.
Uh, let me try that again.

282
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,240
Um, look.
If you're not doing anything Friday night...

283
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,960
I'd like to take you out...
to, uh...

284
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,080
to...
to dinner and a movie.

285
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,400
Pizza?

286
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,360
The mall?

287
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
Bowling?

288
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,760
I'd love to. Call me.

289
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,320
Call you?
That's a little unorthodox.

290
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,440
I'll call you.

291
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,160
Ye-e-es.

292
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,720
"I'll call you." "I'll call you."

293
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,480
Whipped.

294
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,600
What? I don't care about her.
Melissa who? What the hell.

295
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,320
Whipped like the family pig.

296
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,600
Rhonda, I cannot go to Mississippi.

297
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,080
So, you're not coming?

298
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,560
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,600
But maybe we can go
to the movies sometime.

300
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,440
And make out in the theater? Yeah!

301
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,360
Call me.

302
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,880
Good God. Sober up, man.

303
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,160
Oh, screw it, Donna.
Fez likes them big.

304
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,960
Fez likes them small.
Fez likes them all.

305
00:21:08,305 --> 00:22:08,757

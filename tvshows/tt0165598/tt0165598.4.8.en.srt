2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,460
- Oh, Wanda.
- Oh, Derek.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,100
- Oh, Wanda.
- Yes, Derek?

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,060
You're not just
my next-door neighbor.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,860
You're also
the love of my life.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,980
Derek, I, too, have strong
feelings of love for you...

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,140
but I have to give back
this promise ball and chain.

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,500
I must leave
Point Upon the Place...

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,220
and explore the world
with my trusty cat named Sir Bonkers.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,380
No.

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,300
I'll never let you go.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,420
- You can't make me stay.
- Oh, no?

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,300
What if I told you that I've run over
the cat named Sir Bonkers...

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,380
and the cat named
Sir Bonkers is no more?

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,140
Now submit
and be my wife!

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,740
Derek, once you were
a kind, peaceful man...

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,500
but love
has made you wicked.

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,100
Oh, I am wicked.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,580
And until you agree
to be my wife...

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,900
I will scour the earth
in search of cats named "Sir Bonkers"...

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,820
and I will kill
them all!

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,060
Or at very least,
spray them with water...

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,260
which everyone knows
they hate.

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,860
I can't believe Donna would
publish this in the school paper.

25
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,660
I know. This could be in <i>Reader's Digest.</i>
It's that good.

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,980
Oh, this is the worst short story by
an ex-girlfriend in a school newspaper ever.

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, if it isn't <i>Playboy</i> reading,
panty-loving, cat-killing Derek.

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,400
I know.
How could Donna write this?

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,240
Why are you upset? It's this Derek
guy who really gets the shaft.

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,080
Fez, I am Derek.

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,960
Everything always
has to be about you.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Fez, man, think about it.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,120
Eric killed Donna's cat.
Derek killed Wanda's cat.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Donna found panties
in Eric's Vista Cruiser.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Wanda found a chastity belt
in Derek's Vista Carriage.

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Hey, you guys, you know what goes
really good with a bad short story?

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,640
Pinball!

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,840
- No. I hate pinball.
- Hate it or love it?

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,600
- Hate it.
- Or love it?

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Come on, guys. I'm gonna buy a
50-dollar stake in this machine...

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,440
so let's play
so I can make some money.

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,560
Where'd you get $50?

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,240
- From Jackie.
- Hey.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Oh, hey, Jackie.
Can I borrow $50?

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,320
- For what?
- To buy a dress for you.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,760
Okay.

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,600
Wait a minute.

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,160
Eric, Derek.

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,920
Panties, chastity belt.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,680
Dead cat, dead cat.

51
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,080
Oh-ho-ho!
I still got nothing.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Come on, Red.

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,480
Bob really wants us to meet
his new lady friend.

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
Now, think about it,
Kitty.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,680
She likes Bob.

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,560
I have a hard time believing
this woman even exists.

57
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,320
We're gonna get over there,
Bob's gonna be sittin' in a rocker...

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,280
with a lady's wig on.

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,160
"You look lovely
tonight, Bob."

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,880
"So do you, Bob."

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,320
You've been working on that
all day, haven't you?

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,560
Yeah.

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,880
Red, Kitty, I'd like you to meet
a very special lady... Joanne.

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,680
Well, Joanne,
it is so nice to meet you.

65
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,240
- Right, Red?
- We can't stay long.

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,360
Ah, Red. Bob warned me
you can be a pain in the ass.

67
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,360
Well, I'll tell you what.
We'll just have dinner...

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,560
and if it turns out you don't like me,
we'll never invite you over again.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,520
Really?
I like you already.

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,280
Well, let's get this barbecue started.
Bob, grab that meat.

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,880
Oh, I got it, Red.
Why don't you fellas make a salad?

72
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,120
Salad.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,480
Oh, you're serious.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,480
No, see, Bob and I
do the grilling.

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,760
Not this time.
Kitty, you wanna give me a hand?

76
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,600
- Well, I'd love to.
- Oh, I don't think...

77
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,240
But, Kitty, you might...

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,440
set your lovely hair
on fire.

79
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,440
Well, it can't be that hard.
You do it.

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,080
Bob, what the hell's
goin' on here?

81
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,040
Look, Red,
I really like this woman...

82
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,040
so please, for today,
just shut it.

83
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,040
Shut it?

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,080
Good God, Bob!

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,000
Is she teaching you
to stand up for yourself?

86
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,000
- Yes.
- Well, cut it out!

87
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,880
I want to have a nice time.
Come on.

88
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,440
I'll give you first dibs
on the aprons.

89
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,760
You want the fake tuxedo
or the fake hairy chest?

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,280
Oh, damn it.
Give me the tuxedo!

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,480
Whoo-hoo! Hairy chest is Joanne's favorite.

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,400
It's probably
'cause she's got one.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Ah! Well, if it isn't
the wielder of the poison pen.

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,640
- Didn't you like my story?
- No. No, I didn't.

95
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,840
That's why I said
"poison pen"...

96
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,920
not... "marshmallow pen."

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,840
What?

98
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,680
- This story is about us.
- No, it's not.

99
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,560
You took stuff from our life
and put 'em in your story.

100
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,000
Like the time you found
those <i>Playboys</i> under my bed.

101
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,080
Begone, Sir Bonkers.

102
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,080
Derek, look what I found
under your bed.

103
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,920
Lewd renderings of
naked serving wenches.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,840
Did you commission these?

105
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,760
So what if I did?
I have needs, woman.

106
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,320
Now, ready thyself.
On this night... we fornicate.

107
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,800
Okay, well, maybe there
are some similarities.

108
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,880
But that's what writers do.
I mean, we take stuff from our lives.

109
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Yeah, but you made me mean all the time,
and that's mean.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,920
Okay, maybe I exaggerated
some stuff...

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,200
'cause, you know, I'm writing
this for stupid high school girls.

112
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,680
Oh, my God!
Great story!

113
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,920
Michael, Steven just told me
that instead of buying me a dress...

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,760
you spent my $50
on this stupid machine.

115
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,000
Jackie, I did not.

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,480
Oh, yeah, I did.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,160
Jackie, listen.
There's an old saying:

118
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,480
You buy a girl a dress,
and she looks pretty for one night.

119
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,000
But you buy her boyfriend a pinball machine,
and she looks pretty for life.

120
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,120
Okay, there's another
old saying, Michael:

121
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,120
You're dumb as dirt.

122
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,400
That's true.
That was in the yearbook.

123
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,240
Okay, okay. All right.
Listen, listen.

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
So, I bought a half stake
in this machine, all right?

125
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,920
So that means for every quarter
I put into it, I get half back.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,840
That's a 50% profit!

127
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,240
Uh, actually, Kelso,
I think that's a 50% loss.

128
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,440
Fez, I know it's hard
for a foreigner...

129
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,520
to understand our complicated
capitalist system.

130
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
But we're dealing with quarters here,
not frogs or chickens.

131
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,480
Well, I'm not going to dignify
that with a response...

132
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,000
because I can't
think of one.

133
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,240
But when I do,
a good day to you.

134
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,800
- All right, Fez. Y...
- I said, kiss my ass.

135
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,360
So, you still mad?

136
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,800
No. No reason to be mad.

137
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,000
Your story is just a pathetic attempt to
rewrite history and make yourself look good.

138
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm pretty sure everyone's gonna know
who the dill-hole is here.

139
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
Eric, it's just a story.

140
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
No one's gonna think
anybody's a dill-hole.

141
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,520
- Cat killer!
- Bastard!

142
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,080
Porn freak!

143
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,360
Okay, they could be
talking about anybody.

144
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,080
Hey, we're all
porn-freak bastards...

145
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,600
but he's the only one
who killed a cat.

146
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,120
Okay, okay. This school obviously needs
to hear the Eric Forman version of things...

147
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,960
A.K.A. The truth.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
So I'm gonna write my own story.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

149
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm throwing down
the gauntlet, baby.

150
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,520
Really? Okay, smarty,
what's a gauntlet?

151
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,120
A gauntlet?
What's a gauntlet?

152
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,160
What's a gauntlet?

153
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,080
I don't know,
but it's down, lady.

154
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Boy, this chicken's delish. What a chef.

155
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,840
You really know your way
around a grill, Joanne.

156
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,960
Mine's dry.

157
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,280
No, it isn't.
It's tender and delicious.

158
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,400
Maybe if I chewed it
with some water.

159
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,800
Well, there's the hose.

160
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,720
- I don't like her anymore.
- Well, I do.

161
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,520
Kitty, I'm chopping vegetables...

162
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,720
Bob's telling me to shut it...

163
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,080
you're over there grilling
with Susan B. Damn Anthony.

164
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,560
Well, fine, Red.
If it bothers you...

165
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,480
we can invite them over,
and you can do the grilling.

166
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,480
But for now, I'd really appreciate it
if you'd just shut it.

167
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
If one more person
tells me to shut it...

168
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
What? You might
actually shut it?

169
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,000
Please, Wanda, you don't
have to boil me alive.

170
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,560
Killing your cat was
just a horrible accident.

171
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,800
I know, but I'm a witch.

172
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,680
Dear God, why is a nice,
sensitive guy like me...

173
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,560
dating a lying,
manipulative witch like you?

174
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,760
Well, maybe it's because
even witches have itches.

175
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
All is forgiven!

176
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,160
God, why do all my
stories end like that?

177
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Don't stop. I like
where you were going.

178
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,980
All right, guys. It is time
to make a withdrawal...

179
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,740
from the First National
Bank of Pinball.

180
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,260
Oh, man.
No one's playing.

181
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,060
Well, I would've played, but my frogs
and chickens wouldn't fit into the slot.

182
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,420
All right. I know
what the problem is here.

183
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,020
This thing has been here for so long
that people have forgotten about it.

184
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,940
I just need to advertise. So, Jackie, put on
a bikini and stand in front of the machine.

185
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,140
Michael, I am not wearing a bikini in here.
It would cause a riot.

186
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,660
Okay, what if I just
put up flyers...

187
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,700
with a picture
of you in a bikini?

188
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,740
Yeah, okay. I mean,
it'll still draw a crowd...

189
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,860
but at least
they'll remain orderly.

190
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,020
Okay, so I just need some Magic Markers
and a picture of you in a bikini.

191
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,460
Oh. I have one.

192
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,300
Keep it.
I have plenty.

193
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,100
So, guys,
check out my story.

194
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,780
I passed out a bunch of copies
at lunch today.

195
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,540
Oh, Forman, this kind of thing
always blows up in your face.

196
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,300
Don't ever stop doing it.

197
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
What the hell is this?

198
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,140
Oh, you...
you didn't like my story?

199
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,540
Oh, yeah, I loved it.
Especially this part.

200
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,180
Wanda, I have performed
every task thou hath asketh of me.

201
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,700
Please, can we finally
consummate our love?

202
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,620
I beseech you.

203
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,460
Well, I said I would.
So I won't.

204
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,260
But... I beseeched you.

205
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,940
Okay, let's consummate.

206
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,140
- Really?
- No.

207
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,700
Please.
I beseech you.

208
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,620
- Okay.
- Really?

209
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,700
No.

210
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,900
Now rub my enormous feet.

211
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,060
<i>Um, guys, I don't understand.</i>
<i>What does "consummate" mean?</i>

212
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,940
It means to have sex.

213
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,900
Really?

214
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,060
Now I have
two words for that.

215
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,140
Eric, you just
wrote this to hurt me.

216
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,020
What? I did not!
And, hey, so did you.

217
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,580
Look, when I wrote my story,
I just sat down, and that's what came out.

218
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,780
I didn't, like,
plan it or anything.

219
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,700
And besides...
No, you know what?

220
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,860
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

221
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,660
Okay, I'd like someone
to explain it to me.

222
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,260
Uh, well,
that's easy, Fez.

223
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,300
See, Donna,
as an artist...

224
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,980
wrote her story to get
some perspective on her life.

225
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,100
Forman,
as a vindictive ass...

226
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,980
wrote his story
to be a vindictive ass.

227
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,700
Oh, Eric, I think you just
consummated yourself.

228
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,260
See what I did there?
Looks easy, but it's not.

229
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,180
Well, steaks
are a-cookin'.

230
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,860
Ah, what should we have
to go with dinner?

231
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,500
Oh, I know.
How about a salad?

232
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,220
Say, Joanne, why don't you
make the salad?

233
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,380
- No, thanks.
- <i>Oh.</i>

234
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,020
Aww.

235
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,020
Make the salad.

236
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,820
Unless you don't like
to do lady jobs.

237
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,740
Red, put this
in your mouth.

238
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,620
Okay, you know what?
I'll make the salad. Heh!

239
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,580
- Sit down, Bob.
- Sit down, Bob.

240
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,780
- I'd love to make a salad.
- Great.

241
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,380
As soon as Red admits he's not
asking me to make a salad...

242
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,860
he's trying to put me
in my place.

243
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,580
You are woman.
I hear you roar.

244
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,820
I can't believe you're so threatened by
something as trivial as me grilling chicken.

245
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,220
It's not trivial.
Men grill.

246
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,700
It's been that way
since the first caveman...

247
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,820
bonked a woolly mammoth
on the head...

248
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,300
and threw it
on the barbecue.

249
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,500
And his cave wife
made the salad.

250
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,300
- I smell something burning.
- Oh, darn!

251
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,260
Well, if you didn't want it well done,
you should've said something.

252
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,980
What the hell!

253
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,660
Where's my pinball machine?

254
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,460
Oh, where, indeed?

255
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,180
I remember.

256
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,140
I convinced the owner that pinball was out,
and Space Invaders was in.

257
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,300
Fez, why would you stab me
in the back like that?

258
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,700
Well, rest assured, Kelso, your frogs and
chickens comment had nothing to do with it.

259
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,060
Well, why then?

260
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,660
Hey, Eric, we're sorry we called you
a cat-killer bastard porn freak.

261
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,660
Oh, so, you read
my story, huh?

262
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,700
No, we read part two
of Donna's story.

263
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,660
The ending
is so beautiful.

264
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,460
Part... Huh?

265
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,140
Beauti... What?

266
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,700
"And as Wanda walked away,
she knew in her heart...

267
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,140
she would never
stop loving Derek."

268
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,820
Wow,
that's good writing.

269
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,100
It's emotional,
and it screws you.

270
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,580
Hey.

271
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,900
Hey, so, uh, funny thing.

272
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,780
Um, your story
had a second part, huh?

273
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,860
Yeah, the paper broke it in half,
'cause it was too long.

274
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,780
Oh.

275
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,420
Well, uh, you know,
maybe my story has a second part too.

276
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,220
Eric, your story ended with,
"And he never saw that crazy bitch again."

277
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,500
Well, you know, that
was just a prequel...

278
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,300
to a story entitled, uh...

279
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,500
"He Did See That Crazy Bitch Again,
and She Was a Delight."

280
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,380
Okay, I was...
I was pretty mad when I wrote that.

281
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,580
Eric, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings...

282
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,660
but I guess I was mad
when I wrote mine too.

283
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,660
At least when I started.

284
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,140
But once I got all that stuff off my chest,
I mean, I felt better about us...

285
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,900
more like the second half
of my story.

286
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,540
So, uh... So what happens
to Derek and Wanda?

287
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,020
Well, in the story, they went off
on their own adventures.

288
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,740
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
that's probably good for them.

289
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,460
Yeah, it's probably time
they moved on.

290
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,860
Sure.
Derek's gonna be fine.

291
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,900
He's a smart guy.

292
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,020
The wenches love him.

293
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,700
Yeah, well, Wanda's
gonna do great too.

294
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,980
Oh, yeah, sure.
She'll get all the wenches she wants.

295
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,140
Oh, my God, Donna,
there's your story.

296
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,900
"Wanda and the Dirty Wenches."

297
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,340
- Shut up.
- I know. I know.

298
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,340
That's a movie.

299
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,720
Uh! Oh, Fez, I can't hold my
feelings inside any longer.

300
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,520
Yes, we must finally tell you
how much we desire you.

301
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,040
And it's not just us, Fez.

302
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,440
Oh, I knew it all along.

303
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,880
Now let's consummate me.

304
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,320
Ahh, oh, boy.

305
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720

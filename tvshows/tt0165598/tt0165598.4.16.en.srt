1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,540
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,780
"Skinny Dill-hole
Talks Like an Idiot"?

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,060
Yeah, yeah. I read it.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,100
No. Guess who was voted
Point Place High's Most Eligible Viking?

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,100
Tommy Larkin?

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,660
Well, he is dreamy.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,940
No. Me, thank you
very much.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,100
Congratulations, Eric. I guess this
opens up a whole new world for you...

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,980
one where you can
actually date chicks.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,500
And don't think I haven't
already thought of that, my friend.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,820
Bachelorina Number One...

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,580
I've been diagnosed with a disease
that makes me irresistible to women.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,420
If you were my doctor,
what would you do to treat me?

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,620
I'd order you to stay in bed
for three weeks...

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,260
with me.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,140
Uh-oh. I'm feeling
better already.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,300
- Bachelorina Number Two?
- Well...

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,460
I'd have you strip down
for a complete physical.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,740
Well, then I guess we know...

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,660
what's up, Doc.

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,260
Number Three?

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,580
I'd write you
a prescription for love...

24
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,140
and tell you to take me
three times a day.

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,700
Careful, I might O.D.

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,620
Well, Eric...

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,580
it's time to choose.

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,060
Which one of these luscious,
fawning chicks will it be?

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,260
Gosh, they all sound so great.

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,180
I can't decide.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,900
Well, that's okay. You're Point
Place High's Most Eligible Viking.

32
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,100
You can have them all!

33
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,540
How tremendously fair!

34
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,540
Kelso, tell Eric
what he gets.

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,260
Bachelorina Number One...

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,140
is a hot cheerleader.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,180
Bachelorina Number Two
is a hot cheerleader.

38
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,780
Bachelorina Number Three
is a hot gymnast...

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,580
who used to be
a hot cheerleader.

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,060
Well, until next time...

41
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,700
this is Eric's jealous friend Hyde saying,
"I wish I was Eric Forman."

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,660
So long!

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,660
Forman, don't put me in your fantasies.
I don't even like being in your real life.

44
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,260
You can put me in your fantasies.
I don't mind.

45
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,660
I don't have
a lot going on.

46
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,060
Oh, hey, Donna.

47
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,300
Hey, um, did you see
the school paper?

48
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,220
Oh, yeah. Field hockey team's
going to state. Whoo-hoo!

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,020
Uh-oh. Looks like someone
doesn't wanna talk about...

50
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,900
the new Most Eligible Viking.

51
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,740
Look, Donna,
this whole, uh...

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,420
"Most Eligible" thing has
really taught me something.

53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,860
Um, I'm pretty.

54
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,260
<i>So, what do you say...</i>

55
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,140
like, we officially
start dating other people?

56
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,340
Oh, I've been waiting
for your permission.

57
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,220
And can I stay out past 9:00,
please, please?

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,220
As long as you're gonna be cool
when you see me with...

59
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,460
one, two or seven of
Point Place's juiciest tomatoes.

60
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,940
It's just like old times...

61
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,660
Eric and Donna talking about
meaningless crap that affects only them.

62
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,580
I've missed it so.

63
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,140
I <i>have</i> missed it.

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,540
I don't have a lot going on.

65
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,940
Hey, look here.

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,220
That '58 Corvette down
at the used-car lot is still for sale.

67
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,460
Oh, and look here. That diamond bracelet
down at the mall is still for sale.

68
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,460
Hey, Red, get this.

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,940
A while back, I'm in my car crying,
'cause Midgie was gone...

70
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,620
and I kept having to reach
into the glove box for tissues.

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,620
Oh, that's dangerous.

72
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,820
One time I had to blow my nose. Nearly
hit that cockeyed girl down the street.

73
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,540
I could've sworn
she was lookin' right at me.

74
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,620
So I attached a box of tissues
to the sun visor...

75
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,980
sold the idea for a bundle,
and voilא.

76
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,900
The Weeper Keeper was born.

77
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,300
Oh, God.
Are you rich again?

78
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,220
Yep.

79
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,780
I'm back to my
I-can-buy-anything-I-want former self.

80
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,780
Just picked up two sombreros
and a case of Lik-m-aid.

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,740
Where are you gonna wear
a sombrero, Bob?

82
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,780
Where <i>won't</i> I wear it?

83
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,340
Okay, you guys, which one
of these lucky ladies...

84
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,740
gets to go out with
Point Place High's Most Eligible Viking?

85
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,980
Start with the gymnastics team,
but go with the second string...

86
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,260
just as limber
and somethin' to prove.

87
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,380
- How about her?
- Yeah, I made out with her once.

88
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Okay, I don't want my tongue
where Kelso's tongue has been.

89
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,380
Oh, you better stay away
from your mom then.

90
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,380
I was kidding!

91
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,220
- What about her?
- Hey, I know her, man.

92
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,540
She's not all there,
if you know what I mean.

93
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,580
- She's a space case, huh?
- No, she's missing a toe.

94
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,620
Oh, you guys. There's that girl Emily.
Problem solved.

95
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,580
Excuse me, fellas.

96
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,820
- Hey, Emily.
- Oh, hi, Eric.

97
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,980
- I saw your name in the paper.
- God, that totally slipped my mind...

98
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,980
although I think I have a copy right here.

99
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,380
Look at him.

100
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,580
Donna, you have to start dating,
or you're gonna look pathetic.

101
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,460
And <i>I'm</i> gonna look pathetic
for being seen with you.

102
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,540
I know.
I'll set you up.

103
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,460
Uh-uh. Mm-mmm.

104
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,460
- Okay, if you don't wanna do this, just say so.
- I don't wanna do it.

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,180
Oh, you don't know
what you want.

106
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,500
Oh, my God.

107
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,740
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,620
Rhonda just said she has something special
to share with me tomorrow night.

109
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,340
It can only mean that
we're going to do it!

110
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,860
No, no, no. Listen to me.
I need a place to do it...

111
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,180
roomy and cheap.

112
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,220
Just like my Rhonda.

113
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,660
You can use the Fotohut, man.

114
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,220
I'm always happy to lend it out
for deflowering and bar mitzvahs.

115
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,580
Thank you, Leo.

116
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,140
Tomorrow night,
Fez becomes a man.

117
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,140
Oh, so it is a bar mitzvah.

118
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,980
Well, Bob, thanks for insisting
on coming along.

119
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,340
So, Red, what's so special
about this thing?

120
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,100
It's barely got a trunk.
Where do you put the groceries?

121
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,700
This car isn't
about groceries.

122
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,260
It's about freedom.

123
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,700
Speaking of freedom,
they got free doughnuts.

124
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,220
So long, dumb-ass!

125
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,860
- Hey, Red.
- Hey. Oh, yeah.

126
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,780
Yeah, there's plenty
of leg room in here. Oh.

127
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,380
Glad you like it.
I just bought it.

128
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,780
You what?

129
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,420
Yeah, I'm pickin' it up
tomorrow.

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,620
Sure hope that trunk
will hold my sombreros.

131
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,860
Oh, is it my turn?

132
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,500
Oh, funny, 'cause tonight
is also my turn... Ah! To do it.

133
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,740
Guess what, Eric?
Donna has a date tonight too.

134
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,380
Yep, yep, yep. Mm-hmm.

135
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,580
I set her up with
Michael's older brother, Casey.

136
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,860
<i>Oh, man, Donna's going out</i>
<i>with Casey Kelso?</i>

137
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,620
Casey "What's the big deal?
It's just a misdemeanor" Kelso?

138
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,900
Man, that's gonna be
the best bad date ever.

139
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,020
Hey, we should hide
in the trunk.

140
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,980
Oh, like Sprytle
and Chimchim!

141
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,780
Oh, my God. I would pay
to see that date.

142
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,260
Oh, uh...
"So, Casey...

143
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,700
what are your thoughts
on feminism?"

144
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,140
"Well, Donna, I think
it can munch my butt."

145
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,100
Oh.

146
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,100
All right. Hey.
My brother's not that bad, okay?

147
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,780
He taught us lot of good,
useful stuff about chicks...

148
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,900
like, the bigger the boobs,
the smaller the brain.

149
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,540
That's a timeless truth.

150
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,500
I'll tell you another
timeless truth.

151
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,460
I'm going to do it!

152
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,540
I don't know why I let you
set me up with Casey Kelso.

153
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,220
From what I remember,
he's, like, a Kelso.

154
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Ooh, he's here.

155
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,900
Okay, come on.
Try to look pretty.

156
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,900
That's it? That's all
I get is a honk?

157
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,820
What kind of a jerk
won't even come to the door?

158
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,100
Oh, my God. Casey?

159
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,100
Hey, Pinciotti.

160
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,780
Man, you really
grew into those legs.

161
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,940
Yeah. And you...
Your arms seem bigger.

162
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,940
You...

163
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,700
- So you ready to roll?
- Roll? I'm ready.

164
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,500
We're gonna roll.

165
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,420
Fez, honey,
what are you...

166
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,580
Did you come for cake?

167
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,460
No, I... Do you have cake?

168
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,140
No, no, no. I came... I came here
because I have this... friend.

169
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,580
Oh, really?

170
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,540
What's his name?

171
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,660
Name? Uh...

172
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,900
Johnny...

173
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,580
Table.

174
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,620
And what's
Johnny Table's problem?

175
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,220
Well, he and his girlfriend are about to
do something very special for the first time.

176
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,700
You mean, they're going
to engage in...

177
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,700
Putt-putt.

178
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,780
They are going...
They're going to putt-putt.

179
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,420
And-And-And she has
putted around quite a bit.

180
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,780
But-But he is a virgin,
uh, putter...

181
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,780
a-a virgin putter.

182
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,380
- He has never putted.
- I see.

183
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,060
And my friend, uh...
Ay.

184
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,620
- Johnny Table?
- Yes.

185
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Um, he cannot talk
to Eric or Kelso or Hyde...

186
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,580
because they make fun of me...

187
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,780
him... Johnny...

188
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,660
Table.

189
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,740
So he's coming to you.

190
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,420
Well, honey, you tell Johnny Table
to be respectful...

191
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,380
and wear a condom.

192
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,300
- Thank you, Mrs. Forman. That's good advice.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,260
- So, um, may I have my piece of cake now?
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,460
And one for Johnny Table.

195
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,380
So when my dad saw that I had broken
the TV with the bowling ball, I said...

196
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,300
"You fix it, dumb-ass."

197
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,020
Ah, it shut him up.

198
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,980
You know, Eric,
I've had a crush on you for so long.

199
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,900
Well, since the paper came out.

200
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,300
Oh, right,
the Most Eligible Viking.

201
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,620
Well, that's just
good reporting.

202
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,060
I can't believe you're Kelso's brother.

203
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,020
I mean,
you're nothing like him.

204
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,940
'Cause he's, like...

205
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,900
And you're all...

206
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,140
- Hey, you want a cold one?
- Okay.

207
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,900
Thanks.

208
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,060
This is fun.

209
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,300
I've been spending, like, way too much time
worrying about my mom and stuff.

210
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,180
Hey, I learned something
in the army.

211
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,020
When things are tough...

212
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,940
turn up the music
and crack open another beer.

213
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
Yeah, you mean, like,
things will eventually get better?

214
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,620
I don't know about that. But if they
don't, at least you'll have a beer.

215
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,860
Red, guess what?

216
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,460
I went down to pay for my Corvette, and
some jerk-wad bought it out from under me.

217
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,500
Oh. Well, that's
a tough break, Bob.

218
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,900
But you know what would
make you feel better?

219
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,620
<i>A look at my new Corvette.</i>

220
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,380
Oh, my goodness, it's beautiful.

221
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,180
You bought my car?

222
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,460
That doesn't make me
feel better, Red.

223
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,380
I'm sorry. Did I say
make <i>you</i> feel better?

224
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,620
I meant make <i>me</i>
feel better.

225
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,740
Leo, thanks for letting me
use the Fotohut...

226
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,180
for my date with Rhonda.

227
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,940
And when I say date, I mean...
Do it!

228
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,620
- Hi, Fez.
- Rhonda, you look beautiful.

229
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,180
Well, I'll leave you two with
the same advice my father gave me:

230
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,100
"Get a job, dopehead."

231
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,540
So, here we are.

232
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,700
You know, Fez, I've been
with a lot of guys.

233
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,100
You're more special
than any of them.

234
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,300
Now, I've cleared a space
right over here...

235
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,540
And-And because I care
about you and about us...

236
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,460
I wanna wait.

237
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,380
Wait?

238
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,620
Rhonda, hear me now:
Things are turning blue.

239
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,460
But... But-But, Fez,
I love ya.

240
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,820
But... But!

241
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,900
Oh, I love you too.

242
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,420
- Really?
- Yes, damn it.

243
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,100
So, if you want to wait,
we'll wait.

244
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,740
Ah, come here,
Cocoa Puff.

245
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,540
Yeah, this is nice.

246
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,580
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit in the snow.

247
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,980
So, anyway, I just turn
to my dad and I say...

248
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,260
"Yes, I am some sort of wiseass."

249
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,700
Well, shut him up.

250
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,820
Anyway, this was fun.

251
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,540
- Call me?
- Okay.

252
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,060
Hey, Emily!

253
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,300
- On the phone, silly.
- <i>All right.</i>

254
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,500
I am silly.

255
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,500
Hey, Foreplay,
is that you?

256
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,860
"Foreplay."
I forgot about that.

257
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,060
- Come here, little guy.
- Okay, all right.

258
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,980
Okay, all right.
Good to see you.

259
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,340
Okay. Okay, all right.
Okay. Okay.

260
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,180
Man, you haven't
changed a bit.

261
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,060
You still got
that haircut, huh?

262
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,140
No.

263
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,780
So, uh, they let you
out of the army, huh?

264
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,100
Yeah. It was kinda like they were
always tryin' to tell me what to do.

265
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,380
Hey, uh,
Pinciotti tells me...

266
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,460
you and her used to go out,
but you dumped her.

267
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,340
Well, yeah. But it was kind of
complicated with the ring.

268
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,820
- And we talked, but she...
- Yeah, it's a great story.

269
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,540
- Anyhow, I'll see you around, Pinciotti.
- Okay.

270
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,500
You too, Foreplay.

271
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,940
Yeah, okay.

272
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,540
Ooh, Casey Kelso, huh?

273
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,820
Better luck next time.

274
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,460
No, actually, I think I might
go out with him again.

275
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,700
Okay!

276
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,020
What...

277
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,500
Okay.

278
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,940
But, um, I have just
two words for you:

279
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,860
Donna Kelso.

280
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,860
See ya.

281
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,580
What... No! But think
of the children!

282
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,220
Little redheaded morons.

283
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,340
They'd have to go to special schools.
It'd be expensive.

284
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,780
Donna and Casey?

285
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,420
He's a Kelso!

286
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,060
Behold, my friends.

287
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,620
Your lovable foreign exchange
student Fez has done it...

288
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,620
with a woman.

289
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,100
Fine. I'm still a virgin!

290
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,980
You forced it out of me.

291
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,940
Stop looking at me!

292
00:21:02,305 --> 00:22:02,488

1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,369
Hey, guys, guess what I got.

2
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,224
V.D.?

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,034
No.

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,954
A hundred bucks.

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,816
So... money to treat your V.D.?

6
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,031
No. My grandmother
gave me this money.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,067
See, my mom told her
that she needed to bleach her whiskers...

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,435
and I was like, I go,
"What whiskers?"

9
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:29,795
Which is a total lie,
'cause she's got these honkin' whiskers.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,781
But then it made her so happy
she gave me a hundred bucks.

11
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,234
Uh, no offense, Michael, but your mom's
not one to talk. I mean... Whoo!

12
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:42,428
Hey! My mother
is a beautiful woman.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,151
- Apologize.
- Sorry.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,773
- She's nice.
- Whisker face.

15
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:49,699
All right, thank you.

16
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:52,349
Now we gotta go celebrate
this hundred bucks.

17
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,274
Let's all go out to dinner...

18
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:56,412
Someplace expensive.
Someplace nice.

19
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:58,371
Let's go to the Vineyard.

20
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:00,410
My new lady love, Caroline,
works there.

21
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:03,583
Caroline from the concert?
Have you guys gone out again?

22
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:06,554
- No.
- So, have you guys hung out at school?

23
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,442
- No.
- Talked on the phone?

24
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:11,362
No.

25
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:13,664
Have you had any contact
with her at all?

26
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:15,706
No.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,983
- So Caroline's your new lady?
- Yes.

28
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:19,513
- That's great.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:31,138
There she is. Isn't she lovely?

30
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:34,619
She reminds me of that song
"Isn't She Lovely?"

31
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:36,547
Here she comes.

32
00:01:36,612 --> 00:01:38,400
Here she comes.
Watch me impress her.

33
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:43,356
- Hi, Fez.
- Hello, Caroline.

34
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:46,876
- I just came over to say hi.
- Hi.

35
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:50,592
- Hi! Bye.
- Bye.

36
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:56,512
Did you see how I played her?

37
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:01,018
- Hey, Kelso, thanks for dinner. It was great.
- Yeah, it was delicious.

38
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:04,059
Hey, guys, no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.

39
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,323
Okay.

40
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:11,617
Everybody ready?

41
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,105
Uh, don't you have to pay first?

42
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:16,798
- I'm not paying.
- What?

43
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:19,715
What, did you think
I was paying?

44
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:23,096
- Yes. Kelso, we don't have any money.
- You don't need any.

45
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:27,612
People, we are on
a "dine and dash" here.

46
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:30,498
Oh, yeah. 'Cause the only thing
better than eating lobster...

47
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:33,466
is eating lobster
and hauling ass.

48
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,498
Let's haul ass.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

50
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:17,275
Kelso, what the hell
are you thinking?

51
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,518
You said you'd take care of it.

52
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:24,890
And I took care of it...
by planning the "dine and dash."

53
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,068
Kelso, we're not doing it.

54
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,394
Why not? Guys, we're making
memories here.

55
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,370
Kelso, it's wrong.

56
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:38,527
Wrong? Or hilarious?

57
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:41,945
Wrong, you dill-hole.

58
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,994
Or hilariously wrong.

59
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,922
I like it.

60
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:48,354
But then again,
I'm from the underbelly of society, so...

61
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,753
Uh, yes, excuse me.

62
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,169
Um, would you please send
your finest imported beer to Caroline...

63
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,578
and tell her
that when I said "Hi"...

64
00:03:56,643 --> 00:04:00,604
what I meant was,
"I'll take you like a stallion."

65
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,242
You got that? Like a stallion?

66
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,454
Fez, stop ordering stuff.

67
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:14,011
Okay, you need
to chill out, little girl.

68
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,938
Didn't you hear Kelso?

69
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:20,640
The Vineyard is having a dine-and-dash
promotion. Everything is free.

70
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,812
It's not free, Fez.

71
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:25,469
"Dine and dash" is when
you run out without paying.

72
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:32,770
So it's stealing?

73
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:37,437
This isn't going to help me
with Caroline, is it?

74
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,788
Excuse me.

75
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,034
Hey!

76
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,896
That's from me,
you son of a bitch.

77
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:15,099
Oh, good, honey, you're home.
Listen.

78
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:17,851
The Pinciottis called. They wanted
to have card night tonight, so...

79
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,445
No, Kitty, you just
call them back, 'cause...

80
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:22,522
there's no way in hell that
I'm gonna have card night...

81
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:26,272
with the Pinciottis
'cause it's just too much fun.

82
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,022
Hello, Bob and Midge.

83
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,458
- What the hell are they doing here?
- I don't know.

84
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,536
So! Who else needs
a drink real bad?

85
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,807
Tough day
at the salt mines, Red?

86
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh. When did you get a job
at the salt mines?

87
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:48,737
Here, honey. Play with these.

88
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:50,658
Yeah...

89
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,763
workin' Joe.

90
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,170
I'll tell ya.
Since my business went bankrupt...

91
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:57,569
I got a lot of free time.

92
00:05:57,635 --> 00:06:00,483
I mainly use it to nap and cry.

93
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,490
Well, uh, Bob...

94
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:05,410
don't cry on the cards.

95
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,679
It makes 'em hard to shuffle.

96
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:16,444
Michael, I have never dined and dashed,
and I'm not about to start now.

97
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,481
Uh, well...

98
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,410
Remember when we went
to nice restaurants...

99
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,810
and I told you to wait
in the car while I paid?

100
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,901
Did you ever wonder why
I was running to the car?

101
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:32,253
Oh, my God. I'm a thief.

102
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:35,225
I think technically
you're an accessory.

103
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:37,339
Which should make you happy,
because you love accessories...

104
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:41,089
- earrings, bracelets, bangles, bows...
- Shut up!

105
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:46,296
So, did you enjoy your pilsner?

106
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,338
Did you get the message
about the stallion?

107
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:55,262
Okay, look, okay? You can't send beer
to the hostess podium, okay?

108
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:00,001
I almost got fired.
So just pretend you don't know me, okay?

109
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,107
I don't think I do know you,
Caroline.

110
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,771
Caroline has upset me.

111
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:15,585
I can't wait
to dine and dash on her ass...

112
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,724
her beautiful ass.

113
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:22,936
- I'll go first.
- Hyde, we're not doing this.

114
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,150
And especially not you,
'cause you're on probation.

115
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,128
- So what?
- So what?

116
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,537
You get caught, you go to jail,
and I've heard nothing good about jail.

117
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:33,248
I haven't done one stinkin' illegal thing
since I got probation.

118
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:36,544
So, what, you're mad because you haven't
committed any crimes since your last crime?

119
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, so I'm going.

120
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:09,407
Can I help you?

121
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,627
- What happened?
- This place is like Alcatraz, man.

122
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,698
There's no way out.

123
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:47,289
So it was either a U.F.O.
Or I rubbed my eyes too hard.

124
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:54,815
Okay. Good story, Midge.

125
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,771
So, Red, how's work?

126
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,617
Well, yesterday I hired some new guy
down in sporting goods...

127
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:02,814
- but I don't know...
- Whoa. You hired a new guy?

128
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,657
Oh, that's funny.

129
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:10,497
I remember when I was doing the hiring
at my store, and you were out of work.

130
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,570
I hired you...

131
00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:14,847
neighbor.

132
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:17,817
- Listen, Bob...
- No. Midgie?

133
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,411
- We're going home.
- But I have gin.

134
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,938
We're playing bridge!

135
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,387
I can't do it.

136
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,499
I've gone soft, man.
I'm like Forman.

137
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,883
It sickens me.

138
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:36,737
Mm. So you can't do it.

139
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,658
I wonder why.

140
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:41,057
- Why, oh, why?
- Oh! I know why.

141
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,978
- Yes, Donna?
- Because it's wrong.

142
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:46,524
That's right, Miss Pinciotti.
It's wrong.

143
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:50,424
Gee, what a surprise...
Mom and Dad don't want to do it.

144
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,354
We are not Mom and Dad.

145
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,768
And we're not leaving
without paying, young man.

146
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:58,177
Fine. Fine.
I'll pay for the stupid dinner.

147
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:00,098
Now just give me
your stupid keys...

148
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:02,530
so I can get my money
out of your stupid car.

149
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:04,450
Stupid.

150
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,412
I don't care if you're
in the freakin' Olympics...

151
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,338
about to run the freakin'
hundred-yard dash...

152
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:12,258
If someone sends you a beer,
you say thank you...

153
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:15,040
and drink the freakin' beer.

154
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,817
Um, Eric?

155
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:20,737
Did Kelso leave
his money at home?

156
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,934
- 'Cause he just drove away in the Vista Cruiser.
- What?

157
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,785
No. No, he wouldn't ditch us.

158
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:30,080
Are you sure? 'Cause as he drove
past he was doing this...

159
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,790
No. Donna, he's kidding.

160
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,747
He wouldn't ditch us.

161
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:42,844
He ditched us!

162
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:45,468
I'm sure he's right outside.
I'll go get him.

163
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,743
- Fez, I don't know.
- Don't worry.

164
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,666
I'll go and get the money
and come back.

165
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,586
You can trust me.

166
00:10:55,715 --> 00:11:00,384
- He's not coming back!
- And we trusted him.

167
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,451
Foreigners lie.

168
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:07,068
You know what?

169
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,692
I'm just gonna call my dad,
and he'll come pay for our dinner.

170
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,545
Okay, but, Jackie,
if you don't come back...

171
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:16,321
Eric, please. I'm not immature
like those idiots.

172
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,106
She is immature
like those idiots!

173
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:25,691
I can't believe
I got stuck here with the squares.

174
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,651
We're not squares!

175
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,570
Donna, settle down.

176
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:33,344
You don't want
to upset your stomach.

177
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,410
This is bad, man.

178
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:41,566
If I'm not fighting against the system,
I <i>am</i> the system.

179
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,496
Screw it. I'm going.

180
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,611
Banzai!

181
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,236
Okay, I can take the check now.

182
00:11:57,307 --> 00:12:00,209
Or whenever... or now.

183
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,487
Uh...

184
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,108
Two more bananas Foster, please.

185
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,521
Eric, what are you doing?

186
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,497
I'm stalling. They'll come back.

187
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,890
Joke's over, you know?

188
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:21,046
Best thing about this joke,
it just keeps going and going.

189
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,287
And not only
did we break the law...

190
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:26,934
we screwed our friends
while breaking the law.

191
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:31,858
How dumb was he
to give me the car keys?

192
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,939
I mean, who here trusts me?

193
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,866
<i>- No way.
- Not me.</i>

194
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,786
Thank you.

195
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:41,626
You know what?
Stolen food just tastes better.

196
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,546
Dinner roll?

197
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:48,026
Guys, I feel bad
about Eric and Donna.

198
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:50,579
Maybe we should figure out
a way to help them.

199
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,985
Sure, we could do that.

200
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,386
Or...

201
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,713
we could ask ourselves,
"How can we make this worse?"

202
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,779
Happy anniversary
Happy anniversary

203
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:04,983
<i>Happy anniversary Donna and Eric</i>

204
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,367
With best wishes from Hyde,
Kelso, Fez and Jackie.

205
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:22,648
- Oh, this is just terrible.
- Oh, Kitty.

206
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:27,025
Quincy's no Columbo,
but he's still pretty good.

207
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:30,612
Red, Bob was very upset
when he left here.

208
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:32,538
Bob's always upset.

209
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,400
He's a little girl
in big boy pants.

210
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:39,955
Well, why didn't you
offer him a job?

211
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,856
I didn't want to insult him
by offering him some nothing job.

212
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,713
Oh, Red, you insult him
every day.

213
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,299
But that's different.
He thinks I'm kidding.

214
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,717
Kitty, this is about
a man's dignity.

215
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,665
Oh, sure, it was...

216
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:59,633
It was awful, what happened.

217
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,610
But let's just
put it behind us...

218
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:04,625
and watch <i>Quincy.</i>

219
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,666
Hey!

220
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:12,114
Oh, come on, Red.
How bad would it be working with Bob?

221
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,489
It's a big store.
You'd hardly ever see him.

222
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,856
Maybe you could...
You could hide from him.

223
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,451
He'd find me.

224
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:25,338
He always finds me.

225
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:28,370
Well, you better
think of something...

226
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:32,851
because they are gonna live next door
to us for a long, long time.

227
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:35,411
You don't know that.

228
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,297
He's out of work.
He'll probably lose the house.

229
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:45,170
Fine. I'll talk to Bob.

230
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:48,210
But you gotta work
on your sense of humor, lady.

231
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,853
Man, I can't believe
those guys screwed us like this.

232
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:56,218
- Well, at least we still have each other.
- You know what? You're right.

233
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:59,764
I can't count on much in this crazy world,
but I can always count on you.

234
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:02,291
That is so true.

235
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,435
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

236
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,646
Hey!

237
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:11,259
Why don't you just
sit your lyin' ass down?

238
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,468
Eric, don't you trust me?

239
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,808
Not as far as I can throw you,
and that ain't far.

240
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,591
How can you say that?

241
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,830
Okay, so I noticed the fire exit
was next to the bathroom.

242
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,299
Doesn't mean I'd use it.
I happened to notice it, that's all.

243
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,892
It's very convenient.

244
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:35,002
Donna, don't you see
what's happening?

245
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,750
They've turned us
against each other.

246
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:43,286
You're right.
I <i>was</i> gonna use the fire exit. I was!

247
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:46,224
You know why they do this?
Because they know we won't get them back.

248
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,950
We're responsible,
mature "Mom and Dad."

249
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,386
We just...
We won't stoop to their level.

250
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,168
Well, damn it, let's stoop to their level
or an even lower level.

251
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:57,082
Yeah. Oh, I'm with you,
baby, yeah.

252
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,906
There's just one problem.

253
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:05,328
We can't do it from in here.

254
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,833
If I don't make it...

255
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,320
tell Mama I'm sorry.

256
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,250
Don't talk like that.

257
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,388
You'll tell her yourself.

258
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:39,450
Hey, Bob.

259
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,588
So, taking out your trash, huh?

260
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:45,270
No, Red,
I'm bringing it back in.

261
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,490
Yeah, Bob.

262
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:53,370
That's a good one.

263
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:56,369
Listen, I want to offer you
a job at Price Mart.

264
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:59,291
- Geez, Red, Price Mart?
- What?

265
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:03,184
Yeah, that may be fine for you, but you're
talking to a guy who owned his own business.

266
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,554
And ran it into the ground.

267
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,074
Okay, I'm, uh...

268
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,285
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:13,144
Just take the job, Bob.

270
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:15,699
- No.
- Okay.

271
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:19,066
That's fine, Bob. There is no job.
Forget it.

272
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,033
Oh, so now you're <i>not</i>
offering me a job.

273
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,417
I just offered you the job,
and you said you didn't want the job.

274
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:35,066
Well, ask me again.

275
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:40,917
Oh, cripes.

276
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:44,183
You want a job
at Price Mart, Bob?

277
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,120
I'll think about it.

278
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:50,931
Go to hell, Bob!

279
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,298
Okay, you guys. Okay.
Good one last night.

280
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,542
You know, ditching us
at the restaurant and everything.

281
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,715
Yeah, we got you so bad.

282
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:05,943
You really did.
We laughed and laughed.

283
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,866
To show you guys
we're such good sports...

284
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,200
we made you guys a batch
of special brownies.

285
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:13,845
Special brownies.
Like the <i>special</i> kind of special?

286
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,249
The best kind of special.

287
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:23,607
Something's wrong.
I don't feel special.

288
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:25,944
Me neither.

289
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:28,466
Yeah, I don't think those
were special brownies, man.

290
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,994
Oh, no, no. They're special.

291
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:34,547
Say, Donna, do you have any more
of that <i>special</i> ingredient we used?

292
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,449
Well, I certainly do, Eric.

293
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:40,759
Chocolate Super-Lax.

294
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,992
- You didn't.
- We did.

295
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,125
We so did. Now maybe
you'll think twice before screwing us.

296
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,464
Well, nice try, 'cause I don't feel any...

297
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,095
Oh, no. I am last.

298
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:20,217
- Ay, no!
- I know.

299
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,901
You're surprised to see me, right?
And upset.

300
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:26,037
- Yes, many things are upset.
- Okay, listen.

301
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:28,441
Okay, listen, Fez.
About last night...

302
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:31,289
I know you were angry,
and you have every right to be.

303
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,210
But you know what this was?

304
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,130
- Our first fight.
- Oh!

305
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,562
And it made us a real couple...
if you can forgive me.

306
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:41,937
- Fine. Move away from the door.
- So we're okay?

307
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:46,234
Good. Now let's make up like a real couple.

308
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:50,834
You bastards!

309
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:52,882
Wait, Fez! Wait up!

310
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,994
Okay, you guys.

311
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:07,191
That was a wicked burn.

312
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:14,357
It had all the elements: You didn't see
it coming, parts of it really hurt...

313
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,824
Well, Kelso,
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

314
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,029
Oh, I did.

315
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:32,056
I got my eye on you two.

316
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:35,603
You're not gonna burn me
like that again.

317
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:38,708
- I love our friends.
- Me too.

318
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,722
Hey, Red.

319
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:45,642
I've been thinking
about your offer...

320
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:48,074
and I want you to know,
I made a decision.

321
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:50,953
Oh, goody.

322
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,702
But I need you to ask me again.

323
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,534
Bob, would you, uh...

324
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:01,188
like a job at Price Mart?

325
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,976
Say it like you mean it.

326
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:08,133
Go to hell, Bob!

327
00:21:09,305 --> 00:22:09,320

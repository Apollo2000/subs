1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,880
Wow, Hyde. I can't believe it.
Your own set of wheels.

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:08,018
Yep. She is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

3
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:10,957
Oh, except for that one time
Kelso swallowed that fishhook.

4
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:14,162
That was pretty cool too.

5
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,533
Yeah, that was one magic trick
I could never get right.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,593
All right, Hyde,
this car is fine...

7
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:23,381
but, I mean,
it's no Vista Cruiser.

8
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,303
How many miles
you gettin' to the gallon?

9
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:28,368
- Oh, about 11.
- Damn! Okay, fine.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,571
But, you know,
the Vista Cruiser can seat eight...

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,495
nine if someone
sits on the stain.

12
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:36,662
Yeah, okay, Forman,
but do you have any idea...

13
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,542
how many chicks
I can fit in the flatbed?

14
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:41,550
Thirty-two.
And that's with Big Rhonda.

15
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,489
Damn!

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,567
Eww!

17
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:53,911
Oh, hello.

18
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:55,830
What are you doing
back there, Fez?

19
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:57,782
I... I was...

20
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:01,044
I was just showing Caroline
the back of my new car and my tongue.

21
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,819
Fez, this isn't your car.

22
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:07,986
Yeah. Foreigners can't
drive here unless it's a cab.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
Shut up.

24
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:17,010
Isn't he cute? Fezzie, I told you. You
don't have to try and impress me anymore.

25
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,934
I'm your girlfriend now.

26
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:21,934
I'm sorry, Caroline.
From now on, I will be totally honest.

27
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,463
- Good. Now, come on, walk me home.
- Ah, yes.

28
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:27,616
And on the way, I can tell you about
the time I killed a shark with a coconut.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,888
All right, Kelso, let's go out cruising
for hot chicks with self-esteem problems.

30
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,149
Yeah. No, thanks, man.
I don't do that stuff anymore.

31
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,452
Shut up and come on.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,821
No, man, I mean it.
I've matured.

33
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:48,471
Hey, Donna,
wanna go to the mall?

34
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:51,885
Rerun from <i>What's Happening</i> is
opening up the new Dairy Queen.

35
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:56,468
Actually, Jackie,
as fun as that sounds, um, no.

36
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,840
What? "Hey, hey, hey."

37
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:04,083
- I'm in.
- Okay.

38
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,323
Well, let me get my beret
and some Certs with Retsyn.

39
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,526
Cool.

40
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:13,454
Wait a second. You're too mature to go cruising
with me, but you go to the mall with Jackie?

41
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:16,277
Yeah. It's this new thing we're
trying, man. We're friends.

42
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:20,850
See, I did some reflecting, and I realized that
Jackie is the only girl I want to be with.

43
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,758
Today?

44
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,027
No, every day.

45
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:31,219
See, we were meant to be together.
She just doesn't know it yet.

46
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:33,523
Yeah, but I have a plan.

47
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:36,853
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

48
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,669
See, she wants to be
just friends, right?

49
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:44,175
Okay, so I'll be her friend. But what she
doesn't realize is that I'm also a boy.

50
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:51,056
Yeah, and sooner or later,
friend is gonna lead down the path to boy.

51
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,494
And then I'll be her friend-boy.

52
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,662
That is a great plan.

53
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,174
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Hey. Let's go, friend.

54
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,102
Okay.

55
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,254
That is such a bad plan.

56
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,326
Yeah, but, you know,
on the bright side...

57
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:13,141
maybe we'll be there
when it all blows up in his face.

59
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,808
Hey, Mrs. Forman.
Happy birthday.

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,555
Ohh.

61
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,443
I can't believe you remembered.

62
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,639
You are the first person
to say anything all day.

63
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:11,412
And how did you know
I needed more flashbulbs?

64
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,338
Thank you.

65
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:17,302
- So, do you wanna stay for dinner?
- Oh, no, thanks.

66
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:19,673
- I'm just gonna grab a sandwich.
- A sandwich!

67
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,838
Steven, a sandwich is a sandwich,
but a Manwich is a meal.

68
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,002
- Oh, well, thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Uh-huh.

69
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,608
Hey, Mom, what's for dinner?
I'm starving.

70
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:35,188
- Manwiches.
- Again?

71
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,648
Ahh, we just had those.

72
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:40,538
Kitty, I left my shirt on the bed.
It needs to be ironed for tomorrow.

73
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:43,636
- Okay.
- Oh, and, uh...

74
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:47,319
I know you think I forgot,
but I didn't.

75
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:51,282
Oh, Red, I knew you'd remember.

76
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:54,355
Yep, the check for the plumber
is on the dresser.

77
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,042
Oh.

78
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:01,690
Good.

79
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:05,748
Um...

80
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,674
is there anything else to eat?

81
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,824
Well, you know what, honey?

82
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:18,229
I don't give a good gosh darn
what you eat!

83
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:29,080
Wow, she's really upset.

84
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:32,377
Yeah. Nice goin'.

85
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:37,592
See, the boatneck adds
dimension to your shoulders.

86
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:40,506
And the plum color...
that really accents your jewel-toned eyes.

87
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:46,803
Oh, my God. Michael, you just
described my perfect outfit.

88
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,785
You are so good at this.

89
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,958
Yeah, I have
a knack for ensembles.

90
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,874
Hey, Hyde, how goes
the cruising for chicks?

91
00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:01,744
It was going fine till I hit a patch of ice
and almost took out a few of 'em.

92
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,674
Big Rhonda cracked
my brake light.

93
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:10,392
Hi.

94
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,045
- Hey.
- Have you seen Fez?

95
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:16,497
Uh, no. He went bowling
with his host parents.

96
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,920
Damn him! I'm sorry.

97
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,678
I was just hoping he'd be here
so we could study together.

98
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,820
Now I have to
walk home alone in the dark.

99
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,346
It's scary out there.
Somebody ran over Big Rhonda.

100
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:33,146
- Um, do you want a...
- Okay!

101
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,350
Ride?

102
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,648
You know, Michael,
I'm really enjoying our time together.

103
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,625
Really? Me too.

104
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,863
Yeah, you know, the makeup, shopping,
braiding each other's hair...

105
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:47,161
- you are like the girlfriend I never had.
- Oh.

106
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:50,904
Well, thanks, Jackie. I... Wait.

107
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,826
Girlfriend?

108
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:54,746
Yeah. I mean,
Donna's nice and everything...

109
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,299
but she kinda dresses
like a trucker.

110
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,634
The Waltons.

111
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:12,024
Now, there's a grateful family.

112
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,964
Mmm.

113
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:20,342
And, boy, did they
love their mother.

114
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,817
Oh, great.

115
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:27,955
I think I've got athlete's foot.

116
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,227
I am... I... I am going to bed.

117
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,348
Where'd your mother go?

118
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,266
To bed.

119
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:48,186
Man, what's wrong
with her anyway?

120
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:51,667
Oh, who knows?
She's been moody all day.

121
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,903
Let me see the <i>TV Guide.</i>

122
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,979
Ahh. Let's see. What day is it?

123
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,207
Ah, it's the 13th.

124
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:04,177
It seems to me I was supposed
to do something on the 13th.

125
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,048
Oh, good Lord!

126
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,177
You forgot
your mother's birthday!

127
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:19,223
Oh, no. Dad, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.

128
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,225
All right.
Don't start gettin' all twitchy.

129
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,617
Now, we gotta think.

130
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:31,537
Let's watch <i>CHiPs</i> and think.

131
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:41,144
So, Fez is really nice, huh?

132
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:43,960
- Yeah, Fez is a good guy.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,609
You know, sometimes, when I'm
trying to sleep at night...

134
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:50,838
I think about how much
it would hurt if he ever left me.

135
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,761
And then I say,
"Fez would never leave me."

136
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:56,307
But then I say, "We've only been going out
for a short time. Maybe he would leave me."

137
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:02,106
So then, I hold my breath
until my lungs are about to explode...

138
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:04,986
because that's how much I think it
would hurt if he ever did leave me.

139
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:13,908
And then,
when I regain consciousness...

140
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:18,228
I start breathing again,
and everything's fine.

141
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,437
Oops. There's my house.
Thanks! Bye!

142
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:25,106
See ya.

143
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:33,591
Happy birthday!

144
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,298
Oh, you remembered?

145
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:42,160
Well, of course
we remembered, honey.

146
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:45,464
We just figured that we'd wait till there
was only 15 minutes left in the day...

147
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,385
and you were good and mad...

148
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,898
and then we'd sneak up here
and surprise the hell out of you.

149
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,306
Wow, what a good plan.

150
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,240
'Cause I was awfully mad.

151
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:59,162
<i>Yeah. We really had you going.</i>

152
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,704
Here, Mom. Open this one first.

153
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,168
- It's from me.
- Well, thank you, honey.

154
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:13,874
Oh, a map of Wisconsin.

155
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:18,136
Oh, well, thank you.

156
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:21,848
And, Mom, I got you
these balloons too.

157
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:27,889
"Knock out the knock-knocks
at Schiffy's Gas-N-Go."

158
00:10:28,955 --> 00:10:30,810
Huh.

159
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,784
Wait, Kitty, there's more!

160
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,538
A funnel.

161
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:51,767
'Cause I know how much
you like to pour things.

162
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:59,796
Well, um, either these gifts
are really thoughtful...

163
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,445
or you bought a bunch of crap
at the gas station!

164
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:07,541
- What?
- Oh, admit it, Red Forman. You forgot my birthday.

165
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,782
Quick, Dad, give her the lighter.

166
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,281
Look, Kitty, I'm sorry.

167
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,210
But it's just...

168
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,109
Well, marking the calendar
is your responsibility.

169
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,480
<i>Oh.</i>

170
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:26,329
Dad, no.

171
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,785
Ah, good morning, sunshine.

172
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,964
So, what's for breakfast?

173
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,890
A funnel.

174
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,601
Ow.

175
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,209
What the heck makes Jackie think
I'm her girlfriend?

176
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,948
All I did was pick out
a few of her outfits...

177
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,539
paint her nails
and give her a facial.

178
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,426
Gee, I don't know, Denise.

179
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,498
Um, guys, can we go inside?

180
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:06,897
I'm freezing my choo-choos off.

181
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:10,311
No way. I'm not going in there.

182
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,242
I forgot my mom's birthday.

183
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:16,017
Really? 'Cause I remembered
your mom's birthday.

184
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,628
- If you remembered, why didn't you tell me?
- How would that be funny?

185
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,707
I don't ever have to worry
about forgetting Caroline's birthday.

186
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,626
She wrote it on my arm
with permanent marker.

187
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:33,232
- Isn't she sweet?
- More like psycho.

188
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,688
What are you doing
calling my girlfriend psycho?

189
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:38,097
I'm sorry, Fez,
did I say psycho?

190
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:41,425
I meant nut bag,
head case, wackadoo.

191
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:44,044
She chokes herself, man.

192
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,947
Well, Hyde, maybe...
maybe you should...

193
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,507
maybe you should choke yourself!

194
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,745
Good day.

195
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,785
- Fez...
- I said good day!

196
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,648
Man, what fun is it
being a girlfriend...

197
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,049
if you don't even have
your own boobs to play with?

198
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,642
So what, Kelso?
So you're her girlfriend.

199
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:17,642
What could possibly be
so bad about that?

200
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,584
I-I'll tell you
what could be so bad.

201
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:24,204
Oh, Michael, this is
the happiest day of my life.

202
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,873
Thank you so much
for being my maid of honor.

203
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:40,394
That's what girlfriends do.

204
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,322
I'm just honored you asked me.

205
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,561
Yeah, but...

206
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:51,855
you know, on the flip side, try to think
about your life without Jackie at all.

207
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:20,721
Wow. That's even worse.

208
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:25,582
Hey, girlfriends sometimes
make out together, right?

209
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:32,461
Yeah, usually right after
long, sweaty pillow fights.

210
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,148
Yeah, man, it happens
all the time.

211
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,875
All right!

212
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,816
Hey, Mrs. Forman.

213
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:48,754
- Is Eric home?
- Eric?

214
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:52,561
Oh, you mean my son,
the map giver.

215
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:54,699
I don't know, and I don't care.

216
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:59,792
- Mrs. Forman, are you okay?
- Oh, I am just freakin' fine!

217
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,868
What happened?

218
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,360
Well, you know I love my family.

219
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:12,843
It's just sometimes I want to
get in the car and run 'em all over.

220
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,402
They forgot my birthday.

221
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,856
I'm gonna go kick Eric's ass right now!

222
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:21,549
No. I mean, it's one thing
when they don't notice...

223
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,172
when I get my hair done differently...
which they don't...

224
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:27,374
but this is my birthday.

225
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:29,384
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe I expect too much.

226
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,241
No, Mrs. Forman,
you have every right to be mad.

227
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,819
In fact, you should be madder.
You're, like, the best mom in the world.

228
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,127
Yeah!

229
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:40,050
Thank you, Donna.

230
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:43,017
I just wish my own family
would say that once in a while.

231
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:50,063
Oh, sweetie, that's not
your breakfast, is it?

232
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,083
- Yeah.
- Oh.

233
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,188
Why don't you just let me
make you some nice waffles instead?

234
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,201
Oh, cool. I love frozen waffles.

235
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:03,657
Oh, honey. No, no, no, no.

236
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,065
I make my waffles from scratch.

237
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:09,810
Those bastards!

238
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,929
Now, would you
look at her boobs?

239
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,849
I am.

240
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:20,714
And it's... it's disgusting.

241
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:24,464
I mean, what is she thinking,
packing in those sweet melons like that?

242
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,602
I can't even look away.

243
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,912
You know, Michael, I have to say, I'm really
enjoying our new friendship together.

244
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,312
- I love spending time with you.
- Me too.

245
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,767
Do you wanna go to your house
and have a nice, sweaty pillow fight?

246
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:39,697
Okay.

247
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:50,664
- Hello, Caroline.
- Oh, hi, Fez.

248
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:53,160
So, hey, listen,
just, uh... just curious...

249
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,090
um...

250
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,769
do you sometimes choke yourself?

251
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:03,690
Yeah. But I only do it because
I love you more than anything in the world.

252
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,177
Okay, I'm good with that.

253
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,192
I'll get you a soda, lover.

254
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,273
Don't forget to breathe
while I'm gone.

255
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,905
Hey, so how's it going
with "Mental Mary"?

256
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,241
I owe you an apology, Hyde.

257
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,543
She <i>is</i> crazy.

258
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,749
But she's crazy for me.

259
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,514
Yeah. Oh! Here she comes.

260
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,548
Oh, my God.
She didn't even look at us.

261
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,618
I don't think I've ever
seen Mom so mad. Have you?

262
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,275
- Not since she stopped drinking.
- What?

263
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:07,817
Nothing.

264
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,502
Look, obviously your mother's
very upset about something.

265
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,472
And desperate times
call for desperate measures.

266
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:16,401
For the last 10 years...

267
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:19,019
she's been asking us
to do something...

268
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,610
and every time we say no.

269
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:25,577
Because what she wants
is the most horrible thing in the world.

270
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:30,187
I won't do it.

271
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,738
Oh, you will do it.

272
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,356
And you will like it!

273
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:40,426
Need a partner
Turn the partner by the right hand round

274
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,312
I can't believe
we're finally square dancing.

275
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:50,029
Oh, this is so much fun.

276
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:01,070
It looks like
"Hee-Haw" puked in here.

277
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,205
Come on, honey, let's dance.

278
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,418
Oh, my God. This is awful.

279
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,978
She made me waffles.
Now promenade, you son of a bitch!

280
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,483
Bow to your partner corners, all

281
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:19,245
Circle to the left
go around that hall

282
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:21,070
Circle to the left
all around you go

283
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:22,698
When you're there and then

284
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,429
<i>Do an allemande left
with the corner maid</i>

285
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,353
Do-si-do with a partner there

286
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,109
Then start by the left
in the middle

287
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:31,113
Go all the way around and then pick
up your partner with an arm around

288
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,390
<i>Start a promenade
and go around that town</i>

289
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,792
<i>Then when you're there, ladies
you backtrack</i>

290
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,353
<i>Go the other way around</i>

291
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,630
<i>Meet a partner
Turn the partner by the right hand round</i>

292
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:41,586
And back to the corner
for an allemande left

293
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,592
Buck right in
for right and left grand

294
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,033
Whoo-hee

295
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:51,719
So, Mom, we found this present
we just had to get you.

296
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:53,769
So, happy birthday.

297
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:57,868
Ohh. I thought square dance night
was my present.

298
00:19:57,938 --> 00:20:02,030
It is. But we really
messed up this year.

299
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,782
- Well, we're sorry.
- Ohh.

300
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,937
"World's Darn Tootin'est Mom."

301
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:17,329
Do you really think so?

302
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:19,217
You're darn tootin'.

303
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,826
Okay. Well...

304
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:28,971
I think I've had
enough do-si-dos for one night.

305
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:32,784
So, what do you say
we all go home and have hot fudge sundaes?

306
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,574
- Oh, yes.
- Thank God.

307
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,911
Bastards.

308
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,617
- Valentine's Day.
- Check.

309
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:46,585
- Anniversary.
- Check.

310
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:49,043
- Mother's Day.
- Check.

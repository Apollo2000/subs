1
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,351
Man, who'd have thought?
Hyde getting busted for possession.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:12,442
I mean, I always thought it'd be, like,
armed robbery or... pimping.

3
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,295
You know, something cool.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,458
Yeah, Hyde in jail.

5
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:21,527
Hey, guys, do you think
he's anyone's girlfriend yet?

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,589
Kelso, he's been in jail
for three hours.

7
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:29,525
Of course he's someone's girlfriend.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,640
He has very pretty eyes.

9
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:38,046
Well, if he was someone's girlfriend,
I think it might look something like this.

10
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,079
<i>Yeah.</i>

11
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:45,722
Hey there, curlicue, would you like to
perform an unspeakable act on me...

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,125
or would you prefer
that I perform one on you?

13
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:51,388
Well, they both sound good.
Dealer's choice.

14
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,754
You have done a horrible thing
with a children's toy.

15
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:06,998
Huh. Bet you didn't want me
to see this, did ya?

16
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:10,268
Hey! Welcome back, man!

17
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:14,427
We were worried about...
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,247
Yeah, uh...

19
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,265
You know, curlicue... is...
can be... is a term of endearment.

20
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:28,633
So, when do we meet
your new fella?

22
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,981
- Red, we really need to talk about...
- No. No. No!

23
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:11,982
- <i>Steven!</i>
- No! I don't want to talk about Steven!

24
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,910
Subject closed.

25
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,830
Red...

26
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:20,085
For God's sakes, Kitty.

27
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:23,447
We took him into our home.
We treated him like our own son.

28
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:26,512
Treat him better than
your own son.

29
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,378
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not bailing him out.

30
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:33,334
He can rot in that jail, for all I care.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,538
Actually, uh, they already
let him out. Gave him probation.

32
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:41,237
Probation? Well, isn't that just ducky?

33
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:44,565
You know how they treat
their criminals in Russia?

34
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:48,177
First offense, five years in Siberia.

35
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:50,614
Second offense, 10 years.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,127
Believe you me,
there is no third offense.

37
00:02:55,511 --> 00:03:00,781
Unless the criminal
likes to make snow angels.

38
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:09,009
Hey. Steven brought that stuff
into my house.

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,593
<i>And I'm puttin'a stop to it
before things get out of control.</i>

40
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:14,573
Oh, out of control how?

41
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:17,429
Well, I'll tell you how.

42
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:24,014
Say, chum, where ya headed?

43
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:26,673
Just to see my best girl
Donna, that's where.

44
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:30,005
We're gonna split a soda pop.
It'll be keen.

45
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:33,901
Soda pop, eh? I have something
that's even keener than soda pop.

46
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:35,830
It's called marijuana.

47
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:38,000
"Mari-what-a"?

48
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:40,821
Come. I'll show you.

49
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,422
Hyde, you were right.
Marijuana's the bee's knees.

50
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:02,678
Yep. All it takes is one puff
to make you hopelessly addicted.

51
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,810
I am... hopelessly addicted.

52
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,262
Here's a new shipment, fresh from
whatever-the-hell country I am from.

53
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:24,565
Gee whillikers, Eric. Where have you been?
You missed choir practice.

54
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:29,366
Sorry, dollface. But now,
thanks to marijuana, I'm incurably insane.

55
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:36,660
Well, I'm not gonna let
a swell kid like you ruin your life.

56
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,958
Not so fast, sister.

57
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:43,340
I need that for the schoolchildren.

58
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,936
No!

59
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:54,478
Alas, marijuana has ended
my young, promising life.

60
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:59,660
This is what's happening
all over America.

61
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:05,452
And it could happen in your home,
or yours, or yours!

62
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,876
I just don't think
that's gonna happen, Red.

63
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,079
Has Hyde ever pressured you
to use this stuff?

64
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:23,893
No. Absolutely not.

65
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,188
In fact... Yeah, I can honestly say
I have never felt any pressure.

66
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,430
Guess who?

67
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:40,811
It's either Jackie or
the cold, clammy hands of death.

68
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,604
It's Jackie!

69
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:47,086
Damn it.

70
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,388
Oh, Steven, my hero.

71
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:54,678
When that cop found my bag, and you said it was
yours, and they sent you to the big house...

72
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:57,460
it was, like,
the most romantic thing ever.

73
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,691
Yeah, maybe for you.
I was deloused.

74
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,952
Hey, man, you missed
your shift at the Fotohut.

75
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,958
You better have
a damn good excuse.

76
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:18,544
- I got busted.
- Damn. That's a good excuse.

77
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:22,771
- So what'd they get you for?
- For loving me.

78
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,214
'Cause she's, like, 14?

79
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:31,281
I got busted for possession.

80
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:33,620
Oh, man. Join the club.

81
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,574
Yeah, thanks.

82
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,357
No. I mean, join the club, man.

83
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:41,238
We meet every Thursday.

84
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:44,085
We're tryin' to raise money
for a field trip to Amsterdam.

85
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:52,307
Hey there, Red. Takin'
out the trash, I see.

86
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:56,565
Yeah, well,
better late than never.

87
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,622
Is that supposed to
mean something, Bob?

88
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:05,103
No. Just happened to notice that
that low-life Hyde you've been harboring...

89
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,063
has been busted for possession.

90
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:11,567
My gosh! That stuff was right
here in our own neighborhood?

91
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:15,508
To think of all the times
we had to drive across town...

92
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,844
- to get it!
- Ix-nay, Midge!

93
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,934
Well...

94
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,750
as you all know, we had
a little incident yesterday.

95
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:35,532
<i>And I think that as a family,</i>
<i>we should discuss</i> rational <i>solutions...</i>

96
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:38,509
to make sure that
this never happens again.

97
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,656
Can I start?

98
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:46,326
Um, I'm not comfortable
living with a criminal.

99
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,302
I think we should kick Hyde out.

100
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,636
All in favor?

101
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:54,223
Laurie, stop it.
Red, what do you think?

102
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,467
Kick him out! Kick him out!
Kick him out! Kick him out!

103
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:59,404
Laurie, there is no way
we're kicking Steven out.

104
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,196
Steven, we're kicking you out.

105
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:06,646
- Yea, Daddy!
- Red!

106
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,711
- What? Dad, that's not fair.
- Not fair?

107
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,921
I took him in.
I gave him a shot.

108
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,097
<i>He blew it. It's his fault.</i>

109
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,622
Look, I don't want it
in my house.

110
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:20,655
I don't want it around you two.
I just don't want it!

111
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:25,103
Red, putting him out on the street
is not the solution.

112
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,510
This young man needs our guidance
now more than ever.

113
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,746
No, Mrs. Forman. It's cool.

114
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,630
If, uh, Red thinks that I'm not
good enough to live in this house...

115
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,550
then I guess I'm not.

116
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:43,756
You know what?
You're... You're bull...

117
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:47,955
I... I'm... You're very... I'm...
I'm very mad at you!

118
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:03,376
God, this sucks!
I can't believe Red's kicking you out.

119
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,871
I mean, I'm sorry,
where are you supposed to go?

120
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:10,037
I'm gonna go to the Fotohut. I'll sleep
on the floor. They got a hose out back.

121
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,562
Mrs. Forman made me a sandwich.

122
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,956
Man, this is so wrong!

123
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,611
I'm not gonna let you get kicked out
for something we all do.

124
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:25,748
Hey, hey, don't go
draggin' me into this.

125
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:29,047
You know what?
I'm gonna tell Red that I do it too.

126
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:30,543
No!

127
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:33,684
Have you suddenly become
the stupidest man ever?

128
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,487
I mean, is Kelso
no longer the reigning king?

129
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,599
Oh, I'm the king.

130
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:46,641
This can work. If I tell Red, then he's
gonna be a hypocrite for kicking you out...

131
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:48,569
and not making me go with him.

132
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:52,147
Because, I mean, he can't kick <i>me</i> out.
Because, deep down, he loves me.

133
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:02,002
Look, Forman. I appreciate
what you're trying to do, you know?

134
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:06,100
But you getting into trouble is not going
to help me get out of trouble, okay?

135
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,920
- Okay?
- Okay.

136
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:13,012
Okay. Everybody just stop worrying,
all right? I'll be fine.

137
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,700
Yes. It will be good for you
in the Fotohut.

138
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:19,829
Maybe you will develop some character.

139
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,047
Get it? Develop?

140
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:29,075
Oh, fine. I guess I'm not funny.

141
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:32,917
Kiss my brown ass.

142
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,104
Here's your tea, Leo.

143
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:43,861
Oh, wow. Tea, man.

144
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,832
That's, like, exotic.

145
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:49,873
Hey, look at me. I'm the king of England!

146
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:53,272
Off with her head.

147
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:56,185
- Tea.
- Well, um...

148
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,665
I... I think it's great that Steven
has a boss who cares enough to...

149
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:03,448
to come over
and talk to us on his behalf.

150
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:08,402
So, um, I'm just gonna let you fellas
get to know each other.

151
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:10,678
Sit up straight, Leo.

152
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:15,792
Hey, man, I don't think you should
kick Hyde out, because he's a good kid.

153
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:19,860
- He's a doper.
- Well, you say that like it's a bad thing, man.

154
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:24,309
Hey, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

155
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:28,183
I've indulged once or twice myself.

156
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,886
Really? I'm shocked.

157
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:37,460
Yeah, I know. Upstanding businessman.
Last guy you'd expect.

158
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,385
But it's true, man.

159
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,982
Well, Mr... Hippie.

160
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,879
If you say so,
that's good enough for me.

161
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:51,801
Oh, that's great, man.

162
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:58,129
Now, please,
get out of my house.

163
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,457
Okay, what are you writing?

164
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,385
Jackie and Steven Hyde.

165
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,679
Mrs. Jackie Hyde.

166
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:15,502
Dr. And Mrs. Steven Hyde?
All right, what's going on?

167
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:20,313
Okay. Donna,
Steven and I are in love!

168
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:24,502
Um, you do know that he once
compared you to a tick, right?

169
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,465
Oh, really?
Well, if he thinks I'm such a tick...

170
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:31,953
why'd he tell the cops the bag was his
when it was actually mine?

171
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you telling me
that bag was yours?

172
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:37,686
Yeah! And he went to jail for it!
Isn't that fabulous?

173
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:41,431
Oh, my God. You... tick.

174
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:43,669
You're the reason
this whole mess happened.

175
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:47,033
Oh, Donna, stop.
My head is... Whoo!

176
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:51,183
Jackie, you have to tell
the Formans what happened.

177
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:53,113
Do you know that Red
is kicking Hyde out?

178
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:55,512
Oh, God. No, no, Donna.
That's perfect!

179
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,960
When Hyde is on the streets,
he'll have to turn to me.

180
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:03,955
And as I care for him and buy him stuff,
his love for me will grow.

181
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,447
Oh, my God.
Fine. I'm telling them.

182
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:11,825
No! No, no, no.
You cannot ruin this for me, moose!

183
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:14,265
Don't tell me
what to do, midget.

184
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,494
No!

185
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:23,857
Well, well. Turns out you were
all wrong about Steven.

186
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,785
And you wanted to kick him out.

187
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,323
Yes, well... Thanks for telling us
the truth, Donna.

188
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,248
And we know it wasn't
easy for you...

189
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:35,925
especially with Jackie
choking you the whole time.

190
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,969
Um, Steven, wait.

191
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:44,889
You can stay.

192
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,979
Cool.

193
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,905
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

194
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,720
That's it?

195
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:57,168
Isn't there anything else you would like
to say to this brave and noble young man?

196
00:13:57,242 --> 00:14:00,242
You're right, Kitty.

197
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:04,376
Dumb-ass!

198
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:07,737
Do you realize that you put
your entire future at risk?

199
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:11,577
<i>What kind of a moron would go
and take the fall for some little...</i>

200
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,130
Crying and crying and crying.

201
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:17,049
- When she's upset, I'm upset.
- <i>And the next thing you know...</i>

202
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:21,336
I had to have tea
with that greasy old hippie.

203
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:25,940
And now I have hippie stink
on my couch.

204
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,712
<i>Let me tell you something else.
If you ever do anything like that again...</i>

205
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:34,520
I will kick your ass so hard
your nose will bleed!

206
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:40,920
And we love you.

207
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:46,616
So, uh, just so I'm clear...

208
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,983
everything's back to normal, right?

209
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:50,773
Yeah, yeah, everything's back...

210
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,263
All right, Dad!
I've got something to say!

211
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:55,671
Eric, for the love of God, don't.

212
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:58,869
Dad, I do it too.

213
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:05,046
That's right.
So you can't kick Hyde out.

214
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,996
Honey, we already decided
not to kick Hyde out.

215
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,233
Oh.

216
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,797
Then...

217
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:21,905
yea.

218
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:31,191
So, you do it too, huh?

219
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,265
Since when?

220
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,461
Since when?

221
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,385
Uh.

222
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:54,742
I am so baked.

223
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,072
I think. No, yeah, I am.

224
00:15:58,138 --> 00:15:59,992
I think.

225
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:04,116
You know, guys,
I've been living my life all wrong.

226
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:07,982
All I ever thought about was school...
studying, reading, homework.

227
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:10,873
Well, that's over. Thanks, Hyde.

228
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:14,361
Hey, man, don't thank me.
Thank my mom.

229
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:17,361
If she hadn't have passed out,
I couldn't have raided her stash.

230
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:21,302
You have the best mom ever.

231
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:25,231
Hey, guys, you know what?
Yesterday, I was wrestling with Donna.

232
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:28,153
And I felt her boob.

233
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:31,185
It was beautiful... and squishy.

234
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,902
Squishy.

235
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,930
Hey, guys, I had this dream
that I was kissing my English teacher.

236
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:42,449
And when I woke up, I was stuck to my bed.

237
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:48,143
Kelso, man, that's not normal.
You could die.

238
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:50,225
Hey, isn't your
English teacher a guy?

239
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,273
Yeah.

240
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,509
No! I meant my Spanish teacher.
She's a girl.

241
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:58,065
Man! What's in this stuff?

242
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:02,807
Hey, guys, I'm having
the best time ever.

243
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:05,808
I think. No, yeah, I am.

244
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:08,085
<i>Eric?</i>

245
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,297
<i>Eric!</i>

246
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,890
Are you on it right now?

247
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:23,633
I asked you a question.

248
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,560
Since when have you
been using this?

249
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,968
Uh, 'bout a week ago tomorrow.

250
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,705
Um, what? Yeah! Coming, Mom!

251
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:40,119
Okay. Okay, now.

252
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:45,553
You're both smart boys.
What were you thinking?

253
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:50,612
- Well, I... I'm not...
- Oh, oh, um...

254
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:54,959
- The problem was that we weren't thinking.
- We weren't thinking.

255
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,033
<i>And, you know,
with the times... we're living in.</i>

256
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:00,527
Yeah, the times are, like...

257
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,674
- And, um...
- Peer pressure.

258
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,396
And the peer pressure.
Thank you, Mom.

259
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:09,873
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and I found that today, the need to experiment...

260
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:14,833
Oh! Don't try this
blaming society crap with me.

261
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,728
You know whose fault this is?
Do you? Do you?

262
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,801
Well, I have a pretty good idea.

263
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:25,556
It's mine.

264
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,047
- Oh. All right.
- Okay.

265
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,960
The problem is...

266
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:34,196
I've been too lenient.

267
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:39,732
So, from now on, no more easygoin',
devil-may-care, everybody's-best-friend dad.

268
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,699
I'm just... I'm so very nervous.

269
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,704
I'm cracking down.

270
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:52,752
And I'm cracking down hard.

271
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:57,332
Starting right now...
fun time is over!

272
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,440
So where was I for fun time?

273
00:19:09,594 --> 00:19:11,666
- Take it back!
- No, Kelso.

274
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:14,323
I'm sorry. Confessing to Red
makes Eric the king.

275
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,495
Hey, I shot my toe
with a B.B. Gun once.

276
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,325
You're right, Kelso.
You're the king.

277
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:24,433
Thank you!

278
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:29,143
I mean, when I say,
"For the love of God, don't."

279
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,184
Then, for the love of God, don't.

280
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,280
Donna, that could have
meant anything.

281
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:37,655
Okay. I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake.

282
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:42,260
All right, excuse me. But I think we've all
lost sight of what's really important here.

283
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,184
We're in love.

284
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,527
All right, all right. You know what?
Enough of your girly fantasy crap.

285
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:51,797
None of this would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

286
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:54,899
So get this through your
little Easy-Bake Oven head...

287
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,304
I don't love you.
I don't like you.

288
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,606
I can barely stand
to look at you. Okay?

289
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:03,601
Oh, Steven, you're such a bad liar!

290
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,554
All right. Well, don't mind me.

291
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,407
I'm just here to install this...
smoke detector.

292
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:22,224
Smoke detector?
Does that detect <i>any</i> kind of smoke?

293
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,806
Long live the king.

294
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,122
Hey, guys, look what I found
in my sister Laurie's drawer.

295
00:20:33,194 --> 00:20:35,365
Mints. A whole month's worth.

296
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:42,024
They're not minty.

297
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:47,304
They're not mints. They're birth control
pills, you headgear-wearing moron.

298
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:50,686
Hey, when I grow up,
I'm gonna be handsome.

299
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,544
Really? Did your
Mommy tell you that?

300
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,384
Yeah.

301
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:59,304
Kelso, you're the king.

302
00:21:00,305 --> 00:22:00,674

1
00:00:02,807 --> 00:00:04,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:07,702
- What you doing?
- Oh, just writing in my journal.

3
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:10,102
Like in <i>Star Trek?</i>

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,891
Captain's log, stardate 1978.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,807
God, I'm so hot.

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,905
My beautiful red hair and giant jugs...

7
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:26,547
seem to...
drive all life-forms wild.

8
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:29,812
Oh, my God, Eric.
That's exactly what I was writing.

9
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:36,364
I'm gonna go make some popcorn
and get some sodas.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,342
My beautifully sculpted hindquarters...

11
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,263
flounce downstairs to...

12
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:45,111
procure nourishment.

13
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,893
- Shut up.
- Okay.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,647
Eric.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,109
Eric.

16
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:58,769
Yes, Donna's journal?

17
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:02,253
I am the book of secrets, Eric.

18
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:05,524
Don't you wanna know what
she <i>really</i> thinks about you?

19
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:08,047
Read me. <i>Read me.</i>

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,259
You know, I really shouldn't.

21
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,215
Suit yourself.

22
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,510
But beware...

23
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:23,886
what you learn here
cannot be unlearned.

24
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,348
Okay, do you want me
to read you or not?

25
00:01:26,423 --> 00:01:28,845
Sorry.

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,637
<i>Eric and I went to second base tonight.</i>

27
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:33,711
<i>He was hilarious.</i>

28
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:41,358
<i>The prom is gonna be magical. I think
tonight I'm finally gonna sleep with Eric.</i>

29
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,221
<i>Which is like Woodstock,
but for vans.</i>

30
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,263
<i>Anyway, I think I'm finally
gonna sleep with Eric.</i>

31
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:51,725
<i>I love him so much.</i>

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,312
<i>Tonight I'm finally
gonna sleep with Eric.</i>

33
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,044
Okay, let's just skip to the last page.

34
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:03,501
<i>I had the weirdest dream
about Eric last night.</i>

35
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:06,674
<i>He was Eric, but he was also
Steven Tyler from Aerosmith...</i>

36
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,914
<i>and he looked really wicked
and dangerous.</i>

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,887
Yeah! Wicked and dangerous.

38
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,860
<i>Which is so not Eric.</i>

39
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:20,402
<i>Sometimes I wish he were like that.</i>

40
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:22,960
Quick! Put me down!
Someone's coming!

41
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:26,926
Hi! Hello.

42
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:30,577
How are you? I didn't do anything.
You look pretty.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

44
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:09,693
Hey! Glad you're back.
I missed you so.

45
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:18,398
- Did you read my journal?
- What journal?

46
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:22,329
You know, my captain's log.

47
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:25,120
No. Oh! No.

48
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:27,326
I was just, uh...

49
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:31,552
I was, uh, going through
your underwear drawer.

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,573
Yeah. I know.
That's why I look so guilty.

51
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:38,553
Because I was, like, you know...

52
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:42,883
taking out your underwear
and rubbing it against my skin.

53
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:48,735
I can't stay away from your underwear.
That's my curse.

54
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:51,521
So, anyway, see you tomorrow.

55
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:57,240
Gong him. Gong him! Gong him!

56
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,745
Yes!

57
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,878
This isn't gonna work, Jackie.

58
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,314
What, Michael?

59
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,248
This isn't gonna work, Jackie.

60
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:18,011
- What? What isn't gonna work?
- I'm sorry, but you and I...

61
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,931
- They're here! They're here!
- What? What?

62
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,678
- Oh, my God! Michael, what'd you say?
- Huh? I said, "What?"

63
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:28,130
My X-ray specs are here.

64
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:30,584
According to the ad
in the <i>Richie Rich</i> comic...

65
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:33,081
with these, you can see
through a lady's clothes.

66
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,527
Okay, Jackie, prepare to be ogled.

67
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,146
Swindled again.

68
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,743
Kitty, where's the Band-Aids?

69
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,680
I cut my thumb with a hacksaw.

70
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:02,945
Oh, Red, you know those things
are dangerous.

71
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,360
Well, I tried cutting
the metal pipe with a flower...

72
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,106
but it was real slow going.

73
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:16,637
Well, seeing as how
you're being all snarky anyway...

74
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:22,204
may as well tell you,
Pastor Dave is coming to dinner tonight.

75
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,485
Not tonight!
There's a <i>Packer Report</i> on tonight.

76
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,530
They're doing a tribute
to Vince Lombardi.

77
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:33,400
Red, you know I'm trying to get more
involved with the church, so he is coming.

78
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:36,377
Kitty, if Pastor Dave comes over,
we'll never get rid of him.

79
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:40,924
He'll just go on and on
about how great God is.

80
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,834
Well, he is.

81
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:53,148
He said,
"This isn't going to work, Jackie."

82
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,608
What if Michael secretly
wants to break up?

83
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:57,919
I need to get him to sleep again.

84
00:05:57,987 --> 00:06:01,948
What if his unconscious mind knows
something his conscious mind doesn't?

85
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:10,936
Well, let's hope so.

86
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:15,068
At least he's not as boring as Eric.

87
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,270
We're not talking about Eric.
We're talking about Kelso.

88
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:23,129
Untrustworthy, two-timing, sneaks-around-
behind-your-back-and-reads-your-journal Kelso.

89
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:30,588
Okay, Donna, I'm sensing we're not talking
about me and Michael anymore...

90
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,376
so... bye!

91
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:36,738
Ow! Don't pinch me, you lumberjack!

92
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:41,407
Jackie, I think Eric read
my private journal.

93
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:45,665
Oh. Is this about the dream where
you wished Eric was Steven Tyler?

94
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,071
Hey, do you know who I really love?

95
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,660
- Jesus.
- Well, yes.

96
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:56,187
But I was going to say Vince Lombardi.

97
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,556
- You're a Packer man?
- Are you kidding? I bleed cheese.

98
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:06,271
Well, I'm not sure, but I think there
may be a <i>Packer Report</i> on tonight.

99
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,728
Red, I think you might be right.

100
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,170
I think it could start
in eight and a half minutes.

101
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:14,334
Then what do you say we choke our dinners
down, get our asses on the couch?

102
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,508
Amen!

103
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,151
Red, can you help me
in the kitchen, please?

104
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,129
Right now, please?

105
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:31,229
Red, this night is not about football.

106
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:33,186
This night is about company.

107
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,706
And our company wants
to watch the <i>Packer Report.</i>

108
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,357
He spends his life
doing the Lord's work...

109
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:42,743
and if you would deny
this holy little man...

110
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,689
that simple pleasure...

111
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:48,578
well, God have mercy
on your soul.

112
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,285
Just can it, Red.
Bring him his food.

113
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,554
You got six minutes.

114
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:57,529
I'm eating!

115
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:07,164
- Where is your Band-Aid?
- Oh, I don't know. I had it on a second ago.

116
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:09,602
Must have come off
while I was serving the...

117
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,991
Done!

118
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:26,398
Hey, Leo, thanks
for letting us hang out here.

119
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,631
I just... I didn't want to see Donna
after what she wrote.

120
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,001
Forman, no one cares.

121
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,772
That's true, man.

122
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:39,772
Listen, you guys know
I don't allow alcohol in my house...

123
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:42,712
so you're just gonna have
to drink sake instead.

124
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:50,720
"Sake" it to me, Leo.

125
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:53,504
Don't start with the sake jokes, Fez.

126
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,808
Oh, put a "sake" in it.

127
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,984
Well, this would be fun
if I wasn't so miserable.

128
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,604
Look, Forman,
we're happy to sit here...

129
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:08,385
and drink these tiny
allegedly alcoholic drinks...

130
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:11,168
but we don't wanna hear you
bitch about Donna all night.

131
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:15,545
Oh. Don't worry, Hyde.
I don't feel like talking about Donna.

132
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:22,936
You see, the thing about Donna is...

133
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,400
Here we go.

134
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:28,671
She acts like everything's all cool, okay?

135
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:31,773
And then, all of a sudden...

136
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:34,843
I'm no Steven Tyler.

137
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:37,467
Oh, Eric, give it up, for heaven's "sake."

138
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:45,016
You're still the king, man.

139
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,746
Man, I thought we were past the phase
where we had to impress each other.

140
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:52,674
You are.

141
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:57,180
Now you're in the she-dumps-you-
for-a-biker-with-a-wicked-tattoo phase.

142
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:59,640
The most entertaining of all phases.

143
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,103
Oh, my God.

144
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:05,080
Oh, my God, Hyde! That's it!

145
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:07,675
A tattoo's dangerous!

146
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:12,155
There's a place next to the liquor store.
I could go get one right now.

147
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:15,805
No way, man.

148
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:21,752
We're not gonna let you go
to some sleazy tattoo parlor...

149
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:26,616
and spend money for something
you'll regret for the rest of your life.

150
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:29,888
I'll tattoo you for free, man.

151
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:33,304
I'm pretty sure
I used to do this for a living.

152
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,099
How cool am I?

153
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,362
A tattoo of my girlfriend's name.

154
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,147
How's that for dangerous?

155
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:54,248
Yeah, I think Debbie's
really gonna like this.

156
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,627
Wait. Debbie? No. Donna.

157
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,933
Right.

158
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,174
Okay. No problem.

159
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:10,661
- I can fix it.
- Fix what?

160
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,123
Relax. Debbie will never notice it.

161
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,324
It's Donna.

162
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:19,016
See, now you moved, man!

163
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:21,955
It's okay.
I can make that into a flower.

164
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:27,367
Oh, you know what you should get?
Boobs.

165
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,757
Big boobs on your butt.

166
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,252
That's classy.

167
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,715
Hey, I can turn the B's into boobs.

168
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,561
Wait. What B's?

169
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:44,938
Like in Debbie, your girlfriend?

170
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:46,861
It's Donna!

171
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,741
Oh, right.

172
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,736
Oh, I can fix that.

173
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:56,932
Hey. Jackie.

174
00:11:57,006 --> 00:12:00,901
Hey, Michael.
I'm really glad you're here.

175
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,592
Okay! Time to go to sleep!

176
00:12:03,662 --> 00:12:07,011
Oh, sleep? Whoa!
I thought we were gonna do it.

177
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,824
Michael, I invited you over
for a sleepover...

178
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:12,804
not a do-it over.

179
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,908
Okay? I told you.
We're gonna wait until we're ready.

180
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:18,883
So, uh, go to sleep.

181
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:22,567
No, Jackie, I'm not tired.

182
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,995
But, you know...

183
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:29,575
I always get tired right after.

184
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:32,035
Yeah, you don't have to tell me,
Michael.

185
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,379
I know! We'll read out loud. Yeah!

186
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:42,123
I'll be Nancy Drew,
and you could be her pudgy friend Bess.

187
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,004
Oh, damn it! I'm always Bess.

188
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:52,228
And then Bart Starr
fakes a handoff to Anderson...

189
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:56,295
and finds Dowler in the end zone
for the winning touchdown!

190
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,755
Wow, on TV it seemed confusing...

191
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,219
but with peanuts, it's all so clear.

192
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:07,237
- Can I see you in the kitchen for a minute, please?
- Yeah, just one second.

193
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,506
You go ahead and set 'em up again, and I'll
show you how the Packers won the Ice Bowl.

194
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,484
All right!

195
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,794
Okay, Red, don't you think it's time
your little friend went home?

196
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,663
Kitty, I'm just being sociable,
like you asked.

197
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,036
- Just being a good host.
- Oh, sure.

198
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:29,258
All good hosts feed
their guests Band-Aids.

199
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,674
Band-Aid, Kitty. Don't exaggerate.

200
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:45,283
Oh, my God!

201
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:50,307
Hospital, please.

202
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:56,549
"And Nancy Drew and Bess
left the police station..."

203
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:02,439
"and went to celebrate the solving
of the crime with hot fudge sundaes."

204
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,252
The end.

205
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:08,871
Wow.

206
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:11,211
Nancy's so smart.

207
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:15,269
Read another one.

208
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:17,197
Fine.

209
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:21,190
Okay, <i>Nancy Drew</i>
<i>and the Mysterious Charming Clock.</i>

210
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:27,241
"And they celebrated the solving
of the mystery of the clock...

211
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,092
with hot fudge sundaes."

212
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:32,013
The end.

213
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,755
Guess we solved the mystery
of why Bess was so pudgy.

214
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,011
This isn't going to work, Jackie.

215
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,887
What isn't going to work?

216
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,991
I can't sleep with you staring at me.

217
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,243
Eric, how did you get so hot?

218
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,144
I got a tattoo.

219
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,940
Eric's perfect.

220
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:51,621
Oh, yeah. Ow.

221
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:53,549
Ow.

222
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,877
Oh, yeah.

223
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,995
So, are you telling me
that you fed me a Band-Aid?

224
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,604
Well, um, to be honest...

225
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,709
Red fed you the Band-Aid.

226
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:17,507
How did this happen?

227
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:21,193
Red, why don't you diagram it
for him with peanuts?

228
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,730
Look, Dave, I'm real sorry.

229
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:30,093
I didn't realize how sick
a Band-Aid would make you.

230
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:33,988
Well, thank you
for your belated honesty...

231
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:39,048
but the doctor said I had food poisoning
from an undercooked sausage.

232
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:42,860
<i>Food poisoning?
That's Kitty's department.</i>

233
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:48,235
I have never undercooked
a sausage in my life.

234
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:50,985
I have a system. It's foolproof.

235
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:53,923
Hey, Kitty, it's okay.

236
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:56,005
We all make mistakes.

237
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,315
I...

238
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:02,604
Vince Lombardi is overrated.
That's right. He is overrated.

239
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,120
Ignore her. She's hysterical.

240
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:12,867
This isn't going to work, Jackie.

241
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:17,420
Us, Michael?
Are we not gonna work?

242
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:20,333
No. The car.

243
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:23,267
Jackie, the carburetor's busted.

244
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,547
This was all because of a stupid car?

245
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:31,436
We're gonna have to
take the bus to our wedding.

246
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:36,198
Our wedding?

247
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,303
Oh, Michael. That is so sweet.

248
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:41,578
I love you, Michael Kelso.

249
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:44,199
I love you too, Jackie Onassis.

250
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,489
Eric, what the hell?

251
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:11,587
Did you just kick my door?

252
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,331
No.

253
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:17,860
But I got a surprise.

254
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:23,628
I got a tattoo.
Guess where. On my butt.

255
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,449
Why?

256
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,446
Why?

257
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:32,747
Because I'm dangerous, lady.

258
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,423
Eric, I want you to be honest with me,
and I promise I won't get mad.

259
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:44,294
Did you read my journal?

260
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:48,195
Um, yeah.

261
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,757
You sneaky little dill-hole!

262
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,033
No! You know who's sneaky?

263
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,971
People who go around writing
their feelings in their journals...

264
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,434
and not telling their boyfriends
what they feel.

265
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:00,898
So, you know what? I'm not sorry.

266
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,396
I'm so sorry.

267
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:08,518
You want to know how I feel?
Fine. I'll tell you how I feel.

268
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,143
"Today at lunch I was looking at Eric
when he didn't know it...

269
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:15,108
and I just couldn't believe how much I love
him and how lucky I am to be with him."

270
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:19,011
- Why couldn't you read that page?
- Because you came back.

271
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,165
Look, Donna...

272
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:30,440
Look, I'm really sorry, but, you know,
it's just sometimes I get...

273
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,364
worried, you know?

274
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,877
Well, you know what? Suck it up.

275
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,743
Eric, these are my private thoughts,
and I'm allowed to have them.

276
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,683
You have to stop trying to be
what you think I want you to be...

277
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:46,692
and just, like, be yourself.

278
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,619
- Okay. I think I'm gonna go.
- Well, wait.

279
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:53,898
Take off your pants.

280
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,276
Really? All right.

281
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:00,259
No. To show me your tattoo.

282
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,723
- I knew that. Yeah. I knew that.
- Right. Yeah.

283
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,186
I think you're really gonna like it.

284
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:08,163
Just don't be mad if it says "Debbie."

285
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:21,389
Woodstock.

286
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,843
It says "Woodstock"?

287
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:30,216
No, it's a picture
of Snoopy's friend Woodstock.

288
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:38,377
You have a little yellow bird
on your ass.

289
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:43,629
If properly executed...

290
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:47,211
the power sweep is unstoppable.

291
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:52,945
Oh, Red, this is silly.
I don't wanna run this play again.

292
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,523
Well, we're gonna run it
until we get it right...

293
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:59,147
because, if properly executed...

294
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,251
the power sweep is unstoppable!

295
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,038
- Hut-one, hut-two.
- Who wants cookies?

296
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:07,440
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

297
00:21:08,305 --> 00:22:08,757

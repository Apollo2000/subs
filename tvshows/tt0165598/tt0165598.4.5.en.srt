2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Steven, it's 7-damn-30
in the morning.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,960
What the hell
are you doing here?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,880
Red, be nice.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,480
Steven, we're waiting.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,440
Oh, I've been living
in the basement.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,320
You know, I did notice a dusting
of curly hair on the floor...

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,280
but I just wrote it off to
my changing teenage body.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,520
I moved back in when
my dad got transferred.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,080
Transferred?
He's a bartender.

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,120
Where'd he get transferred to,
the jukebox?

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,640
You know, Red, if it's cool,
I'd kinda rather not talk about it.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,120
Well, Steven, it's important
to get these things out in the open.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,560
Kitty, let him
do what's natural...

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,840
and keep his feelings
bottled up.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Attaboy.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,800
Well...

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,200
Welcome back,
Steven.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,800
You know, maybe we can
spruce up your old room...

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,920
since I decided
to redo the basement.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,440
What? You're redoing
the basement?

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,880
Well, honey,
no one uses it.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,680
I use it.
Every day.

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
It's my Batcave.

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,480
I'll find you
a good, cheap contractor.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,480
Oh, no, no, no. This is something
I want to handle myself.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,440
- This is going to be expensive, isn't it?
- Maybe.

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,560
Don't you like
anything cheap?

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,480
I like you.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,160
Yeah, I'm gonna
miss it down here.

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,080
A lot of good times.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,680
I broke my foot
climbing out of this dryer.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,200
Yeah, I hit my head playing handball
with the soap in that shower.

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Me and Jackie totally did it, like,
a bajillion times on this old sofa.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,640
Michael, that's private.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,000
I got news for you.
It wasn't that private.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,160
Oh, my God! That is
the biggest spider I have ever seen.

38
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,960
I think it had a rat
in its mouth.

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,280
Okay, I think maybe the basement
isn't the place for me after all.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,880
Oh, you know what, Mom?
I think you might be right.

41
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,680
I mean, not only is it bug-infested,
but in all honesty...

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,640
I think it
might be haunted.

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Get out.

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,720
That's spooky.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,200
I don't know, Mrs. Forman.
I mean, sure, it's a pit now...

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,640
but if you paint, fumigate and get rid
of Eric, this could be a great room.

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
Hey, wh...
Hey, okay.

48
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,000
You're not
my girlfriend anymore. Okay?

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,920
So you don't get an opinion
on my stuff now.

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,920
Mom, don't listen to her.
She's crazy.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
Wait, I disagree with you,
so I'm crazy?

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,960
I think the last time I disagreed
with you was the sanest thing I ever did.

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, are you referring
to our breakup?

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,680
Because I must remind everyone that she wore
my promise ring around her neck.

55
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,800
That's crazy.

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,840
Ring, finger.
Finger, ring.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,520
- Well, you're lucky I didn't shove the ring up your ass.
- Mom!

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,280
All right. Wait.
Who said, "Get out"?

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,760
Anyway, Mrs. Forman, we have a bunch of
decorating magazines at home.

60
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,040
- I'll bring 'em over.
- Well, thank you, Donna.

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,400
And I think that ring
looked nice around your neck.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,560
Donna, what the hell?
What, we're not going out anymore...

63
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
so you don't
like my basement?

64
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,560
Well, I guess now that
I'm an ex-girlfriend...

65
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm free to tell
the truth.

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,400
Free at last!
Free at last!

67
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Whoo!

68
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,520
- Michael, get Eric some ice.
- Why?

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,960
For that wicked burn!
Burn, Eric! Burn!

70
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, happy day.

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,800
Your friend Fez has taken his love of dance
to its logical conclusion.

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,720
I have joined
a ballet class.

73
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Man, no offense, but you're,
like, one good cry away...

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,680
from being
the total woman.

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, really? Well,
would a total woman...

76
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,760
have her own
pink satin slippers?

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,320
Oh, Red, here. Um,
meet our contractors.

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,920
This is Theo and...

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,880
Hey, Mr. Eric's Dad.

80
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,840
This is who you hired
to redo our basement?

81
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,120
Well, no, no.
Actually, I hired Theo.

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,920
And, uh, I didn't
really expect Leo.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,720
That was, um...
That was a bonus.

84
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,600
Here.
Shoo, Leo.

85
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
Don't worry, ma'am.
Leo is solid.

86
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,880
And he's not allowed to
touch anything electrical.

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Kitty, I hate to
interfere...

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,440
I understand
your concern, sir.

89
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,120
But I'm not an irresponsible
screwup like my cousin Leo.

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,040
That's true, man.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,880
I used to be like Leo, sitting
around all day, wasting my life.

92
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,800
But then one day
the smoke cleared.

93
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,560
See, Red?
He had an epiphany.

94
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Actually, I ran out of weed,
and the smoke cleared.

95
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,240
But, uh...

96
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Then I saw how trashed
my apartment was, so I rebuilt it.

97
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,520
Been a contractor
ever since.

98
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,200
Well, I'm sold.

99
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,880
Okay, Donna, when did you
stop liking my basement?

100
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,720
I never liked it. There were a lot of things
I kept to myself when we were dating.

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,720
Yeah, well...

102
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
there were plenty of
things I kept to myself.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,960
Plenty.

104
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,360
Like what,
for instance?

105
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm sure Donna would
like to know.

106
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,520
Yeah, like what,
for instance?

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Well, like...

108
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,520
Why don't...
you just start first?

109
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
Okay.

110
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,560
You know how when you eat, and you
smack your lips in that really cute way?

111
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,560
Yeah.

112
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,360
It's disgusting.

113
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,720
That's all you got?

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
No. You have
tiny wrists.

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,800
What?

116
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,640
No, I don't.

117
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,160
Mom, do I have
tiny wrists?

118
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,920
No, not tiny.
Dainty.

119
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,520
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>No, no.</i>

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,960
The doctor always said
you were in the normal range.

121
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,480
See? Normal,
Big Bone Magoo.

122
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,600
Ooh. That's nice.

123
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,720
You don't have to
tell me.

124
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,640
It's really cool you're here.
Most men won't take ballet class.

125
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,760
Oh, my pet,
most men are not Fez.

126
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,220
This whole basement thing
is Donna's fault.

127
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,020
I mean, what's her problem?
She's been messing with me all day.

128
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,940
- It could be payback.
- For what?

129
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,860
Well, she had to see
you naked for two years.

130
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,540
That must've
been unpleasant.

131
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,740
You know, for a guy who's been orphaned
twice, you <i>really</i> lack compassion.

132
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,660
Speaking of
hurtful things...

133
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,420
Hey, where's
your dad, man?

134
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,460
Okay.

135
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
He, uh...

136
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,460
He went to work
for the police...

137
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,900
developing high-tech handcuffs
to restrain people with tiny wrists.

138
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,100
Hey, uh,
puffy-shirt guy called.

139
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,300
He wants his puffy shirt back.

140
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,580
Things at ballet class have
taken a turn for the worse.

141
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,900
Somehow, I've become
one of the girls...

142
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,940
a hairy, brown girl.

143
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,980
Hey, uh, Fez...

144
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,420
does that shirt come with
its own bicycle pump?

145
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,820
You should talk.
That shirt makes you look like...

146
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,740
a stick of
Fruit Stripe gum.

147
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,980
God, what did you have
for breakfast this morning...

148
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,300
Carnation Instant Bitch?

149
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,100
Okay, that one
was out of the park.

150
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,220
I am so bored with you two.

151
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,860
You know what? I actually
want to talk about Fez.

152
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,060
Fez, why don't the women
at ballet love you?

153
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,100
I don't know. They let me touch
their thighs but not their hearts.

154
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,700
You know what might help?

155
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,980
If you dressed
a little more masculine.

156
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,420
Hey, Hyde, you know what
my favorite ballet is?

157
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,420
<i>The Nutcracker?</i>

158
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,540
Hey, guys.

159
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,700
Don't you think it's time to knock off?
You know, maybe forever?

160
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,500
Yeah, well, we're not done yet.
Don't let us get in your way.

161
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,420
Do whatever
you'd normally do.

162
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,660
This is what you normally do?

163
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,780
I used to do this, too,
back when I was being an artist.

164
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,980
I love art.

165
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,180
But I hate work.
But...

166
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,500
I love art.

167
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,420
But I hate work.

168
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,420
Do you hear that, Forman?

169
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,620
Theo's an artist
who hates work...

170
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,580
and who at this moment...

171
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,860
is very open to suggestion.

172
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,980
Oh. I gotcha, Hyde.

173
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,220
Theo, cluck like a chicken.

174
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,340
Do it. Ow!

175
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,140
Oh.

176
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,140
Theo, if you're unhappy,
and I hope you are...

177
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,300
you gotta be true
to yourself.

178
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,860
Give up construction, man.
Go back to art.

179
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,460
You broke up with Art?

180
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
I don't know
what Eric's problem is.

181
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,860
I wasn't being a bitch,
was I?

182
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,660
Oh. Donna, I know from bitch,
and yes... yes, you were.

183
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,980
But I feel much
closer to you now.

184
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,460
All right. Okay.
I know what's going on here.

185
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,540
You're being mean to Eric
because you wanna do it with him.

186
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,020
When Jackie dumped me,
I had a buttload...

187
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,380
of leftover "wanting to
do it with her" feelings.

188
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,900
You morons
might be right.

190
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,260
But why do I have these
stupid feelings left over?

191
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,380
I just want to be
friends with him now.

192
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,380
What a child.

193
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,940
So innocent.

194
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,580
You're never gonna
be friends with him.

195
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,500
The only reason he was friends with you
was so he could do it with you.

196
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,380
Really? So he made friends
with me when I was five...

197
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,020
so he could do it
with me when I was 17?

198
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,900
Well, that and your
sweet Big Wheel.

199
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,940
Okay, off to
ballet class now.

200
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
More masculine, yes?

201
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,340
Okay.
We're all done.

202
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,700
But you've only
been here a day.

203
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,740
Well, you know what they say:
Rome was built in a day.

204
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,220
No. Uh, "Rome wasn't
built in a day."

205
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,620
Oh? Well, your basement
was built in a day.

206
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,580
Ta-da.

207
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
Y-You didn't
do anything.

208
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,780
It's a commentary.

209
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,700
See, you wanted to change your basement
into something that it wasn't.

210
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,940
So instead of giving you something
that you thought you wanted...

211
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,980
I gave you something
that you needed.

212
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,060
Red, I think
my contractor's on dope.

213
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,620
No need to thank me.

214
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,340
Oh, we won't.

215
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,340
Because you didn't
do anything, hophead.

216
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,020
Look! It's art!

217
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,420
I moved everything
in this basement...

218
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,860
two inches to the left.

219
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,700
Oh, yeah.

220
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,020
I call it "Basement...
Two Inches to the Left."

221
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,940
It's wild, huh?

222
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,500
I mean, it's like...
Where are you?

223
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,700
All right.

224
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,460
Mrs. Eric's Mother
would like you to leave now.

225
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Okay, you don't get it.

226
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
But when your life shifts
two inches to the left...

227
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,260
you're gonna
call me.

228
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,980
Oh, yes. You are
gonna call <i>me!</i>

229
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,500
And if you like our work,
tell your friends, okay?

230
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,580
Well, well, well.

231
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,780
- Look who finally got his basement back.
- Yep.

232
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,900
Outwitted two hippie burnouts.

233
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,060
Walk tall.

234
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,380
So, hey, Hyde.

235
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,140
Come on.
Where's your dad? Really.

236
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,460
Fine. You want to know?

237
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,940
He and my mom
got back together.

238
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,940
No way.
No way.

239
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,060
That's great.
So, where are they?

240
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,340
I can't tell you.

241
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,700
- Why not?
- 'Cause they won't tell me.

242
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,540
They split on you?

243
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,780
Oh, man.

244
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,180
Oh, man. See, this is why
I didn't wanna tell you.

245
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,660
I knew you'd get all
<i>After School Special</i> on me.

246
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,100
Me?

247
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,140
Please.

248
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,060
It's okay.

249
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,620
You're home now.

250
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,660
- Get off me, man.
- No, you let me love you, orphan boy!

251
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,860
Don't hide
from your feelings!

252
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,700
- So, hey.
- Hey.

253
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,100
Look, I'm sorry
I've been so...

254
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,900
Bitchy?

255
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.
Who said "bitchy"?

256
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,980
Yeah, well, it turns out
that there are some...

257
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,620
lingering feelings
or something.

258
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,900
Not real feelings...
just, like, lingering urges.

259
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,900
But they're just lingering feelings.
They're not actual feelings.

260
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,900
I just wanna make that
very clear.

261
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,580
You have. By using the word "lingering,"
like, six times.

262
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,460
Okay.

263
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,940
And the basement's
actually really cool.

264
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,740
And your wrists
are very wide.

265
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,860
Hmm.

266
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,540
Um, there must be some way
to break the tension here.

267
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,860
Oh, I know.
Let's just have sex.

268
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,220
- Okay.
- Really?

269
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,220
No. See ya.

270
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Like I wanted to.

271
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,380
I did want to.

272
00:20:40,305 --> 00:21:40,301

2
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:17,900
Kelso, what's with the gym shorts?

3
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:22,539
Oh, something happened.
I had to take my pants off.

4
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,778
Do you shave your legs?

5
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:31,500
No. It's...
They're just... naturally smooth.

6
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:35,180
Shut up!

7
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:38,990
Not to worry, Kelso.
The Puberty Bunny will visit you soon.

8
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,179
So, lab partner...

9
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:46,379
I guess you and I are gonna be spending
a lot of time together now, huh?

10
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,302
Yeah, Shelly.
And, uh, good thing too...

11
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,822
'cause, you know, I just shouldn't be
alone around a Bunsen burner.

12
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:54,572
That is so funny!

13
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,712
Let me go tell my friends
you're driving me home.

14
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:01,796
Looks like Shelly
has a thing for Forman.

15
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:04,871
Yes, and Forman
has a thing for Shelly.

16
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:06,853
And it's in his pants.

17
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:10,885
Oh, good one, Fez.

18
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:17,094
Watch. Shelly's gonna invite you over
to her house when her folks aren't home.

19
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,534
That's what slutty girls do.

20
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,822
So, Eric, my parents aren't home.
Let's go to my house.

21
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:26,953
Huh. Don't you have a girlfriend?

22
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,878
Yeah. That's what's great about it.

23
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:34,573
See, maybe Donna will get jealous
and her and Shelly will wrestle over you.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,211
- Kelso, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
- Oh, yeah? Think about it.

25
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:48,132
- He's mine!
- No, he's mine!

26
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:51,436
- I had him first!
- You're going down!

27
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,176
Kelso, that's the smartest thing
I've ever heard.

28
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:57,269
Are you sure you don't
want to study at my house?

29
00:02:57,339 --> 00:03:00,503
I mean,
it's just sitting there all empty.

30
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,611
No, come on,
this place was made...

31
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,163
This... this place was made for studying!

32
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,833
Well, okay.

33
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:14,358
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Shelly, look. It's my girlfriend, Donna.

34
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,532
Hi, girlfriend Donna.

35
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:20,083
Hi, Donna.

36
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:24,018
You know, Eric, we'll do this later,
when we can be alone.

37
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,120
To study. We were just studying.

38
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:31,897
- Eric, you got to hear this...
- We were just studying, Donna, that's all.

39
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,833
Eric, I'm telling a story here.

40
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:38,617
Kelso was running through the cafeteria and there
were these mashed potatoes on the floor...

41
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:42,196
She's just my lab partner!
So, mellow out! God!

42
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,744
Uh-huh. So, Kelso
slips on the potatoes...

43
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,107
slides into a pole with his legs spread,
totally wracks himself.

44
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:52,823
And everybody starts throwing
their carrots and their cheese at him...

45
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,925
chanting...
"Tater nuts! Tater nuts!"

46
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:59,159
It was awesome!

47
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:04,312
So, wait. Even though I'm spending time
with Shelly, you're not jealous?

48
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,372
I'm sorry, but you and Shelly?

49
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:14,998
- What does that mean?
- It means that she can have anyone.

50
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:18,363
And what does that mean?

51
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:21,242
- Oh, you're sweet.
- Get off of me!

52
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,586
Well, there's the little patient.

53
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:29,335
So, how'd it go at the doctor's?

54
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,672
Well, let me put it this way.

55
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:35,384
If a horse is in good shape,
they say it's healthy as me.

56
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,682
Uh-huh.

57
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:43,319
And did they say something about
your pants being on fire, liar, liar?

58
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:48,440
- No.
- I just got off the phone with Dr. Leggett.

59
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,612
He said your blood pressure
is through the roof.

60
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:53,683
Well, Kitty,
who are you gonna believe?

61
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:59,025
Some quack doctor or the man who stood by
you while you delivered our children?

62
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,946
Oh, you did not.
You went out for a sub.

63
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:08,121
Red, from now on, I am going to
make sure you eat right.

64
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,554
No meat, no cheese and no beer.

65
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,426
No beer? You... Ohh!

66
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,798
Oh, that's it, Kitty. Ohh!

67
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:23,860
You've killed me.
I see the light.

68
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:30,458
What's that, Lord? It's okay
to eat meat and beer and cheese?

69
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:33,305
Okay, I'll... I'll tell her.

70
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:39,733
What that's, Lord?
Dry toast and oatmeal. Will do.

71
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:45,812
Man, Donna saw Shelly
practically living in my lap.

72
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:47,857
How could she not be jealous?

73
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,376
I'm hot.

74
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:58,737
It's because you are decent, good-hearted
and pure. You know, a sissy.

75
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:05,368
Forman, I think what we need here
is some input from Tater Nuts.

76
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:07,639
Tater Nuts, what do you think,
Tater Nuts?

77
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:14,746
Eric, this...
Hey, stop calling me Tater Nuts!

78
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:21,111
If Donna's not jealous, I mean, it means,
basically, you're in the free and clear.

79
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:25,009
She's giving you the okay to cheat.
You gotta cheat!

80
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,169
Hmm. Tater Nuts makes sense.

81
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:32,210
<i>Quit it!</i>

82
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:37,873
I mean, I could be with Shelly right now,
if I wanted to.

83
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:41,395
So, why shouldn't I?

84
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,663
Because then you will have two women
when some people have none!

85
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,458
Forget it, Forman.
You're not a cheater.

86
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:53,143
You know, a wise man once said,
"Know thyself."

87
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:56,310
That man's name...
was Tater Nuts.

88
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:05,394
I got to be honest with you, guys.
Okay, I... I do shave my legs.

89
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,922
I just... I just like the way it feels.

90
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:14,032
No! Come on now!

91
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,742
Hey, Donna. Look, we're not gonna be able
to hang out tonight.

92
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,851
I've got to go to the library with Shelly.

93
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,897
Okay, that's cool. We can just
hang out tomorrow night.

94
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:24,913
No, yeah, no.

95
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:29,297
<i>See, yeah, I'm gonna have my hands full with
this project that's due in a few days...</i>

96
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:33,048
so I'll be off alone with Shelly.

97
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:37,494
She doesn't wear a bra, you know.

98
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,378
Yeah, whatever. Bye.

99
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:44,434
Uh-oh. Farmhand got ahold
of the rich lady.

100
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,769
Oh, hi, kids.

101
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,697
Your dad's not really a farmhand.

102
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,193
Yeah. It's just a little intimacy game
we're playing.

103
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,463
- And it's fun!
- Yeah.

104
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:03,290
I'm sorry you had to see that.

105
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:06,225
I'm sorry <i>I</i> had to see that.

106
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:11,187
- Yeah, well, you know, Shelly's waiting for me. So...
- Yeah, Eric, you said that.

107
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:14,647
Okay, bye.

108
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:20,246
- He usually gives me a kiss good-bye.
- Yeah. To be honest?

109
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:22,454
It kinda grosses me out.

110
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:26,352
Wait, Jackie, should I be worried that
he's spending so much time with Shelly?

111
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:31,184
Okay, well, normally I'd say yeah,
but Eric would never cheat on you.

112
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,514
I mean, all guys cheat. But I never
really thought of Eric as a guy.

113
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,437
Yeah, he's more like a...
like a really masculine girl.

114
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,648
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, kind of like you.

115
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:55,475
Mmm! Lookee, lookee, lookee.
Ribs, corn bread and baked beans.

116
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:58,166
Come to Papa! Ow!

117
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:00,471
Ooh, Papa been slapped.

118
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,567
No, now... now that food
is for the kids.

119
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:09,556
But, here, um, I-I boiled you
some skinless chicken.

120
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:14,777
Ew! It's gray!

121
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:19,251
- Laurie!
- I mean, it's gray, yea!

122
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,576
Look, he's already home.

123
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,913
I can't believe
I was so suspicious.

124
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:34,321
He's such a good guy. I'm gonna write
him a note. A little, "I love you."

125
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,353
You know, Michael
once wrote me a sexy note.

126
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,445
Except, he can't really spell, so I didn't
know what I was supposed to do to him.

127
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,103
Oh, my God!

128
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:53,041
Donna, you should not leave
your panties in your boyfriend's car.

129
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:56,595
- I didn't.
- Oh.

130
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,576
Oh!

131
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,561
Oh.

132
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,090
- Is this your card?
- No.

133
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,817
- Is this your card?
- No.

134
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,505
- Is this your card?
- No.

135
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,997
Ah, screw you.

136
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:22,275
Hey, Kelso, I had a dream
about you last night.

137
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:25,158
- Really?
- Yeah.

138
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:29,379
We were doing stuff,
and it was all hot and sweaty...

139
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:33,637
and I just kept calling
your name over and over.

140
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:38,013
"Tater Nuts! Tater Nuts!"

141
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,854
Then what?

142
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:51,710
Hey, Laurie, I found something in Eric's
car that I think must probably be yours.

143
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:55,329
Is that...
Oh, good heavens, it is.

144
00:10:57,287 --> 00:11:00,004
I am in the presence of panties.

145
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:07,452
Donna, please. I don't wear pink panties.

146
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:10,113
Yeah. She'd have to wear panties
to wear pink panties.

147
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,108
Hyde, did you have a girl
in Eric's car?

148
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,471
No. Oh, but I did have
some nachos in there.

149
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:22,626
And to mess with Forman, I smeared cheese
underneath the seat so it'd really stink.

150
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,997
- Did it stink in there?
- Kind of.

151
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:28,925
- All right!
- Well, then, whose are they?

152
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,421
Hello? You have not asked me.

153
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:37,030
Could they not be Fez's panties?

154
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:40,957
I mean, is that so hard to imagine,
Fez in a car with a woman?

155
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,281
Whose could they be?

156
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:48,384
All right, Donna, here.
I'll figure this out.

157
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:51,324
I like to think of myself
as the Columbo of panties.

158
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:57,953
Yeah. I'd say we're looking at a woman.

159
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,986
Ages 16 to 38...

160
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,536
with a five-figure income.

161
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:09,884
She lives within a four-mile radius of here
and is very popular with the gentlemen.

162
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,773
Sure, she is. She'll have sex in a car
that stinks like cheese.

163
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,549
So, what you're saying is,
they could be Shelly's.

164
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:18,852
Come on.
Forman wouldn't cheat on Donna.

165
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:22,268
Sure he would. Shelly's a tramp.
No man can turn down a tramp.

166
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:25,212
Well, let's find out.
Laurie, have you ever been turned down?

167
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:30,048
Nope.

168
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,028
Oh. Sorry, Donna.

169
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:37,794
Don't feel sorry for me. Feel sorry
for Eric. 'Cause I'm gonna kill him!

170
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:42,109
Will somebody please open the door
so I can kill Eric?

171
00:12:57,895 --> 00:12:59,968
Hey, there, Red.

172
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:06,533
Does Mrs. Forman know you're out here
clogging your arteries with a double cheese?

173
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,664
Yes.

174
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:15,804
So there would be...
no reason to tell her.

175
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,654
Sorry, Red. I don't think
I could lie to Mrs. Forman.

176
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,629
'Cause I really, really love her.

177
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:27,172
All right, you blackmailing S.O.B.,
what do you want?

178
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,573
Sure could use some fries.

179
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,427
Here. Now beat it.

180
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:33,764
You don't have to be rude.

181
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,492
What if this wasn't even the first time?

182
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,731
What if there have been other girls?
Other panties?

183
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:57,407
Eric, where did these panties come from?

184
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:00,348
Uh, gee, I don't know.

185
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,976
But there's nothing in the dresser.
Nothing at all.

186
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:22,275
Okay, but at least my closet is panty-free.
Donna, you have my word.

187
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,132
Okay, Donna, please, ignore the rope
in the middle of the room.

188
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,679
<i>And whatever you do,
don't pull it!</i>

189
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:52,094
<i>Eric, how do you explain all this?</i>

190
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,779
Panties! Glorious panties!

191
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,157
Bastard!

192
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:13,084
- Hey, there, Donna. Where are you going?
- To The Hub to kick Eric's ass!

193
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:17,087
Yeah, well, kick it good.

194
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:20,158
Jackie, why is Donna
gonna beat up Eric?

195
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,881
Donna found another woman's panties
in the Vista Cruiser.

196
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,464
- Oh, no!
- I know, right. Eric's cheating on her.

197
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:29,884
Jackie, those panties were mine.

198
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:34,369
You and Eric?

199
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:38,054
No! Me and...

200
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:41,248
Geez, you're dumb.

201
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,388
Now, remember, we can't have the protons
and electrons right next to each other...

202
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,830
because that would
just be madness.

203
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:52,098
Madness, I say!

204
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:57,501
Oh, Eric Forman, you are just
the funniest person I've ever met.

205
00:15:57,574 --> 00:16:01,698
No, I wouldn't go as...
Yes. Yes, I am.

206
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:05,344
Doesn't your girlfriend mind
you spending so much time with me?

207
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:08,481
Well, no.
Apparently, she's thrilled about it.

208
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,405
Well, she's crazy.

209
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:14,267
'Cause if I was your girlfriend,
I would want to kiss you all the time.

210
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:16,253
Really?

211
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:23,099
Whoa! Hey, come on, lady!
I'm spoken for!

212
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,653
Wow!

213
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,566
Hey, did we miss anything?

214
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,453
What? God, no.
You didn't miss anything.

215
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,156
All right, people! Let's back up!
Give 'em some room here!

216
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:43,590
Hey, Donna, hi, hello.

217
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:46,338
Don't "Hey, Donna, hi, hello" me.

218
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,960
I trusted you,
and you cheated on me with this slut.

219
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:51,038
- Uh, Donna, I don't...
- Excuse me?

220
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,664
Yeah, I said it.
You want some of this? Come on!

221
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:57,379
- Donna, hey, whatever you think happened...
- I know what happened.

222
00:16:57,446 --> 00:17:00,763
- I found these in your car.
- Panties?

223
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,205
Aha! So he admits they are panties.

224
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:07,159
Hey, next time you fool around
with someone else's boyfriend...

225
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,149
why don't you take your panties
when you're done?

226
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:12,997
Those aren't mine.
Mine are white. And cotton.

227
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:16,324
With a little pink rose in the front.

228
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,766
So these are some
other girl's panties?

229
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:29,126
Whoa, whoa! No offense, Donna,
but, dude, you're on fire!

230
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,821
You know what, Eric?
I don't need this.

231
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:39,394
Oh, and by the way,
your car smells like cheese.

232
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:46,277
Donna, look, you have to believe me.
I have no idea whose panties those are.

233
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:48,896
Donna, those panties are mine.

234
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:53,756
Eric! Ohh! Ohh!

235
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,383
You are a god!

236
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:04,674
A god, I say!

237
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:11,968
Um... Mom...

238
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:14,494
why were your panties
in the Vista Cruiser?

239
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,950
And please be as specific.

240
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:23,587
Donna, when you've been together
as long as your father and I have...

241
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:27,200
you need to do creative things
in creative places.

242
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:30,500
- Ew!
- Ohh! Gads!

243
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:49,505
Psst. Daddy, here.

244
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:57,152
Red, you eating again? I thought
you'd be full after that burger.

245
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:01,950
- Burger?
- Yeah. The broccoli burger.

246
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,199
Oh, you are lying!

247
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:10,277
Well, come on, Kitty.

248
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:14,652
This isn't food.
This is what food eats.

249
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:17,957
Well, but it's good for you.

250
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:21,088
Well, if it's so good, how come
I'm the only one that has to eat it?

251
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,093
Good point.

252
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,884
Hey, he's the food sneaker!

253
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:41,123
- Eat up!
- You wanna mess with me again? You just come on back.

254
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,445
- Say it again.
- I already said it.

255
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,966
- Come on, one more time.
- You're hot.

256
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,276
- Hot enough to get Shelly?
- Hot enough to get Shelly.

257
00:19:57,351 --> 00:20:00,995
- Hot enough to get any girl I want?
- Hot enough to get Shelly.

258
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:06,304
Yeah. That's just good stuff.

259
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:10,368
You know, Eric, you don't have to rub it
in. I know I made an ass out of myself.

260
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:15,076
Well, you know what? That's what
you get for taking me for granted.

261
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:18,754
'Cause, Donna, I may be skinny, but...

262
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:22,914
Yeah, I'm Mick Jagger skinny and that's
very in right now. Yeah, it's very hot.

263
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:26,976
Eric, I know you're hot,
'cause you're with me.

264
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:35,778
Okay. So, what have
we learned from all this?

265
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:38,287
- Always lock the doors to the Vista Cruiser.
- Right you are.

266
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:44,239
Man, Bob and Midge
must really hate me.

267
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:48,911
'Cause right after having sex in my car,
I think they smeared cheese under the seat.

268
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,247
That's just mean.

269
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:54,576
There. Okay, I think it's safe
for human occupancy again.

270
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:57,163
Uh-oh.

271
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,951
Looks like Bob left something
in the car too.

272
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:05,808
Eric, you must sell this car.

273
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:07,784
Or call a priest.

274
00:21:08,305 --> 00:22:08,757

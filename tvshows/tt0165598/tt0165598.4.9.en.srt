1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,500
Well, here are my boys!
How was work?

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,340
Oh, you know, just another day of restocking
upper Point Place with durable household goods.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,300
Sleep soundly,
Wisconsin.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,580
I got some big news
from the Price Mart home office.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,780
Ooh! They finally gonna let you
physically discipline the workers?

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,140
- No, but I still have a free hand at home.
- Right.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,060
Headquarters is having
every manager...

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,980
make a departmental
training film.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,140
And they picked me
for the stockroom.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,700
- Stockroom. Wow!
- Yeah!

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,820
Steve from Oshkosh
got ice and snow management.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,780
Loser.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,980
Well, Red,
that is wonderful.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,900
Yeah, I know.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,620
Every single Price Mart stock boy
will be trained in the Red Forman way.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,740
Oh, you mean, undermining
their self-esteem...

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,820
until they're too weak
to fight back?

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,140
If you would just
zip it for a second...

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,980
you might be interested in hearing
who I want to play the stock boy.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,620
Oh, look, Dad,
I appreciate the thought...

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,020
I'm gonna use this idiot!

22
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,740
All right!

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,074

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,580
Man, I guess my movie career
is getting started sooner than I thought!

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,340
Kelso's playing the stock boy?

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,180
This is my
favorite thing ever.

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,540
Well, Michael does have
marvelous bone structure.

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,500
Oh, but you will too, honey,
once you fill out.

29
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh, man! Mom burn!

30
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,820
Yep. That's twice
the normal burn.

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,220
Dad, how can you choose Kelso
to play the Price Mart stock boy?

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
You have a better suggestion?

33
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,300
Hello!

34
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,260
I <i>am</i>
a Price Mart stock boy.

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,780
I just came
from stocking.

36
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,180
At Price Mart.

37
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,660
And I am currently wearing
a Price Mart stock boy smock.

38
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,260
Good point, Eric.

39
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,460
Give your smock to Kelso.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,660
Oh, I don't think my broad, photogenic
shoulders are gonna fit in that little thing.

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,780
Now, don't take this
personal, Son.

42
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,140
You're just too...
twitchy and skinny.

43
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,100
Well, you know,
the camera adds 10 pounds.

44
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,580
Yeah, 10.
Not 40.

45
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,380
How could he pick Kelso
to play the stock boy?

46
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,780
I'm the one with the
acting experience. Remember?

47
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,540
I was Mushroom Number Two
in <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

48
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,340
But you were
Mushroom Number One in my heart.

49
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,020
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. What's up?

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,420
- We're going to lunch.
- We're going to lunch?

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,460
Well, actually, honey,
<i>we're</i> going to lunch.

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,340
You and I
are going to lunch?

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,500
Well, no.

54
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,780
You and Donna and I
are going to lunch?

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,020
Well, almost, honey.

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,820
You and Donna are going to lunch?

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,900
Nothing gets past you,
Einstein.

58
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,940
I don't think I like the idea of you two
going out to lunch together.

59
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Well, what if we bring
you back a sandwich?

60
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Well, a sandwich isn't gonna
make me feel better, Mom.

61
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,460
Okay, then.
We're leaving.

62
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Well, in that case,
I would like a sandwich.

63
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,660
Yeah,
I don't like this day.

64
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
Hey, dudes.

65
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,020
Hey, Leo, man,
Huggy Bear called.

66
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,020
He wants his suit back.

67
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,220
Huggy Bear?

68
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,380
This is <i>my</i> suit, man.

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,620
So, to what do we owe
the fancy pants?

70
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,460
Great news, man!

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,780
I inherited a million bucks
from my dead uncle!

72
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,140
- Shut up.
- No way.

73
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,020
It's true! So, come on!
Let's share the wealth!

74
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
Come on. I'll buy you
anything you want.

75
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,380
Does that include burgers
and nudie mags?

76
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,180
Include?
That's half the budget, man.

77
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,180
Eric, have you seen Donna?

78
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,420
She was supposed to help me sort out my
daytime cosmetics from my nighttime cosmetics...

79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,420
but she never showed up.

80
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,700
Oh, you haven't heard?

81
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,100
Donna's got a new friend...

82
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,020
and I, for one,
think it's time you met her.

83
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,380
Donna!
What are you doing?

84
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,460
We invented
a new cookie.

85
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,780
It's a variation
of the snickerdoodle.

86
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,140
We're calling it
the "DonnaKitty."

87
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,260
Or the "Ditty."

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,500
We haven't decided.

89
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,540
Donna, you're supposed to be sorting...
as in, <i>my</i> cosmetics.

90
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,180
Oh, yeah.
I'm real sorry I missed that.

91
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,580
It started as an annoying,
but innocent lunch.

92
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,180
And now they're
inventing cookies.

93
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,220
It's growing, man.

94
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,180
It's the freakin' Blob.

95
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,220
Donna, why do you
need a new friend?

96
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,140
Haven't I always
been there for you?

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,180
Uh, no.

98
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,420
I hope
your cookies burn!

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,300
Eric, old people
and young people...

100
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,180
are not supposed to
spend time together.

101
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,140
It's unnatural.

102
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,820
What am I
supposed to do about it?

103
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,820
Well, you better
do something.

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,740
You know what girls talk about
when they get together.

105
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,500
Um, sugar and spice
and everything nice?

106
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,260
That's what we're made of,
you dumb-ass.

107
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,500
They talk about men,
and that would be you.

108
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,180
Well, barely.

109
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,180
You know, you could really use a refill
on the "everything nice."

110
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,180
You know, I wasn't that worried
about Donna and my mom talking about me...

111
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,460
but now
that I'm all paranoid...

112
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,580
I'm all, like...

113
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,500
paranoid.

114
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,940
I mean, when did it become okay
for them to be friends?

115
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,660
Right after your father replaced you
with a semi-literate pretty boy.

116
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,780
That's me.

117
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,340
So, I've been thinking about great actors
to model myself after...

118
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,340
and I choose Travolta.

119
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,420
Kelso...

120
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,780
I can think of no better way
to impress Red...

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,740
than by acting like Travolta
in his industrial film.

122
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,460
Bravo, man.

123
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,060
That is good advice.

124
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,260
Man, I don't want Donna
and my mom talking about me.

125
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,300
Yeah,
and Donna's a big mouth.

126
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,660
Like, she told me how you wore makeup
to last year's class picture.

127
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,780
What?

128
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,020
I did not!
I did not.

129
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,380
I had a zit.
Stop looking at me.

130
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,900
Forman, you and I are both
victims of parental abandonment.

131
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,220
Luckily, I have
a rich hippie benefactor.

132
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,380
He bought me nudie mags
I'd never even heard of.

133
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,500
Yeah, I'll stock this shelf!

134
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,060
But someday I'm gonna dance
across this whole city.

135
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,740
That's dead-on.

136
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,260
Okay, we need to talk.

137
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,220
It's about, shall we say,
your new crowd.

138
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,100
And don't even pretend you and Donna
aren't talking about me.

139
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,020
I know what's going on here,
and it goes a little something like this...

140
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,420
Oh, honey, you look wonderful.

141
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,580
Say, can we look at Eric's
naked baby pictures again?

142
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,820
They're right here!

143
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,220
My, you could tell even then
he'd always be small.

144
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,700
Yeah, he really is tiny.

145
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,940
It's not satisfying.

146
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,100
Well, how could it be, dear?

147
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,020
But at least he's nice.

148
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,940
Yeah, he's nice.

149
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,620
For a nancy boy!

150
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,740
So, what do you say
to that?

151
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,300
All right, Kelso. You'll just go through
a few typical stock boy tasks...

152
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,220
while I firmly, but kindly,
oversee you.

153
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,580
- Got it.
- All right. Let's get started.

154
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,260
Kelso...

155
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,180
what the hell
are you doing?

156
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,940
Oh, see, I'm going
for a Travolta thing.

157
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,820
Okay, my character's
actually a dancer...

158
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,740
who's just stocking shelves
until he makes it big.

159
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,500
All right. Let me
paint a picture for you.

160
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,500
Just close your eyes.

161
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,980
Okay, imagine
with your eyes open.

162
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,940
Just come with me.

163
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,020
Just stack the cans,
moron.

164
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,660
But <i>why</i>
am I stacking cans?

165
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,620
See, I'm thinking that
the manager is a bad guy.

166
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,500
So, why would I
stack cans for him?

167
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,620
Because if you don't
stack the cans...

168
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,860
the manager
is going to kill you.

169
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,620
Oh! So I'm afraid
for my life!

170
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,460
That works.
All right. Let's act!

171
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,180
Oh, no.
You're all alone.

172
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,820
Where's your little buddy,
Skipper?

173
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,180
Okay, sweetie.

174
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,260
My friendship with Donna is making you
uncomfortable, so I'm gonna call it off.

175
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,260
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

176
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,980
Well, thank you.

177
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,340
Maybe some of your loyalty
will rub off on Dad.

178
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,740
Oh, don't let that
bother you.

179
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,140
Michael may have
movie-star good looks...

180
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,020
but you are much,
much smarter than he is.

181
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,900
Okay, why couldn't you have
said that in front of everyone...

182
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,940
instead of how great
Kelso's bone structure is?

183
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,140
I don't want to
make anybody feel bad.

184
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,420
Well, good job.

185
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,900
All right, guys.
Let's shop!

186
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,700
Thanks again, Leo.

187
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,180
Yes, thank you.

188
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,860
You know what would
make this outfit perfect?

189
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,860
A cockatoo.

190
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,340
Then we'll get a cockatoo.

191
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,260
Or three!

192
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,620
Hey, Red, listen, I've got this great new
idea I want to lay on you about our movie.

193
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,900
Dad, I've heard this idea...

194
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,940
and speaking as an unbiased observer
with no score to settle...

195
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,900
it is great.

196
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,820
Go!

197
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,260
Kelso, you don't
get to have ideas.

198
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,180
Dad, if I could
just interject.

199
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,300
This idea will literally change
industrial filmdom forever.

200
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,260
Go get 'em, Kelso!
Go!

201
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,820
Okay. The stock boy
has a love interest.

202
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,380
No.

203
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,660
Now, before you say no,
I've already found the perfect person.

204
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,900
Oh, stock boy,
I love you!

205
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,020
No. Get out.

206
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,700
Okay, um,
Eric's uncomfortable...

207
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,860
because he thinks we talk about him...
which we don't.

208
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,900
Although that story about him wearing
makeup to his class pictures was a hoot.

209
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,980
But I guess
what I'm saying is, um...

210
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,940
we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

211
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,260
But it's been so nice having someone
to talk to since my mom left.

212
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,180
I know.

213
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,380
Someone who understands
what I'm going through.

214
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,860
Oh, honey.

215
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,300
Someone to make
banana bread with.

216
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,260
I ate that for dinner
three nights in a row.

217
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,940
Oh, you poor, sweet girl.

218
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,340
What the hell?

219
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,940
Boy, being a millionaire
is great.

220
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,260
Well, at least you put the money
to good use.

221
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,100
Fun Tart?

222
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,020
Don't mind if I do.

223
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,980
Candy button?

224
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,940
I've got
a million of them.

225
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,020
So, Leo, man,
tell us about your Uncle Ed.

226
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,500
Why'd he leave you
all his money?

227
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,940
Check it out, man.
It's all in this letter he sent me.

228
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,100
Your Uncle Ed is Ed McMahon?

229
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,820
Yeah.

230
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,620
Who knew
I was Scottish?

231
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,620
Uh-oh.

232
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,980
Damn, Leo, you didn't
inherit a million dollars.

233
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,940
That's a sweepstakes contest.

234
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,900
Well, then
who has my money?

235
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,620
There is no money,
you son of a bitch!

236
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,780
Oh.

237
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,780
Wow. I guess all this stuff
has to go back.

238
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,260
Oh, that means you too,
Feathery Frank.

239
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
- Good day.
- But, Fez...

240
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,420
I said, good day.

241
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,620
I'm leaving Brooklyn, Mister Formanelli.

242
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,780
And when I get to Manhattan,
I'm gonna be a star.

243
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,020
So, what do you think?

244
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,340
You're fired.

245
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,140
You.

246
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,900
<i>Price Mart is only</i>
<i>as strong as its weakest stock boy.</i>

247
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,220
<i>Just look at what one</i>
<i>well-trained worker can accomplish.</i>

248
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,540
<i>Neat, efficient, organized.</i>

249
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,860
<i>The Price Mart way.</i>

250
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,260
<i>And each job completed with that</i>
<i>award-winning Price Mart attitude.</i>

251
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,220
<i>Remember, you can't spell</i>
<i>stock boy without "Oh, boy!"</i>

252
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,260
Perfect.

253
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,180
Well, who would have thought
a stock boy would do a good job...

254
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,700
playing a stock boy?

255
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,740
Yeah, I mean,
it's a topsy-turvy world.

256
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,740
Yeah.
You did a good job.

257
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,260
Wait a minute.
Are you proud of me?

258
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,220
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't say that.

259
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,420
So...

260
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,380
do we hug now?

261
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,380
Men don't hug.

262
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,380
My daddy loves me!

263
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,740
- Shut it!
- I love you too, Daddy!

264
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,180
Oh, well,
look who's here.

265
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,060
Do a little shopping, ladies?

266
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,940
Well, it's not like
I can take my dad shopping.

267
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,820
I mean, every time the sales lady
brings over some underwear...

268
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,700
he gets embarrassed
and goes, "Whoo-hoo!"

269
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,300
So, I suppose you have
something snarky to say about that.

270
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,620
You know what?

271
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,580
I don't.

272
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,940
- Really?
- No.

273
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,940
Look, your mom...

274
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,140
can't take you shopping, so...

275
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,860
it's cool with me
if you guys want to hang out.

276
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,340
Honey, I am so glad
you understand.

277
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,220
- Yeah, Eric, thanks.
- Yeah.

278
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,060
Yeah, just, look, please...

279
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,740
no talking about me, okay?

280
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,940
And no looking at
my naked baby pictures either.

281
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,860
They're... misleading.

282
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,420
Honey, I've already
seen you naked.

283
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,700
Mom.

284
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,660
Oh, and she's
already seen you naked!

285
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,300
You know what? From now on,
that's all we should talk about.

286
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,060
Okay. Leaving now.

287
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,940
Okay, here he is
on the potty.

288
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,780
Look how hard
he's concentrating.

289
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,740
Oh, I have
some earlier ones.

290
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,500
Look at that baby.

291
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,380
Didn't he have
the cutest little behind?

292
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,820
Yeah!

293
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,700
So when did he lose it?

294
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,580
Right around
when he turned 10.

295
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,500
It was the strangest thing.
Poof.

296
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,420
Like someone ironed him.

297
00:20:49,305 --> 00:21:49,253

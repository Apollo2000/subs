1
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:08,263
Donna, I'm so glad
you're my study partner.

2
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:12,713
Because you make learning fun.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,256
Okay. Well, no more study breaks.

4
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,331
We have to get this report done.

5
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:21,957
All right. Fine. Okay.

6
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:25,825
A report on the current state
of U.S.-Soviet relations.

7
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,907
Okay, we need a title.

8
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:31,941
How 'bout "Current State
of U.S.-Soviet Relations"?

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,150
Damn, you're smart.

10
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,682
U.S.-Soviet Relations.

11
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,765
You know, Donna,
I lost my underwear.

12
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,876
But...

13
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:58,565
whatever.

14
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:01,734
Okay. Seriously,
we need to get some work done.

15
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:04,619
Donna,
I couldn't agree with you more.

16
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:06,539
Okay.

17
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:08,775
Right now,
with a push of a button...

18
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:13,000
the two superpowers could
condemn us to painful, fiery deaths.

19
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:15,457
Fiery... deaths.

20
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:25,418
Okay.

21
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,137
Seriously, we gotta do this thing.

22
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:34,027
You're right.
Eric, no more study breaks.

23
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:37,321
Uh, right.
From now on, all business.

24
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:45,636
The arms race began with the massive
buildup of bombers by the Soviet Union.

25
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:48,261
Actually, the United States
started the arms buildup.

26
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:51,365
No, they didn't.
What about the bomber gap?

27
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:54,599
Bomber gap? What?

28
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:58,308
That's so cute.

29
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:02,980
<i>Bombers by the United...</i>

30
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:04,906
States.

31
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,577
What are you doing?

32
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:12,488
Study break?

33
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,792
Get bent.

34
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:18,119
<i>Ow! Oh, there's my underwear.</i>

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,074

36
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:57,788
- Hey, Donna. What's wrong?
- Eric, you can't just ignore my ideas.

37
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,063
Oh.

38
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,928
Donna.
You'll get the same "A" I get.

39
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:07,385
Relax, baby.

40
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,038
Eric, I can't relax
'cause you're wrong, and I'm right.

41
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:15,392
Okay. Okay.

42
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,715
I think we need to clear our heads
with a nice study break.

43
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:23,969
Eric, knock it off. I'm not in the mood
for a stupid study break.

44
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,680
<i>What? Why?
Because I disagree with you?</i>

45
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:30,529
- It has nothing to do with that.
- Really, Donna?

46
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:33,148
Because up until now,
we were going at it like rabbits...

47
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:36,634
who had just gotten out of prison.

48
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:39,096
Well, that's over.

49
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:42,584
Wait. So what are you saying?

50
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,042
You're gonna hold out on me until I agree with
you? Because that's not gonna work, Donna.

51
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:48,504
First of all,
I'm not holding out on you.

52
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,184
And second of all,
if I did, it would <i>so</i> work.

53
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,384
Okay, well, you know what?
I think that <i>is</i> what you're doing.

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,776
So try this dress on for size!
I'm cutting you off!

55
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:05,307
Yeah!

56
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:12,156
- Is that supposed to be a threat?
- Supposed to be.

57
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:14,529
Yeah.

58
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:17,213
Okay.
If you wanna do this, we'll do this.

59
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:20,153
But you're gonna cave,
and I'm gonna laugh. Yeah!

60
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:28,862
I just saw a U.F.O.!

61
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:33,497
Oh, my God!
What an unbelievable coincidence.

62
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:37,369
I was just telling Fez
about how dumb you are!

63
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:46,206
Okay. No. So I'm out in the field, right?
And there it was.

64
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,959
It was in the air,
and it had lights, and it was, like...

65
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:59,617
That's a U.F.O., all right.

66
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,538
Hang on, Fez. Kelso.

67
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:04,571
Remember that time you thought
you saw the Abominable Snowman?

68
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:06,170
Yeah.

69
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:10,335
- Do you remember what it turned out to be?
- Just a regular snowman.

70
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:17,976
Guys, come on. Let's go out to the field.
It could come back.

71
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:22,361
You think I got nothing better to do than
stand in a field freezing my 'nads off?

72
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:25,883
Hey, who wants to help me
connect the dots?

73
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,810
Sorry, 'nads. Let's go.

74
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:42,621
What is all that noise?

75
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:46,172
Oh, Bob's cutting down a tree
in his front yard.

76
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:48,152
By himself?

77
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:53,370
Doesn't he know
that's incredibly dangerous?

78
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:58,557
Yeah, but you know what
they say about Bob...

79
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:01,016
"He's stupid."

80
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, Red.

81
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:06,752
Is that any way to talk about a friend?

82
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:09,208
A stupid friend.

83
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:12,632
<i>Timber!</i>

84
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,838
<i>Oh, no!</i>

85
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,394
Oh, damn it!

86
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,401
Did Bob kill me?

87
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:45,468
Oh, but he just feels super bad about it.

88
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,427
Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,695
So, where is everyone?

90
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:53,112
Boy, you can hardly tell
where your head was crushed.

91
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,697
Where are all my friends?

92
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,171
You don't really have any friends, Red.

93
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,144
You know,
it's-it's an unfortunate side effect...

94
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:10,619
of telling everybody
to-to stick it up their butts.

95
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,267
Yeah.

96
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,209
Gee, I guess you're right, Kitty.

97
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,803
Maybe I should have been nicer.

98
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,111
Yeah.

99
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,962
Oh, well.
Hindsight's twenty-twenty.

100
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,896
You just lie back
and enjoy your coffin.

101
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:30,338
Ooh, satin. That's nice.

102
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:43,706
Red! Red! Oh, I'm so sorry!
It was an accident.

103
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,234
Bob...

104
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:49,177
I never thought I'd say this...

105
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:52,066
but I'm glad you're my friend.

106
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:58,624
Red, I never thought I'd say this...

107
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:01,179
but... you smell nice.

108
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:17,241
- Jackie, that's really annoying.
- Knock it off, Hyde!

109
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,704
Donna, is there something
you need to talk about?

110
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,649
Oh, crap. Do you need
to talk about something?

111
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,081
Can you keep a secret?

112
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:28,056
- Not really.
- Yeah.

113
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,520
Unless I can burn you with it later.

114
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,633
I'm holding out on Eric.

115
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,041
I'm holding out on Donna.

116
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:36,962
Donna, that's great!

117
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,067
Forman, that's hysterical.

118
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,211
So, how long has it been?

119
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:44,993
Three of the longest days of my life.

120
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,946
Maybe I should just cave.

121
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,866
No!

122
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,786
If you cave, she owns you.

123
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:54,200
When he caves, you own him.

124
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:57,756
Yeah, but there's no way
she wants it as bad as I do.

125
00:08:57,827 --> 00:09:01,601
Can you blame her?

126
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,569
I think I want it more than Eric.

127
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,553
Eww. Why?

128
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:11,904
Forman,
sex is how women control men.

129
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:16,128
Donna, sex is how we control men.

130
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:18,683
If they ever find out we want it too...

131
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,144
we'll never get jewelry again.

132
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:26,044
Secretly, I believe
they like it as much as we do.

133
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,628
Oh. You and your
crazy conspiracies.

134
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,162
Hyde, what are you doing?

135
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:42,136
This means something.

136
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:46,045
This is important.

137
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:50,556
Well, this is a close encounter
of the potato kind.

138
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,328
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:56,792
How's it going, guys?

140
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,169
Good to see you all.

141
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,352
Kitty, I've been thinking.

142
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:06,296
It might be fun to have our friends
over for a party.

143
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:09,666
Oh, whoo-hoo! Party at Red's!

144
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:12,381
Are you feeling okay, Red?

145
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:15,299
Oh, honey, honey, don't touch him.

146
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,422
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay. Well, I just...

147
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:22,720
I have never heard you use the words
"fun," "friends" and "party"...

148
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,674
all in the same sentence.

149
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:27,194
I have, Mrs. Forman.

150
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:31,904
For instance, "Eric, I had fun ruining
the party for you and your friends."

151
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,208
Yeah, that was fun.

152
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,901
Well, I think a party
is a great idea, Red.

153
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:43,320
Great. Then it's settled.

154
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,304
How you doin' there, Sabu?

155
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:52,034
He smells nice.

156
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,452
- Hello, Donna.
- Hello, Eric. I have come to work on our report.

157
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:07,418
- Excellent. May I take your coat for you?
- Of course.

158
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,641
Holy crap! She is so sexy.

159
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:20,602
Be strong. Fight back. Use the look.

160
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:27,424
Oh, no. Not the look.

161
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,167
It's so... Wait. I find this hot?

162
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:33,089
What is wrong with me?

163
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:35,872
Come on, Pinciotti. Counterattack.

164
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:40,928
Oops.

165
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,241
Look away! Oh, I can't look away.

166
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:51,169
Must touch.

167
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:53,144
No! Be strong.

168
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:00,636
Well, Donna, if you would
refer to page 83...

169
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,142
Oh, the ear!

170
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:08,764
Damn him!

171
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,966
Wait.
Must win this for womankind.

172
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,785
Must crush Eric.

173
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:21,308
Red alert.
She is touching your thigh!

174
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:26,143
Oh, no. Plan backfiring.

175
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,928
Thigh is so warm, inviting.

176
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,199
Bony, but nice.

177
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,208
<i>Donna, your mother's on the phone.</i>

178
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:39,192
Oh, thank God!

179
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,569
- Eric, everything all right?
- Fine. Shut the door, please.

180
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,857
Hey, dudes.

181
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:11,623
Leo, what are you doing here, man?

182
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:14,829
Wow.
That's a really good question, man.

183
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,377
- Leo?
- I'm working on it, man.

184
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:27,983
- Chocodile?
- What's that?

185
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,017
It's a Twinkie
wrapped in chocolate, man.

186
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,603
No, in the sky! Those lights.
I think that's a U.F.O.

187
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:39,310
It's just a plane.

188
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:41,899
They're all just planes.

189
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,970
Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.

190
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:49,546
Now I've got photographic evidence.

191
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:53,164
Of what? That planes can fly?

192
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,601
I saw a U.F.O. Once, man.

193
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,659
It was awesome.
It just hung in the air.

194
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,218
Then it sent me a message...

195
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,679
in big, bright yellow letters.

196
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:07,568
It told me I was gonna
have a good year.

197
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:13,167
Did this, by any chance,
happen at a football game?

198
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,145
Yeah, man.

199
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:22,223
And the weird thing was,
I was the only one freaking out about it.

200
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:28,587
Wait a second. Good year?

201
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:31,527
Ah, it was a terrible year, man.

202
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:34,057
Stupid aliens.

203
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,235
Hey, Red!

204
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,728
I was just telling Tony here
how I almost killed you with a tree.

205
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:40,712
- Ooh.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo.

206
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:44,583
- Close call like that can really make you think, huh?
- You bet.

207
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:49,448
You know, it's like I was upset that you
hadn't returned my hedge clippers.

208
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,969
Oh, shoot. I think I gave those
to my brother-in-law.

209
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,912
You did, did you?

210
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:59,564
Oh, well, that's okay.
It's not like you stole them or anything.

211
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:02,449
You just took 'em
and never returned 'em...

212
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:04,423
which is different somehow.

213
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:07,181
Ha!

214
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,706
It's...

215
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:13,127
Mom, can I ask you a question?

216
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:15,853
In your relationship with Dad,
have you ever...

217
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:19,086
let an argument cross
into other parts of your relationship?

218
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:21,423
What do you mean?

219
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,807
You know, I mean, do you ever...

220
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,184
not have sex with Dad?

221
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,342
Sure! I'm not having sex
with him right now.

222
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,112
No, Mom, I mean, like,
in an argument, to get your way.

223
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,829
You can do that?

224
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:41,865
Yeah. I just wonder if it's wrong.

225
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:44,077
Donna, you're saying...

226
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:46,731
by my not having sex
with your father...

227
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:49,584
I can get him
to paint the bathroom?

228
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,610
Yeah. But don't you think
it hurts the relationship?

229
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,944
Blah, blah, blah!
I'm getting my bathroom painted!

230
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:07,087
And two of them to turn the ladder.

231
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:10,929
Yeah.

232
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:14,377
Yeah, those Polish people... they sure
don't know much about lightbulbs.

233
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,622
Exactly.

234
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,559
Two of them turn the ladder.

235
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:28,718
So Sammy Davis Jr., the pope
and this Polish guy are on a plane, see?

236
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:31,753
There's only the one parachute.

237
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:37,518
Hey, Red, seeing as how you're
dead and all, can I have those shoes?

238
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,162
Get away from him!

239
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,495
Red, honey, your funeral's a big hit.

240
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:47,017
You are corpse of the year.

241
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,865
Just put the lid on, Kitty.
I need some freakin' quiet.

242
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:02,214
- Are you having fun?
- No.

243
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,200
Turns out I was mistaken.

244
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,175
Life is too short to spend it
with people who annoy you.

245
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,440
I... I just wanna spend it
with people I really, really love.

246
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:14,223
Like you and, uh...

247
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,388
Well, mostly just you.

248
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:20,141
Everybody.

249
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,959
Thanks for being here.

250
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:25,229
And I just wanna say...

251
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:29,738
when my time comes,
I wanna be buried facedown...

252
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,152
so that anyone who doesn't
like me can kiss my ass.

253
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,223
Hey, Kelso, man.
I brought you your film.

254
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:59,534
U.F.O. Pictures came out okay.

255
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:01,968
Aha! Proof.

256
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:04,751
But these naked ones of you
are far more interesting, man.

257
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:09,521
What? Those were on that roll?

258
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,920
You know, I don't see a U.F.O...

259
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:14,855
but I can definitely see Uranus.

260
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,159
It's a planet,
but it's also your butt.

261
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:27,535
You guys are so immature.

262
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:30,984
- Kelso, why are you squirting water out of your mouth?
- I was a fountain!

263
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:33,905
I totally got it, man. It's art.

264
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,879
Man.

265
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:42,921
Hey, you guys wanna see
the other set he brought?

266
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:45,231
Ohh!

267
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:58,700
Donna, we've gotta get this thing done.
This report is due in six hours.

268
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:01,868
Yeah, Eric.
I've been thinking about it.

269
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:04,808
This whole Cold War standoff?
It's ridiculous.

270
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:08,045
Neither side is getting what it wants.

271
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,626
So, what you're saying is...

272
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:15,691
by hurting each other,
they're actually hurting themselves.

273
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:20,780
Yeah. It must be incredibly frustrating
for both sides.

274
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,780
Both of them are just building up
and building up.

275
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,454
The urge to launch a first strike
must be overwhelming...

276
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:32,239
and painful.

277
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,306
You know, Donna, in a lot of ways,
what we're going through here...

278
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,767
is just like the Cuban missile crisis...

279
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:40,427
except in our case, it's a...

280
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,985
missile crisis.

281
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,112
Eric, you're right.
It's time for dיtente.

282
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:52,231
Wait.
What about our disagreement?

283
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:54,695
I don't care. You win, okay?

284
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:58,640
What?

285
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:02,317
It's just... I can't believe you caved.
Wait until I tell Hyde.

286
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,694
No. No! Where are you going?

287
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:09,933
Suddenly I'm...
I'm not in the mood.

288
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,904
You're lying!

289
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,044
Donna, we're past the point
of no return here.

290
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,562
Eric, girls don't have
a point of no return.

291
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,838
So see you tomorrow.

292
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:26,826
- Donna?
- Yes, Eric?

293
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:32,166
- I cave.
- Oh, thank God, 'cause I was just bluffing.

294
00:20:33,305 --> 00:21:33,524

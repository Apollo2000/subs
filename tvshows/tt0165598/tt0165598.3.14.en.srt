1
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:08,790
Bob.

2
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:10,765
That's my soda.

3
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,901
But I drank all mine.

4
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:18,221
Keep it.

5
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:21,461
Hey, that's <i>my</i> soda.

6
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:23,764
Life is unfair.

7
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:26,806
Oh, swell.

8
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:28,944
It's Max from the radio station.

9
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:30,990
His ad rates bled me dry.

10
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,006
I got nothin' to say to him.

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,185
Hiya, Max!

12
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:37,809
Oh, Bargain Bob!

13
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,694
Hey, I'm sorry
you lost the store, man.

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,126
Sorry? I lost it by choice.

15
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:45,942
Yep, I'm doing great.

16
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,691
Got the large fries, you know.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,378
Large fries. That's great.

18
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:54,262
I'll see you.

19
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:58,320
Hey, uh, speaking of fries, you got
any jobs down at the radio station?

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,246
Oh, not for a guy like you.

21
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,613
I'm currently looking
for an office girl...

22
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,494
but usually my office girls
are... <i>girls.</i>

23
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,374
Hi. I'm Donna. The girl.

24
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,032
Okay, Donna!

25
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,584
Listen, drop by the station
and we'll see what we can do.

26
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,990
Sure. Thanks!

27
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:21,101
I could have been an office girl.

28
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:26,060
Aw, that does it.
This tastes like crap!

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,902
May I help you, sir?

30
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,822
Yeah.

31
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:37,808
I wanna compliment you
on one tasty, fried piece of shoe.

32
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,614
Let me take care of this
right now. Earl!

33
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,597
Oh, no.

34
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,927
- Did you say Earl?
- Just one second.

35
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,592
Ricky, I'm glad you called me.

36
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:51,446
I need to leave early for a...

37
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,748
Oh. Hi, Red.

38
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:55,506
You two know each other?

39
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:57,964
I used to work for Red.
Then he fired me.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,855
Oh. Then he and I
have something in common.

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,447
You're fired!

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,203
What did I do?

43
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,238
Hey, Bob.
Job just opened up for you.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

45
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,470
Fez?

46
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:34,390
What instrument's that?

47
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:37,106
Instrument?

48
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:43,856
Eric, I got a job! I'm sorting records
at Jerry Thunder's radio show!

49
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:46,098
No way!

50
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,233
WFPP? That's Jerry Thunder!

51
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,158
The Sound!

52
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:53,973
And he knows rock stars.
And he gets free concert tickets.

53
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,854
And he gave me this guitar pick
from Foghat.

54
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,643
No way!

55
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:03,186
Eric, there's a whole pile
of bumper stickers, and they're free!

56
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:06,070
No way!

57
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:09,616
Okay, well, I gotta go. I gotta go
alphabetize the eight-tracks.

58
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,345
No way!

59
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,296
Leo, man, this place is a mess.

60
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,949
Yeah? You should see my garage.

61
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,269
This is your garage, man.

62
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,366
Well, then you see what I mean.
It's a mess.

63
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:04,818
<i>National Geographic</i>
is a beautiful magazine.

64
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:09,781
There is volcanoes and a gazelle.

65
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,761
And naked...

66
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:14,778
Leo, man, there's a car in here.

67
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:17,494
- <i>It's an El Camino!</i>
- Ohh!

68
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:19,865
Wow. Do you think it's mine?

69
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,299
The plate says "Leo's."

70
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,435
No, I mean the car, man.

71
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:28,112
This guy, huh?

72
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:33,082
And this is where we do the interviews.

73
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,464
A lot of rock legends
have puked in this room.

74
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,394
Good times.

75
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,314
Wow.

76
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,194
So, if I stay here long enough,
I might see a rock star throw up?

77
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,325
See it?
You'll probably clean it up.

78
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:49,429
All right!

79
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,532
Oh, yeah, this is Jerry Thunder...

80
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:55,669
Coming to you on The Sound!

81
00:04:55,739 --> 00:05:00,474
And it looks like we got a new office girl.
What's your name, baby?

82
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,711
Um, Donna.

83
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,668
Mmm. Well, Donna, you are hot.

84
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,779
So I'm gonna call you...

85
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,826
Hot Donna.

86
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:16,537
Okay.

87
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:20,084
<i>You got yourself a boyfriend,
Hot Donna?</i>

88
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:24,754
Um... no.

89
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:27,413
<i>Mmm! That is good news, fellas.</i>

90
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:29,272
'Cause Hot Donna is...

91
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,249
<i>hot!</i>

92
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:37,210
Max, why'd you make me say that?
'Cause I have a boyfriend.

93
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,130
Fine. You have a boyfriend.

94
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,203
So does Elton John.

95
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,865
No way!

96
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,754
Yeah! They're a fantastic couple.

97
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,510
I love 'em.

98
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,434
The point is...

99
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,354
we're selling an image here...

100
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,136
and an available Hot Donna
is good for ratings.

101
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:01,913
Oh. Well, what the hell.
Eric won't have a problem with this.

102
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,368
What the hell?
I have a problem with this!

103
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:07,290
Maybe she dumped you
and forgot to tell you.

104
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:11,600
Oh, my God. Thank you, Nairobi.

105
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:18,036
Look, Forman,
I wouldn't read too much into this.

106
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:21,850
Donna probably just said she doesn't have
a boyfriend 'cause she's ashamed of you.

107
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,818
Okay, baby, I'll see you later.

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,700
Listen, Forman, you're just upset...

109
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,586
because you know Donna is entering
the really cool world of FM radio.

110
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,506
But, you know, feel good, man.

111
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:40,248
'Cause you'll be like that first sweet
relationship she'll look back on fondly...

112
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:43,130
while she's on the tour bus
straddling rock stars.

113
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,935
Yeah, life just hasn't been the same
since I lost the van.

114
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,818
It's hard to get chicks
when you don't have wheels.

115
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:57,179
I mean, sometimes
a killer bod just isn't enough.

116
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:00,502
Amen to that, brother.

117
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:07,669
Okay, I'll sell the El Camino to you
for 500 bucks.

118
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,397
- 400.
- 600.

119
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:12,118
700! No! Damn! Wait!

120
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,074
That's the wrong way. Um...

121
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,027
Uh... 500.

122
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:18,098
No.

123
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,440
500.

124
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:23,864
Sold.

125
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:26,004
Sucker.

126
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,506
Eric, don't worry about
this whole Donna thing.

127
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,711
I know a lot of girls who are
much more realistic for you.

128
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,594
They might be a little heavy,
or a little dumb, or have a cockeye, but...

129
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:42,881
Jackie... she didn't break up
with me, okay?

130
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:46,045
- She still loves me.
- Oh.

131
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:48,384
So you're in the denial stage.

132
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,688
- No.
- See?

133
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:56,120
Oh, my God, you guys!
This has been the best day <i>ever.</i>

134
00:07:57,507 --> 00:08:00,322
Jerry Thunder has totally
taken me under his wing.

135
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:03,005
And his stories... he's so funny!

136
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:05,530
Oh! Elton John has a boyfriend!

137
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:10,781
Plus, I get to meet Alice Cooper.
Here it is.

138
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,858
I'm gonna see if Alice'll sign this.

139
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:16,226
Oh, I can't make it
to the movie tonight. See ya.

140
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,656
See?

141
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,634
She still loves me.

142
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,594
Yeah.

143
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,568
Have you met my friend Fat Sally?

144
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,488
Earl. What brings you here?

145
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,311
Uh, I took the bus.

146
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:47,008
First off, Kitty, I'd like to say
you have a lovely home.

147
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:49,279
Second of all, screw you, Red.

148
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,972
What?

149
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:53,858
I'm out of work,
and it's all your fault.

150
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:56,923
How am I supposed to
pay my bills or feed my dog...

151
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,904
or... go to Hawaii?

152
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:02,209
Look, Earl...

153
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,609
you can't blame me for getting fired.

154
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:07,490
I didn't make you too dumb
to flip burgers.

155
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,108
That's God's fault.

156
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:14,434
Yeah, well, you know the Christmas card
you get of me and my dog every year?

157
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:16,834
You're off the list.
Yeah. That's right.

158
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,095
Don't bother checking the mailbox, Red,
'cause it ain't comin'.

159
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:27,897
I loved his Christmas cards.

160
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:29,881
They were handmade.

161
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:35,488
This is Jerry Thunder...

162
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,595
comin' at you on The Sound!

163
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,187
We got Alice Cooper
droppin' by any minute...

164
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,877
and it is going to be wild!

165
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,801
This is Jerry Thunder...

166
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:49,373
Comin' your way on The Sound...

167
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:53,469
<i>where we are enjoying lots of sex,
drugs and rock and roll.</i>

168
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:56,157
<i>Am I right, Hot Donna?</i>

169
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,074
You sure are, Jerry Thunder.

170
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,441
Radio people are the coolest!

171
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:05,697
That's right. That's why
you want to have sex with us all.

172
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:08,152
I really do!

173
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:11,707
<i>Hey, everybody, it's Alice Cooper!</i>

174
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:14,658
Hey, Hot Donna.

175
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:17,985
Heard about you
at the last big rock star meeting.

176
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,906
Hey, Ted Nugent and I
were wondering...

177
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:22,841
Did you ever break up
with that loser boyfriend of yours?

178
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,013
Not yet, Alice Cooper.

179
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,417
Here's my loser boyfriend right now.

180
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:31,963
Hey, Donna. Are you ready
to go to the Price Mart ball?

181
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,617
You hear that, everybody?
The Price Mart ball.

182
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,051
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we feed
your skinny boyfriend to the snake?

183
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:44,920
Okay.

184
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,288
Damn you, Alice Cooper.

185
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,682
I haven't seen Donna in two days.

186
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,562
She's been spending all of her time
at the radio station.

187
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,482
This is a real problem.

188
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:12,711
Oh, here we go again.
Forman's got a problem.

189
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,707
Well, you know what? Maybe I got
a problem, man. Did you ever think of that?

190
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:19,977
Oh. Man, Hyde, I'm sorry.

191
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,952
Go ahead, man, Unload.

192
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,354
Actually, I'm cool.

193
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,274
And that's how you do it.

194
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:30,089
You have a problem,
and you hold it in, man.

195
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,064
Now, leather up, fruitcake.

196
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,744
I have a problem.

197
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,488
But I guess I'll keep it all inside.

198
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,746
Hey, you guys...

199
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:48,423
so, Leo agreed to sell me
the El Camino for, like, 500 bucks.

200
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:51,076
So, what I need from you is...

201
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:53,481
500 bucks.

202
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,402
Hey, I'm Hyde.

203
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,322
I don't feel anything.

204
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:59,296
I'm just a frizzy-haired robot.

205
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,122
Hey! I'm Forman!

206
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:05,056
I use the same voice
to imitate everybody!

207
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,504
It's just that I...

208
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:12,736
I...

209
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,712
Nothing.

210
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:19,973
Oh!

211
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:23,360
Gilligan screwed it up.

212
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,488
He always screws it up.

213
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,524
Why don't they just kill him?

214
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,465
I don't think you're really
mad at Gilligan, Red.

215
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:42,696
<i>Admit it. You feel guilty
about what happened to Earl.</i>

216
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,407
This has nothing to do with Earl.

217
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,566
The professor worked on that
coconut radio for three months.

218
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,360
Now how the hell are they
gonna get off that island?

219
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,185
Oh.

220
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,218
Well, then I guess I was wrong.
I don't know why I questioned you.

221
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,105
And I'll tell ya...

222
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,724
something's going on
with that Skipper.

223
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,429
You don't get that fat
eating coconuts.

224
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:22,405
Jackie, you know I wouldn't ask you
if this wasn't important. Okay?

225
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:25,158
But this is an El Camino.

226
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,965
That's Spanish for "The Camino."

227
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:39,012
By accepting this check,
you are agreeing to two things.

228
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:42,116
First, you will pay me back in full...

229
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:45,002
and you will be my slave
for a week.

230
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:48,198
Meaning, like, your love slave?

231
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,018
No.

232
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,352
More like an errand boy.

233
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,834
You mean,
like your errand love boy?

234
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,776
No. Just errands.

235
00:14:01,803 --> 00:14:03,658
- Okay.
- Good. Here.

236
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:06,538
Now, go get your car,
and then come by my place.

237
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:09,669
I need you to hold my toes apart
while I paint them.

238
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,255
Well, errand boy...

239
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,810
you just sold your soul for a car.

240
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:21,672
Who cares, Fez?

241
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,903
Your soul is like an appendix.
I don't even use it.

242
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,815
Kitty, about this burger...

243
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:43,078
What? Is it burnt?
Are you gonna fire me?

244
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:46,016
Make me live on the street
with the other hoboes?

245
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,634
Kitty, let it go.

246
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:52,423
I do not feel guilty!

247
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,021
All right! I feel guilty!

248
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:05,257
He'll thank me when his tummy
stops hurting.

249
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,657
So...

250
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,762
how are things with you and...

251
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,743
Hot Donna?

252
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,616
Well, if you heard about Hot Donna...

253
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:23,017
then you heard
that I'm not her boyfriend.

254
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,937
The whole world heard that.

255
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:28,799
Well, people in Canada heard it.

256
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:31,143
Oh, honey,
Canadians don't matter.

257
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:38,982
What matters is that
you and Donna are okay. Right?

258
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,384
Mom, I don't even know
if we're okay.

259
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,036
She's spending all of her time
at The Sound with Jerry Thunder.

260
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:47,401
That reminds me of when
I first started at the hospital.

261
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:51,525
Your father was concerned that I was
spending way too much time down there...

262
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,536
with all these handsome doctors.

263
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,465
But, Mom, that's stupid.

264
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,951
Doctors aren't important
like deejays.

265
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:02,920
Okay, well, the point is...

266
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:06,914
your dad started showing up
at the hospital to mark his territory...

267
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:11,109
and one of the doctors, who was getting
a little fresh, got punched in the mouth.

268
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,520
Dad's so cool.

269
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:20,680
No, that wasn't cool.
It was embarrassing.

270
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,339
But you married him.

271
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,614
Yes, but it was embarrassing.

272
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,470
Still, you married him.

273
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,709
The point is,
you have to trust Donna.

274
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:31,363
But Dad didn't trust you,
and you married him.

275
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:34,084
Okay, you know what?
I can't talk to you.

276
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:45,733
Okay, I am here to withdraw
my complaint about my overcooked burger.

277
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,420
Uh-huh. Well, I don't think
you can do that.

278
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,745
- Well, I think I can.
- Of course you can. The customer's always right.

279
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,712
So, you'll give Earl his job back?

280
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:59,560
Well, the fry cook burnt off
his finger this morning...

281
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,408
so... sure.

282
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:05,889
By the way, don't have the fish sticks.
We haven't found it.

283
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,839
You hear that, Earl?
You got your job back. You can go to work.

284
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,953
Wait. You mean right now?

285
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:16,098
But I'll miss <i>WKRP.</i>

286
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,695
- Okay, man, here are the keys.
- Oh, bitchin'!

287
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:24,809
You know...

288
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:28,649
I was gonna give this car to my son
on his 16th birthday.

289
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,365
But then my old lady
took him and split.

290
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:35,329
Yeah, wow. Sad story.
Keys, please?

291
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:39,814
- I can't sell you the car, man.
- Oh, man!

292
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:43,429
Ah, I guess I understand.

293
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:47,622
Thanks, man.
Hyde, I want you to have this car.

294
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,513
What? No! You just said
that you couldn't sell the car.

295
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,847
Well, I'm not selling it.
I'm giving it to him, man.

296
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:57,768
He's family.

297
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,222
He's the son I never had.

298
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:02,884
You just said you had a son!

299
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:08,361
Yeah, and Hyde's the son
I <i>never</i> had.

300
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:12,771
Hey, Leo, man, thanks.
You're the best.

301
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,518
The car, the love,
the wicked burn on Kelso.

302
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:20,223
Hey, man, need a lift?

303
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:26,697
- Eric, what are you doing here?
- I'll tell you what I'm doing here, Donna.

304
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:29,991
I'm here to say who's who
and what's what to Jerry Thunder.

305
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,353
Eric, you can't talk to Jerry.
He's on the air.

306
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,272
Oh. Fine.

307
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:37,672
Then I guess I'll just have to wait.

308
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:40,673
But let me tell you something...
I'll be fuming.

309
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,097
This is Jerry Thunder...

310
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:47,715
signing off.

311
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:50,568
And I'll see you around The Sound.

312
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,488
All right!

313
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:56,328
Whoo! Let's get Mr. Big FM Stud
out here right now!

314
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,466
Yeah! Big time!

315
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,156
Eric, why are you being weird?

316
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:03,560
Donna, I'm gonna make a long story short.

317
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,855
I'm here to kick a little deejay ass,
so have a seat.

318
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,776
Hey, Donna.

319
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,980
And this must be
the boyfriend, Eric.

320
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,505
Hi. I'm Jerry Thunder.

321
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:18,463
<i>You're</i> Jerry Thunder?

322
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,527
Well, that's just great!

323
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:26,569
Check out Jerry Thunder!

324
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,968
Hey, you kids,
the night is young.

325
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,717
You guys up for a game
of Dungeons & Dragons?

326
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:36,420
I'll let you be Mandar, the half-elf.

327
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:40,168
Oh, well. Another time, perhaps.
Good night.

328
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:46,847
So, <i>that's</i> Jerry Thunder?

329
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,233
It really turns me off
when you're so insecure like this.

330
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,161
We've been together long enough...

331
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,641
where it's either you don't get it
or you don't trust me.

332
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:59,911
- No, Donna, I trust you.
- Well, then you don't get it.

333
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:03,273
I finally have something that's
really good in my life right now...

334
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:06,567
and if you can't handle that,
then we have a problem.

335
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,488
So, Eric, do we have a problem?

336
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:10,561
No, we do not have a problem.

337
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:12,488
Good.

338
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:15,849
'Cause I broke my nail on a Styx album,
I didn't get to meet Alice Cooper...

339
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,987
and I am super pissed.

340
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:20,097
Yeah, well, you know...

341
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:25,025
you have a really cool job.

342
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:28,617
Yeah, I do, don't I?

343
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:31,399
REO Speedwagon's
coming in next week.

344
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,942
I'm gonna see
if they'll sign my boobs.

345
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,562
Now we have a problem.

346
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:46,040
Okay, suddenly you're face to face
with the Dragon of Fear.

347
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:50,361
No! I should have worn
my Gauntlet of Ogre Strength.

348
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:53,241
Dumb! Any ideas, Mandar?

349
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,520
Well, there's my Rod of Cancellation,
but it's chancy.

350
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:01,400
Yeah.

351
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:04,280
You know, a girl once promised
to play with us, but she didn't show up.

352
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:07,160
Cheer up, King Zintar the Great.

353
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:10,040
Let's get out there
and slay that dragon.

354
00:21:11,305 --> 00:22:11,582

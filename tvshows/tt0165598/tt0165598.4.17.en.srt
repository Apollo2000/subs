1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,960
Guys, look what I got
for Big Rhonda.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,440
Oh, it's so nice to have
a girlfriend on Valentine's Day.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,680
Yeah, it definitely increases the chance
of gettin' your fun stuff touched.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,360
Well, sorry, fun stuff.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,000
Looks like it's just
you and me this year.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
Unless...

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,040
- Sorry, fun stuff.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,400
Oh, Rhonda's
going to love these.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,320
I just have to not eat them
until Valentine's Day.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,160
- But you love candy.
- Some would say it's an unnatural love.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,200
Yes, I do love candy.
But I love Rhonda more.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,000
Really? 'Cause there's
three pieces missing.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,360
Fine. I love her the same.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,720
Hi, sweetie.
How was work?

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,120
I am so exhausted.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,040
Yeah, the commute from Austria
must be a real bitch.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,200
A bus full of old people
stopped by the Cheese Palace.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,880
And when they saw free samples,
all hell broke loose.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,440
But the good news is
I got paid!

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,400
Oh, that's great.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,280
'Cause Valentine's Day's coming up,
and I need you to give me money...

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,240
and tell me whatever foo-foo
crap gift you want to get.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,760
Michael, I'm not doing that again.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,160
Last year I gave you money,
and you bought a bag of plastic dinosaurs.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,160
For you!

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,120
Look, you need to make some cash...

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,240
and buy me something nice...

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,160
because I worked way too hard
for my money, and you're not gettin' any.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,080
Oh, I smell like hickory.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,720
Oh, this bites.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,040
Hey, Fez, how's it going
with not eating the candy?

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,080
Fine, thank you.

33

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,360
Oh, my God.
Casey Kelso's here.

35
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,560
What? Oh, my God.
He is so fine.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,120
You know, if you marry Casey
and I marry Michael...

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,040
we'll be like sisters.

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,200
Yea!
Okay, go talk to him.

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,680
- I don't know.
- I want to go baby shopping with you. Now go!

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,760
All right. Shut up.

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,440
Oh, my God. Casey.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,040
Hey, Pinciotti.
How you been?

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,960
Love the jeans.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,560
Really? They're blue.

45
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,400
Um...

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,640
so what have you, like,
you know, been up to?

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm working part-time
for the railroad.

48
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,560
They leave a lot of stuff unlocked.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,800
You need any Cheerios or rebar?

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,440
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- Right on.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,280
Well, listen, I'll give you a call sometime,
but right now I gotta go see a guy.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,600
He's got a leather
steering-wheel cover.

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
Oh, yeah.
For the Trans Am.

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,720
Yeah. I was thinkin' about using
my G.I. Bill for college...

55
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,840
but, uh, Trans Ams
just kick so much ass.

56
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,760
I love the Trans Am!

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,720
Everybody does.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,280
- See ya.
- Okay, bye.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,920
- He's gonna call me.
- You gave him your number?

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
Of course I... didn't.
Damn it!

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,640
Oh, that's okay.
Kelsos never call.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
They're like dogs.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,760
They're cute,
but they can't work a phone.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,640
Hey, Jackie. I thought
about what you said...

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,280
about making money so I can get you
a Valentine's Day gift, right?

66
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,120
And then I realized
that it'd mean a lot more...

67
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,560
if I gave you something that
I crafted with my own two loving hands.

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
Oh, my God! It's horrible!

69
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,080
No, it's an address rock.

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,400
You put it on your lawn.

71
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,600
Happy Valentine's Day,
my love.

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,120
Michael, a rock
is not a romantic gift.

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,600
And that's not even my address.

74
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,520
That's my address.

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,480
No, it isn't.

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
That's my dad's address rock!

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,240
No, it isn't!

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
Hey, Dad.
You want this?

79
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,440
Thanks, Son.
I love you.

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,640
I'm sorry. What?

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,600
I love you. I really do.

82
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,880
Yeah.

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah.

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,120
Donna!

85
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,040
What are you doing at my house?

86
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,480
Nothing. I just thought I'd come by
and see what you were up to.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,560
Oh, you're here
to see Casey, aren't you?

88
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,920
Casey, your lover's here!

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,600
You love my brother!
You're gonna do it with...

90
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Ow! Mom!

91
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,440
- Thank you.
- No problem.

92
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,360
<i>Spaz face!</i>

93
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,280
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,960
Um, you were gonna call me, and I remember
I never, like, gave you my number.

95
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,760
So, anyway, here's my number.

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,600
You know, I was gonna get that from you
tomorrow night... when we go out.

97
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
- We're going out?
- Yeah. I'll pick you up at The Hub after school.

98
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,920
I'll be in the Trans Am.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,760
I love the Trans Am!

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,720
Everybody does.

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,240
Later, Pinciotti.

102
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
Pinciotti.

103
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,040
Mom, was Dad abducted by aliens and replaced
by an identical creature programmed to love?

104
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,280
Honey, this is breakfast.
Don't ask me things.

105
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,800
He told me he loved me.

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,280
Your father?

107
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,360
No!

108
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
Yeah.

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
I think I know what happened.

110
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
I gave your father
an early Valentine's Day card...

111
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
that said what a wonderful
husband and father he is...

112
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
and it rhymed,
and maybe it touched him.

113
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,280
It didn't look like it touched him.
He just... He got up and got a beer.

114
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,840
But maybe deep down...

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,760
deep, deep, deep down...

116
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
something woke up.

117
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,320
I am so glad he loves you.

118
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,680
Yeah, but, Mom, this is weird.

119
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,120
He's never said that. Ever.

120
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,920
One time I saved him
from getting hit by a lumber truck...

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,440
and I think he was about to say it,
but then he said...

122
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,280
"Get in the car."

123
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,240
But how am I
supposed to handle this?

124
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,160
You think I should say it back?

125
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,600
He's gonna hit me.

126
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,520
Maybe not.

127
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,240
I can't believe that Jackie
wants me to get a job.

128
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,280
I mean, my plan has always been
to coast through life on my good looks.

129
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,880
I mean, look at me!
It's like I was chiseled out of marble.

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,960
Okay, you guys, here goes.

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,840
Dad, I love you.

132
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,840
I love <i>you,</i> Pop.

133
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,240
Poppy? Pappy? Daddy? No.

134
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,320
Oh, I have to... I have to stop eating
Rhonda's chocolates.

135
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,640
Oh, it's hopeless.

136
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,960
Kelso, if you need to make
some quick cash, just sell your blood.

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,680
And you!
You've had enough of this!

138
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,440
No, I can stop anytime I want.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,880
I am not selling blood.

140
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,200
There's no way that anything inside
of my body is comin' out for cash.

141
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,520
Well, that's too bad, Kelso, 'cause
I hear there's this clinic in Madison...

142
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,880
that'll pay you for your,
um, manly donations.

143
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,160
Manly donations?

144
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,480
No way!
They'll pay you for that?

145
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,840
Well, I'll do that.
I'm good at that.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,560
"Do you have any serious
medical conditions?"

147
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,280
Puked... after...

148
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,800
Crunch Berry eating contest.

149
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,920
- You know what? I'll just finish that for you.
- Thank you.

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,480
Now, Mr. <i>Chang...</i>

151
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,880
you'll be in room two.

152
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,760
Some of our clients prefer a magazine.
Would you like one?

153
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,120
Nah. Farrah was on Carson last night.
I should be good to go.

154
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,600
Okay, so I was in the kitchen and Red came
in, and I was gonna tell him I loved him.

155
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,320
But, uh, then he said
if my hair got any longer...

156
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,840
he was gonna buy me
a pair of boobs, so...

157
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,920
Yeah, you're in a tough spot.

158
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,760
But just know I'm here for you,
'cause... I love you.

159
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,160
You know what would make Forman
feel better? A piece of that candy.

160
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,200
No, no, no. There's only nine left.
I will guard them with my life.

161
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,880
Hyde! Eric!

162
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,800
Fez!

163
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,200
Easiest money I ever made.

164
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,800
They paid me 50 bucks
for my underpants navy.

165
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,400
You mean
your corduroy commandos?

166
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah, your team from the inseam?

167
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,920
Your <i>Battle-pants Galactica?</i>

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
- <i>Battle-pants Galactica.</i> Nice one. Wow.
- It just came to me. Thank you.

169
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,120
Man, this job is the greatest.

170
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,520
It combines all my interests,
hobbies and skills...

171
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,240
into one moneymaking endeavor.

172
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,040
I'm gonna get Jackie
a sweet gift. Popcorn?

173
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
- Dude!
- Oh, forget it!

174
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,240
All right, Kelso.
Where the hell is your moron brother?

175
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,760
He was supposed to meet me at The Hub,
and he totally blew me off.

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,280
Whoa. A Kelso blew you off?

177
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,040
Oh, my God. What a shock.

178
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,400
Oh, hey, Colonel Mustard called.
He said get a clue.

179
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,720
What is wrong with you Kelsos?

180
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Did all of you
get dropped on your heads?

181
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,800
You know, if you're mad at Casey,
why don't you go yell at him?

182
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm too tired from working
all day to argue.

183
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,120
Oh, to be a working stiff.

184
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,640
So, Red, you big, old softy.

185
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,760
Did anything special
happen yesterday?

186
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,240
Special?
Well, let's see.

187
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,160
The dentist called with a cancellation,
so I went in...

188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,920
and the sadistic son of a bitch
found a cavity.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,400
The next thing I know,
I'm hopped up on drugs...

190
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,640
and he's taking
a jackhammer to my jaw.

191
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,520
I spent the rest of the day in a fog.

192
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
Oh, no.

193
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,360
Oh, my God. You don't remember
what you said to Eric?

194
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,920
Kitty, I don't even remember
how I got home.

195
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,120
All right, Dad.

196
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,280
Look, I tried to figure out
the right words...

197
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,400
and then I realized
I just gotta say it, so...

198
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,240
- Wait, Eric...
- Mom, please.

199
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,360
Dad, I...

200
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,600
Stop!

201
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,040
He was drugged!

202
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,640
Love you.

203
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,800
Go to your room.

204
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,240
Rhonda is going to be
so disappointed.

205
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,160
All that remains
is one lonely candy.

206
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,320
Look!

207
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
More candies!

208
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,080
It's a Valentine's Day miracle!

209
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Oh, candy...

210
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,560
you've got me under your spell!

211
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Jackie, I couldn't wait
till Valentine's Day.

212
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,000
So... here.

213
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,400
Oh, my God, Michael!
These earrings are gorgeous!

214
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,560
Big day at the office?

215
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah, I worked a double shift.

216
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,920
Wai-Wait. You got a job?

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,760
Michael, I am so proud of you.

218
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,800
Well, now, if it wasn't
for you pushing me...

219
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,000
I would've never realized
how good it feels...

220
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,200
to roll up my sleeves,
get a little sweaty and earn some cash.

221
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,840
Oh, this is so exciting!

222
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,560
I can't wait to come
visit you at work.

223
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
That'll speed things up.

224
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,240
What's he talking about?

225
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,680
Oh.

226
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,960
I've been selling my love nectar.

227
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,240
What?

228
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,280
Michael, you can't do that.
You're hot.

229
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
Women are gonna want to take
your little Kelsos home.

230
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,760
My God, she's right.

231
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,320
Think about it...
a world full of Kelsos.

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
Libraries will fall into disrepair.

233
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,320
There'll be feathered hair
as far as the eye can see.

234
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,560
We'll have to put padding
on every sharp corner!

235
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,360
Hey, those sharp corners
can be hazardous, man.

236
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,280
I mean, come on. It's 1978!
Things should be round by now!

237
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,800
Hey! Hey, Casey!

238
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,720
Hey, Pinciotti.

239
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,240
What the hell happened to you?
I was waiting at The Hub?

240
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,120
Oh, man.

241
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,040
See, the thing is, when I went
to go pick up the steering-wheel cover...

242
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,360
the Trans Am was running kind of rough,
so I thought I'd rebuild the carburetor.

243
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,840
<i>But I was waiting at The Hub.</i>

244
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,520
Well, you want a smooth ride,
don't you?

245
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,800
I just think that if you say
you're gonna be someplace...

246
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,720
that you should be there.

247
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,080
Aw, man, I guess I flaked.

248
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,240
I've just got this thing
where a lot of times I don't show up.

249
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't know what to do about it.

250
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,320
How about showing up?

251
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,760
I guess I could give that a shot.

252
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,440
So this will never happen again?

253
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,800
No, I'm pretty sure it'll happen again.

254
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,280
But we'll light that firecracker
when we come to it.

255
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,280
Fair enough.

256
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,680
I can't believe this.
When I got here, I was so mad at you...

257
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,840
and I already totally forgave you.

258
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,160
Yeah. Everybody does.

259
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm sorry, miss,
but I can't give it to you.

260
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,680
The donor himself is the only one
who has legal rights over the specimen.

261
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,000
Fine!

262
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Michael, you get them!

263
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,400
You're the only one who has
rights over your "special men."

264
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,800
Jackie, what do you care
what I do with my special men?

265
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,680
Specimen.
I said, specimen.

266
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,440
I care because if there are
gonna be any little Kelso babies...

267
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,400
well, I want them to be ours.

268
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh. You want to have my children?

269
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,040
Well, yeah.

270
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
I mean, if you get rich and don't
lose your hair. Because I love you.

271
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,720
I love you too.

272
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,560
You can't do that here.

273
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,320
Oh, she's right.
We'll be in room two.

274
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
- Dad?
- Oh, crap.

275
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,720
I was hoping that you
wouldn't find me back here.

276
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,160
Well, that's a good icebreaker.

277
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,600
Look, um...

278
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,080
about the... "love" incident...

279
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,840
All right.
Stop right there.

280
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,400
There are only a few times in life when it's
acceptable for a man to use that phrase...

281
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,920
when he's drunk,
when he's dying...

282
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,920
or when he's in big trouble
and that's the only way out.

283
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,840
Which usually means he's drunk.

284
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,800
So, other than that...

285
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,400
Other than that,
it's just a given.

286
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,120
Oh. Hey, you just
kind of told me...

287
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,040
No, I didn't.

288
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,720
Yes, you did.

289
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,400
Well, I'm drunk.

290
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,200
Clearly I'm drunk.

291
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Daddy, be my valentine.

292
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,240
Do I have to hit you?
Go to your room.

293
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,240
All right.

294
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,680
Good news. My boys
are back in friendly hands.

295
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,480
Ironically, that's just where
they started their journey.

296
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,760
That's a shame, Kelso. It's the one job
I knew you could've been a success at.

297
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,400
Thanks, Hyde.

298
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
Kelso, get that nasty bag
of genetics out of my basement.

299
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,520
This bag?

300
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,440
Burn! It's just
a big bag of candy.

301
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,320
Candy? What kind of candy?

302
00:21:09,305 --> 00:22:09,320

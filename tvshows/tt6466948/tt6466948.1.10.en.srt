1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:02,125
<i>Starting my own podcast company has been</i>

2
00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:04,750
<i>the most exciting,
rewarding, and difficult thing</i>

3
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:06,513
<i>I've ever done, but the nice thing is</i>

4
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:09,156
<i>I can always come home to
the warm embrace of my family.</i>

5
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,488
Don't come in here!

6
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:13,410
There is no reason to be naked
in the living room, Ben.

7
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:16,140
And don't throw last year's
Valentine's Day in my face.

8
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,042
No, Dad. I-I don't want you to trigger

9
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:20,697
my Rube Goldberg contraption.

10
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,492
Wow. Impressive.

11
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:24,406
But, hey, Ben, check out
this guitar pick

12
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,842
a guy on the subway gave me
for joining his sing-along.

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,257
Joke's on him, though.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,476
You couldn't pay me <i>not</i> to sing

15
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:30,389
"We Are the World."

16
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,599
I was Cyndi Lauper.

17
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,190
Thanks, Dad, but I'm over guitar.

18
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,685
What? Since when?

19
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:36,358
I don't remember, but a long time ago.

20
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:37,644
Easily a week.

21
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,748
- What's up, guys?
- Oh, look who it is.

22
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,662
Is that the beautiful Rooni Schuman

23
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:44,974
from the yet-to-be popular
podcast "Gone Guy"?

24
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,556
Oh, actually, I was at Starbucks
earlier today,

25
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:50,227
and the woman behind me
was like, "I know that voice.

26
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,714
Are you Rooni from 'Gone Guy'?"

27
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:53,349
It was so exciting.

28
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:55,518
Eh, I'm sure that happens to you
all the time.

29
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,353
Yeah. All the time.

30
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,056
Attention, family.

31
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,992
Soraya, the marble, please.

32
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:04,359
I don't know where it is.

33
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:06,112
You had one job!

34
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:08,013
So, Ben's over guitar now?

35
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:10,856
How did I miss that?
Am I working too much?

36
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:13,109
No, it's Ben. It's hard to keep up.

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,301
One day he's vegan,

38
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:15,843
the next day he's smoking his own jerky.

39
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,250
You know what this means.

40
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:19,358
I'm gonna have to really
up my game for Career Day,

41
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:22,137
remind Ben how totally awesome I am.

42
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:24,981
Ah, yes, the true meaning of Career Day.

43
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,210
Found the marble.

44
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:28,223
Yeah, well, the momentum's still gone.

45
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,429
It's fine. I'll make it work.

46
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:31,608
Hold onto your butts.

47
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,741
Okay, now, what's the best place
to watch this?

48
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,483
I want to make sure
I'm in the perfect position

49
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:38,970
to appreciate the whole thing.

50
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,116
Wait! Not there!

51
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:46,737
Soraya, get the frozen peas.

52
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:48,267
Daddy's concussed.

54
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,464
Okay, first order of business...

55
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,702
time to check
the weekly podcast rankings.

56
00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:00,040
- Oh, God.
- I say we downgrade this ritual

57
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:02,176
to once a year
and spare ourselves the agony.

58
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:04,044
<i>Every Tuesday, the ratings came out,</i>

59
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:05,879
<i>and sometimes it felt like
no one knew our podcast</i>

60
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,147
<i>was even there.</i>

61
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:09,450
<i>But this was the day everything changed.</i>

62
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:11,652
Oh, my God. This can't be right.

63
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:14,053
Our Family's Business is number one.

64
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:15,354
Hundred?

65
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:16,622
No. We're number one.

66
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,191
We're first!

67
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:21,027
We're the most downloaded
podcast in the country!

68
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,662
Look!

69
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:24,130
I can't believe this.

70
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:25,932
We got discovered
by the show "Shark Tank"!

71
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,067
They tweeted, "Check out
Our Family's Business.

72
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,569
Alex Schuman puts it all on the line

73
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,137
to go after the American dream."

74
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,238
Yeah, we did!

75
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,640
We did it! We did it! We did it!

76
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:36,275
Okay. Remember what we said.

77
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,945
Count to two in your head, then release.

78
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,548
Nailed it.

79
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,650
N-No, you can't come back for seconds.

80
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:46,252
We're so excited, too.
This is the most...

81
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:47,520
<i>Hundreds of thousands of people</i>

82
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:49,689
<i>had suddenly taken notice
of our podcast,</i>

83
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,458
<i>and, most important of all,
so had our main investor.</i>

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,061
You guys, Sacca is going crazy
about these numbers.

85
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:56,329
He says we have to run with this.

86
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:57,930
He says he'll give us
as much money as we need

87
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:00,166
to deliver five new shows
by the end of the year.

88
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:03,202
Yay! But, wait, how are we gonna
pull off five new podcasts?

89
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:05,605
Sacca said he'd send us
all the help we need

90
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,373
in the form of Serena Bans!

91
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:08,508
Oh, my God.

92
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,909
- Are you kidding me right now?
- No.

93
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:11,143
- Serena Bans?
- Yeah.

94
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:12,578
The most famous podcast producer
on the planet?

95
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,180
- Yeah.
- First of all, there's no such thing

96
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:16,048
as a famous podcast producer.

97
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,216
Second, never heard of her.

98
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,251
Are you serious?

99
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:19,752
You've never heard of Incredibilia,

100
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:22,054
The VonTrieger Conundrum, Anaesthesia,

101
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:24,090
Hosted by Arnaud and Celine Juh?

102
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,525
- Are you having a stroke?
- Not yet.

103
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:28,661
I cannot believe that Serena
and I are gonna be colleagues.

104
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,296
And dare I say friends.

105
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:31,397
Best friends?

106
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:32,598
Anything can happen.

107
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,799
Guys, it's really happening.

108
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,401
Our dreams are coming true.

109
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:36,602
I think we should hug again!

110
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:37,937
I don't have time for one of your hugs.

111
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,405
I agree. Back to work.

112
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:42,441
Girl, the last episode
of your podcast was a-mazing.

113
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:43,809
Thank you.

114
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:45,378
They have been so much fun to make.

115
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,879
I think about them all day long,

116
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:48,915
usually when I'm supposed to be working.

117
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,683
Hey, Rooni, can I have a word?

118
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:52,051
Oh, sure.

119
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:53,686
How's the podcast coming?

120
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,621
Oh, um, yeah, it's okay.

121
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,856
But I want to reassure you

122
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,791
that it will not get in the way
of my work here.

123
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,928
Well, I can reassure<i> you</i>
that it already has.

124
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,864
Maybe instead of focusing on podcasting,

125
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,866
you can focus on these.

126
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:09,235
Wow, that's a lot of cases.

127
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:10,269
I e-mailed them to you, too,

128
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,671
but I felt like dropping them
on your desk

129
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:12,805
was more dramatic.

130
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:14,540
Have fun.

131
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:15,541
Sure.

132
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,077
Huh?

133
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,912
Oh, my God! I'm so proud of you!

134
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:21,280
Thank you. I'm so excited.

135
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:22,416
Put your dinner shoes on.

136
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:23,884
I'm taking you and the kids
out for steak.

137
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:25,152
Kids!

138
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:27,321
So, what, he wants five podcasts
by the end of the year?

139
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:28,889
That's... That's... Wow!

140
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,591
It is "wow"
and it's totally overwhelming,

141
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,092
but he's sending us
this amazing producer

142
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,327
named Serena Bans.

143
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:35,195
She hasn't even started yet,
and she's all over it.

144
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:36,930
Probably her texting me now.

145
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:38,065
Yeah.

146
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:39,132
And now she's e-mailing me.

147
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,202
We still have a landline?

148
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,236
<i>Hey, you've reached the Schumans.</i>

149
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,504
- We still have an answering machine?
- <i>Leave a message.</i>

150
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:46,340
I sure hope so. I just bought
a 12-pack of tapes for it.

151
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,075
Listen, babe,

152
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:49,876
I'm really glad that you got her
because my boss says

153
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,878
I have to start focusing more
on my real job,

154
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,268
which means I can't help out
as much on "Gone Guy."

155
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,498
Really? Babe, it's going so well.

156
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:57,733
I know. I'm sorry.

157
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:58,967
What's up, Dad?

158
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,969
Oh! Hey, guys, wash your little faces.

159
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,671
We're going out to dinner.
We're celebrating.

160
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,840
I can't. Emma's moms are out front.

161
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,341
I'm doing dinner at their place.

162
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,677
They're making Sloppy Janes.

163
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,445
Well, that's too bad.
What about you, Ben?

164
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,247
No, I got to take a rain check, too.

165
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:13,381
I'm going over to Greg's place

166
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,083
and we're editing
my Rube Goldberg video.

167
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:18,086
Oh, hey! Make sure you don't
let Greg near any Cheez Whiz

168
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:19,121
while you're over there.

169
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,992
Right?

170
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,998
No Cheez Whiz for Greg!

171
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,067
We know how that goes. Classic.

172
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,444
Yeah. Good one, Mom.

173
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:35,983
I got to tell Greg you said that.

174
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,539
Well, tell Greg I said hi.

175
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:41,830
- Who the hell is Greg?
- You know, Greg. Ben's friend.

176
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,201
If Ben had a friend named Greg,
I think I would know it.

177
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,507
Guys, this is Serena Bans.

178
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,985
These are my amazing partners,
Eddie LaGuzza and...

179
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,274
Deirdre Riordan. Hi.

180
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,309
Longtime admirer, first time...

181
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:55,710
meeting you. Hello.

182
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,879
I feel like I know you both already.

183
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:59,514
I did some light Googling and...

184
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,991
Oh, God, it was sorority rush,

185
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,195
and I had no idea that shaving
a goat's privates

186
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:04,519
was a misdemeanor.

187
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,688
I did not get to that page.

188
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,024
Like I said, welcome.

189
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,844
Uh, when you Google me,
you may have noticed

190
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,009
I have a lot of Miata parts for sale.

191
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:15,321
Not sure what your Miata needs
may or may not be,

192
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,828
but just know... I'm your guy.

193
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,674
Anyway... Serena, I thought
we'd ease you in today,

194
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:21,929
help you get your bearings.

195
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:23,867
Oh, no easing necessary. Let's dig in.

196
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,274
Okay, full disclosure...

197
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,832
I was kind of hoping
we could spend the afternoon

198
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:29,700
brainstorming ideas
for my son's Career Day.

199
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:32,737
Every year, I do a bit
of an interactive presentation.

200
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,473
The kids all look forward to it.
It's super special.

201
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:37,041
Sorry, dude, but maybe
you shouldn't have been

202
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,509
so damn successful.

203
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,144
Your investors want five new podcasts,

204
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,446
which, based on my experience,
really means 15,

205
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,601
which means we should
prepare at least 20,

206
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,925
which means we got work to do.

207
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,947
Yeah.

208
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,215
You're right.

209
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:50,837
Like I always say, "Screw the kids."

210
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:52,041
Let's dive in.

211
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,150
<i>She made us work all day,
but on my way home,</i>

212
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,278
<i>I came up with
a great idea for Career Day.</i>

213
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:58,282
Ben, your father's done it again.

214
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:59,970
Just jiggle the handle, Dad.

215
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,071
No, it's not that.

216
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,573
On the train home, it came to me.

217
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:03,507
Eureka!

218
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:06,043
Career Day: The Podcast.

219
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:09,113
At Ben's School.

220
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,347
- Dad...
- You guessed it.

221
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,150
I'm gonna do a live Career Day podcast

222
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:14,885
where I go around and I interview

223
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:16,353
all the different kids in your class

224
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:18,055
about what they want to be
when they grow up,

225
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:19,523
and everyone's participating.

226
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,958
This guy's doing sound effects,

227
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,560
and this little girl, you know,

228
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:24,595
she's on a banjo or a lute,
and we're jamming.

229
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:27,898
It's like Burning Man
at an elementary school.

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,967
Burning Boy. Learning Man.

231
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,135
I'll have something on the day.

232
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:32,870
- Yeah, t-that's really great, Dad.
- Right.

233
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,940
But, uh, I already asked Mom
to do Career Day.

234
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,641
Mom? Whose Mom?

235
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:39,743
My mom. Your wife?

236
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:41,312
Rooni Schuman?

237
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,847
What's up, guys?

238
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,230
Her?

239
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,444
<i>I was afraid my career
was driving a wedge</i>

240
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:50,812
<i>between Ben and me.</i>

241
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:55,204
<i>And fear makes you see
everyone as the enemy.</i>

242
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:02,476
So... I guess congratulations
are in order.

243
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,594
I had just naively assumed
that Ben would choose me

244
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:09,626
for Career Day,
as he has year after year

245
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:10,863
after precious year.

246
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,662
Yeah, I was kind of surprised
he asked me.

247
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,668
Hey, babe, can you turn
some lights on, please?

248
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:17,357
He's obviously punishing me
for being so busy with work.

249
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,225
I get it. I'm not a fool.

250
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,461
<i>Or</i> he wanted to learn
more about my career

251
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,196
as a public servant.

252
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:24,630
No.

253
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,766
Okay, well, I'm really
looking forward to it.

254
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:29,202
I just wish I was
a little less swamped at work.

255
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,288
- Seriously, could you get a light?
- I want to warn you.

256
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,833
There are certain kids in the class

257
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,544
that can get a little testy
with the parents

258
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:40,302
who have more "inside the box"
jobs, like lawyer.

259
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,949
You know, it's hard to keep
habeas corpus

260
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:45,886
from turning into habeas snore-pus.

261
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,354
- Alex.
- Hmm?

262
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,379
If Career Day is that important to you,

263
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:50,476
you can have it.

264
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:55,761
Ha! No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

265
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:57,166
No. I'm too busy.

266
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,284
I just have to mourn the fact

267
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,597
that my son and I are...
are drifting apart.

268
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,726
Okay? Let it happen.

269
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:03,994
Maybe dust off some records

270
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,800
and crank "Cat's in the Cradle."

271
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,128
Aah!

272
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:10,031
It's that golf ball
from his Rube Goldberg machine.

273
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,646
You know what? I'll get the light.

274
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:12,667
Another reminder of a thing

275
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:15,437
Ben and I don't have in common anymore.

276
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,371
I have an idea!

277
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,951
How do you like these sandwiches?

278
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:20,953
I got them at
a super-fancy sandwich place

279
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:22,888
where you're only allowed
to order in Dutch.

280
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:25,124
You've got the
"vleesliefhebber on plat brood."

281
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:27,326
Uh, it's fine. It's lunch.

282
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,583
Thanks.

283
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:31,030
So, Serena, what'd you do last night?

284
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:32,298
Honestly, last night, I worked

285
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,772
and watched the Rangers game.

286
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:35,751
You're a Rangers fan? Me too.

287
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,119
How 'bout that hat trick?

288
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:38,854
I thought Mark Messier
was back out there.

289
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:41,347
Man, when I was a kid,
Messier was my hero.

290
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:42,878
Mm. Mine was Janet Reno.

291
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:44,794
I was bit of a Jan-nut.

292
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,718
Actually, I took one
of his slap shots right here.

293
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,795
Wait.

294
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,742
You got hit by "The Messiah"?

295
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:51,959
I really did.

296
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,582
I got hit by the messiah, too.

297
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:54,750
At least that's what that minister

298
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:55,884
in that revival tent said

299
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:57,853
before he pushed my face
into the ground.

300
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,621
We have so much in common.

301
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,490
I wish I got hit by a puck.

302
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,658
Best thing that ever happened to me

303
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,864
was getting food poisoning
at a hot dog cart.

304
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,916
They gave me free dogs for a year.

305
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,485
I only got sick two more times.

306
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,087
You know what? The hell
with these fancy sandwiches.

307
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,463
Let's go get some dogs.

308
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:13,690
Oh, you read my mind.

309
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,724
Okay, yeah, no, cool. I'll just be here!

310
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:20,127
<i>Ben's golf ball had given me
the perfect idea</i>

311
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,995
<i>for how to rebuild our bond.</i>

312
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:24,498
Oh, hey, Ben. How are you, pal?

313
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:25,989
I've actually gotten into a little bit

314
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:28,553
of a Rube Goldberg phase myself.

315
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,874
Can I interest you in a glass of soda?

316
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:32,845
Wait! Before you answer!

317
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:39,407
Godspeed, little guy. You got this.

318
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,955
Okay, well, imagine
that had gone down the track,

319
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,714
and then it goes over the dominos.

320
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:49,870
Well, imagine that dropped
the ball in the bucket.

321
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,991
And then string, string, string...

322
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,993
Well, then that triggers the...

323
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:57,094
these apples.

324
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:00,804
Well, I needed more apples
to go in the colander,

325
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:01,820
but you get the idea.

326
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:03,822
And then over at the blower...

327
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,124
Stupid batteries on this thing.

328
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:10,946
Dad, you don't need to keep doing that.

329
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,961
I'm not really
into Rube Goldberg anymore.

330
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,329
Greg and I are inventing
our own languages now.

331
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,493
So... snap, snap, fizzle, blurp.

332
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,460
Fligglestorp!

333
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:26,705
Mom's definitely gonna be mad.

334
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:29,941
<i>At work, I was trying to focus,</i>

335
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,377
<i>but all I could think about
was my crumbling relationship</i>

336
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:35,003
<i>- with my son.</i>
- Al, get this.

337
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:37,557
Just talked to Theo from SoundCloud.

338
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,535
They said they'd host
all the new podcasts for free.

339
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:41,011
We just got to give them a shout-out.

340
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,063
That's great, Ed.

341
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:44,668
I thought you'd be excited.
I've been working this guy for months.

342
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,731
Why don't you go tell
your new best friend Serena?

343
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,157
And while you're at it, maybe
she wants to see that hat trick

344
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,184
that you apparently know how to do

345
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,371
but have never shown me.

346
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,995
Is it just a top hat that flattens?

347
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:55,364
Because, if so, yawn. I've seen it.

348
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,099
What are you talking about?

349
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:59,001
Serena's supposed to be <i>my</i> friend.

350
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,770
We both love podcasts.
We both make podcasts.

351
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,801
What does she even see in you?

352
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,715
You're the only person in this incubator
who still uses a Rolodex.

353
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,877
It's like, what are you, from 19...

354
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:11,319
whatever year it was
that they used those?

355
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:12,943
Whoa, this is starting to feel personal.

356
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,602
Excuse me if I like having
someone in the office

357
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:17,203
who can talk about sports.

358
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:18,447
Between you and Alex,

359
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:20,616
it's all "Les Mis" and dry shampoo.

360
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,727
Well, not everybody
puts a gallon of hair product in

361
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,207
every morning.

362
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,021
You know, Deirdre,
I don't think you deserve

363
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,389
a place in here any longer.

364
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:31,056
Let me just quickly access
your contact info.

365
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,216
Okay, I know you're in here somewhere.

366
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,324
Ah!

367
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,622
Oh!

368
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:48,391
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, you're not gonna</i>

369
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:50,101
<i>believe this, but my boss
is making me go down</i>

370
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:51,249
<i>to the courthouse now.</i>

371
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:53,789
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to make it to Career Day.

372
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,720
Did I also mention
that I hate this place?

373
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:57,788
Really? That's fantastic!

374
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:59,891
- Thank you?
- No, I'm sorry, babe,

375
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,694
but this is exactly
the opportunity I need

376
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:02,894
to fix things with Ben.

377
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,444
I got to do a big gesture.

378
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,984
Honey, I think you're being
a little manic

379
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,352
about this Career Day thing.

380
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,924
You know, I was gonna do
a podcast about his classmates.

381
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:12,041
Instead, I'm gonna do a Ben-ography.

382
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:14,151
What? No. That sounds weird.

383
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:15,469
You know what else sounded weird?

384
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:16,637
"Coming to America."

385
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,272
And that turned out to be a great movie.

386
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:19,874
I might still be able to get down there.

387
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,317
Got to go. Byeee!

388
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,044
Hi, everybody. Sorry I'm late.

389
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:24,745
Dad, what are you doing here?

390
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:27,415
Well, some parents
care more about their career

391
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:30,218
than their kids, but not this guy.

392
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:32,002
I'll take it from here. Thank you.

393
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,534
- Hi, kiddies.
- Oh, man.

394
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:37,924
I'm Alex Schuman, Ben's papa.

395
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:39,726
All right, kids,
well, as some of you may know,

396
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,161
I've recently made
a very big career change.

397
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,065
I used to be in radio,
and now I'm a podcaster.

398
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,496
Does anyone know what a podcast is?

399
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:49,996
It's radio on the Internet.

400
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,972
My mom listens to them,
and they're totally boring.

401
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:55,914
Oh, well...

402
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,354
I guess I don't need this card.

403
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:00,290
Nailed this one, too.

404
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:04,194
Here we go. And what is
podcasting most like?

405
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:06,539
Uh... that was you, again.

406
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:10,170
Anyway, because of that change,
I've had a little less time

407
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,439
to be with the very important
people in my life,

408
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:15,776
so we are gonna do
a live podcast right here,

409
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:18,679
and the subject is gonna be
my best friend,

410
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,180
Ben Schuman.

411
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,683
I call it a Ben-ography.

412
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:24,418
- What?
- Yeah, what?

413
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:26,253
Can a man...

414
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,789
Excuse me, young man.
I didn't catch your name.

415
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:30,824
- Greg.
- Oh, Greg!

416
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:32,292
Dad, what are you doing?

417
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:33,694
I'm so glad you asked.

418
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:35,562
On with the Ben-ography.

419
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:37,931
My relationship
with your favorite madman

420
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,770
began 12 years ago
when he came into my life

421
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:44,805
naked and afraid as a bouncing baby boy.

422
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:49,376
Dad, I'm naked in that!

423
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:50,844
Everybody has a tushy, Ben.

424
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,145
- Even Mr. Durham.
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,415
But, fine, if it makes you
uncomfortable,

426
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:56,883
I'll skip to my next thing.

427
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:59,386
Here's Ben starring
in his first-grade production

428
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:00,620
of "Little Orphan Annie."

429
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:01,788
Now, I know what you're thinking.

430
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,890
Dad, this is humiliating.
I'm out of here.

431
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:06,088
Wait! Ben! Wha...

432
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,518
Ben, where are you going? Ben?!

433
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:13,056
Dude, what did you do in there?

434
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,857
Never seen kids
more excited to listen to

435
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,894
a presentation on a career
in Orthodontics.

436
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,806
In retrospect, bringing
a nude photo of a minor

437
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,672
into a classroom was probably a misstep.

438
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:25,011
It's definitely different
than what I had planned.

439
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:27,154
I was gonna have them ask me
what the truth was,

440
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,224
and then I was scream at them,
"You can't handle the truth!"

441
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:31,726
Kind of looking forward to that
for weeks.

442
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:32,994
Yeah, they would have loved that.

443
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,531
You know what I've been thinking about?

444
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,495
When I saw those crazy numbers

445
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:40,909
and Sacca called to offer us more money,

446
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:45,367
I mean, that was beyond
my wildest expectations.

447
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:48,236
But now that it's actually happened,

448
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:50,105
I kind of wish it hadn't.

449
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:53,308
- Mo' money, mo' problems.
- True dat.

450
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:57,014
I mean, my life is so crazy right now.

451
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,050
Everyone's arguing at work.

452
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:01,339
I just publicly humiliated Ben.

453
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,542
The only time I ever see you
is when you're picking me up

454
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,530
off the ground,
either emotionally or literally.

455
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, on the bright side,
you do fall a lot,

456
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,435
both emotionally and literally.

457
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,666
What if I were to tell Sacca

458
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:16,673
that we're not ready to expand yet?

459
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,441
Would you think I was a coward?

460
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,012
For choosing your family
and friends over your career?

461
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,019
I'd say that's pretty brave.

462
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,973
Dr. Gibbs!

463
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:31,227
Dr. Gibbs! Dr. Gibbs!

464
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:33,177
Whoa, what a rush!

465
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,713
Those kids were re-ceptive!

466
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,703
Time for an encore.

467
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,788
- Dr. Gibbs!
- You thought I was done?!

468
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,834
Think again, ya little bastards!

469
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:46,241
- Dr. Gibbs!
- He's so passionate about teeth.

470
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:48,617
Hey, can I talk to you?

471
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:50,686
Really? It's happening.

472
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:52,888
What is the deal with these guys?

473
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,089
What? What guys?

474
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:55,123
Alex and Eddie.

475
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:57,064
Alex is never here, and Eddie...

476
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:58,275
I mean, is that guy serious

477
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,333
with his Rolodex and his pinky ring?

478
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,395
Yeah, he claims that ring
has special powers.

479
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:03,689
I guess I can give Alex a pass

480
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:04,723
because he's obviously talented,

481
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,725
but Eddie's not a podcast person.

482
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,527
I'm just not sure that I want
to let some guy's cousin

483
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,405
jeopardize the prime of my career.

484
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,319
Plus, I have no need for Miata parts.

485
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,065
Nobody does. That's the problem.

486
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,399
Look, I get it.

487
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,835
I used to think that Eddie was
a lunkhead gumming up the works,

488
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,537
but he's really good at his job.

489
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,138
Plus, he teaches me old-timey sayings

490
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,940
like "lunkhead"
and "gumming up the works."

491
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,409
He's 1/3 of this company.
We couldn't do it without him.

492
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,812
And I wouldn't want to. He's my friend.

493
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,960
Well, your friend is not qualified.

494
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:32,421
I'm sorry, but he's got to go.

495
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,179
Well, maybe you're unqualified
and you got to go.

496
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,241
Excuse me?

497
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:37,773
If you can't recognize the value

498
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:39,445
that Eddie brings to this company,

499
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:42,078
then that makes me think that
you're not good at<i> your</i> job.

500
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,840
Maybe you need to take
the prime of your career

501
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,009
and blow it out your French horn!

502
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,289
I'm sorry. Are you... firing me?

503
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:49,998
- I am!
- Can you do that?

504
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,612
I'm not sure!

505
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,914
She can if another partner
agrees with her.

506
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:55,716
Wow. Okay.

507
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:58,848
Well, ultimately, it's up to Alex,
I'm sorry to say.

508
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:01,108
Oh, good. You guys are all here.

509
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,711
Serena, I am so sorry,

510
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,317
but I don't think I'm gonna take
Chris Sacca's money.

511
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:07,878
I just don't think we're ready
to expand that fast.

512
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,546
Is that okay with you guys?

513
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:10,781
Very okay.

514
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,950
Uh, does a goat quiver
when you shave its privates?

515
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,085
Sorry, Serena.

516
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,067
It's fine.

517
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:18,191
Honestly, I'll have another job
in like two minutes.

518
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,260
Good job. We did it.

519
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:24,862
Back to idle.

520
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,575
<i>When I got home that night,</i>

521
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:28,977
<i>Soraya said she was taking us out</i>

522
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,087
<i>to celebrate my "job thing."</i>

523
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:33,040
<i>Plus I still had to make things
right with Ben.</i>

524
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:35,532
Mom. Soraya.

525
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:38,366
Person who showed my whole class
my butt cheeks.

526
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,140
You weren't naked in every picture, Ben.

527
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,075
In some, you were wearing
your Little Orphan Annie dress.

528
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:45,244
Mm. You're right.
I should be apologizing to<i> you.</i>

529
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,068
Guys, I'm very excited you
wanted to go to dinner tonight,

530
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:49,137
but unfortunately, there's
nothing really to celebrate.

531
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:50,939
I decided it isn't worth
having a big company

532
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,741
if you all feel neglected.

533
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:54,709
Ben didn't even invite me
to his Career Day this year.

534
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:56,244
Wait, that's why you had a meltdown

535
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:57,679
in front of my whole class?

536
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,781
Dad, I don't feel neglected at all.

537
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,053
The only reason I didn't
invite you to Career Day

538
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,179
was because I didn't want
to make you feel like

539
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:07,012
you had to go when you had
so much else going on.

540
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,780
Really?

541
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,782
But, bud, I will always
have time for you.

542
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,450
But didn't you also invite me

543
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,807
because you were a little bit
interested in my career?

544
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,573
- No.
- Okay.

545
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:17,954
Look, Mom, your job's cool,

546
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:20,309
but Dad's is amazing.

547
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,159
He's building something
that's all his own.

548
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,095
That's what I want to do, too.

549
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:28,898
Me too. That's why Emma and I
opened a lemonade stand.

550
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,902
Sweetie, you started your own business?

551
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,169
Oh, we didn't order those.

552
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,471
She did.

553
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,501
It's okay, Dad. Business is booming.

554
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:41,322
Well, don't worry.
I brought my earnings, too.

555
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,077
- Good.
- What do you think, Al?

556
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:46,053
Think the kids might be ready
for you to go for it.

557
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:47,944
- Come on, Dad.
- You could be huge!

558
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:51,100
Well... there's really only one way

559
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:52,646
I'd be able to do it.

560
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:56,872
What?

561
00:19:58,699 --> 00:19:59,742
What?

562
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,881
Good morning, you two.

563
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,606
What's all this stuff? A garage sale?

564
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:08,751
How much for the ladder?

565
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,052
I've been having second thoughts

566
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,755
about my second thoughts
about expanding the business.

567
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:14,457
I mean, we've worked so hard,

568
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,926
and our goal was always to expand.

569
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:18,360
Maybe we should give it a try.

570
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:19,595
You know me, I'm all for it,

571
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,581
but Serena was Sacca's choice.

572
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:22,785
He's not gonna give us the money

573
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,633
unless we get someone else
he trusts in here

574
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:26,168
<i>and</i> someone we trust.

575
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,870
Not sure if that person exists.

576
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:29,705
But, Eddie, what if she does?

577
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,707
May I draw your attention to my balls?

578
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,923
Ta-da!

579
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:49,772
For the record, I just wanted
to walk through the door.

580
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,264
You guys, it worked!

581
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,062
Why do you sound so surprised?

582
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,396
Way to go, Dad.

583
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:55,898
Wait a second. You're gonna
come work with us?

584
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,266
If you'll have me.

585
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:59,768
Really? Oh, my gosh!

586
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:02,438
We are gonna become best friends!

587
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,539
- Boop!
- Ooh.

588
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,225
Wow. You just booped me.

589
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,285
Yeah, we'll talk about that later.

590
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,386
Okay.

591
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:09,636
Isn't this exciting? She quit her job!

592
00:21:10,654 --> 00:21:13,176
<i>Like I said, starting
your own company is hard,</i>

593
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,178
<i>but the best part is
that you create a new family.</i>

594
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:18,119
<i>The problem is,
sometimes you have to choose</i>

595
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,877
<i>one family over the other.</i>

596
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,838
<i>Not anymore.</i>

597
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:30,025

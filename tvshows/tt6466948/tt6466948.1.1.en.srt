1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,046
Look, I've invested
in Twitter, Uber, Instagram.

2
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:05,382
Why should I invest
in your podcast company?

3
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,479
Well, first of all, it's not
just<i> any</i> podcast company.

4
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:09,981
It's the Cadillac of podcast companies.

5
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,150
Do people still use "Cadillac"
as a reference?

6
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:14,210
- Mnh-mnh.
- Sorry. It's, uh... the Maybach,

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,837
uh... the Khaleesi,
t-the Leonardo DiCaprio.

8
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:20,106
Wow. Is your dad always this nervous?

9
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:22,399
- It's 'cause you're rich.
- Soraya!

10
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,700
I'm sorry, again, about her.

11
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:25,435
We had a little childcare dilemma.

12
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:27,237
You know, I think I could
explain the money part better

13
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,139
if I fire up the old pitch deck.

14
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:30,640
Um, now, uh...

15
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:31,774
I have a graph here.

16
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:32,886
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry!

17
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:34,311
I'm just so sorry.

18
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,113
I just never really fully
got a chance to...

19
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,754
to set all this up.

20
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:38,965
Uh, so many wires.

21
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,434
This guy. Who's this guy?

22
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:42,402
Look, Alex, listen,
if I were calling an Uber

23
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:44,037
and it said it was gonna be here
in two minutes

24
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:45,372
and that's all the time you had...

25
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:47,541
who are you and what are you doing?

26
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:48,583
Go.

27
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:50,477
<i>One month ago, I decided, at 37,</i>

28
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,146
<i>with a wife and two kids,
now would be a good time</i>

29
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,382
<i>to quit my job
and start my own business.</i>

30
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,217
<i>Who am I and what am I doing?</i>

31
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:00,587
<i>My name's Alex Schuman,
and I'm ruining my life.</i>

_

34
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,820
- Now, who said that?
- Dad.

35
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,151
- And what did he say?
- Dad!

36
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:11,580
He said what? I'm not...
I didn't hear you.

37
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:13,115
- Dad!
- Ben.

38
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,518
Let Daddy finish
his super-important work call.

39
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,119
I just thought
he'd be interested to know

40
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,255
that I met this girl on the Internet.

41
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,090
At least, I<i> think</i> she's a girl.

42
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,291
Her name's Steven,

43
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:24,326
and she wants to meet
in a van in the woods.

44
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,861
Ha ha. I can hear you.

45
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,363
Look, I got to go.
They want me off the phone.

46
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:28,831
All right. I'll see you in a bit.

47
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,866
Sorry. I'm just, uh,
working on this story

48
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,935
about this alleged murderer,
Wesley Harman.

49
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:34,537
But Mommy's right... no more work talk.

50
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,772
This is morning family time.

51
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:38,941
I'm gonna puke up my breakfast.

52
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,806
All right, what's up? I'm sorry.
You have all my attention. Go.

53
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,993
Do you want to see a new
illusion I've been working on?

54
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:45,927
Sure.

55
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:47,760
Awesome. Let me get my hamster.

56
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,295
<i>Our</i> hamster!

57
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:51,264
How do we feel
about this whole magic thing?

58
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:52,965
Middle-school kids can be so mean.

59
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,201
All I know is,
David Blaine is pretty hot.

60
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:56,969
Yeah, but for every David
Blaine, there's a Carrot Top.

61
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:58,506
- I hate carrots.
- Me too.

62
00:01:58,607 --> 00:01:59,939
All right.

63
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,808
Now... pay very careful attention.

64
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,444
As you can see, Todd is in the box.

65
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,246
Oh. Morning, Todd.

66
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,448
By the way, I'm doing a much
more elaborate version of this

67
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,916
for the school talent show.

68
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:12,785
In front of the whole school?

69
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:14,754
Whoa, whoa! What is that hand gesture?

70
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:16,055
Look in the box.

71
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,391
I think you'll find that Todd's gone.

72
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,959
- No.
- No, sweetie.

73
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:21,186
- He's still there.
- Todd's right there, man.

74
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,170
- Fail.
- Really?

75
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:23,363
Yeah.

76
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:25,298
What the heck, Todd?

77
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,767
- We talked about this.
- I have to get this. Don't be mad at me.

78
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:29,402
He's arguing with Todd.
I promise, it'll be quick.

79
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,803
- What do you mean, you don't like the trick?
- Hello?

80
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,405
- It's a classic!
- He's in?!

81
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:33,639
Yes!

82
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:34,640
Harman's in!

83
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:35,908
- The murderer?
- Alleged.

84
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,143
I got to go. Love you all!

85
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,911
Love you. Good luck!

86
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,279
<i>For the past 16 years,</i>

87
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,415
<i>I've worked at a radio show
called "Cheer Up!"</i>

88
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:44,617
<i>It was like NPR on Prozac.</i>

89
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:47,687
I got the Harman story!

90
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:49,622
<i>We'd been doing
the same feel-good stories</i>

91
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:52,191
<i>my whole career,
and lately, I'd been yearning</i>

92
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:54,260
<i>to do something different...
something that mattered.</i>

93
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:56,162
<i>And so I walked into that pitch meeting</i>

94
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:58,264
<i>with what I knew would be
a game-changing story.</i>

95
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:01,934
And it... it... it's
a portrait<i> and</i> a reprimand,

96
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:04,837
not just of the justice system...

97
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,972
but of society itself.

98
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:11,777
<i>But except for my producer,
Deirdre, nobody else liked it.</i>

99
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,446
I appreciate your passion, Alex,

100
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,047
but the show's called "Cheer Up!"

101
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,717
not "I Wanna Hang Myself."

102
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,045
<i>And I don't know why,
but in that moment,</i>

103
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,380
<i>something in me just snapped.</i>

104
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:27,514
You know what, you know what...

105
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,716
I-I-I-I-I can't do this anymore, okay?

106
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,885
I-I can't do one more feel-good piece

107
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:34,221
about child-prodigy pianists

108
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,323
or gorillas who know sign language.

109
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,492
How many gorillas know
sign language at this point?

110
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,326
It feels like all, frankly.
All gorillas!

111
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,597
Sorry, Akira.

112
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,766
I-I don't want to cheer people up.

113
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:48,201
I want to engage their minds
and open their eyes

114
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:49,903
to what's happening in the world.

115
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:53,039
And I know I'm not the only one
who feels this way, okay?

116
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:56,042
I'm gonna go somewhere
where I can tell those stories.

117
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,711
Now, who's coming with me?

118
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,249
- You quit your job?!
- Yes.

119
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,284
But what if I...
and this is one of the reasons

120
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:06,086
why I wanted to take you
to dinner tonight...

121
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,522
start my own podcast company?

122
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:12,926
Why are you laughing?

123
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:14,461
Because you're kidding.

124
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,596
You're not kidding? Oh, God.

125
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:18,532
Rooni, I've worked my whole life
for other people.

126
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,133
I want to do something
I can be proud of.

127
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:21,468
I want something that's mine.

128
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,236
- Buy a boat.
- We can't afford a boat.

129
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:24,438
Buy a kayak.

130
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,939
I<i> would</i> love a kayak.

131
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,608
Alex, you're an amazing
storyteller, but...

132
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,610
please don't take this the wrong way...

133
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,412
you're not good at anything else.

134
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:35,215
I know. That's why I'm gonna ask
Eddie to be my partner.

135
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,917
Second cousin Eddie?

136
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,618
Does he even know what a podcast is?

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,921
I'm not sure.
But Eddie can sell anything.

138
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:42,923
I really think we'd be a good
yin/yang for each other.

139
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,759
He could yang me. And sometimes,
I need to be yanged.

140
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:46,860
You do like a good yanging.

141
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,094
But no, babe,

142
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:50,497
you need someone who knows
something about podcasting.

143
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,133
I know, which is why I'm also
gonna ask...

144
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,434
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.

145
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:56,069
Deirdre.

146
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,905
Tell me you're not mumbling "Deirdre"!

147
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,574
I've worked with like 50 producers.

148
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,641
She's the best by a mile.

149
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:02,976
Alex, she's in love with you!

150
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:04,644
Oh, I don't know about that.

151
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:06,346
It's more of an unhealthy obsession.

152
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:08,415
I know what this is really about,

153
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,384
and I want you to know,
I am not gonna touch the 401(K).

154
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,587
It would never occur to me

155
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,956
that you would even<i> think</i> about
touching the 401(K).

156
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:17,525
Again, not going to.

157
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:19,226
Rooni, this is my moment.

158
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,294
This industry's about to explode,

159
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:24,030
and if it does,
it could change the whole world.

160
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:25,966
Let's be a part of that.

161
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,168
I want to change the world. Don't you?

162
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,936
Damn it.

163
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,105
You know I'm a sucker
for Change the World Alex.

164
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,874
I didn't want to play
the change-the-world card,

165
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,842
but you left me with no other option.

166
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:37,711
Fine!

167
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,312
Go change the world!

168
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:40,680
Love you.

169
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:43,683
<i>So, like Jobs and Zuckerberg before me,</i>

170
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:45,819
<i>I got my dream team together.</i>

171
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:48,989
Uh, Deirdre, do you think maybe
you could sit across from me?

172
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,024
I'm so sorry... I didn't realize
we were physically

173
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,459
- Yeah, well...
- next to each other.

174
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,160
Aah!

175
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,496
Yeah, 'cause there's more room over
here, actually, so that's good.

176
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,199
So, what, you hired a groupie?

177
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,301
Stop it. Let me make
the formal introductions.

178
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,004
Deirdre Riordan,
meet my cousin Eddie LaGuzza,

179
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,972
the most in-demand salesman in town.

180
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,041
If he's so in-demand,
why is he in a coffee shop

181
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:09,309
at 3:00 on a Tuesday?

182
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,379
Because I was just dying
to spend 8 bucks on an espresso.

183
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,914
This friggin' place.

184
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:15,715
Who the hell is she?

185
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,884
Uh, Ed, did you have a chance
to come up with a business plan?

186
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,886
Yes. I ran some preliminary numbers,

187
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:22,389
and the good news is,
seems like all we really need

188
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,724
is a solid mic and some chairs.

189
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,892
Now, I have some chairs.

190
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,594
I-I-I'm sorry.

191
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:30,830
It's clear that you have no idea
what Alex does.

192
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,567
He makes highly produced,
highly edited pieces.

193
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,536
They require equipment and staff
and a travel budget

194
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:39,105
and just a li'l bit
of Alex's special sauce.

195
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:40,574
But you don't need to worry about that,

196
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,509
'cause it's<i> my</i> job
to get that out of him.

197
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,102
You say filthy things
without realizing it.

198
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,280
I like you.

199
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:48,882
I think what Deirdre's
trying to say, Eddie,

200
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:51,017
is the type of shows I want
to do cost a lot of money.

201
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,285
So, why don't we make a list

202
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,787
of every rich person that we know?

203
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,188
<i>Eddie had nothing.</i>

204
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,600
<i>Deirdre had a particularly
lovely picture of me.</i>

205
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:58,992
<i>I love the way she handled my nose.</i>

206
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:00,451
<i>And all I could think of
was a billionaire</i>

207
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,728
<i>I once interviewed.</i>

208
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,530
<i>But for our company
to be taken seriously,</i>

209
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,398
<i>we needed an office
that wasn't a coffee shop.</i>

210
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
<i>When my co-founders and I
finally found one</i>

211
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:09,235
<i>that was cheap enough,
I wanted Rooni to see it</i>

212
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,437
<i>before we signed the lease.</i>

213
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:12,205
Welcome to the nerd factory.

214
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,707
It's an incubator, babe.

215
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,875
Everyone here has ideas
they're developing.

216
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,108
Those guys are designing a robot

217
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,280
- that rocks a baby to sleep.
- Heads up!

218
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,983
Coming along, fellas.

219
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,151
Those ladies made a jacket
you put on cats

220
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,120
to make them hypoallergenic.

221
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:30,256
These guys are trying to create
a professional beer pong league.

222
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,826
Hey, they're kind of cute, huh?

223
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,761
Oh, I prefer my men more intellectual,

224
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:36,896
with larger noses.

225
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,431
So? What do you think?

226
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,534
I think it's amazing, babe.
I'm so proud of you.

227
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:42,736
Listen, I got to get to court.

228
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,671
- I'll see you tonight, okay?
- I love you.

229
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,773
Al, we got a little problem.

230
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,742
Guy wants three months in advance.

231
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,745
I don't have $10,000...
unless I dip into the 401(K),

232
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,446
which I promised Rooni I wouldn't do.

233
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,348
Yeah,<i> but</i> what if there was a world

234
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,916
where you didn't tell Rooni?

235
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,085
- I tell Rooni everything.
- Yeah, in<i> this</i> world.

236
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,654
Let's go to that other world.

237
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:02,689
Look, I believe in this company.

238
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,524
That's why I'm putting
everything I have into it.

239
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:06,526
- You don't have anything.
- Yeah, but it's all in there.

240
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:10,096
I need an answer, fellas.
I got Pilates at noon.

241
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,333
We're gonna be huge, Al. I know this.

242
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:17,829
We're in.

243
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,336
<i>A week had gone by,</i>

244
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:24,471
<i>and I still hadn't told Rooni
I'd dipped into our 401(K).</i>

245
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,652
<i>Fortunately, I was doing a
decent job of hiding my guilt.</i>

246
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:32,863
Oh. Sorry, guys.

247
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm just trying to make sure
it's nice and lean.

248
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,034
Guys, Daddy's a little nervous

249
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:38,869
because he's interviewing
a murderer tomorrow

250
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,371
for his big investor pitch.

251
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:42,907
"Alleged," and I am not that nervous.

252
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,375
Is it gonna be on the radio?

253
00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:46,077
TV's better. I need pictures.

254
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,645
Ohh! My own daughter.

255
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:50,181
You don't need pictures.
Are you kidding me?

256
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:52,550
Here. I'll tell you what.
Close your eyes for a second.

257
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:56,520
Now imagine hearing
a really creepy old guy's voice.

258
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:58,856
"My name is Wesley Harman,

259
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,358
and I didn't do it!"

260
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,392
Didn't do what?

261
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:03,394
Oh! See, Daddy's got you listening now.

262
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,229
Now we hear a woman's voice.

263
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:06,931
She says she's Harman's neighbor.

264
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:08,699
"Something was always off with him."

265
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,203
"Always alone on his family's estate.

266
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,739
And when kids would come
and take his apples,

267
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:16,006
you know what he would do?

268
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,908
He'd chase them off with a shotgun."

269
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,211
Are you sure this story's
appropriate for children?

270
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:21,812
Okay, calm down, Grandma.

271
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:25,249
Then, we hear a
policeman's voice on a CB radio.

272
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,918
"Uh, dispatch, we got two murdered kids

273
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,320
on the Harman property."

274
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:31,355
Yeah, actually, Al,
where are you going with this?

275
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,491
- I like it.
- Me too. Then...

276
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:36,260
"We now go to Bob Jenkins,
reporting live at the scene."

277
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:39,964
"Uh, the children both had
a rare poison in their stomachs

278
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,099
and... apples."

279
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:44,935
- Hold that for a second.
- Ugh!

280
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,637
So, Harman's arrested
and let out on bail.

281
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,506
Now we're in a science lab...

282
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:54,645
...where a scientist tells us
about this rare poison.

283
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,147
The one Harman put on the apples?

284
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:58,449
The one<i> someone</i> put on the apples.

285
00:09:58,551 --> 00:09:59,884
The scientist says...

286
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:01,485
"It's very hard to make.

287
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:04,789
Uh, you need seeds from
the Croatian Rhine Poppy...

288
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,258
virtually nonexistent in the U.S."

289
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,264
Now we hear this.
Make this noise with me.

290
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,167
The wind blowing through a field.

291
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,032
A knock on a heavy door.

292
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,369
And a voice we've heard before.

293
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:23,138
"Can I help you?"

294
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,707
- Who is it?
- Harman's brother, Max.

295
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:29,377
And the wind we're hearing
is blowing through a giant field

296
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,217
of Croatian Rhine Poppies
right in Max Harman's backyard!

297
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:36,618
So, Wesley Harman's innocent?

298
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,553
I believe that Max framed Wesley

299
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,355
to cut him out of the family fortune.

300
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:43,024
And I want to tell his story
to the world...

301
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,559
and lots of other stories, too.

302
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:47,195
And once in a while, sometimes,

303
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,064
they might even change someone's life.

304
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,298
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

305
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,733
"Whoa," indeed.

306
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:54,402
See? You don't need pictures, okay?

307
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:55,737
Okay.

308
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,317
Now, go watch TV while we finish dinner.

309
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,346
You look like you're
very attracted to me right now.

310
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,781
- Little bit.
- Well, all those characters

311
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:08,149
are gonna try and have sex with you.

312
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,018
Well, we'll just see how that goes.

313
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,977
I hope one of them wins.

314
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:15,724
Guys, I need you to calm me down.

315
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,025
Harman's skittish.

316
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,160
What if he freaks out
when he sees this place.

317
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,829
Al, he's gonna love this joint.

318
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,898
This is a completely normal workplace.

319
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,232
- Ohh!
- Heads up!

320
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,768
Dee! Now is no time for resting.

321
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,236
Harman could be here any second.

322
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:29,404
I think he's here.

323
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:31,640
Mr. Harman!

324
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,508
Hi. I'm Alex Schuman.

325
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,076
It's so nice to finally meet you.

326
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,678
I thought we were meeting
in your office.

327
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,280
This looks like an Urban Outfitters.

328
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:40,682
Oh, no, no, this place is great.
I promise you.

329
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,551
And if there's anything I can do
to relax you...

330
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:44,019
- Is that a cat?!
- Oh.

331
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,754
- I'm quite allergic!
- Okay.

332
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:48,723
Well, now, sir, you are in luck.

333
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,426
The Sneeze Jacket uses
revolutionary technology

334
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:55,263
that makes felines 100% hypoallergenic.

335
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,765
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,134
I love cats, but I haven't been able

337
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,202
to touch one since I was a little boy.

338
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,804
Come with me!

339
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:05,307
People like you are the reason

340
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,642
I've dedicated my life to this start-up.

341
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:08,877
- Here. Have a seat.
- Okay.

342
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,713
And meet Mr. Tender-Puss.

343
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,214
Oh!

344
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,917
Mr. Tender-Puss. Hi.

345
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,285
This is amazing, dude.

346
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:19,087
That cat is totally calming him down.

347
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:21,957
This is it, cuz.
Your dream's about to come true.

348
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,925
Should we hug?
I feel like maybe we should hug.

349
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:26,461
Okay, quick one... with back taps.

350
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,266
Oh, my God!

351
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,601
That's not good.

352
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:34,269
What a wonderful jacket!

353
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:37,005
It looks so handsome
on your little body.

354
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,407
Oh, my God. M-Mr. Harman?

355
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,277
I feel so happy.

356
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,412
But also...

357
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,481
sleepy.

358
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,627
Oh, boy!

359
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:50,580
<i>With Harman in the hospital,</i>

360
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:51,838
<i>I was pretty sure starting a company</i>

361
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,554
<i>had been the biggest mistake of my...</i>

362
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:54,784
<i>Oh, no.</i>

363
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,185
<i>Magic.</i>

364
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:59,109
Hey, buddy.

365
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,223
What you doing?

366
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:01,521
Getting ready for the talent show.

367
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:03,690
- Want to see?
- Uh, sure.

368
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,426
It's like a... glorious ballet.

369
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:08,862
Listen, did I ever tell you
that in high school,

370
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:10,697
I was in the AV club?

371
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,799
We'd go around setting up VCRs,

372
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,312
and I thought I was so cool
at the time, but...

373
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:17,882
What's a VCR?

374
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:21,585
Oh. That was...
That was back there, huh?

375
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,054
I just mean,
with the talent show, man, may...

376
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:27,257
maybe think about just flying
under the radar a little bit.

377
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:30,961
T-That's what I did,
and I-I got pretty good at it.

378
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:32,429
You know what? That's a good idea.

379
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,765
- Maybe I'll go a different way.
- Really?

380
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,834
Dad, we are totally on the same page.

381
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:38,168
Okay. Great.

382
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,354
Did you brush your teeth?

383
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:58,689
This<i> is</i> how I brush my teeth.

384
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:05,629
Oh, dramatic sigh.

385
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:08,265
I want to talk about it, babe.
I do. I just need one sec.

386
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:12,603
Okay, I guess we're talking
about it<i> now.</i>

387
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,371
Look, babe, I know you lost

388
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:16,139
- your murderer today.
- Alleged.

389
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:18,275
Just tell the investor
that you're gonna think

390
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:20,811
of millions of other shows,
'cause you are.

391
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:22,512
You're a very persuasive man.

392
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:24,147
I knew that from the moment I met you.

393
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,150
You mean when I threw up on your shoes?

394
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:29,720
No, after that,
when you popped an Altoid

395
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:31,221
and went right back to hitting on me.

396
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,291
And, look, worst-case scenario...

397
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,760
even if this doesn't work,
we're gonna be okay.

398
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,563
Al?

399
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,798
We<i> are</i> gonna be okay, right?

400
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,637
Tell me you didn't touch the 401(K).

401
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:48,839
- Rooni, calm face.
- I don't want to do calm face!

402
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:50,674
Wait. Babe, I can explain what happened.

403
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:52,476
- Rooni! Rooni!
- No, you know what?

404
00:14:52,578 --> 00:14:53,977
This last month has been hard.

405
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,046
I have been picking up cases
to make more money,

406
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,315
racing home for the kids
because Rosalba claims,

407
00:14:58,417 --> 00:14:59,917
"Only the devil is up after 7:00,"

408
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,019
and I have tried not to complain

409
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:04,154
because I really want you
to have your shot.

410
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,256
But you know what would have
been nice in return?

411
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,658
Not spending the 401(K)?

412
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,694
Not lying to the person who's
supposed to be your best friend.

413
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:17,834
<i>Well, if the night before
wasn't bad enough,</i>

414
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:20,270
<i>the morning of the biggest day
of my life was even worse.</i>

415
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:21,738
Rosalba is dead to me.

416
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,607
- She has a tummy ache.
- No, she didn't call in sick.

417
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,208
She called in "old," which I don't think

418
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,944
you're even allowed to do.

419
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:28,779
<i>So, here we are, back where we started.</i>

420
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,747
<i>And, as you can see, I'm nailing it.</i>

421
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,582
Look, my plane's waiting for me
at Teterboro.

422
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:35,118
So when I'm on the fence
about something like this,

423
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,586
what I like to ask is,

424
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:39,423
"Why are<i> you</i> gonna succeed
when others will fail?"

425
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:42,025
I like to call it
a company's unfair advantage.

426
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:43,026
So what's yours?

427
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:44,728
<i>Unfair advantage?</i>

428
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,263
<i>I was ready for a lot of questions,</i>

429
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:47,898
<i>but this was not one of them.</i>

430
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,700
<i>So instead, I did the only logical thing</i>

431
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:51,501
<i>someone in my position would do.</i>

432
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,120
Well, I have<i> no</i> idea what that was.

433
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:57,441
It's better with a hamster.

434
00:15:57,543 --> 00:15:59,910
Look, bro, I got to go. Till next time.

435
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:01,278
Goodbye, tiny friend.

436
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,546
Peace out!

437
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:03,647
Your smoothie, ma'am.

438
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:05,148
Ooh! Thank you.

439
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,550
You ordered a smoothie?

440
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,352

But in my defense,
none of those are the notes.

- Not one.
- I think it's beautiful.

455

better to say "I told you so,"

go right ahead, 'cause nothing could

possibly make me feel worse.

461
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:03,021
Next up... Ben Schuman's
Magical World of Illusion!

462
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,689
I stand corrected.

463
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,526
Greetings, mortals!

464
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,194
He told me he wasn't gonna do this.

465
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:16,634
Prepare to be transported
to a magical land of wonder...

466
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,670
and illusion.

467
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,440
Loser!

468
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,510
Now I need a volunteer.

469
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,944
What about you?

470
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,780
Come on. Don't be shy.

471
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,381
Let's give her some encouragement, yeah?

472
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:31,254
Yeah.

473
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,889
Yes, very nice.
Big round of applause for, um...

474
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,057
Sorry. What's your name?

475
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,026
- Chloe.
- Chloe, everyone!

476
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,394
Chloe!

477
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,662
We're gonna have to move.

478
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,331
All right, now, in you go, Chloe.

479
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,033
All right. Perfect.

480
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,301
You comfy?

481
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,373
And now comes the fun part...

482
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:59,177
real... steel... swords!

483
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,545
Where the hell did he get swords?

484
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,546
I have no idea.

485
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,414
And now, dear Chloe,

486
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:08,820
I am about to transport you
to a land of wonder.

487
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,388
Oh, my God!

488
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,356
Uh, uh, wha... No, no, no, no, no!

489
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,991
No, no, no, Chloe! I'm so sorry, Chloe!

490
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,327
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Uh, uh...

491
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,763
Chloe?! Chloe?!

492
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,501
Well, that's strange.

493
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,536
- Oh, my God!
- Oh...

494
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,772
Chloe?

495
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,341
Yeah!

496
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,342
Whoo!

497
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,143
That was amazing!

498
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,848
Yeah! That's my son!

499
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,517
That's my son!

500
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,919
- Dude, that was awesome!
- Ben, that was incredible!

501
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,221
- Oh, my God!
- Thank you.

502
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,223
- That was so amazing!
- Thanks.

503
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,058
I thought you said you were
gonna go a different way.

504
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,226
I did.

505
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,461
Until today, Chloe was my assistant.

506
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,029
When you said, "Fly under the radar,"

507
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,598
I figured you meant
plant her in the audience

508
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,932
as a reluctant volunteer.

509
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,635
That's<i> exactly</i> what I meant.

510
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,404
You nailed it. You nailed it.

511
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,573
You know, I-I saw some kids
give some mean looks,

512
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,108
but you just kept going.

513
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,309
That was so brave, Ben.

514
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,911
People who think magic is lame

515
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,946
just haven't seen
the right person do it yet.

516
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,215
I know how to make magic cool.

517
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,450
It's like you.

518
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,986
- <i>Nobody</i> thinks radio is cool...
- Mm...

519
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,156
...but when<i> you</i> do it, it's amazing.

520
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,660
What? What did I say?

521
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,096
Exactly what I needed to hear.

522
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,632
Everybody... in the van!

523
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,634
We've got a plane to catch.

524
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,741
Hold on!

525
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,517
- Mr. Sacca, wait!
- Schuman?

526
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,985
How the hell did you get out here?

527
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,954
I... may have driven through
a security gate,

528
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,689
but I had to tell you something.

529
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,859
You asked me earlier... what's
my company's unfair advantage?

530
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,527
Well, it's me.

531
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,362
What I do is really, really hard,

532
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,198
and no one does it better than I do.

533
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,166
So if you don't want in, that's fine.

534
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,801
I will find someone who does,

535
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:07,638
and I will make them very, very rich.

536
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,440
Much richer than this.

537
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,443
All right!

538
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,478
That's what I've been
looking for from you, man!

539
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,713
Some fire!

540
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,448
I mean, driving up here like this,

541
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,383
- busting through that gate...
- I know!

542
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,119
...which those guys are
definitely gonna arrest you for.

543
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,655
That's passion.

544
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,390
That's what it takes to build a company.

545
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,093
But before I go all-in,
I still got to know,

546
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,494
what's the first show about?

547
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:34,665
<i>Okay, it was time to shine,
but my mind went blank.</i>

548
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,400
It should be this.

549
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,171
Yes! Yes! This is the show.

550
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,706
This is the first show.

551
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:45,142
It... It... It's a show
about a-a guy like me

552
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,211
with a family like them.

553
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,047
Yeah, a guy who has no business
starting his own business,

554
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,350
but he's going for it anyway.

555
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,085
And he'll make lots of mistakes.

556
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,186
He'll lie to his wife.

557
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,888
Only once.

558
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,389
And she'll forgive him?

559
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,558
Eventually.

560
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,592
Maybe.

561
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,529
A-And we don't know how it'll turn out.

562
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,032
I mean, he could succeed, he could fail,

563
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,001
but either way, I promise you,

564
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,237
people are gonna love to watch him try.

565
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,505
I love it.

566
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,607
It's the American dream.

567
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,942
I'm in.

568
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,244
Yes! What did I tell you?!

569
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,682
Thank you, Mr. Sacca!

570
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,550
We did it! Whoo-hoo!

571
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,953
This is the best day of my life!

572
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,055
Oh, wow, that really hurt.

573
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,791
Okay, listen,
are handcuffs really necessary?

574
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,127
My family's here.
What am I gonna do? Run away?

575
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,029
Sorry, buddy. That's protocol.

576
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,598
Protocol.

577
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:56,777

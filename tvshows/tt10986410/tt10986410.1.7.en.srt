1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:09,426
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,971
No, Trevor, no.
The bag has to go all the way in, okay?

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,140
Use all the space. Out the way. Thank you.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,061
What's gone on back here? Right.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:24,483
These need to be moved around, 'cause
this is gonna jiggle about, otherwise.

6
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,485
Now, can we move... Hello?

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,446
There's someone in here. Oh, my God.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,966
Hey, almost forgot. You know
how we're playing Everton tomorrow?

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,301
- Yeah.
- Well, that's not a town.

10
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,412
- It's actually a team in Liverpool!
- Like the Beatles!

11
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:41,708
If you see John, Paul, George or Ringo,
will you take a picture, please?

12
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,835
Hey, you got it, big guy.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,587
Okay, hey,
I better get a roll on here, all right?

14
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,131
Okay. And Mom wants to talk to you.
Hold on.

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,716
- I love you, buddy.
- Love you too.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,486
Still haven't told him
John and George are dead?

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,594
They're what?

18
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,221
It was Keith Richards.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,931
Hey, Ted.

20
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,140
- Hey. How you doing?
- Good.

21
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,809
How's work going? Everything all right?

22
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,938
Yeah. I'm sorry. I know this isn't easy,
but the paperwork the lawyer sent?

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,647
I know. Oh, hey.

24
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,525
Got it right here.

25
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,112
I'll, uh, look it all over, sign it,
send it right back. I promise.

26
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,948
Okay, thanks. Hey, good luck tomorrow.
We'll be watching.

27
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,032
All right now.

29
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:25,961
Whoo-hoo!

30
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,381
- Girls' trip!
- Mm. Liverpool, here we come.

31
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,544
I just want to say up front

32
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,777
that I'm really flattered
you asked me to come this weekend.

33
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,553
Oh. Come on now.

34
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,015
But, hey, we're both single.
I think you are super hot.

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,951
If I'm gonna dip my toe back
into the lady pool,

36
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,728
I can't think of a finer body of water
to do it with than you.

37
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,646
No. Keeley, I think you're confused.

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,149
I was, at first.
Then I was like, "Come on, Keeley.

39
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,444
Blow off some steam and have
some wicked sex with your new friend."

40
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,655
I'm fucking with you.

41
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,282
Oh, my God.

42
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,535
I thought you were being serious.
I mean, can you imagine?

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,745
Oh, I have.

44
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,789
Do-da do-da do do do do doo

45
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,667
Looks like we have a new passenger
on today's flight.

46
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,020
Actually, Keeley will be taking your seat
on the jet, Higgins.

47
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,463
Oh.

48
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,797
Sorry.

49
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,841
I'm gonna go spend a penny
before we take off.

50
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,176
See you downstairs, Rebecca.

51
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,179
Oh, that's okay. I always
enjoy the antics on the team bus.

52
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,348
No. I need you to stay here this weekend.

53
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,558
Doing work that doesn't matter.

54
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,984
All right, gentlemen. Who's ready
to go show Everton what we got?

55
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,486
Whoo!

56
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,072
Thank you, Dani.

57
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,743
Jeez, Louise.
Why's everybody so down in the dumps?

58
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,162
What happened?
Did BeyoncÃ© dump Jay-Z or something?

59
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,288
No, nothing like that.

60
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,334
Thank goodness. Just saying it out loud
made me immediately sad.

61
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,710
Let me see what's going on here.

62
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,256
Hey, guys. Seriously, come on.
Talk to me. What's up?

63
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,341
Well, we're fine.

64
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,425
Mm.

65
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,886
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Okay.

66
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,931
We're in a shit fucking mood because
we never fucking win at Everton

67
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,850
and it sucks fucking shit!

68
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,768
Ah, come on, fellas.

69
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,895
How long has it been
since y'all won up at Everton?

70
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,356
- Sixty years ago.
- Jesus Christ.

71
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,693
Wow. That is a heck of a long time. Okay.

72
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,361
So we got that going on.

73
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,322
And obviously we're bummed out
that O'Brien tore his butt.

74
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,949
It's my upper hamstring, Coach.

75
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,494
You tore your butt, son. There's nothing
to be ashamed of, okay? It happens.

76
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,458
People tear their butts all the time
in athletics. You're not alone, man.

77
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,434
Hey, Coach,
you've torn your butt a few times, right?

78
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,793
- Three times.
- Three times.

79
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,630
Butt's an amazing muscle.
God as my witness, your butt will heal.

80
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,051
The silver lining here,
with O'Brien's tore butt,

81
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,219
is that my man from Montreal is
gonna be filling in at goalie.

82
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,097
- Give it up for Zorro.
- Oh. It's pronounced, um, "Zoreaux."

83
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,892
- I'm sorry. Zorro.
- "Zoreaux."

84
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,394
You... I don't know
what I'm doing wrong here.

85
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,664
Point is, gentlemen,
unless one of y'all got a crystal ball,

86
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,332
we don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

87
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,733
That's why we play the game.

88
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,903
So let me hear it! Richmond on three!
One, two, three!

89
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,905
- Richmond!
- Right, come on. Let's go.

90
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,993
- Hey, Coach.
- Howdy, fellas. How can I help you?

91
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,954
Um, so, uh, since Jamie Tartt
has gone back to Man City,

92
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,832
uh, you've lost one, you've drawn one,
you've not scored any goals.

93
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:09,956
- Yeah.
- So I'm wondering,

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,252
how worried are you
about the threat of relegation?

95
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,548
Lloyd, right now I'm mostly concerned
with the definition of relegation.

96
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,259
What you got for me, Marcus?

97
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,113
Just wanted to know how you're feeling
about the departure of Jamie Tartt.

98
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,722
Yeah. Um...

99
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,517
Well, if I'm being honest,
it, uh, breaks my heart a little.

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,769
I think one of the neatest things
about being a coach

101
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,892
is the connection you get to make
with your players.

102
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,066
That's a loss that hits me a lot harder
and is gonna stay with me a lot longer

103
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,829
than anything that happens
while playing a game on a patch of grass.

104
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,088
All right.
See you fellas in Liverpool, yeah?

105
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,239
Yeah.

106
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,826
Oh. Hey!
Last one there is a Scotch egg! Whoo!

107
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,496
What?

108
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,344
Hey, there he is.

109
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,270
- Good to see you, buddy.
- All right, let's go.

110
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,592
Here we go. It's the presidential suite.
Hope it's to your satisfaction.

111
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,136
Would you like me to show you
the various room amenities?

112
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,762
No, thank you.

113
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,848
My lady and I wanna have
a quick shag and a shower

114
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,266
before we hit the town tonight.

115
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,101
Welcome to Liverpool.

116
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,315
What? He would've spent
a cash tip in, like, a minute.

117
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,109
Come on. The image I just gave him
is gonna last for a lifetime.

118
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,237
No, it's... it's not you. It's... Oh, fuck.

119
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,741
This is Rupert's and my
anniversary weekend. And...

120
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,515
- It's the first one I've spent by myself...
- Hey, it's okay.

121
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,083
Thank you.

122
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,171
- Mm.
- Ooh. That's a long hug.

123
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,593
So, just to remind you,
the hotel furniture stays in the rooms,

124
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,137
not the hallway or the pool.

125
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:32,601
Nor are you allowed to ship it
to your homes or other hotels, okay?

126
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,645
All right, fellas,
we got team meal in an hour.

127
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,272
After that, it's either gonna be
movie night or a pillow fight.

128
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,666
What's it gonna be this time around?

129
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,150
Movie night.

130
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,403
All right. But I tell you what,
y'all say "pillow fight" one time,

131
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,089
and we'll never watch another movie
together again.

132
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,382
- That's for you, Coach.
- Thank you, sir.

133
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,033
- And that's for you.
- Thank you.

134
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,953
Whoo! Room 5150. Finally.

135
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,414
Sammy Hagar,
greatest lead singer in Van Halen history.

136
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,125
- In the post-David Lee Roth era.
- Thank you.

137
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,961
- Coach, what room you got?
- 5148.

138
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,421
- Hey.
- Howdy, neighbor.

139
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:05,342
Yes, hello. We still haven't received
the champagne I ordered. Thank you.

140
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,262
Ah. Good question. One second.

141
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,349
Should I get the concierge to make us
a reservation somewhere tonight?

142
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,185
Shipley's steak house is unmatched
in its cuisine and ambience.

143
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,354
Mm. Is it now? Cool, I can do steak.

144
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,065
Uh, yes. The steak house for two, please.

145
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,943
Does 8:00 p.m. work for you?

146
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,238
The business center is open
24 hours a day.

147
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,322
Okay.

148
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,176
What was that about the business center?

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,703
Guests also have access
to our state-of-the-art gym,

150
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,455
filled with the latest
in workout technology.

151
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,540
Like kettlebells!

152
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,916
Oh, my God.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,252
Liverpool has much to offer
when it comes to nightlife.

154
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:45,424
From pubs and clubs,
to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!

155
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,885
I don't even remember doing this.

156
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,345
- And if you're the artsy type...
- Right, enough.

157
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,514
This weekend is moving forward.

158
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,976
When that champagne arrives, we are
going to get drunk, have a nice meal,

159
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,477
and leave the past in the past.

160
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,730
- Sound good?
- Sounds fucking great.

161
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,063
Oh. Speak of the devil.

162
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,236
Hello, Stinky.

163
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,743
Still giving you the big room even
without old gray walnuts footing the bill.

164
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,870
Good. Fuck Rupert!

165
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,166
Oh. Who's this then?
Is this your concubine? Is she Russian?

166
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,085
- Are you Russian?
- A, I love you. B, who are you?

167
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:26,965
Let me introduce Flo Collins,
my best mate since we were little.

168
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,010
Brilliant child psychologist
and proud, newly single...

169
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:30,969
Mm-hmm.

170
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:34,472
...mother to the most amazing 12-year-old
little girl called Nora, my goddaughter.

171
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,474
Wow.

172
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,477
Both of whom I've completely neglected
to speak to in the last six years.

173
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,562
Oh, Jesus, Stinky.

174
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,565
Remind me to bury you in the set list
for speeches at my funeral.

175
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,069
Hi, I'm Flo. Or you can call me "Sassy."
I don't care which.

176
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,141
So, you heard about the divorce?

177
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,325
Yeah. I bumped into Derren at a party.
He told me right after he hit on me.

178
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,995
Hey, what's new? Still, weird order
for him to roll out that information.

179
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,258
Right,
what's in the plan for tonight, then?

180
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,999
Shall I call down? Get myself a robe?

181
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,084
Oh!

182
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,127
Look what I've got.

183
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:05,879
Ta-da!

184
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,565
Stole it off
a room service trolley outside.

185
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,799
You're amazing!

186
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,927
- I'm Keeley, by the way. Hi!
- Oh!

187
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,154
Yeah, I know who you are, honey.

188
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,430
My ex used to masturbate to you
like a maniac, so...

189
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,614
Am I cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs
thinking we can beat these guys tomorrow?

190
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,992
- No, we match up perfectly.
- Exactly.

191
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,155
What about you, Nate?
You believe these guys can win?

192
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,767
I believe this team can do anything.

193
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,598
See? There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.

194
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,166
Okay, Nate. So if you were me,
what would you tell these guys?

195
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,602
Oh, no. I wouldn't... No, I don't...

196
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,754
Hey. I'm just asking for your opinion.
You understand that, yeah?

197
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,548
- Yeah.
- And you got one, yes?

198
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,592
- Yeah.
- Locked, loaded, ready to rip?

199
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,010
Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,136
- Let me hear it.
- No.

201
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,638
Why not? What are you afraid's
gonna happen if you tell me?

202
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,616
That you won't like my idea
and it makes you hate me.

203
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,516
Then you fire me.

204
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,911
Then I have to move back in with my
parents and they'll be ashamed of me.

205
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,622
Then everyone finds out back home
and laughs at me until my face melts off.

206
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,646
Excuse me.

207
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,153
Well, at least he didn't stammer.

208
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,780
Mm.

209
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,347
I gotta go take care of a couple things.
I'll see you in the morning, all right?

210
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,373
Hey, do me a favor.
Keep an eye on these guys,

211
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:27,503
'cause around the 74 minute mark, there's
gonna be a room full of grown men crying.

212
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,463
I'll be one of 'em.

213
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,259
Right, so I hadn't prepared anything.

214
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,471
Not the brightest idea for a maid
of honor, especially with an open bar.

215
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,097
Yeah, she was the star of the weekend.

216
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,059
- Yeah, I gave Elton John a boner.
- You did what?

217
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,394
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did!

218
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,355
He has repeatedly denied that.

219
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,273
Ah. Classic "she said, she said," innit?

220
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,238
Would you ladies like another bottle?
A little dessert perhaps?

221
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,075
My sexy and extremely single friend here

222
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,245
actually prefers her desserts
on the larger side.

223
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,081
If that's something
you could possibly accommodate.

224
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,042
I'll give you a few minutes.

225
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,210
Thank you. Sorry.

226
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,548
I can't believe you just did that.

227
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,132
Oh, shut up. You love it.

228
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,260
Right. I'm going for a smoke. Stinky?

229
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,636
No. Don't smoke anymore.

230
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,306
And yet, you're still on fire.

231
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,475
Hmm.

232
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,564
Yeah, I don't know. Just...

233
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:33,527
May I suggest flushing it again
but harder? Okay, bye.

234
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,946
Hi, how can I help you?

235
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,509
Hey, how you doing? I was
wondering if y'all had a fax machine.

236
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,284
Fax machine?

237
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:45,289
Oh, okay. Um, that's a good question.
If you bear with me a second,

238
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,875
I'll just check with a colleague
and see what I can find out.

239
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,753
A fax machine, hey? Are you
sending something to the year 1997?

240
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,315
Yeah, just a little note to myself
telling me to buy Apple stock.

241
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,799
Oh. Good idea.

242
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,243
Can you tell me to murder J.K. Rowling and
write the first Harry Potter book as well?

243
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,014
Can do. Yeah. I'll probably write "handle"
instead of "murder,"

244
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,515
so there's no paper trail.

245
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,226
- Yeah, I'm Ted, by the way.
- Oh. Sassy.

246
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,395
Sassy, huh? Like the Smurf, right?

247
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,207
Don't think there was a Sassy Smurf,
was there?

248
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,232
That's too bad.

249
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,156
Seems like a Smurf with an attitude
would've been a lot of fun to watch.

250
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,363
All right, yeah, I'll tell him.
Let me know how the trial goes. Okay, bye.

251
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,658
Right, we no longer have a fax machine
on the premises.

252
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,911
But the concierge was able to locate one

253
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,414
at a tanning salon eight miles away
in Croxteth.

254
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,707
You know what, that's okay.

255
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,793
I'm just gonna hit this manicurist
nearby that has carrier pigeons.

256
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,255
- Thank you though. All right.
- Okay.

257
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,924
Nice meeting you.

258
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,759
Right, how can I help you?

259
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,844
Well, I was gonna go out for a smoke

260
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,096
and hope my friend picks up the check
while I was gone.

261
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,892
Then I saw Magnum, P.I. in line,
figured I'd flirt with him as well.

262
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,603
- See what happens, you know?
- Oh, well, good luck.

263
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,022
Yeah, I think I fucked it.

264
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,944
I... I actually get off in about 30 minutes
if you'd like to, uh...

265
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,195
Of course not, why would you?

266
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,032
You are who you choose to be.

267
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,454
Superman.

268
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,794
Okay, so I just met
the fucking Marlboro Man in the...

269
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,713
- Where's Stinky gone? She abandoned you?
- No, she just went to pee.

270
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,298
- Oh.
- Where does "Stinky" come from?

271
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,218
I remember the day
she moved into our town.

272
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,262
She was already taller than me,
had bigger boobs.

273
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,390
Family was rich.
So, first day of year seven,

274
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,142
I told everyone her nickname was "Stinky."

275
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,644
That's genius.

276
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,230
To the ties that bind us.

277
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,523
To Rebecca.

278
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,818
Yeah, that's not Rebecca.

279
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:39,945
How do you mean?

280
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,281
No, the real Rebecca is silly.

281
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,533
Strong, yeah, but not cold.

282
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,494
- Have you ever heard her sing?
- No.

283
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,121
Ah. Beautiful voice.

284
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,207
Her and Nora would sing through
the door for hours.

285
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,293
Do you wanna build a snowman?

286
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,211
- Who's Nora?
- My daughter.

287
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,504
Oh, yeah.

288
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:00,132
Yeah, if you like that woman,
you are gonna love Rebecca.

289
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,302
- Ready?
- What about the bill?

290
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,888
- Thank you, Miss Welton.
- Okay.

291
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,035
Do you wanna do that thing
where you pretend you wanted to pay?

292
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,979
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This is really good fun. Join in.

293
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,148
Oh, you absolute piece of shit!
I was about to do that!

294
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,127
- I was just about to get my card out.
- I can't believe that you've done this.

295
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:22,151
- We were gonna split. That was so nice.
- Six years I've waited for this...

296
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,097
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm... I'm so sorry. I just...

297
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,122
You're what?

298
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,084
- What is this?
- It's just my thoughts on the team.

299
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,253
Go, Nathan. Come on, it's past curfew.

300
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,796
- Go! Get outta here!
- Sorry.

301
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,773
Liverpool has much to offer
when it comes to nightlife.

302
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:45,571
From pubs and clubs,
to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!

303
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:50,033
And if you're the artsy type,
or you're just trying to impress a date,

304
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,952
Liverpool has more
museums and galleries...

305
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:56,164
Welcome to Goodison Park.
I'm Arlo White here with Chris Powell.

306
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,959
- Okay, guys! Got some snacks here!
- Whoo-hoo!

307
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,379
Let's try not to eat them all
in the first half. Come on, Richmond!

308
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,048
It's eighth-place Everton
hosting AFC Richmond,

309
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,010
in 18th and staring relegation
in the face.

310
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,220
The last time Richmond left here
with a win,

311
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:14,975
the number one song in the UK
was by Elvis Presley, "It's Now or Never."

312
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,478
And that's certainly the case
for Ted Lasso's men tonight.

313
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,481
- Nate, can I speak with you, please?
- Yeah.

314
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,279
You all right?

315
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,575
I wanted to apologize for last night.
I bit your head off for no good reason,

316
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,098
and I'm really sorry about that
and I hope you can forgive me.

317
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,330
Yeah, of cour... Yes, of course.

318
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:40,959
Thank you.
Also, I read through your thoughts.

319
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,961
- Yeah.
- They're great.

320
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,548
And I agree with every last one of 'em.

321
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,509
But I can't say this to them.

322
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,594
- But they need to hear it.
- I agree.

323
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,586
That's why you're gonna do it.

324
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,556
Are you drunk?

325
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,267
You're giving the pregame talk,
and you're gonna read them this.

326
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,522
- I ju... I don't know.
- It'll be fun.

327
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,025
No. No, no, no.

328
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,319
Oh, my God.

329
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,154
All right, listen up, fellas.

330
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,031
As of late, I feel like y'all
have heard enough of my jibber-jabber.

331
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,367
So I asked Nate the Great here to
jot down a few of his thoughts and ideas

332
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,162
about you guys and today's game.

333
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,372
So let's focus up.

334
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,082
- All yours, Nate.
- Okay.

335
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,967
- Let's go, Nate.
- Come on, boy. You got this.

336
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,053
- You got this, Nate. It's okay.
- Okay. Thank you. Let's do it.

337
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,307
- Isaac.
- Hmm?

338
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you got this, bruv, all right?

339
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,646
Yeah.

340
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,064
I've noticed of late...

341
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,363
that you've been playing
like a big, dumb pussy.

342
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:55,993
Wow.

343
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,347
What the fuck did you say to me, bruv?

344
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,457
You're more concerned about looking tough
than actually being tough.

345
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,727
There's a way to be intimidating
without being physical.

346
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,587
I hope you don't mind me saying.

347
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,921
Um...

348
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,840
- Sam.
- Oh, no.

349
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,800
You're constantly getting beat
on the wings.

350
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,069
It's 'cause you're indecisive.

351
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,845
You second-guess
more than a shitty psychic.

352
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,991
The only African I know more imprisoned
by their own thoughts

353
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,349
is goddamn Nelson Mandela.

354
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,103
Did you hear that?

355
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,124
You think that's funny, do you, Colin?
You and all your fancy step over bullshit.

356
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,828
Let me ask you this.
Do you wax your pubes?

357
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,568
What?

358
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,921
Did I stutter, dickhead?
Do you wax your pubes? Yes or no.

359
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:32,988
No.

360
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,271
Then why are you always trying to play
like a Brazilian?

361
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:36,742
Yeah.

362
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,243
What just happened?

363
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,538
- Uh, Rojas.
- Whoo! Roast me, amigo.

364
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,665
All right.
You say that football is life, right?

365
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,250
Football is life.

366
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,753
- Yeah, well, then your defense is death.
- Oh!

367
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,899
The only person I've seen lose their man
more often is Carrie fucking Bradshaw.

368
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,758
Oh!

369
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,635
- Sex and the City.
- Shh.

370
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,263
- Yeah.
- Tough but fair.

371
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,640
Right. Roy.

372
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:12,236
Go on. Say what you're gonna say.

373
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,780
Okay.

374
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,284
Don't read it.

375
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,870
Say it to my face.

376
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,499
The great Roy Kent.

377
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,335
You're old now.

378
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:33,173
And slow. And your focus drifts.

379
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,937
But your speed and your smarts
were never what made you who you are.

380
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,763
It's your anger. That's your superpower.

381
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,967
That's what made you one of the best
midfielders in the history of this league.

382
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,561
But I haven't seen it on the pitch
at all this season, Roy.

383
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,272
I mean, you used to run
like you were angry at the grass.

384
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,692
You'd kick the ball like you'd caught it
fucking your wife, for Christ's sake.

385
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,654
But that anger doesn't come out anymore
when you play.

386
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,197
But it's still in there.

387
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,274
And I'm afraid of what it's gonna do to
you if you just keep it all for yourself.

388
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,558
Ooh!

389
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,147
Let's go get these fuckers.

390
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,572
See? Told you it'd be fun.

391
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,629
And the impossible has happened.
Richmond have won at Everton 1-0.

392
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,007
- Yes, Ted! Yeah!
- Thanks to a rare goal from Roy Kent.

393
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,675
Kent was absolutely brilliant today.

394
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,885
He was like a man possessed.

395
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,222
Yeah!

396
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,057
We know we are, we're sure we are.

397
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,808
We're Richmond till we die.

398
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,453
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond...

399
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,561
Oh, my God!

400
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,939
Come on, give us a hug, Nate. Yeah.

401
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,565
- Ted!
- Hey!

402
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,443
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, boss.

403
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,779
Could I, uh, just introduce you to...

404
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,990
- Sassy Smurf!
- Marlboro Man! Oh, my God.

405
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,493
We know we are, we're sure we are...

406
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,288
- I didn't know you were here.
- Surprise!

407
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,290
I've been thinking about you a lot
this weekend.

408
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,834
Oh, yeah? How come?

409
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,504
'Cause you and your crazy hair keep
popping up every time I turn on my TV.

410
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,468
Oi! Listen up!

411
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,429
None of you are going back
to the hotel tonight.

412
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:48,058
'Cause we did something today that
no one thought we could do, including us!

413
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,060
So, we're going out, we're celebrating,

414
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,479
and we're gonna rub it
in this city's fucking face!

415
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,110
Roy! Roy! Where are we going?

416
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,153
Keeley?

417
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,450
Well, Liverpool has much to offer.

418
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:09,580
From pubs to clubs
to the great Asian pastime of...

419
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:14,042
- I said maybe - Said maybe

420
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,545
You're gonna be the one that saves me

421
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,339
Saves me

422
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:23,385
And after all

423
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:29,725
You're my wonderwall

424
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,227
I'm going for a smoke.

425
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,937
- Can I join you?
- Come on.

426
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,648
Thank you, Richmond FC!

427
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,237
So, what's Marlboro Man's story, then?

428
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:43,961
'Cause I kinda wanna grab him by the ears

429
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,700
and ride that little mustache
like a Jet Ski.

430
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:50,120
- It's so good to see you, Sass.
- You too, Stinky.

431
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,416
God. You know, today would've been my...

432
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,377
Of course I know.
Why do you think I'm here?

433
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,881
Mate, I'm so sorry.

434
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,968
I'm sorry for disappearing from you,
from Nora.

435
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,804
I really am.

436
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,057
Thank you for saying that.

437
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,433
Mm.

438
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,602
God, that man took so much from me.

439
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,395
No.

440
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:20,609
Rupert is a horrible man who built
an ivory tower he kept you captive in.

441
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:25,113
But you climbed every single step
of that tower on your own.

442
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,534
You're the one who stopped
coming home, stopped calling.

443
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,870
Who made a six-year-old girl
wonder what she'd done wrong.

444
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,706
I'll always be your biggest defender,

445
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,793
but you have to own up
to the part that you played.

446
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,461
You're right.

447
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,046
Course I'm right. I'm always right.

448
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,149
You're not always right.
Most of the time you're an arse.

449
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,884
There you are. Fucking hell.
I thought you guys ditched me.

450
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,427
- No!
- As if!

451
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:51,390
Jesus, I didn't know that
I had abandonment issues till right now.

452
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,100
Come on, Rebecca. Your song's up next.

453
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,101
- What?
- Yeah.

454
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,644
No, I didn't put a song in.

455
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,355
Well, then someone else
must've done it for you.

456
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,774
Who could've done that?

457
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,110
See? You are an arse.

458
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,737
Caught in a bad romance

459
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:09,658
Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah Roma-roma-ma

460
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,827
Gaga, ooh-la-la

461
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,288
Want your bad romance

462
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,668
All right, who's next?

463
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,211
Me, me, me.

464
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,298
Your turn, Rebecca. Get on up here.

465
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,134
Thank you. Oh, God.

466
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,470
Okay. Uh, I don't even know
what song I'm singing.

467
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:34,224
But I would like to dedicate it to
the best friend a girl could ever have.

468
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:35,976
That is me! She's talking about me!

469
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:46,028
This is also dedicated
to my goddaughter, Nora.

470
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,654
I love you.

471
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,744
The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight

472
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,622
Not a footprint to be seen

473
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:03,253
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

474
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:11,553
The wind is howling
Like this swirling storm inside

475
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:17,809
Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I've tried

476
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:26,026
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be

477
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:32,199
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know

478
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,577
Well, now they know

479
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:39,206
Let it go, let it go

480
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,501
Can't hold it back anymore

481
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:46,129
Let it go, let it go

482
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:50,217
Turn away and slam the door

483
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,723
I don't care what they're going to say

484
00:25:56,807 --> 00:26:00,727
Let the storm rage on

485
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:04,731
The cold never bothered me anyway

486
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,165
- Ted.
- Dad?

487
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:23,667
Ted?

488
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,086
Ted.

489
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,255
It's okay.

490
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,924
It's okay.

491
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,593
Try to breathe.

492
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:37,097
I can't. I don't know what's going on.
I'm... I'm sorry.

493
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:40,559
It's okay. You're having a panic attack.
Just breathe.

494
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:43,979
Am I going crazy?

495
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,398
No more than anyone else.

496
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,777
All right. You're all right.

497
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:57,868
There we go. There we go.
There we go. Come on.

498
00:26:58,744 --> 00:26:59,745
Come on.

499
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:06,960
There we go.

500
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,463
I think I need to call it a night.

501
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:13,008
Gonna go back to the hotel and
just get a good night's rest, you know?

502
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,010
Would you like me to walk back with you?

503
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:16,946
Do you want to take my car?

504
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,848
No, no, no. I'm okay.
Thank you though. I appreciate it.

505
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,683
- All right.
- Okay.

506
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,608
Hey, do me a favor. Just, uh, let Beard
know I went back to the hotel.

507
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,236
Of course. You just get home safely.

508
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,654
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

509
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,697
Okay.

510
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:55,110
- Excuse me. Very drunk man coming through.
- Yeah.

511
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:58,447
Guys. Guys, guys, guys. I think
we should take the boys to the pub.

512
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,742
Oh, I am so done, Sass. Sorry.

513
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,911
Think I'm tapping out
for the evening too, actually.

514
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:08,081
So I have to take 18
young, handsome men all by myself?

515
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:09,958
Oh, trauma.

516
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,419
- All right then. See you later.
- Bye. I love you.

517
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:15,422
Amigos, I can't find my tropical shirt.

518
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,507
He's so drunk.

519
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,675
You won't need it, you won't need it.

520
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,427
Right, want a lift back to the hotel?

521
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:24,765
Oh, no.
Um, I think I'm gonna walk, actually.

522
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,080
Unless you want me to come with you,
'cause that I can do.

523
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,357
- I'm fine. Really.
- Yeah?

524
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,526
Besides, that was yesterday.

525
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,418
- You're wasting valuable time.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm going, I'm going.

526
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,635
Oh, this is me.

527
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:06,348
I'm sharing a suite with Rebecca.
We've got separate bedrooms though.

528
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,074
Good night.

529

1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:10,177
You're hearing AFC Richmond
being booed lustily by their home fans,

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,470
and you have to say,
not without good reason.

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,812
2-0. We're better than that!

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,193
Jamie. Jamie. Sorry, I didn't put
that cross where you wanted it.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,114
Forget it, mate.

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,689
Hey, would it be too forward
if I gave you some advice

7
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,735
that might help improve your game a bit?

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,818
No. Please, anything.

9
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,283
What you need to do is get yourself
a time machine, and go back to the moment

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,485
when your mom was about to fuck
a sad little man with no athletic talent.

11
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:39,246
Pull her off him, fly her to Argentina,
and drop her onto Maradona's cock.

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,334
Hope that helps, mate.

13
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,502
Right, that's it.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,012
I'm done with you
being a prick to everyone.

15
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:53,513
So, either I beat up an old man,
or I let an old man beat me up.

16
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,557
Fuck it. Let's go.

17
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,266
Fucking...

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,765
Hey, hey, hey!

19
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,267
Easy, easy, easy now!

20
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,418
Coach, tell these boys
what the first rule of my fight club is.

21
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,322
- No fight club!
- No fight club. Okay? You understand?

22
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,199
For the love of Pistol Pete, y'all.
We still got a second half to play.

23
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,123
Now, please, sit down. Everybody.

24
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,079
Gaffer saved you, old man.

25
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,589
Call me old...

26
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,879
one more time.

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,050
Sorry...

28
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,888
granddad.

29
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,681
I'll fucking kill you!

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,074

31
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:06,341
Table four is done and shall from now on
be known as the boring table.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,420
But that's where I'm sitting.

33
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,762
I haven't placed Elaine Kenner.
Awful woman.

34
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,262
She won't be attending tonight.
She was kicked in the face by her horse.

35
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,426
That poor thing. Is the horse okay?

36
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,852
Looks like we still got ourselves
a team divided here.

37
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,333
Coach, you know what
I'm thinkin' about right now?

38
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,727
- West Side Story?
- You know it. Sharks and Jets.

39
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,817
You think these fellas

40
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,702
could solve their problems
with a dance-off at a gymnasium?

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,410
Course, if memory serves,

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,040
Riff and Bernardo ended up getting
knifed to death at that particular event.

43
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,328
No, they didn't die
until the rumble afterwards.

44
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,502
Right. Right, right, right.

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
When I was 15, I was understudy for Anita.

46
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,877
All-boys school.

47
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,712
We have peeled yet another
juicy layer of the Nathan onion.

48
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,670
Coach Beard!

49
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,796
For dinner tonight,
it's either chicken or steak!

50
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,347
You can't tick both!

51
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,968
Okay!

52
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,477
Busted.

53
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,689
And Ted!

54
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,309
- Yeah!
- I need to know who your plus-one is!

55
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,188
Well, that'd be Mr. Two Entrées here.

56
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,946
No, he's already bringing a date!

57
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,323
Hey, you free tonight?

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,910
- I'm free every night, yeah.
- Okay.

59
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,124
- I'm gonna bring Nathan!
- Who?

60
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,616
Nate the Great! He's gonna be my date!

61
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,587
And for obvious reasons,
we'd love to be at table eight!

62
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,304
No!

63
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,459
And Beard, you're having chicken!

64
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,509
Hey, boss.

65
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,644
Pajama Friday? Wish I woulda known.

66
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,641
You're gonna get a kick outta this story.

67
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,933
- When I was 17...
- Ted, let me just stop you there

68
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,387
before you tell me a folksy anecdote
about you and pajamas.

69
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,372
Okay. When you change your mind,
just let me know,

70
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,186
'cause this one is a doozy.

71
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,918
Sorry, was there anything you needed?
'Cause I'm really...

72
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,992
I was wondering if me, Roy and Jamie
could all sit at the same table tonight.

73
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,070
- Is that possible?
- Yes.

74
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,009
Great! 'Cause I got some fences I need to
mend, and I think that might do the trick.

75
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,953
- Ted, I just said yes.
- Right.

76
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,115
Oh, God,
that one's absolutely beautiful, but...

77
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,366
I don't think I can get away
with that anymore.

78
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,378
Sure you could.
Fashion's all about confidence.

79
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,420
If I didn't have any confidence,
I never would've worn pajamas to my prom

80
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,940
and ended up in jail
the rest of that night.

81
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,901
But you don't wanna hear that story,
so I ain't gonna tell it.

82
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,235
You know what? I'll get outta your hair.

83
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,799
You're probably all revved up
because of the big shindig, right?

84
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,307
No, no, no. I'm absolutely fine.

85
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,138
I mean, even when Rupert and I
were running the gala together,

86
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,055
I did most of the work myself.

87
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,603
So, I'm not revved up at all.

88
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,556
I'm actually, really,
feeling quite mellow.

89
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,858
Good afternoon. We have a huge problem.

90
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,822
Our musical guest, Robbie Williams,
has canceled.

91
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:38,903
God!

92
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,107
Oh, no. Who is that?

93
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:44,947
No, no, no. That's absolutely fine.
It's not a problem. Let me just think.

94
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,195
All right, here's what
we're going to do, Higgins.

95
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,367
Tonight, when I tell everyone
that Robbie has canceled,

96
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,087
by then it won't matter because
you will have found someone better.

97
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,171
- There ya are.
- Right.

98
00:04:56,255 --> 00:05:00,085
I am a world-class problem solver.

99
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,545
There it is. You got it.
Catch it! Yep! Look at that!

100
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,135
You got this, Higgins!

101
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,183
And Rebecca's grateful
for all your hard work!

102
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,267
Thank you, Ted!

103
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,494
No. I hate it, babe.

104
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,779
It's just not me.
There's no hood, no zips.

105
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,034
There's no graffiti.

106
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,489
No graffiti.

107
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,037
Mad. I look like a banker.

108
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,581
Not with trousers that tight
around the crotch, you don't.

109
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,285
Fine. I look like a banker
with a great cock.

110
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,456
Babe, if those existed,
we wouldn't be together.

111
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,422
Whatever.

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Okay.

113
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,724
Look, you're gonna get more endorsements
when you start embracing high fashion.

114
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,563
I'm just trying to help
build up your brand.

115
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,391
Jamie, no. What are you doing?

116
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,684
I'm doing...

117
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:52,902
style.

118
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,150
Yeah, people don't know it,
but I'm good at this fashion shit.

119
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,612
- Are you?
- Yeah, I'm like a progeny.

120
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,025
Oh, yeah?

121
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,320
Oi. Down, boy.

122
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,240
That's a good boy. Find the treat, yeah.

123
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,158
Hey, hon.

124
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,366
Shoot, I was hoping I'd catch ya.
Got your message.

125
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,458
Playing a little phone tag, it appears.
And you are now it.

126
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,707
Hey. Guess what.

127
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,966
I'm wearing the suit
you told me I should bring.

128
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,929
You were right, as always.

129
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:29,517
Yeah. Okay, so, that's it.
I love... I miss ya.

130
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,138
And just go ahead
and give the little guy a squeeze for me.

131
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,636
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

132
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,401
Hey. All right, now.

133
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,151
Gotta love a troubadour.

134
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,323
Here we go.

135
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,945
Holy moly, look at you.

136
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,489
- Hope I'm not too early.
- No.

137
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,425
Or too late. I was trying to go
for somewhere in between.

138
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,344
Yeah, no.
You threaded that needle perfectly, Nate.

139
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,538
- Good.
- Yeah, nailed it.

140
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,789
Hey, let me ask you something.

141
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,266
Are you one of those guys
that likes it if your friends tell you

142
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,210
- you got a piece of food in your teeth?
- Absolutely, yeah.

143
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,053
Okay, good.
'Cause that suit does not fit at all.

144
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,969
- Really?
- Yeah.

145
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,758
I was gonna buy one,
but, you know, they're so expensive.

146
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,803
- I just thought I'd borrow my dad's.
- I hear ya.

147
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,432
Hey. We'll make a little pit stop.
Come on, follow me.

148
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,514
Yeah.

149
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,062
What you lookin' at?

150
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,439
You boys all right? How's my suit?
All good? Yeah?

151
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,736
This is great.

152
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,489
Hey, thank you, guys, so much
for taking my picture.

153
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,572
What are your names?

154
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,237
So you're Jerry, and you're Dave.

155
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,196
What you all came for.

156
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,707
Left eyebrow. Right eyebrow.

157
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,541
Confused look.

158
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,126
Yeah, now for the one
that you'll actually use.

159
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,691
That's it, darling. How about a kiss?

160
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,053
- Romance is not dead.
- Guys, sorry, sorry. I just...

161
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,823
- Gonna let them take a picture.
- Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,267
I just need to get inside. Okay.

163
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,731
Rebecca, over here!

164
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,849
- Nice, ladies.
- Rebecca, over here!

165
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,766
- You look perfect.
- Now, look to your left.

166
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,935
I hate this part.

167
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,823
- Miss Welton.
- Lovely. Nice.

168
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,317
Hey.

169
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,736
Just put one foot
in front of the other, yeah?

170
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,780
And then put your hand on your hip
and make, like, a claw shape.

171
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,534
It's the most flattering.

172
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,451
- Rebecca, give us a smile.
- Rebecca!

173
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,294
Look at her. She's fucking fit!

174
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,182
Don't strut. Let the suit do the work.

175
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,023
Ted Lasso. My God.

176
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,227
Right back at ya, boss.

177
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,317
I had a hunch
you were gonna pick this dress.

178
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,362
And may I say,
you are wearing the heck out of it.

179
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,821
Thank you.

180
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,276
Check out Nate.
Looking pretty dapper himself, huh?

181
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,487
Great to see you again.

182
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,366
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,139
- If you'll both excuse me.
- Absolutely, yeah. Go do your thing.

184
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,497
Look, there's Beard over there.

185
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,419
That's his new gal, Jane.

186
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,341
Yeah, they met
at his Friday night chess club.

187
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,433
Apparently, they liked each other's moves.

188
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,970
That wasn't a joke.

189
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,064
Was it not?

190
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,556
I guess it kinda was.

191
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,562
No. No. Fuck off. Fuck you. No. No.

192
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,521
Yeah, I know.

193
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,439
This is gonna be so uncomfortable.

194
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,658
- I'm switching tables.
- No, no, no. Hey. Come on back here.

195
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,779
This is my doing.

196
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,076
I parent trapped y'all. Take a seat.

197
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,832
Now, listen. You two knuckleheads
have split our locker room in half.

198
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,455
And when it comes to locker rooms,

199
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,542
I like 'em just like
my mother's bathing suits.

200
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,417
I only wanna see 'em in one piece,
you hear?

201
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,714
So we're fixing this.

202
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,859
Tell me what's the biggest issue
you got with each other. Go.

203
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,053
He's a piece of shit.

204
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,804
If his brain was on fire,
I wouldn't piss in his ear.

205
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,282
Well, hey. You don't need to be best
friends to be great teammates.

206
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,386
Think about Shaq and Kobe, right?
Lennon and McCartney.

207
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,715
Heck, even Woody and Buzz
got under each other's plastic.

208
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,997
Wasn't Woody made out of cloth?

209
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,111
I appreciate you, Nate,
but now's not the time.

210
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,983
You know what all those dynamic duos
had in common?

211
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,147
Mutual respect.

212
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,857
Y'all gotta find some common ground.
So who wants to get the ball rollin'?

213
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,197
I do.

214
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,204
Nate, that's a very nice suit.
I think you look chic.

215
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,457
Thank you. It's actually only
the second suit I've ever owned.

216
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,591
The first one was my suit
when I was a naked baby.

217
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,125
Sorry, it's funny when Ted says it. I...

218
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,547
Well, the term "birthday suit"

219
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,738
- woulda helped you a ton there, yeah.
- Oh, God, yeah.

220
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,402
Come on, let's try this again, all right?
Hey, Jamie. You wanna go?

221
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,681
Pass.

222
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,390
- Roy.
- He's a piece of shit.

223
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,517
You're gonna stick with that, huh? Okay.

224
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,041
Here's an idea that's
gonna help a little or hurt a whole lot.

225
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,185
Who needs a drink?

226
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,155
Any progress with the musical guest?

227
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,780
I've talked to a number of agents

228
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,826
and made a fairly extensive list
of those who cannot make it.

229
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,752
Process of elimination. We're on our way.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,170
Hey, there she is.

231
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,046
You're working on your speech, huh?

232
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,375
Rupert was always very good
at the public speaking part.

233
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,945
Hey, here's a little trick of the trade.

234
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,429
Just make fun of yourself
right off the bat, a little joke.

235
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,524
Folks will love that.

236
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,388
Okay, so,
what should I make fun of myself about?

237
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,521
Right, right, right.

238
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:35,152
You know... You know what would be...
No. Okay.

239
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,237
You're not gonna walk
into that one, are you, Ted?

240
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,492
No, ma'am. Nope, nope, nope. Okay.

241
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,161
Good luck though.

242
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,667
You know what?
I thought of something. No, no, no.

243
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,207
Queen to rook four.

244
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,335
Wait, are y'all playing a game
without a board?

245
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,007
Sorry to interrupt. My fault.
Sorry. Carry on.

246
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,054
Knight to king five.

247
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,770
Good evening,

248
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:10,651
and welcome to the Tenth Annual Benefit
for Underprivileged Children.

249
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,614
If I could hug each of you as a thank you
for your kind donations, well...

250
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,568
I probably wouldn't because,
as we all know, I'm not much of a hugger.

251
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,828
Now, I do hope you've all brought your
checkbooks with you for our auction later.

252
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:31,843
Because you can all bid
on our very own Richmond players.

253
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:39,796
Same rule as always, no hanky-panky
unless the player signs a waiver.

254
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,470
Rupert?

255
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,887
Hello, darling.

256
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,813
What a... lovely surprise.

257
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,897
Weren't you expecting me?

258
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,146
Only 'cause you RSVP'd no.

259
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,492
Well, one of the perks
of being a wealthy good-for-nothing.

260
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,778
Sometimes my nights
just magically free up.

261
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,820
May I? Thank you.

262
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:09,365
Gals and gents, with your help,
we raised £800,000 last year.

263
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,292
And this year, hopefully even more.

264
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,508
Well, I know I'm crashing your party,
but I so badly wanna help.

265
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,300
My fingers and toes are crossed
that you will have me.

266
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,385
Of course.

267
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,886
Let's get him a seat at the boring table.

268
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:26,806
Only joking.

269
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,599
Table four. Rupert Mannion, everyone.

270
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,147
Thanks, doll.

271
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,529
Oh, my God.

272
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,865
- Thank you.
- That...

273
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,418
Nathe, Nathe, Nathe. Come on.

274
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,458
Look, guys, this is a brand-new suit.

275
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,271
Rather than messing with me tonight,
can you just get me two times tomorrow?

276
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,835
Roy said we're not allowed anymore.

277
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,761
He fucking headbutted me.
I'm still dizzy half the time.

278
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,471
The doctors told me not to drink.

279
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,684
Shit.

280
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,475
Yet another reason shirts exist.

281
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,479
Shut up, it's not funny. Burned my nipple.

282
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,266
I wish I was that ice cube.

283
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,146
I will be bidding for a night with you.

284
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,361
Thanks, love.

285
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,986
Yeah, it's just a date though.
It's not a whole night. So...

286
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,334
We'll see.

287
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,747
Mate, I've done these before.

288
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,618
If she bids over 3,000,
you will have to fuck her.

289
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,539
- Is that true?
- You don't have to go all the way.

290
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,876
Just, like, some of the way.

291
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,800
Fingering.

292
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,722
Fuck you. Fuck this table.

293
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,056
Jamie, it was a joke.

294
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,771
It was a joke. Jamie.

295
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,597
What happened now?

296
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:59,111
Just the usual.
Jamie being a little bitch prima donna.

297
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,441
Roy, let me ask you something.

298
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,148
What were you like when you were 23?

299
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,656
Playing in this league,
making all that money.

300
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,293
- Little bitch prima donna.
- Yeah.

301
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,831
You know how they say that
"youth is wasted on the young"?

302
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,672
Well, I say don't let the wisdom
of age be wasted on you.

303
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,127
Ted?

304
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,215
I just came up with that.
I feel pretty good about it.

305
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,059
I just wanted to say thanks
for talking to Colin and Isaac.

306
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,773
Why is your face so close to mine?

307
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,944
Well, my initial plan was to hug you,
but I just chickened out just now.

308
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,784
Right.

309
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,530
- Okay, we're done.
- Yeah.

310
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,907
Ted, I'd like to introduce you
to Rupert Mannion.

311
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,535
- Mr. Mannion, how are you?
- It's Rupert, Ted.

312
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,252
Especially for the man
who's managing my club.

313
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,503
Used to be your club.

314
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:04,086
Of course, of course, but...
it's still my club in here, love.

315
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,802
Love of a sports team
is a lifetime obsession.

316
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:07,724
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

317
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,761
Kinda like your best friend's
older sister, right?

318
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:10,928
Hey, but do me a favor.

319
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,783
If you're ever in Kansas City
and come across a fella named Tom Dineen,

320
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,017
don't tell him I said that.

321
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,769
I love that.

322
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,066
I don't love our last two losses though.

323
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,399
- Horrible showing.
- Yeah.

324
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,783
Had to say it, wish I didn't.

325
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,700
It's okay. Who knows?
Maybe we'll turn it around, huh?

326
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,115
Oh, my God. I believe you.

327
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
Do you believe him?

328
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,002
Night's gonna take
a turn for the worse if you say no.

329
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,249
Of course I believe in Ted.

330
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,960
He's exactly what we've needed.

331
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,381
Not too much champagne now, dear.

332
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,505
Gotta stay sharp for the auction.

333
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:50,795
Why don't you do the auction?

334
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,312
No, I couldn't. This is your night.

335
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,558
We both know they'd rather see you.

336
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,140
And besides, it's... for the children.

337
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,063
For the children.

338
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,627
Right. If you'll excuse me,
I need to speak to the other guests.

339
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,687
I must say, I love that dress.

340
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,316
It's very youthful.

341
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,656
Good for you for getting back out there
looking like that.

342
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,743
Thank you.

343
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,122
Excuse me.

344
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:21,924
Ted.

345
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,554
It's been a hard year for her.
Is she okay?

346
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,627
Yeah, she's great.

347
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,585
You know, a lot of moving pieces putting
together a thing like this though.

348
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:34,012
And then she had this fella...
Robbie Williams cancel on her and...

349
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,096
- Robbie?
- Yeah.

350
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,930
Well, he's an old pal of mine.

351
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,845
I'm happy to text him.
I bet you I can get his ass over here.

352
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,847
I bet she'd love it.

353
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,227
I'll go track her down
and run it up the flagpole, huh?

354
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,823
I'm sorry.
That's an expression from back home.

355
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,861
- Just means I'm gonna ask her.
- Fabulous. Showtime.

356
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,156
All right, go get 'em.

357
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,531
Can I get something stronger,
like a Jack on the rocks or something?

358
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,367
A double and a single in one. A triple.

359
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,002
Ladies and gentlemen,
slight change in plans.

360
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,173
I have been cajoled into being
your auctioneer for this evening.

361
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,434
And our first victim is Jamie Tartt.

362
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,385
Babe, you have to win me.

363
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,523
I can't bid on my own boyfriend.
I'll look pathetic.

364
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,521
Babe, it's 2020. Women can do anything.

365
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,113
No, it's not happening.
Come on, you look hot. Go up there!

366
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:29,689
Look at him, folks.
Young, gorgeous, charming. The bastard.

367
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,646
So, we'll start with £5,000.

368
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,318
I want him, Rupert.

369
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,615
Five thousand from Cheryl Barnaby.

370
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,331
Richmond's premier breeder
of Shetland ponies.

371
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,162
Do we hear six?

372
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,212
Six thousand.

373
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,752
Six. Thank you.

374
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,835
- Seven thousand.
- Seven thousand.

375
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,262
Ten thousand.

376
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,553
Stunning.

377
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,675
And that applies
to the bid and the bidder.

378
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,023
I don't think so.

379
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,019
- Twelve thousand pounds.
- Fourteen thousand.

380
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,601
Fourteen thousand!

381
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,806
Sixteen thousand.

382
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,016
Eighteen.

383
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,321
Eighteen thousand. Do I hear any advance?

384
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,280
Yeah. Twenty-five thousand.

385
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:17,371
Twenty-five thousand! Going once. Twice.

386
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,199
Sold to Keeley Jones.

387
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:24,214
Why spend the time with your boyfriend for
free when you can have him for 25 grand?

388
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,706
You owe me.

389
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,171
Hey. There you are.
Getting a little fresh air, huh?

390
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,507
Yeah. Those rickshaw bike things
are so silly, but they do look like fun.

391
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,434
Yeah.

392
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,222
- You ever been on one?
- No, ma'am.

393
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:44,805
My wife and I once rented one of those
tandem bikes on vacation a while back.

394
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,193
Not the best experience.
She broke her arm and I actually...

395
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,782
Well, I chipped a tooth,
and I bruised my perineum.

396
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,454
- Hey, you okay?
- It's just...

397
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,116
That man, he knows me.

398
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,197
I used to think his blunt honesty
was noble rather than what it really is.

399
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,288
Which is just...

400
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,293
the cruelest way
of hiding his own insecurities.

401
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,921
He'd say wear this, eat that.

402
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,298
And I listened.

403
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,891
But now I'm alone.

404
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:25,926
I'm alone, Ted.
Just like he said I would be if I left.

405
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,692
I don't want to be alone.

406
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,318
Hey. It's okay. Okay.

407
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:56,716
You wanna hop on this thing
and get the heck outta Dodge? Come on.

408
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,928
I wish.

409
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:00,838
Not right now. Thank you though.

410
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,183
Has he started the auction?

411
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:08,643
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,647
Good. I'm glad he's done that.
We'll get much more money.

413
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,070
No matter what he does,
they just love him.

414
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,028
- You wanna head back in?
- No, you go ahead.

415
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,698
I need to freshen up.

416
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:26,753
I probably look like Robert Smith
after he's woken up from a nap.

417
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,122
Very emotional man. Yeah.

418
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,377
Okay, I'll see you inside.

419
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,303
When I was coming up,

420
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,808
there was this old geezer at the club,
Doug Stashwick.

421
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,980
He was always on me. Hated each other.

422
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,731
- You wanna know how we won the league?
- No.

423
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,726
It was the same shit
Yankee Doodle was peddling.

424
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,105
He sat me down and he said,
"Let's get it all out there.

425
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,072
You tell me why I'm a prick,
and I'll tell you why you are."

426
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,366
- You're a nasty bastard...
- No, I'm going first.

427
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,872
Even though I know I should pass to you...

428
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,868
you're so selfish and arrogant.

429
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,077
Every time I do,
it makes me want to fucking puke.

430
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:20,257
You know, I had a poster of you
on my wall when I was a kid.

431
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,588
Used to love watching you play.

432
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,351
But you're not the player
that you used to be,

433
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,682
and just because you won a few trophies,

434
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,847
you walk around here
expecting everyone to kiss your ring.

435
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,185
Yeah, I can be like that.

436
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,619
Now's the bit
where you admit to what I said.

437
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,368
I don't wanna.

438
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,207
Even if it is just...

439
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,746
a little bit true.

440
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,295
You and that Doug bloke,
you ever become friends?

441
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,433
Fuck no. I hope he's dead.

442
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,758
To you dying.

443
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,425
Such a prick.

444
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:16,896
Howdy, partner.

445
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,777
So, you ask Rebecca
what she thought about texting Robbie?

446
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,781
You know what? I couldn't find her.
I say don't worry about it.

447
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,454
If you change your mind,
say the word and... sent.

448
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,874
He'll be right over. Top up.

449
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,708
Hey, Rupert,
something just occurred to me.

450
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:37,249
If you could've texted Robbie Williams
asking him to come tonight...

451
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:42,174
you could've probably just as easily
asked him not to come.

452
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:47,428
Well, now, that would've made me
a real piece of shit, wouldn't it?

453
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,687
Hey, Ted. Do you think Rebecca knows
what the real Adele looks like?

454
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,147
I need to go on a little adventure,
and I need a copilot.

455
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,863
- And you want me?
- Yeah. Forget the rest, I need the best.

456
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:05,154
Come on, follow me.

457
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:13,116
- Thank you, by the way.
- Huh?

458
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:17,617
The red carpet photos are already online,

459
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:21,338
and I actually look all right for once.

460
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,920
Glad to help.

461
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:27,632
Keeley?

462
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:28,718
I think you should know

463
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,642
that the young woman that was bidding
on Jamie was actually his other plus-one.

464
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,440
Cheeky little prick.

465
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,397
- Can I have a sip of your drink?
- Yes.

466
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,612
Thanks.

467
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,533
In anything else, I hate olives.

468
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:50,822
I think the little, like,
orange clitoris thing is really freaky.

469
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,291
Have you ever dated a footballer?

470
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,371
- What?
- Sorry.

471
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:02,247
I shouldn't laugh. It sounds... judgy.

472
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,456
No, it's okay. You are a bit judgy.

473
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,546
So when I was 18,
I dated a footballer that was 23.

474
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:13,011
Now I'm close to 30, and I am
still dating a 23-year-old footballer.

475
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:15,966
I'm Leonardo DiCaprio.

476
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,021
They are pretty fun though.

477
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,523
Simple, rich, fit.

478
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,316
What about accountable?

479
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,025
What do you mean?

480
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,780
Well, I mean,
everyone makes mistakes, but...

481
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,277
I was married to a man for 12 years

482
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,543
who never once took responsibility
for any single one of them.

483
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,166
Hi.

484
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,258
- Hi.
- I'm Keeley.

485
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,342
Hi, I'm Bex.

486
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,279
- Really nice to meet you, Bex.
- Nice to meet you.

487
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,448
Do you mind if I just have a minute
on my own with this one?

488
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,232
Yeah, sure. Lovely to meet you.

489
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,058
She your new girlfriend?

490
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,774
Relax, babe.
It's all part of the branding plan, innit?

491
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,777
If I've got two women bidding on me,
it makes me look more valuable.

492
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,940
Do you know what I mean?

493
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:10,988
It's fucking smart, eh?

494
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:17,447
And now, the only former Champions League
winner on the menu, say hello to Roy Kent.

495
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:18,576
Granddad.

496
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:26,341
And the highest bidder gets to spend
a day at a swanky hotel by the pool

497
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,970
drinking frozen daiquiris
and soaking up the rays...

498
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,258
No, we said
there's no daiquiris and no rays.

499
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,314
There's not gonna be a fucking pool
either. We're not leaving SW14.

500
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:40,059
You looked so jealous. It was so cool.

501
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,022
You think jealousy is cool, do you?

502
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,622
Don't know, babe. I don't get jealous.

503
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:47,067
Well, can we have 100 quid for what's
turning out to be a very boring date?

504
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,864
All right. A thousand pounds.

505
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,739
- Any advances on that?
- Two thousand pounds!

506
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,075
Cheryl's got fire inside her.

507
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,079
- Three thousand pounds.
- Babe, you're just embarrassing yourself.

508
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,624
Four thousand pounds!

509
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:03,786
Five thousand!

510
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,841
Six thousand pounds.

511
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,879
- Any advance on six?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

512
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,048
Okay, sold to Cheryl.

513
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:24,733
That concludes the auction,
apart from one small surprise.

514
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:31,534
I am personally donating
£1 million to the cause.

515
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,164
Thank you.

516
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,446
Thank you very much. Thank you.

517
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:43,713
And that, I believe, gets Rebecca
over her goal of 800,000. Thank you.

518
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:48,789
For the children, eh?

519
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:01,636
Rebecca.

520
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,643
This here is Cam Cole.
He's an undiscovered mega-talent.

521
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,187
Go on, Cam. Show 'em what you got.

522
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,441
Are you insane?

523
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,486
Hey, Rebecca. You do not wanna judge
this book by its cover right here, okay?

524
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:18,865
The hell with it.

525
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,617
Yes.

526
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:27,921
Hello again. Ladies and gentlemen,
I regret to inform you that...

527
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:33,299
Robbie Williams is unable to be here
tonight due to an emergency.

528
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,220
But we have a brilliant replacement
for you who you are just going to love.

529
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:41,182
Or, at least, have lots to talk about
on the way home.

530
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:47,602
All the way from outside...
please welcome Cam something.

531
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,108
Bollocks.

532
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:58,696
What does that mean?

533
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:18,591
Mama, sweet mama nature
Please forgive us and what we've done

534
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,893
Can we just forget about the game
and go and have a dance?

535
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,678
Queen to king five. Checkmate.

536
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,775
We've gone and hurt our mama

537
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,070
And her wrath has begun

538
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,010
'Cause I'm a good boy to my mama

539
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:13,811
But

540
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:19,027
I've got bad siblings

541
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,136
- Thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

542
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,254
- We really had a great time.
- Thank you so much.

543
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,421
Good night.

544
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,669
Thank you again
for such an unbelievable donation.

545
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,513
- See you again next year.
- Can't wait.

546
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,680
What a charmer, huh?

547
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,387
Indeed.

548
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:55,188
You may think that you're the only one
that can see who he really is...

549
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,690
but you're not.

550
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,333
Oh, boy. You all right, buddy?

551
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,250
- Quick.
- All right.

552
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:11,329
Fun night.

553
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,125
Hey, wait, hold on. Slow down, Coach.

554
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:20,961
Will you stop being mad at me now?

555
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,219
I'm sorry, babe.

556
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,598
Do you even know
what you're sorry for, Jamie?

557
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,604
You always ask me that.

558
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,522
Hey, do me a favor.

559
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,613
Don't use me as a prop
in your little fights.

560
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,734
Made me feel like an idiot.

561
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,898
I'm sorry. I...

562
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:44,655
I shouldn't have done that.

563
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:46,906
Thanks.

564
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,873
No one was bidding on you anyway, mate.
Just fuck off.

565
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,411
Go on.

566
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,207
What are you saying sorry to him for?

567
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,710
Being accountable matters, Jamie.

568
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:04,684
We're done.

569
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:07,093
I'll see you around.

570
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:11,931
Whatever.

571
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,568
Excuse me, can I take these?

572
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:21,649
Two?

573
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,121
Do you wanna go get, like, really drunk?

574
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,247
- Yes, I do.
- Then we can go rob a bank or something.

575
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:45,045
Michelle and Henry
are coming out next weekend.

576
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,512
- Hey, that's great, Coach.
- Yeah.

577
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,507
So come on, tell me about you and Jane.
What happened?

578
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,215
I did it again.

579
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:54,015
- Put the game before the dame, huh?
- Yup.

580
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,809
When are you gonna learn, Coach?

581

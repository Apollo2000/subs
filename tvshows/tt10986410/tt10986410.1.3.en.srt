2
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,295
Fuck!

3
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,848
Siri, call Shithead.

4
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,896
Good morning.

5
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,861
There is nothing in The Sun
about Ted and Keeley.

6
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,861
Nothing. Are you in your office?

7
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,153
Of course I am.

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,236
Then get up here now.

9
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,367
Bye, boys. Tell Mum I love her.

10
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,194
Knock, knock.
Hey, boss, I don't know about you,

11
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,746
but I had an absolute peach of a Sunday.

12
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,831
Here you go.

13
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,248
Yeah, finally saw Big Ben.

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,585
Boy, I thought
I'd seen the biggest clock there was.

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,420
When I was a kid, my folks took me

16
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,006
to the Allen-Bradley Clock Tower
up there in Milwaukee.

17
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,819
They ended up leaving me there
all by myself.

18
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,764
Yeah, three hours and 42 minutes.
You know how I know that?

19
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,137
You were staring at a clock?

20
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:40,576
I was staring at a clock.
That's exactly right. Yeah, bingo.

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,870
That's a little bit of a mystery puzzle.

22
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,454
You figured it out right away.
You're a sharp cookie.

23
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,478
- Ted.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,902
Speaking as we were mere moments ago,
about time,

25
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,692
I unfortunately don't have any.

26
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,564
I have a branding meeting, so...

27
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,531
I always feel so bad for the cows,

28
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,783
but you gotta do it
otherwise they get lost.

29
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,118
That was a branding joke.

30
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,504
If we were in Kansas right now,

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,250
I'd just be sitting here waiting for you
to finish laughing. Yeah.

32
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,501
I'll see ya tomorrow, okay?

33
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,455
- Okay. Counting the minutes.
- Yeah, there you are.

34
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,401
All right. Let's see what we got here.
I've got this fella up here, the goalie.

35
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,658
Then all these guys over here, okay?

36
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,409
And going over here, going over that way.

37
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,326
This son of a gun's gonna go
all the way down here.

38
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,627
Crystal Palace
kicked our booties last week.

39
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,711
And this here, is our current offense
that we are running,

40
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,876
and I think it stinks!

41
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,338
Get rid of it.

42
00:02:57,593 --> 00:03:01,644
Now, you might be wondering why'd I draw
all that up there just to erase it.

43
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,853
And that is because
I believe in symbolic gestures.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,689
As do I.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,110
What time did you get home last night?

46
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,572
- Didn't.
- Really?

47
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,073
Now, look, our whole offense right now
is all give-and-go.

48
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,662
Give the ball to Jamie
and everyone else can go to hell.

49
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:19,578
So, I am officially on the prowl
for any new ideas, you hear?

50
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,615
- You got something, Nate?
- No.

51
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,996
So...

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,330
No. No. God, no. Never mind, I'm sorry.

53
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,978
Come on now. You're one of us.
Let's go. Fire away. What do you got?

54
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,712
Okay, right.
Well, it's just... No, other pocket.

55
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,586
It's just something that I thought of.

56
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,135
Sorry. Jesus.

57
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,052
Not that one.

58
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,268
You know what, it's not even very good.

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,388
It's probably really bad.
It's embarrassing even.

60
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:46,474
- I just...
- Sorry, Nate.

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,439
I have a real tricky time hearing
folks that don't believe in themselves.

62
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,789
I'm gonna ask you real quick again.

63
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,944
- Do you think this idea will work?
- Yeah, I do.

64
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,031
- Why you screaming at us, Nate?
- God!

65
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,700
We're right here.

66
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,985
All right, come on now.
Walk us through it.

67
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,201
Okay. So, I thought if we started
the attack on the wing,

68
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,615
Jamie could run through nearside,

69
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,413
then when the defense follows,
Sam could fill his spot.

70
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,247
So, use Jamie as a decoy?

71
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,332
No.

72
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,165
No. Well, yeah, in...
Yeah, in this case, yes.

73
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,336
Let's give it a shot.

74
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,401
What, you're gonna use my play?

75
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,636
Yeah. I mean,
we're gonna try it on, see if it fits.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,060
You know, it might not.

77
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,927
Then again,
it might be a very flattering silhouette,

78
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,805
and I might wear it right outta the store.

79
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,653
Makes me feel good and I start to strut.

80
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,903
I'm like, "I like this.
I like the way this makes me feel."

81
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,271
Show him your strut, Coach.

82
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,187
Yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah.
Yep, that's how to strut.

83
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,817
Let me see you strut, Nate. Come on.

84
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,132
There you go, Nate.
Yeah, that's one way to do it.

85
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,276
There you go.

86
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,677
You look a little angry,
but that's all right.

87
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,430
That's my fault.
I forgot the pitch is right this way.

88
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,932
Come on, let's go.
Strut this way. Here we go.

89
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,115
Still strutting.

90
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,997
- I'll see you later. Yeah.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,507
Ted! Hey, have you got a minute?

92
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,677
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine, yeah.

93
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,850
- It's not fine. Everything's shit.
- Oh, no.

94
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,310
This was gonna be
the front page of The Sun today.

95
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,310
"Manager Shags Star Player's Girlfriend."

96
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,769
I think a more accurate headline would be,

97
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,574
"Manager Innocently Feeds Young Woman
Whose Relationship Does Not Define Her."

98
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,149
Ted, this is really bad!

99
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,324
Except I look insanely fit
in this picture.

100
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,064
Yeah, no, it's beautiful light.

101
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,802
My friend who works at the paper said
he can hold this story for one day

102
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,196
as a favor.

103
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,536
When this shit hits,
Jamie is going to go mental.

104
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,141
There's going to be photographers
all over us.

105
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:32,995
Right, right.

106
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,963
The next picture of me
will not be this perfect.

107
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,423
I am gonna be mid-sneeze face, like...

108
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,762
- Guess what the headline will be.
- Gesundheit?

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,011
"Jamie's Tart Breaks Tartt's Heart."

110
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,432
- Did you just come up with that?
- Yeah.

111
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,644
- Everyone would read that.
- Of course they would.

112
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,077
You have no idea the power of rhyming
in this goddamn country.

113
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,151
Yeah.

114
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,858
"Lasso Makes Passo
and Creates Team Fiasco."

115
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,942
Keeley's got bars.

116
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,024
Yeah, I'm cute as a button
and I can rhyme my ass off.

117
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,906
God, it's no wonder
they want to destroy me.

118
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,911
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,461
Sorry, it took me so long
to get up the stairs.

120
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,550
I was... stopped to talk
by about a hundred people.

121
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,959
Still nothing.

122
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,086
Get someone to run
the story about Ted and Keeley.

123
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,677
- Hey, boss.
- Ted! And Keeley. Hello.

124
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,012
Hey, I found that in the hall. Yeah.

125
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:31,096
So, we got ourselves a situation here.

126
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,733
Go ahead, show her the picture, yeah.

127
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,403
See? And the fucking Sun
is running it tomorrow.

128
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,689
Honestly, these people,

129
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,653
they just have no regard
for people's privacy and dignity.

130
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,324
Yeah, I'm gonna find the piece of shit
that took this and who hired them.

131
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,913
No, no. Not necessary.

132
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,369
I know the owner of the paper.
I can get this stopped with a phone call.

133
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,913
Really? Oh, my God. Thank you.

134
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,245
See, what I tell ya, huh?

135
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,211
This woman right here is strong,
confident and powerful.

136
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,211
Boss, I tell ya, I'd hate to see you
and Michelle Obama arm wrestle,

137
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,314
but I wouldn't be able to
take my eyes off it either.

138
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,088
That's not a compliment I've had before.

139
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,007
- You do have perfect action figure-y arms.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,139
There's another one. Anyway, glad to help.

141
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,103
- All right. Yeah.
- Thank you.

142
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,353
- Okay.
- See y'all later.

143
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,463
There's no way she can
trace that photo back to me, can she?

144
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,394
- Yes.
- What do you mean "yes"?

145
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,192
Did you not use an alias
or a burner phone?

146
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:29,577
I'm not a spy, Rebecca. I'm just
the director of football operations.

147
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,737
And equally proficient at both.

148
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,536
Well, thank you. Wait...

149
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,707
Okay, here we go. Sam lays it for Dickson.

150
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,792
Okay, nice touch.

151
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,877
Switch to Bumbercatch.

152
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,548
Jamie decoys through.

153
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,762
- Sam wide open.
- There it is!

154
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,185
Nice play, Nate. How you feel?

155
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,519
I just don't know.
So many new feelings. Yeah.

156
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,084
Kinda like getting your first pube, right?

157
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,148
- Yeah. What?
- Here we go.

158
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,947
All right. Hey. Nice work.

159
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,028
Okay, now, gentlemen,

160
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,673
here's the other thing
we're gonna start focusing on.

161
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,908
Making quicker transitions
from offense to defense.

162
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,122
Y'all gotta start making your hellos
goodbyes. You understand?

163
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,254
Easiest way to get that done well
is to do it well.

164
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,081
But aside from that,
you gotta be in great shape, right?

165
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,127
So, we are all gonna run two laps
around this field.

166
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,552
Anyone who loses to me
has to run four more. Let's go!

167
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,052
- Okay, come on. What you got?
- What's going on?

168
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,058
You're catching up. Don't cut that corner!

169
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,159
Come on. You can't catch me,
I'm the gingerbread man.

170
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,524
Faster, boys!

171
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,610
- Look at his face.
- Colin, Isaac, please stop.

172
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,662
Yeah, it really hurts now.
It really hurts.

173
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,953
Be careful, Colin, now.
That's our new coach.

174
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,697
- Oh, right, boyo.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,950
Sorry, gaffer.

176
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,084
Thank you.

177
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,251
Okay, way to run out there today, fellas.

178
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,211
You guys are much faster than me.

179
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
Except Coach Beard.

180
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,230
What's going on? I thought you ran track
in high school or something.

181
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,264
Chess team, Coach.

182
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,508
Illinois State Champs, baby.

183
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,379
Okay, yeah. Illinois is a state, fellas.

184
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,296
One last thing, there are some gifts
up in y'all's lockers.

185
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,806
In your little cubbies up there.
So, hope you enjoy 'em.

186
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,899
It's a fucking book.

187
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,711
Nice one, bitch boy.

188
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,258
- Hey.
- Yeah, I just thought you should know

189
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,929
that your boy Nathan's being harassed
every single day

190
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,009
by Jamie and his little... side-pricks.

191
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,351
- Right.
- So you know already?

192
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,471
Yep.

193
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,138
So, you'll take care of it?

194
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,306
No.

195
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,767
What the fuck?

196
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,815
Roy, I learned two pretty big lessons

197
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,820
on the rough-and-tumble playgrounds
of Brookridge Elementary School.

198
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,485
One, if little Ronnie Fowch
offers you a candy bar,

199
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,082
you immediately say no,
and you get the hell outta there.

200
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,908
'Cause there's a good chance

201
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:22,124
that little son of a gun has just pooped
inside of a Butterfinger wrapper.

202
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,211
No one ever saw him do it,
but a couple people ate it.

203
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,422
Number two, if the teacher tells the bully
not to pick on someone,

204
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,844
it's just gonna make it worse.

205
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,381
So, you're not gonna do anything?

206
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,336
No.

207
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,432
Why you winding him up?

208
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,181
He's the one, Coach.

209
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,307
If we're gonna make an impact here,

210
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,653
the first domino that needs to fall
is right inside that man's heart.

211
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,615
Yes.

212
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,745
- Jamie, can I ask you something?
- It's 40 kilos. I do three sets of ten.

213
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,791
And then I alternate between bis and tris.

214
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,456
I don't give a shit what you lift,
you little pretty boy.

215
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,216
Yeah, you do, 'cause you asked.

216
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,546
Can you curl 40 kilos?

217
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,514
No, but I can use your balls
as a speed bag.

218
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,724
- Do you wanna try that?
- Not especially.

219
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,616
Do you even understand
the influence you have on this team?

220
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
- I'm the shit, yeah.
- No, you're a bellend.

221
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,059
But because your right foot
was kissed by God the boys look up to you.

222
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,686
It's made me question my own faith.

223
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,480
So, when they pick on Nate...

224
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,280
and you laugh...

225
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Yeah.

226
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,453
They think it's okay.

227
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,290
Right, 'cause Nate's a weak baby
and he can't do anything about it.

228
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,748
Yeah, all right. I'll take care of it.
Nate's a good lad.

229
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,248
Good.

230
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,980
Hey, Roy. You comin' to the club tonight?

231
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,205
Hold on, will you be there?

232
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,378
- Of course, bruv.
- Then fuck no.

233
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,505
Colin, Isaac, come here.

234
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,907
You know how you two are
always messing with Nate?

235
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

236
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,269
Keep it up. Makes me laugh.

237
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,399
- Good morning, Higgins.
- Good morning. I was just...

238
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,908
Waiting at the entrance
so I'd see you were here on time.

239
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,241
Exactly. You seem in good spirits.

240
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,908
Yes, I am. I've just realized something.

241
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,917
Who cares if we can't run that picture?

242
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,879
The bigger issue
is that the local community

243
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,418
is getting behind the team
no matter how badly they play.

244
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,375
It is an outstanding fan base.

245
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,004
Yes, one I believe I can put an end to.

246
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,091
Hooray.

247
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,096
No.

248
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,139
Okay. I'll go back there.

249
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,273
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

250
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,559
So, I spoke to the owner of The Sun.

251
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,854
You spoke to God?

252
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,859
- No, the newspaper.
- Oh, right.

253
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,528
And he has agreed to
not run the photo of you and Keeley.

254
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,160
MVP! MVP! MVP!

255
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,408
- Left leg! Right leg, not as good!
- Okay.

256
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,081
- Yeah!
- Yes. Okay, thank you, Ted.

257
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,839
Sorry. Yeah, no.
You were saying. Go ahead.

258
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,910
In exchange,

259
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,365
I've agreed for his
more reputable newspaper, The Independent,

260
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,956
to do a profile on you.

261
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,341
"One-on-One with Coach Lasso."

262
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,498
Yeah, okay.

263
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,375
The writer will be Trent Crimm.

264
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,224
And he's very good,
and the supporters really listen to him.

265
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,679
Oh, no. I know Trent, yeah.
He's a tough cookie.

266
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,971
- Really?
- Yeah, but that's okay.

267
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,615
You know what you do
with tough cookies, don't ya?

268
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,019
- No.
- Dip 'em in milk.

269
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,104
All right, let's run that new one.

270
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,822
Hey, there he is.

271
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,860
Hello, Coach Ted Lasso from America.

272
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,274
Hello, Trent Crimm from The Independent.

273
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,384
Hey, excited to spend the day with ya.
Gonna be fun.

274
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,778
And please, call me Ted.

275
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,034
All right, let's go!

276
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,956
Wide open.

277
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,633
- Yeah!
- Snuck it by him.

278
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,967
Thataway, Sammy. How'd that feel?

279
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,682
Oh, wonderful, Coach.
I felt that one in my penis.

280
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,701
Yeah. No, that sounds about right.
That's good. Yeah.

281
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,225
Hey, Jamie, you gotta sell
that run-through hard, baby.

282
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,038
Make the defense believe you.
Watch, like this.

283
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,611
Ball! Ball! Give me the ball!

284
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,528
I want the ball! Give me the ball!
I would like the ball, please!

285
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,609
Make it a performance.

286
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,952
I want you winning an Oscar
at the ESPYs next year.

287
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,359
You want me to run decoy?

288
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,447
Yeah, that's right.

289
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,489
It's a joke.

290
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,448
Unfortunately for you, though,
no one thinks it's funny.

291
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,534
That true?

292
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,162
Agree to disagree. I find it hilarious.

293
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,600
I thought it was
funnier than Step Brothers.

294
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,624
High praise.

295
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,789
That scene where the bunk bed collapses...

296
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,491
I used to think
that was the funniest thing I'd ever seen,

297
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,546
but then I just saw that.

298
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,692
And now I'm gonna have to
rethink my order of what I think is

299
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,902
the funniest thing I've ever seen.

300
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,216
Yeah, that's when sports and art combine,
as far as I'm concerned.

301
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,157
All right, fellas,
let's run it again. Let's go.

302
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,181
Cheers.

303
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,235
Yeah, they're getting it.
They're getting it.

304
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,398
Interesting play, Ted.
Did you come up with this?

305
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,479
Oh, no, no, no.

306
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,732
This is all cooked up
by our very own Nate the Great.

307
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,477
Who's "Nate the Great"?

308
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,442
Oh, yeah. There he is.

309
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,783
Someone's been walking their dog here.
Found another poo.

310
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,322
Okay.

311
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,985
What exactly does "Nate the Great" do?

312
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,971
I'm not exactly sure what his title is.

313
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,639
Hey, Coach.
What is Nate's job around here?

314
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,423
- Kit man.
- There you go. Kit man.

315
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,461
Do you mean to tell me you're
entrusting a Premier League team's attack

316
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,544
to the kit man?

317
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,191
That young fellow's forgotten more
about this sport than I'll ever know.

318
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,335
Heck, might be a genius.

319
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,674
Anything to add, Coach?

320
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,759
Good kid.

321
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,346
Boy, oh boy.

322
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,283
If you knew Coach Beard,
you'd know what a big deal that was.

323
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,427
You mean that, don't you?

324
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,620
Well, hell.
There's your story right there.

325
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,644
Got a headline and everything.
"Man Nods Head."

326
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,860
Watch your back, Gay Talese.

327
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,990
There's a new iconic profile
about to be typed up by one Trent Crimm.

328
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,450
Tighten up those lines!

329
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,370
Let 'em know, Coach.

330
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,793
Come on.

331
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,995
Get a towel.

332
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,999
- Oh, God. No, no, no.
- Get a towel.

333
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,040
- Let go. Please, God. Stop it. No.
- Oi, oi!

334
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,625
What the fuck are you doing?

335
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,220
Jamie not talk to you
about leaving him alone?

336
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,836
Fuck's sake.

337
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,164
- You look like you've forgotten something.
- Hi, Keeley.

338
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm looking for your prick boyfriend.
You know how to pick 'em, don't ya?

339
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,815
Didn't your last girlfriend steal
your Rolex and sell it for drug money?

340
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,494
So? I don't need a phone and a watch.

341
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,871
Look, I didn't sign up
to be your boyfriend's minder, okay?

342
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,790
But the new gaffer's
trying to make me feel responsible

343
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,370
for fucking Nate,
whose last name I don't even know.

344
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,628
It's Barnes.

345
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,749
No. It's Shelley.

346
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:42,835
Yeah, I know.

347
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,210
I don't like being tricked.

348
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:48,125
Not by you and not by,
"Howdy y'all, cowboys.

349
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,136
My name is Ted Lasso and I'm from Kansas."

350
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,183
Wow, you're, like,
really, really bad at impressions, man.

351
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:01,225
I know he's trying to push my buttons,
but I cannot be manipulated.

352
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,323
Come on. I could push all of your buttons
right now if I wanted to.

353
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,335
- No, you couldn't, Keeley...
- I think, actually, I could.

354
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,587
- You couldn't, Keeley... No, Keeley.
- What was that? I can't seem to hear you.

355
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,797
- Keeley, if you would listen to me...
- I'm trying to listen to you.

356
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,260
- I could tell you why...
- So tell me.

357
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,701
Is that making you mad?

358
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,617
No.

359
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,578
No.

360
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:26,087
"I'm Roy Kent
and I get paid to play a game,

361
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,421
but I'm mad all the time."

362
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,429
That's actually pretty good.

363
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,074
Hey, Trent.

364
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,397
- You know who you remind me of right now?
- No. Who?

365
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,993
One of them robot vacuums.

366
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,817
Just kinda wandering around
looking for dirt.

367
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,565
- Roomba.
- That's the one.

368
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,833
Actually, I have a question.

369
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,868
After your resounding loss
to Crystal Palace,

370
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,712
one of your players said
there was a party in the locker room.

371
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,828
Do you feel it sends the right message
having a party after a loss?

372
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,380
Well, Trent, I've never really concerned
myself too much with wins and losses.

373
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,512
Now that's a quote I'll probably use.

374
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,590
You should get going.

375
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,944
Hey, will you let Roy know
we're heading out soon?

376
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,219
- Copy.
- Thanks, Coach.

377
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,473
You wanna tag along?
We're gonna go speak to some schoolkids.

378
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,057
Oh, what a coincidence.

379
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,271
The day of our interview you just happen
to be visiting a local school.

380
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,732
Well, that's the funny thing
about coincidences, ain't it?

381
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,823
Sometimes they just happen.

382
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,903
Come on now.

383
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:32,567
Come in.

384
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,993
I just wanted to come and thank you again
for stopping that picture from running.

385
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,825
And I bought you a present.

386
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,419
Made me think of you.

387
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,923
It's strong and a bit prickly.

388
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,413
You know, I've decided to
not be scared of you anymore.

389
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,835
I didn't know you were.

390
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,884
Yeah.
I was, like, fucking terrified of you.

391
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,677
My God,
Jamie would have been so pissed off

392
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,063
with reporters poking around
in our love life.

393
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,536
I don't know why I'm telling you.
You know all about that, don't you?

394
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,059
Remember when you got divorced?

395
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,692
It rings a bell.

396
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,731
Yeah, I mean, didn't it,
like, make you really mad

397
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,443
that they went after you and not Rupert?

398
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,212
'Cause he was the one that cheated
and he came across like Prince Charming.

399
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,527
It really pissed me off.

400
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,907
Well, the press are never awful to men.

401
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,621
No one ever pays a fortune for a photo
of a naked man on a yacht in Mallorca

402
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,913
a week after his divorce.

403
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,247
That's like a very specific scenario.

404
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,962
Oh, my God. That means
there's a picture of you naked on a yacht.

405
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,044
Can I see it? Is it here?

406
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,336
Come on. You wouldn't have said something
if you weren't dying to show someone.

407
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:34,882
Please.

408
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,390
It was taken from a helicopter
while I was sunbathing.

409
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,136
Holy shit, Rebecca.

410
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,055
Are those your real tits?

411
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,523
I feel like a teenage boy.
I can't stop staring at them.

412
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,355
Where did you get those?

413
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,529
My mum.

414
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,407
I can't believe
you stopped this from running.

415
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,742
I would have shown everyone.

416
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,660
Right. I really need to get on.

417
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,779
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

418
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,241
Thank you.

419
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:05,962
Bye.

420
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,707
Shoes.

421
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,251
Shoes. Yes.

422
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,211
Wow, you really blew my brains out

423
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,257
with those beautiful breasts of yours,
Rebecca.

424
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,862
When I first saw
our school football squad,

425
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,818
I didn't think that Richmond Primary
would win a single game,

426
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,784
much less the league championship.

427
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:53,204
To celebrate, please welcome
the new manager of AFC Richmond,

428
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,795
Ed Lasso.

429
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,798
Thank you. I appreciate you.

430
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,223
All right. Hey, gang. How y'all doing?

431
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,009
- Wanker.
- Jacob.

432
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,846
It's all right.

433
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,806
Look, I just wanted to come down

434
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,023
and congratulate y'all
on a heck of a season.

435
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,273
But hey, I know someone else
who's really excited to meet all of ya.

436
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,938
So if you please help me welcome

437
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:19,855
the captain of your AFC Richmond squad,
Roy Kent.

438
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,237
Roy! Roy! Roy! Roy!

439
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:26,786
Right.

440
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:32,076
Never been much for public speaking
or school, really.

441
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,593
Always seemed like a waste of time to me.

442
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,257
Why don't we
get out of this stuffy auditorium,

443
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,472
go out on the pitch
and have a proper fuck-about?

444
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,816
I think it's really cool you do this.

445
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,951
Only doing it
'cause my fucking niece goes here.

446
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,607
- Oh, yeah? Which one is she?
- That idiot.

447
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,535
Oh boy, here she comes.

448
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,616
Can we do headers, Uncle Roy?

449
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:10,994
Yeah, all right. Come on then.

450
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,794
All right. Come on, you lot. Line up.

451
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,746
Heads. Lovely.

452
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,546
Next. Go. Perfect.

453
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,169
Next. Heads.

454
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,839
Next.

455
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,795
Well done. Next.

456
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,563
Next. Sweet.

457
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,056
Lovely. I liked it.

458
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,186
- Good.
- Roy, come on.

459
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,125
You hop in there, show 'em how it's done.
I'll do a couple.

460
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,439
How you doing? Ready? Come on.

461
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,025
That's the spot. Come on.

462
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,240
Here we go, Phoebe.
Let's see what you got.

463
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Hey, nice catch.
We might have ourselves a goalie.

464
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,279
Boy, oh boy. That was right in the button.

465
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,785
Good job, Phoebe.

466
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,421
Oh boy.

467
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,922
Sorry about the blood there.

468
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,421
There you go.

469
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,756
Don't use it to clone me.

470
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,049
Nice meeting you. Take care now.

471
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,779
That's the longest anyone's ever stayed
for something like this.

472
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,596
- Hey, thanks for having us.
- Cheers.

473
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,681
Thanks again.

474
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,186
Roy, that was a blast.

475
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,788
And I tell you what, that niece of yours
is a real cutie patootie.

476
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,902
Enough. I've had it with your mind games
and your stupid gifts.

477
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,403
I mean, what even is A Wrinkle in Time?

478
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,105
It's a lovely novel.

479
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,236
It's the story of a young girl's struggle
with the burden of leadership

480
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,663
as she journeys through space.

481
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,617
Yeah. That's it.

482
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,794
Am I supposed to be the little girl?

483
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,421
I'd like you to be.

484
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,164
Right. None of this matters.

485
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,438
'Cause I'm just doing
what everyone in this town is doing,

486
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,382
and I'm counting down the days
until you're gone.

487
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,544
Trent, you're a colossal prick.
You always have been.

488
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,509
Phoebe, come on.

489
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,599
Are you hungry?

490
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,019
Little tradition.

491
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,070
Let battle commence.

492
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,724
Ted Lasso?

493
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,198
- Hey there, Ollie.
- Leave it out. What are you doing here?

494
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,798
Well, I mean, you invited me, remember?

495
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,821
I invite every person
who's been in my car.

496
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,366
Hey, Ollie. This is my friend Trent.

497
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,555
- Trent, this is my buddy Ollie.
- Pleased to meet you.

498
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,788
Congrats. You both just met a cool person.

499
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,131
Right, gentlemen.
You know what you're having?

500
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,561
Yeah. Well, you know,
whatever the chef recommends.

501
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:24,046
That would be my father-in-law.
Are you okay with a little bit of spice?

502
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,730
Have him make it for us
like we're a couple members of the family.

503
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,140
You're a brave man.

504
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,018
Oh, man. Mad respect.

505
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,268
That might not be the wisest of choices.

506
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:37,977
Here you go, boys.

507
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,145
- Dig in.
- Can't wait.

508
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,319
The smell's already deep inside my brain.

509
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,939
- Gonna love it.
- I appreciate it.

510
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:47,737
I can't imagine
they have good Indian food in Kansas.

511
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,371
I have no idea.
I've never had Indian food.

512
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,707
Wow, that... I mean, that's hot.

513
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:06,835
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
Feel like I'm about to breathe fire.

514
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,001
I don't think I can eat that.

515
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,071
What? No, no, no. Come on now.
We gotta put a decent dent in this,

516
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,496
otherwise we're gonna embarrass Ollie
in front of his family.

517
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:19,063
- No, really, I can't.
- Come on, just dump it on my plate.

518
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,651
Yeah, yeah. You're good.

519
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,320
So, if you love Kansas so much,
why did you...

520
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:30,199
Why did you leave to coach a sport
you can barely... you know anything about?

521
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,279
Was it just the money?

522
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,575
Wait, I'm supposed to be getting paid?

523
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:34,828
Are you enjoying the food?

524
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,115
Tell your father-in-law it's perfect.

525
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,083
Dad! He says it's perfect!

526
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,790
Ted. What you're doing is irresponsible.

527
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,262
This club actually means something
to this town.

528
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:47,878
I know that.

529
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:48,964
I do.

530
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,131
Trent, what do you love?

531
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Is it writing?

532
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,219
- Yes.
- Yeah.

533
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,986
Well, good, 'cause you're darn good at it.

534
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,424
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

535
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,438
Me? I love coaching.

536
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,180
Now, I'm gonna say this again

537
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,834
just so you didn't think
it was a mistake the first time I said it.

538
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,028
For me,
success is not about the wins and losses.

539
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,338
It's about helping these young fellas
be the best versions of themselves

540
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,363
on and off the field.

541
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,275
And it ain't always easy, Trent,

542
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,036
but neither is growing up
without someone believing in you.

543
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:20,825
Let me ask you this.

544
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,544
Is my tongue still in my mouth?

545
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,035
'Cause I am about to hallucinate
from all the heat here.

546
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,047
I really should go.

547
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,545
- Deadlines and all.
- Hey, gotta do the work.

548
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,884
Hey, I'll say this though.

549
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,329
I really enjoyed getting to
spend this time with you, Trent.

550
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,625
You actually mean that, don't you?

551
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:40,892
Yeah.

552
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:42,894
Yeah.

553
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,557
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

554
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,105
You all right?

555
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,025
Normally, one dish is plenty,

556
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,779
but we know how
you Americans like to eat, innit?

557
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,404
Let's do it, huh?

558
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,578
Try that one.

559
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,133
- Beautiful, right?
- It's beyond beautiful. It's hot.

560
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,876
"Mrs. Which's voice was grave.

561
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,182
'What do you understand?'

562
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,471
'That it has to be me.

563
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,762
Can't be anyone else.'"

564
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,346
Fuck!

565
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,153
That's a bad word, Uncle Roy.

566
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,900
Mind your own business, Phoebe.

567
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,277
Be good.

568
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:43,996
- Yes?
- I have an advance copy of the article.

569
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,632
- Read it to me.
- Title: "Wayward Ted."

570
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:52,415
"Whatever you think of Ted Lasso
as a football coach,

571
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:56,215
I assure you,
the truth is harder to swallow."

572
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,010
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. How's your nose, Coach?

573
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,324
- It's fine. Thank you for asking.
- "And swallow you must,

574
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,057
because Ted is out there in the community

575
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,862
either bravely
or stupidly facing the music."

576
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,083
- Hey, fellas. How you doing?
- "That's for you to decide."

577
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,856
Piss off, wanker!

578
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,398
- Hi.
- Yeah.

579
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,027
- Stop it.
- Every time.

580
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,413
"And yes, he's in over his head.

581
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,701
He insisted twice that he didn't care
if Richmond won or lost.

582
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:28,247
But if the Lasso way is wrong,
it's hard to imagine being right."

583
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,134
Why have you stopped reading?

584
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:37,176
Please do me the favor of remembering that
these aren't my words, it's Trent Crimm.

585
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,050
Keep going.

586
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,511
-"In a business that celebrates ego,
- celebrates ego,

587
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,032
- Ted reins his in."
- Ted reins his in.

588
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:48,477
His coaching style is subtle.
It never hits you over the head.

589
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,612
Hello, Roy.
I didn't know it was a retirement party.

590
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:54,817
Shit!

591
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,568
Stop messing with Nate!

592
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,839
Now, I don't know
which one of you I nutted,

593
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,299
'cause I don't
see so well at night anymore,

594
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,483
but that goes for all of you!

595
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,999
Slowly growing until you can no longer
ignore its presence.

596
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,084
Vanilla vodka.

597
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,290
Such a child.

598
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,798
Keeley.

599
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:14,878
Roy.

600
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,336
Whether that means
allowing followers to become leaders,

601
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:23,313
or in a show of respect,
eating food so spicy

602
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,557
it's sure to wreak massive havoc
on his intestinal system.

603
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:27,942
Keys, keys, keys.

604
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,018
Okay, here we go. Oh boy. Oh boy.

605
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,772
And though I believe that
Ted Lasso will fail here

606
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,895
and Richmond will suffer
the embarrassment of relegation,

607
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,856
I won't gloat when it happens.

608
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,069
Because I can't help but root for him.

609
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,329
Fuck!

610
00:29:46,305 --> 00:30:46,671

2
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,658
Oh, boy.

3
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,411
Morning, fellas. Sorry I'm late.

4
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,541
Just needed to clear my head
so I decided to, you know, walk to work.

5
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,669
Turns out that clearing and walking
in a town you don't know all too well

6
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,629
can be a little tricky.

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,048
Ended up getting lost
but, you know, then I got unlost,

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,550
then I got lost again but...

9
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,262
Well, you know, now I'm here, you know.
Beard's here, Nate's here, which is great

10
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,365
because the world
can be a sad, lonely place, but...

11
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,599
Hey, come on now,
let's get to work, shall we?

12
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,767
Michelle.

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,269
Which is fine.

14
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,063
You know, it's okay,
'cause it's a great time now for me to,

15
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,858
you know, bury myself in my work here.

16
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,377
And so... Although, I'm not crazy...

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,570
I don't love the word "bury,"
you know what I mean?

18
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,780
It's just got a negative connotation
to it, don't it?

19
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,407
What's another word I could say?

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,703
Everyone loves a good bath, right?
Just a nice warm bath, right? Yeah?

21
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,706
So that's what I'll say. I'll say,
"I'm gonna bathe myself in work."

22
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,392
How 'bout that? That's good. That's good.

23
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,168
Nate, you got a favorite bath bomb, buddy?

24
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,296
No, I just don't really enjoy baths,
just 'cause my skin gets really wrinkly,

25
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,089
and I'm deeply worried about aging.

26
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:32,092
Okay, I get that. What about you, Coach?
You got a favorite bath bomb?

27
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,260
Crème brûlée honey.

28
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,613
Honey? Is that an ingredient
or something you just called me?

29
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,805
- Ingredient.
- Shoot.

30
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,600
I was hoping it was the other one.
But that's kind of a fun idea.

31
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,935
Maybe we start calling each other
little pet names.

32
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,104
You know?
Like "honey" or "babe," you know?

33
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,148
It might be nice, right?
What do you think, Coach?

34
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,376
Nate, will you do me a favor here?

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,569
Will you just help Coach
plan practice for today?

36
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,696
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- All right. Thank you, sweetie.

37
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,781
Okay, I'll see y'all in a little bit.

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,952
- Is he all right?
- No.

39
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,603
All right. Shall we?
Sarah, why don't you lead us off?

40
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,190
So, Coach Lasso.
You finally won your first match.

41
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,358
How's it feel?

42
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,161
Well, Sarah, I believe you can
outscore your opponent and still lose.

43
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,238
Just like you can score less than them
and win.

44
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,032
But last week we definitely won,
which is pretty darn fun.

45
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,535
All right, next question.

46
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,204
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

47
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,164
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,210
Is it safe to assume that Jamie Tartt
will be back on the pitch next match?

49
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,879
Well, you know what they say
when you assume, Trent?

50
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,841
You make an arse outta you and me. Yeah?

51
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,885
And that right there is another example

52
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,430
of how our English and y'all's English
sometimes do not jive, innit?

53
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,185
But are you honestly gonna keep
your best player on the bench?

54
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,814
Well, that depends on Jamie.
He knows what we need from him.

55
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,024
Let's keep it going, yeah?
Kip, come on, hit me.

56
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,361
- Ted. Just the man I wanted to see.
- Hey, boss.

57
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,364
Your decision to bench Jamie Tartt
was very brave.

58
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,491
- Thank you.
- I mean, a masterstroke.

59
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,636
I don't think we're allowed
to talk like that at work anymore.

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,012
There's just one complication now.

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,413
Manchester City have called,

62
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,082
and they've inquired
about terminating Jamie's loan.

63
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,585
- They're gonna take his house?
- No.

64
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,963
Ted, Jamie's contract is owned
by Manchester City,

65
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,299
and they, in turn,
loaned him to Richmond for the season.

66
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,134
Okay. I get it.

67
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,469
They want Jamie back
if you are planning to bench him.

68
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,139
I'm not planning on that.
No, my plan is for my plan to work.

69
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,475
But you know what they say about
the best-laid plans, right?

70
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,395
Said "plan" too many times.
Word's lost all its meaning now.

71
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,607
Plan. Plan. Plan. Doesn't matter.

72
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,443
Hey, you tell Man City
that this man has a plan.

73
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,487
- Plan. Plan. Plan?
- Plan.

74
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,989
- Plan?
- Not plan.

75
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,948
- Plan.
- Plan.

76
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,034
- Plan.
- Like "flan." Plan.

77
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,702
Flan? That dessert?

78
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,995
Yes, like "flan."

79
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,039
No, I don't dig on flan.

80
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,791
Plan. Plan.

81
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,127
Plan. Plan?

82
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,504
- Word become a sound?
- What's that called again?

83
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,130
- Semantic satiation.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,216
Okay. All right.

85
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,719
Is that new kid from Mexico here yet?

86
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,846
- He's getting treatment on his knee.
- Okay, good.

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,140
- What's his name again?
- Dani Rojas.

88
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,434
Yeah. It's a great name. Okay.

89
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,644
How's Jamie doing?

90
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,396
What?

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,775
Says he can't practice today.
Says he's hurt.

92
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,446
Oh, boy.

93
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,200
Hey, Jamie.

94
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,137
I heard you're not gonna be able
to run with us today. That true?

95
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,538
Yep.

96
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,622
Why's that?

97
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,457
'Cause I'm hurt.

98
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,669
Really sorry to hear that.

99
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,756
Relax, Ted. It's just practice.

100
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,559
Hey.

101
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,322
If you can't practice, you can't practice.

102
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,188
If you're hurt, you're hurt.
It's as simple as that.

103
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,776
But it ain't about that... at all.

104
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,574
You're sitting in here. You're supposed
to be the franchise player.

105
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,535
And yet here we are,
talking about you missing practice.

106
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,706
We're talking about practice.

107
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,833
You understand me? Practice.

108
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,377
Not a game.

109
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,047
Not a game. Not the game
you go out there and die for. Right?

110
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,733
Play every weekend
like it's your last, right?

111
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,051
No, we're talking about practice, man.

112
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,804
Practice! You know
you're supposed to be out there.

113
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,407
You know you're supposed to
lead by example.

114
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,391
You're just shoving that all aside.

115
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,895
And so here we are, Jamie.
We're talking about practice.

116
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,563
Not a game.

117
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,646
Not the game.

118
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,901
We're talking about practice,
with your team. With your teammates.

119
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,613
The only place we get to play together,
we got control over.

120
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,907
Rest of the time
it's us 11 against those 11.

121
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,618
We're talking about practice, man!

122
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:12,247
I'm talking about practice!
And you can't do it 'cause you're hurt.

123
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,708
Right?

124
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,169
It's fine by me.

125
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,838
Tell you what. Do me a favor.

126
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,215
When you get out there,

127
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,760
set up the cones so the other reserves
can do a little passing drill.

128
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,180
- You want me to set up cones?
- I really appreciate it.

129
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,392
- Colin, go set the cones up.
- I think he asked you, mate.

130
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:33,852
Was I talking to you, big man?

131
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,896
Colin, set up the cones.

132
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,732
Isaac's right. He asked you.
You are a second-teamer.

133
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,991
That's gotta sting.

134
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,120
Cheers.

135
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,336
I must say, it's quite nice seeing Jamie
put in his place for once.

136
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,255
- Thrilling even, innit?
- No, no, no.

137
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,899
This is a no schadenfreude zone,
all right?

138
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,967
- Nein schadenfreude.
- All right.

139
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,094
The new kid, what's his... Dani what?

140
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,346
- Rojas.
- Rojas, yeah. Is he any good?

141
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,908
Came here in the summer transfer window,
was immediately injured,

142
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,017
- so no one's really seen him play.
- That's okay.

143
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,704
You know, 'cause once Jamie sees
someone else playing his position,

144
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,939
you know...
I mean, it's gonna hurt his soul.

145
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,694
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't be happy about that.

146
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,155
Okay, let's be sure to help Dani
get acclimated, all right?

147
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,491
First time in this league
can be very overwhelming.

148
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,705
Dani Rojas, Rojas! Dani Rojas!

149
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:40,085
Rojas, Dani Rojas! Rojas, Rojas, Rojas!

150
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,504
Hey! Hello, coaches.

151
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,549
- Thank you for the opportunity.
- Yeah. You are a spirited fella, Dani.

152
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,861
Just go on out there,
and get the striker spot for us, okay?

153
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,763
Yes! Just like back in Guadalajara,
you say it, I do it, Coach.

154
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,557
Football is life!

155
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:58,937
I like him.

156
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,233
Jamie doesn't.

157
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,153
Chipper dickheads like that
can never back it up on the pitch.

158
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,340
Beautiful cross, Sam!

159
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,635
Football is life!

160
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,970
Oh, boy.

161
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,019
Did you see that?

162
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,438
I can't really tell,
but it seems like he's very good.

163
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,150
Cheers, again.

164
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,612
And some unemployed gaffers are asking
if we'll have an opening soon.

165
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,865
Tony Pulis. Alan Curbishley.
Harry Redknapp called three times.

166
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,745
Hi. I've been up all night
doing deep dives on all the players.

167
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,289
Did you know that Richard
was raised on a goat farm?

168
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,209
And that Isaac's mother
has two left hands?

169
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,546
And I called a couple of contacts
about some sponsorship opportunities.

170
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,214
Even got myself a little work planner.

171
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,217
You couldn't get one
without the word "unicorn" written on it?

172
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,469
Fuck off. It's adorable.

173
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,474
Sorry, I couldn't help but think
how you'd react if I told you to F off.

174
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,815
- That'll be all, Higgins.
- Of course.

175
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,276
I'm really glad to see
that you're laughing.

176
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,119
I just came by to see
if you're okay, really.

177
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,487
Why wouldn't I be?

178
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,948
Oh, Christ.
Have you not seen the news yet?

179
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,703
I really wanted to be the one
to comfort you, not to break it to you.

180
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,372
So, you remember that stunning girl, Bex?

181
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,749
The one that Rupert left with
the night of the gala?

182
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,337
Do you really want me to pretend
that she wasn't mad fit?

183
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,630
I'd appreciate it.

184
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,050
Okay, well. That hideous cow,
whose name's Bex,

185
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,137
- which is actually short for...
- Rebecca.

186
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,806
Yep, which is also your name, as you know.

187
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,225
So the press is calling her...

188
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,436
"New Rebecca." Shit.

189
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,104
Nope.

190
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,193
The press is calling her "Rebecca,"
and you're...

191
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,361
"Old Rebecca."

192
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,989
- What?
- Old Rebecca.

193
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,991
Old Rebecca?

194
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,122
Don't worry about it. You've got this.

195
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,624
And if you ever have a moment,

196
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,126
or if you don't got this,
then you just call me, right?

197
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,314
Wow! That was on purpose, yes?

198
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,024
Yeah. Look, mate.

199
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,776
You're good, yeah, but up here,

200
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,278
there's a difference
between good and great.

201
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,910
1-1. Your turn, amigo.

202
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,758
Fuck's sake.

203
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,844
Right, watch this then. Left post.

204
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,265
Wow. That was good.

205
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,308
I know.

206
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:26,937
Yeah!

207
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,738
I got lucky.

208
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,908
- Again tomorrow, Jamie Tartt?
- We'll see.

209
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,159
Football is life!

210
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,999
Dani Rojas, Rojas! Dani Rojas!

211
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,918
Oh, boy. I tell you, man.

212
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:54,339
I feel like we fell out of a lucky tree,
hit every branch on the way down,

213
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,634
ended up in a pool full of cash
and Sour Patch Kids.

214
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,345
I mean, Jamie is an ace, right?

215
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,307
You know, whose attitude
turned him into a seven of clubs.

216
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,059
So then we bring in another fella
to help turn him back into an ace

217
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,103
and then that fella ends up
being an ace himself.

218
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,605
And so now we got two aces.

219
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,609
Aces. Aces.
Oh, heck. I did it again. I'm stuck.

220
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,068
- Aces.
- That's the word, yeah?

221
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,695
- Aces.
- Aces.

222
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,178
- Ace.
- Aces? Oh, now I'm in there.

223
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,532
- See? Okay, good.
- Aces? Aces.

224
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,159
- I hope it's not contagious.
- Aces.

225
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,620
- Aces. Aces.
- Aces? Aces.

226
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,537
- Aces.
- Aces.

227
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,164
- Isis.
- No, that sounds like "ISIS."

228
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,665
I did say "ISIS." I didn't mean to.

229
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,585
Okay, what if we cloned
the lead guitarist from Kiss?

230
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,212
- You'd have two...
- Frehleys.

231
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,683
It's lovely weather we've been having,
don't you think?

232
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,310
I love this time of year.

233
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,104
- All the smells of fresh leaves.
- What's happening?

234
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,774
I was just pretending
that the two of us were on a walk.

235
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:54,858
I'm trying to read.

236
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,779
I've been doing a lot of reading myself,
actually, recently.

237
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,865
I read this mad story

238
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,785
about a kid who grew up
in a shit part of South London.

239
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:09,081
And who got sent off to play as a child
in Sunderland, of all places.

240
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,835
And who later was forced
to rap his own verse in a charity single

241
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,379
which was called
"Winner, Winner, Football Dinner."

242
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,922
That was for world hunger.

243
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,633
And I believe it was the cure.

244
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,155
How do you know all this anyway?
What are you doing now? Stalking me?

245
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,140
No. I'm reading all the players' bios.

246
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,852
Rebecca's got me in
to help with the team's PR.

247
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,980
Well, you leave me out of it.
I'm not one of your show ponies.

248
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,400
You wear a number,
trot around while people clap,

249
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,528
so I wouldn't be
too high and mighty about it.

250
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,114
Later, Roy.

251
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,203
Dani Rojas! Dani, Dani!

252
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,753
Okay.

253
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,590
Okay, okay, I don't understand.
What the heck happened, all right?

254
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,384
- Did you trip over something?
- That's the thing, Coach.

255
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,804
I did not trip over something.
Something tripped me.

256
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,931
Something not there.

257
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,480
Yeah. Okay, Doc.
Let's go get him looked at.

258
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,358
Okay. You're okay.

259
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,612
God, this is all my fault.

260
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,590
I saw Dani go into the treatment room
before training,

261
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:24,865
and I didn't say anything.

262
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,284
That was a mistake.

263
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,036
How could you not say anything?

264
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,680
Well, I hope you've all
said your goodbyes,

265
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,765
- 'cause we're never gonna see him again.
- Hey, that's enough!

266
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,459
One more person says something
that me and Beard don't understand,

267
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,702
I'm gonna have one of my son's
classic temper tantrums.

268
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,023
It's basically just him
calling me a bunch of silly names,

269
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,634
you know, like, I don't know,
"dummy head" or "poo-poo face"

270
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,136
or "poo-poo dummy" or... I don't know.
What am I missing?

271
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,930
- "Pee-pee fingers."
- "Pee-pee fingers."

272
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,681
Come on, now. Spill.

273
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:55,020
The treatment room is cursed.

274
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,855
- What?
- It's true.

275
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,107
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

276
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,110
Well, I think it has a lot to do with
grown men being embarrassed

277
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,280
to admit that they believe
in all this hoodoo, voodoo, juju business.

278
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,032
- Hey, I don't believe it.
- Okay, good.

279
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,843
Then me and you,
we're gonna go look in that room.

280
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,410
- No.
- Why not?

281
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,162
Because... No.

282
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,290
Heck! Oh, man.

283
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,168
I mean, Dani was out there,
what, an hour ago?

284
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,795
Running circles on that pitch

285
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,298
like a joyous
raven-haired golden retriever.

286
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,468
Coach, is it true in America you guys
have so many beautiful dogs in pounds

287
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,220
that some get put down for no reason?

288
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,847
That is true, Sam.

289
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,090
But it's also something a lot of female
singer-songwriters are trying to change.

290
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,937
Look, we're not gonna put Dani Rojas down.
I'll tell you that right now.

291
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,065
Gentlemen, I need you to gather up
the rest of the fellas.

292
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,861
'Cause we got ourselves
a curse to reverse.

293
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,143
What the fuck's wrong with you two?

294
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,038
The whole Richmond team's here.

295
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,041
Holy shit.

296
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,801
Hey, Coach. Jamie?

297
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,263
Okay. That's okay.

298
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,764
Hey, guys.

299
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,516
Hey, fellas. Fellas, listen up.

300
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,703
Thank you, guys, for coming out.

301
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,146
Look, I don't know a lot
about this stuff, you know.

302
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,731
I don't know about curses.

303
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,858
But I do know this,
they don't last forever.

304
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,235
Okay, look at the Boston Red Sox curse.
That's over.

305
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,487
Chicago Cubs, over.

306
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,241
Heck, even Mr. Martin Scorsese
finally won his Oscar.

307
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,535
But I think we can all agree that
The Departed

308
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,995
is not necessarily his best work.

309
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,079
- No.
- Yeah.

310
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,291
- That belongs to The Color of Money.
- No, it's Goodfellas.

311
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:43,003
- Agree to disagree.
- Nah, nah. It's Age of Innocence, bruv.

312
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,631
- Cape Fear.
- Silence!

313
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:49,009
Oi, once the word gets out
you lot are in here,

314
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,386
this place will turn into a fucking zoo.

315
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,639
And the answer's Mean Streets.

316
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,641
- Yeah. That's a good one.
- Yeah.

317
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,310
You're all here
because of this poster behind me.

318
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,436
Mr. Higgins.

319
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,856
"Are you a fast, fit, fan of football?"

320
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,733
That's solid alliteration right there.

321
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,233
Hundreds of those posters

322
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,448
were put up around Richmond
on the 18th of November, 1914.

323
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,909
It was an invitation for young men

324
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,662
to try out to be
a professional footballer.

325
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:19,454
It said to come to our stadium that day.

326
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,375
And it was a lie.

327
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,797
In 1914, the war was raging.
There was no tryout.

328
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,469
Just recruiters, waiting to encourage
those boys to fight the fight.

329
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,764
They enlisted 400 lads that day.

330
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,475
Very few of them came home.

331
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,061
And after they enlisted...

332
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,772
do you know where they went
for their physical?

333
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,191
Oh, Christ,
it's our treatment room, isn't it?

334
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,609
What are you talking about?

335
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:51,989
Hey, no, no, no. Hey, no, fellas.
No, it was not, okay?

336
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,761
It was. I'm sorry, I'm lying to ya.
I don't even know why I'm lying.

337
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,972
I'm sorry. I just wanted y'all
to take a breath for a second.

338
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,757
Wait, wait, wait. What you're telling me
is that we've got 400 ghosts?

339
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,041
That's too many ghosts.

340
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,209
We cannot fight them all.

341
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,104
We're not going
to have to fight them, Richard.

342
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,213
Wait, so, Coach, how do we fix this?

343
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,049
- We can't change the past.
- No, Sam. No, we cannot.

344
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,177
But we can choose to honor it.

345
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,346
Now, those young men,
they made the ultimate sacrifice.

346
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,516
So I think it's only fair
that we sacrifice something of our own.

347
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,352
I'm gonna ask each and every one of you
to go home tonight,

348
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,605
find something, an item.

349
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,857
Something personal.
Something that you truly value.

350
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,110
And I want you to bring it tonight
to the clubhouse, at midnight.

351
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,737
No. That is bullshit.

352
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,616
We're all going to fucking do it!

353
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,158
All right.

354
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,180
That's your captain talking right there.

355
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:45,167
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

356
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,710
Told you.

357
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:51,298
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

358
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,259
Hi, Jamie. What do you need?

359
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,555
Babe, I said it was important.
We can't go inside your house?

360
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,432
No way! We can't.

361
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,702
Sex was, like, the only thing
that you and I was good at.

362
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,187
I've had three glasses of wine.
It's Pavlovian.

363
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,273
Pavlovian? What is that? Is that the wine?

364
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:12,027
Babe, can we not at least
just get inside my car? It's cold.

365
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,863
No. You don't remember how many times
we shagged in this thing?

366
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,032
So the car's also Pavlovian?

367
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,116
Think I'm getting it now.

368
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,453
So, what's up, Jamie?

369
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,164
Fucking Ted Lasso.

370
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,208
He's really gotten up your bum, hasn't he?

371
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,168
Babe, he's not even a real coach.

372
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,979
Do you know what
we're supposed to do tonight?

373
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,799
Apparently, some bullshit sacrifice,
show-and-tell bullshit.

374
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,052
- Okay. You gonna go?
- No, 'course I'm not.

375
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,849
- Is everyone else doing it?
- Yeah, but I'm Jamie Tartt.

376
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,433
I'm not like everyone else.

377
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:48,146
Do you think that I could've got
from a council estate in North Manchester

378
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,898
to the Premier League,

379
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,109
if I did what everyone else did?

380
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,194
No. I don't.

381
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,197
You're a battler, Jamie.

382
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,449
It's really hot.

383
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,287
But maybe someday
you should stop battling the people

384
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,830
that just wanna help you.

385
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,794
I feel like you want me to come in.

386
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,254
It's Pavlovian.

387
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,423
Have a good night, Jamie Tartt.

388
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:22,764
Come in.

389
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:27,769
Excuse me, Ms. Welton. Hi, I'm Sam.
Sam Obisanya. I play for the team.

390
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,355
Yes, Sam. I know who you are.

391
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,525
Is there something I can help you with?

392
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,904
This is really awkward,
but are you free tonight?

393
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,490
Sam, I am very flattered, but...

394
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,327
No, no, no. It's not for romance.

395
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,206
It's just to get rid of this curse.
I can understand why you misinterpreted.

396
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,498
I mean, you're so lovely

397
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,834
you must get romantic invitations
all the time.

398
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:51,919
That's nice.

399
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:56,423
Gosh, I'm dealing with
my own sort of curse. Anyway, thank you.

400
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,761
I'm from Nigeria, and so I feel like
whenever the subject of curses comes up,

401
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,348
people are like, "I bet the African guy
is really into this."

402
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,683
- You're obviously not?
- No, no, no. I really am.

403
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,019
But that's mainly
from loving Harry Potter.

404
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,730
Do you know J.K. Rowling
has more money than the Queen?

405
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,981
I did.

406
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:16,265
I like the idea of someone becoming rich,
because of what they gave to the world.

407
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,918
Not just because of who their family is.

408
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,990
Well, Ms. Welton, I really hope you can
participate in this ceremony

409
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,492
that we're having later tonight.

410
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,868
I don't think so.

411
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,412
I apologize,
but I can't take no for an answer.

412
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,624
Coach thinks it will only work
if the whole team is there,

413
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,710
and Ms. Welton, it's your team.

414
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,173
So you have to be there. Please.

415
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,468
At least think about it.

416
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:43,971
For you, Sam, I will.

417
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:45,597
Thank you.

418
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,811
See you tonight.

419
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:51,895
See ya.

420
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,735
Gentlemen, I am, by nature, a believer.

421
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,321
Ghosts, spirit guides, aliens.

422
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,781
Still, I can't actually tell you

423
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,284
what lives beyond our physical world
and what doesn't.

424
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,078
What I can tell you,

425
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,913
is that with the exception

426
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,082
of the wit and wisdom
of Calvin and Hobbes,

427
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,751
not much lasts forever.

428
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,885
- Hey, boss. Glad you could join us.
- Hello. Yeah.

429
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,932
Roy, why don't you
get things started for us?

430
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,025
I was nine
when I got scouted by Sunderland,

431
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,361
and I'd never left London before.

432
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:47,951
My granddad drove me all the way there,
and it was freezing, and I was terrified.

433
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,705
I was fucking nine. Say something.

434
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:57,044
When I got there,
he gave me this old blanket.

435
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:01,632
He said it was to keep me warm
and to remind me of home.

436
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,717
And that was the last time I saw him.

437
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,804
'Cause he'd passed away by the time
I got back for Christmas, so...

438
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:13,310
That is why blankie means so much to me.

439
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,686
Did you just say "blankie"?

440
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,523
No, I said "blanket."
Conversation over. Sam, go.

441
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:22,110
This is a picture
of the 1994 Nigerian World Cup team.

442
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:26,240
I pledged I wouldn't take this down
until I made the team myself...

443
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,700
and I still intend to do that.

444
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,998
This sand is from a beach in St. Barts.

445
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,711
This is the first beach where I ever...

446
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,924
It's the first beach where I ever slept
with a supermodel.

447
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,640
- Smile because it happened.
- Thanks.

448
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,323
Sam and Richard coming at ya
from both ends of the spectrum there.

449
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,394
Appreciate that.

450
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,941
A girl once said I look like Clive Owen
in these sunglasses.

451
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,236
I don't think I can do it.

452
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,756
- Come on, Nate. Throw 'em in.
- You got it, Nate. Give it a toss.

453
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,282
- Nice.
- Good boy, Nate.

454
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:09,992
Thank you. Thank you.

455
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,915
Is that today's paper?

456
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:20,669
There's something in there about me,
as usual, and I'm trying not to care.

457
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,881
Fuck the haters.

458
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,467
Word.

459
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:31,972
This is my cat's collar.
She was a faithful companion for 20 years.

460
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,767
Gonna miss you, Cindy Clawford.

461
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,229
It's the only pen
I can write my name with.

462
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,043
The keys to my Lamborghini.

463
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,129
How you getting home?

464
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,591
- All right. Everybody go?
- Yeah.

465
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,344
- Yeah.
- No. I wanna go.

466
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:23,148
These aren't my first boots or anything.
My mum gave 'em me.

467
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,402
She was the one who got me into football
in the first place.

468
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:32,324
Her and me dad split up
when I was just a sexy little baby.

469
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,328
She's the reason I work so hard.
Just wanted to make her proud.

470
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,414
She doesn't even care if I'm any good.

471
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:42,084
Just wants me to be happy. Be a good lad.

472
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:47,506
Once I got good though, me old man
started showing up, didn't he?

473
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,259
You know, bragging to all his mates
every time I scored a goal.

474
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:56,139
Calling me "soft" if I didn't...
dominate, you know.

475
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,766
And I hated that.

476
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,270
I actually fucking hated that.

477
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:09,361
So, I made a vow to be so tough
that he could never call me "soft" again.

478
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,575
I wonder if sometimes...

479
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,202
I forget about making her proud.

480
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,957
I don't think that she would be lately.

481
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,180
Well, gentlemen...

482
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,934
What do you say we burn this crap?

483
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,936
Maybe we should do this part outside.

484
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,188
- Yeah.
- That's a good call.

485
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,272
Yeah. That's smart. Okay.

486
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,232
Hey, would you guys mind
grabbing this for me?

487
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,326
Excuse me, Ted. The eagle has landed.

488
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,537
Hey, fellas.

489
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:04,082
I think the only way to know
if the curse has been lifted or not,

490
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,710
we need to ask the spirits for a sign.

491
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:09,713
Spirits...

492
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:12,925
speak to us.

493
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,182
Dani Rojas! Rojas! Dani Rojas.

494
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:26,563
I brought a bottle of mezcal
to throw into the curse fire.

495
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,565
Hey, hey, hey. Rojas, look.

496
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,984
Whatever ghosts it were
that made you trip over,

497
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,903
they're gone now, I promise, yeah.

498
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,321
Crack that bastard open.

499
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,448
- Yeah, boy!
- Yeah.

500
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:40,369
Jamie's not wrong. Ghosts prefer
empty bottles that we've all drunk.

501
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,787
Fact.

502
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,039
Let us celebrate, amigos.

503
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,502
That is a team united.

504
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,506
You're very lucky that everything's fine
with Dani's injury.

505
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,050
I just never had you pegged
as a gambler, Ted.

506
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:58,679
I'm not. We knew Dani's okay hours ago.

507
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,306
In fact, it was my man Higgins' idea

508
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,434
not to share that info with the boys
until after the ceremony.

509
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,563
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

510
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,648
Putting the team first, eh, Higgins?

511
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,567
Yeah, I suppose I am.

512
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,694
Hey, Coach, you joining the party or what?

513
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:17,698
What do you say, boss?
A lot warmer over there by the fire.

514
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,868
I'll respectfully pass.

515
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,454
Higgins, coming with me?

516
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,666
Off you go.

517
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,046
All right now, what's this going on?

518
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,007
What's going on here? What's going on?

519
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,884
Richmond till we die.

520
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,760
We're Richmond till we die.

521
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:42,306
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

522
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,559
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

523
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,812
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

524
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:52,065
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

525
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,527
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

526
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,655
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

527
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:01,992
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

528
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,662
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

529
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:08,665
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

530
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,834
Morning. How y'all doin'?

531
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,341
Hey. That's cool.

532
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:21,261
Oh, boy. Here we go.

533
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,599
I got it.

534
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,269
Interception. Easy, gentlemen, easy.

535
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,272
Good morning, honey bunch.

536
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,942
You hear that buzz out there? I love it.

537
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,109
How you doing?

538
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:39,988
You got rid of Jamie?

539
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,449
Man City recalled him.

540
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,552
I told you, Ted.
They were concerned he wasn't playing.

541
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,161
I finally got through to him!

542
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,247
I mean, you saw it.

543
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,875
With him and Dani,
we had two aces, Rebecca.

544
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,795
- I thought that was what you wanted.
- Yeah, well, you thought wrong!

545
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,941
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for my tone there,
okay. That was rude.

546
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:02,636
Look, I'm trying to be cool about this,
but I am just seeing red everywhere.

547
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,597
Well, perhaps you should leave
before you say something you'll regret.

548
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,601
No, actually, you know what? Here you go.

549
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:11,186
Your biscuits.

550
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,146
I hope they're not as good
as they usually are.

551
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,900
But dang it, they're the best batch yet.
I finally cracked the recipe!

552
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,034
Coach?

553
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,790
Football is life.

554
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:34,814

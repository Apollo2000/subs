[exhales]

00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,564
I'm sorry about this.

6
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,896
Don't you dare apologize. Thanks to you,
we can afford to get the other car fixed.

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,243
Tell him, boys.

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,337
- Bye, Dad.
- It's all right, Dad.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,241
Whatever.

[chuckles]

11
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,655
- Love you.
- Love you, darling.

12
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:35,538
Ooh, and... and tell your boss
I hope she gets heart disease.

13
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,659
Ooh. Oh.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,710
- Morning, Ted.
- Hey, Higgins...

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
- [grunts]
- [boys] Ooh!

16
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,844
[boy] Is he dead?

00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,878
[song fades]

18
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,052
I mean, you know, it's my fault
for staring at my phone.

19
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,131
I just can't stop
checking on my family's flight.

20
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,028
You know, I haven't shared this
with too many folks,

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,682
but, um, Michelle and I,
we've been having some marital issues.

22
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,734
Ted, you really don't have to
talk about this if you don't want to.

23
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,809
Oh, I don't mind.

24
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,935
Tried couples therapy.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,456
Didn't like the other couple though.

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,360
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,026
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

28
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,990
Yeah, you know, our therapist
gave us this code word to use.

29
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,121
So if either of us says "Oklahoma,"

30
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,408
the other one has to tell
the God's honest truth.

31
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,372
Yeah, you know, it's pretty helpful.

32
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,662
Did ruin the musical for me though.
[chuckles]

33
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,183
So now every time I hear,
"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin',"

34
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,297
or, uh... what...
"Surrey with the Fringe on Top," or...

35
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,955
- "Shall We Dance?"
- No, that's from King and I.

36
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,723
Anyway, if I hear any of those tunes,

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,640
I immediately think about
my wife telling me

38
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,099
that my constant optimism is too much.
[chuckles]

39
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,192
And this... sharing of feelings

40
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,650
is 'cause I opened up to you
about my ex-husband at the gala.

41
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,060
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,518
Well, that's a lesson learned.

43
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,778
[Ted] Oh, come on now.

44
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,649
I bet deep down you kinda dig
we're getting so close, right?

45
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:52,857
I do.

46
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,696
- Oklahoma?
- I do not.

47
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,821
Mm-hmm.

48
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,988
[theme music plays]

49
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,353
Jamie?

50
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,807
You up?

51
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,357
Hello?

52
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,778
Is, uh, is Jamie here?

53
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,820
Oh, my God. You're Keeley Jones.

54
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,574
[chuckles] Yeah, I am.

55
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,449
Hi, Jamie.

56
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,997
No, no, no. No. You can't get mad.
You broke up with me.

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,620
Like, 24 hours ago.

58
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,166
How long's a man meant to be alone?

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,090
What am I supposed to do?
Shower by myself?

60
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,997
Sorry, can I just say,
I'm your biggest fan.

61
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,008
I follow your Insta,
your Snap, everything.

62
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,010
Wow, thank you.

63
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,839
And, Jamie, thank you.

64
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,811
Whenever I break up with someone,
I spend months questioning it,

65
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,349
wondering if I made
a huge fucking mistake.

66
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,313
But you have really helped me to feel good
about this decision, just by...

67
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,277
being you.

68
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,775
You're welcome.

69
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,442
What?

70
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,488
You said I made you feel good
about your decision.

71
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,530
- Yeah.
- Did you mean it?

72
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,697
- Yes.
- Well, then you're welcome.

73
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,123
I like to make people feel good.

74
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,164
- Mm.
- [Jamie] Mm.

75
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,268
You still gonna be around
for the promo shoot later?

76
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,792
Oh, the promo shoot
that I've spent weeks setting up for you?

77
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,545
Yes.

- [snaps fingers]
- [laughs]

00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,593
It was nice to meet you.

Yes, Jamie! Jamie, Jamie!

84
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,150
Jamie, I'm open. Jamie!

85
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,585
- What are you doing? That was going in.
- Well, we'll never know.

86
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,962
Jamie, how many times I gotta tell you
to make the extra pass?

87
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,696
Come on. Sam was more open than the jar
of peanut butter on my kitchen counter.

88
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,885
- [player] What? What's he talking about?
- [players murmur]

89
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,429
Oh, that's right. Y'all don't know
I like to keep the peanut butter open.

90
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,931
That way, whenever I walk by,
I can just stick my finger in there.

91
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,955
Oh.

92
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,168
- It's a fucking good idea, to be fair.
- Yeah, it is.

93
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,960
Now look, when Sam is that open,
you gotta pass to him, okay?

94
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:16,255
But why?
Even when Sam's open, Sam is still shit.

95
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,929
I heard my name. What did he say?

96
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,757
- Don't worry about it.
- Oh, okay.

97
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,483
Guys, we gotta play like a team tomorrow.

98
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,973
Otherwise we're gonna
get our butts kicked. Extra passes.

99
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,677
We're gonna keep doing this
until we get it right. Let's go.

100
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,018
[Henry] Dad!

101
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,483
Practice is canceled.

102
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,986
That is a lot longer run
than he thinks, though.

103
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,084
Metaphor.

104
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,120
- [Ted] Hey!
- Daddy!

105
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,724
I kinda thought y'all would meet me
halfway, but hey, that's all right.

106
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,708
- Hey, buddy!
- Helicopter!

107
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,882
Oh, you got it. [grunts] Two spins.
[chuckles] How about that?

108
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,565
Boy, you're gonna be a dizzy fella there.

109
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,969
- Slower helicopter.
- No way. Come on now.

110
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,760
[both laughing]

111
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,845
[sighs] I missed you so much.

112
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,310
[Henry] Group hug.

113
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,640
Hey! There he is.

114
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,234
Hey, big guy. Look how tall you got.
What the heck?

115
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,731
And look at this. I mean, you, what...
You got teeth now?

116
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,154
- I already had teeth!
- And you can talk!

117
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,073
Also, Ms. Welton, sorry to report,

118
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,201
but this weekend's match
will not be completely sold out.

119
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,741
Not a surprise. We've lost four matches
in a row, and we're facing relegation.

120
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,828
But why be sorry?

121
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,751
I think it's all going rather smashingly.

122
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,171
- [door opens]
- Uh...

123
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:38,671
I'm happy to be the new brand ambassador
for Darsteiner.

The favorite beer of Jamie Tartt.

125
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,255
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Get my tats.

126
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,097
Get that one. It's very important to me.

- What?

128
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,896
- [whispers] Just drink the beer.
- [Jamie] Yeah.

129
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,940
No judgment,
but are you back with that twat?

130
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,153
Bon appétit.

131
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,903
No. We're done.
God, I love that you care though.

132
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,738
I'll kiss you on the mouth
if I can reach those lips.

133
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,988
You know, I put this whole thing together.
I get 10%.

134
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,615
Hey, do you like mythology?

135
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,952
You've seen a unicorn.
You ever seen a brewnicorn?

136
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,998
[neighs, sputters]

137
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,535
- That's fucking funny.
- Oh, no.

138
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,626
What's that? It's my beerby.

139
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,051
- Come on.
- Okay.

140
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,009
Y'all getting all this for free.
Not even extra for that.

141
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,090
- Keeley.
- Hmm?

142
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,175
If any of the other players
needed some branding work done,

143
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,311
is that something you'd be interested in?

144
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,574
I don't want you to offer me a job

145
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,534
just 'cause I was nice to you
in the loo the other night.

146
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,098
Why not? Men give each other jobs
in toilets all the time.

147
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,977
[laughs] Yeah, they do.

148
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,574
- [laughs]
- I meant employment. Like job-jobs.

149
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,321
- So not hand, or blow, or foot?
- Foot?

150
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,493
Oh, you're right.
Technically it would be... feet, right?

151
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,118
[stammers] Just give it a thought.
Unless you want to carry on doing...

152
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,998
What is it you do again?

153
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,837
I'm sort of famous
for being almost famous.

154
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,554
Excellent.

155
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,166
- Maybe think of it as a plan B.
- Yeah.

156
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,394
Okay, now,
little tip for y'all, all right?

157
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,929
Fries are called "chips."
Chips are called "crisps."

158
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,434
And "bangers" aren't great songs,

159
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,647
but they do make you feel like dancing
'cause they're so darn tasty.

160
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,188
When you gonna win a game,
you fucking wanker?

161
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,403
Hey, Baz. Fellas.
Uh, this here... This is my wife, Michelle.

162
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,614
Absolute pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Lasso.

163
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,735
Nice recovery. Well executed.

164
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,591
- Yeah, coach's wife. She's heard it all.
- Yeah.

165
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,695
Hi, Ted. Hello, young man.

166
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:36,253
Here are the darts. There's the board.
Try not to hit any regulars.

167
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,252
[Ted] Yeah, go have fun.

168
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,753
- Your table's this way.
- Go on. After you.

169
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,296
- Three fish-and-chips?
- Yes, please. And two pints.

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,010
- I like your style.
- [Ted] Yeah.

171
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,090
[both chuckle]

172
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,176
Look at this. [stammers]

173
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,730
Do they, um, wrap the fish-and-chips
in newspaper? I read they do that here.

174
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,439
No, no. I wish. Boy, I'd love that.
Having my food teach me stuff?

175
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,441
Yeah, that's your dream scenario, right?

176
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,573
A doughnut
that knows about Rosa Parks or something.

177
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,360
- Yeah. Exactly, yeah.
- Yeah.

178
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,654
- Can fit a lot of wisdom just in the hole.
- Mm.

179
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,321
Yeah.

180
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,492
Oh. You already done, bud?

181
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,286
Yeah, he probably should be.

182
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,499
Ooh. Well, I'm sorry about that.

183
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,750
Happens all the time.

184
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,090
- What are you doing?
- I'm just curious, yeah?

185
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,147
The photographer's gonna
send me over the pictures,

186
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,107
and I'll just kill the ones
where you look like shit.

187
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,358
Then I'll send them over to you.

188
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,592
Uh, firstly, babe, there won't be any
where I look like shit because...

189
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,635
And B, why don't you just
bring them over to my place

190
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
and we can look at them together?

191
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,063
Maybe we're naked.

192
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,063
Oh... [chuckles]

193
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,475
Hard no. Thank you again, Jamie.

194
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,320
Smart move.

195
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,486
Excuse me?

196
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,202
I have to hang out with that prick.

197
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,492
The fact that you would choose
to be with him is frankly mind-blowing.

198
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,367
I'm not with him. We broke up.

199
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,374
We're working together, actually.
And who asked you anyway, huh?

200
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,457
Right.

201
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,378
I didn't know that, so... apologies.

202
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,132
No, it's fine.
You should definitely weigh in on my life.

203
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,965
I'll make sure that I text you
anytime I have to make a decision, yeah?

204
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,889
It's just that in training,
Sam was wide open,

205
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,604
and Jamie wouldn't pass to him.

206
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,234
But Sam was wide open.

207
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,477
Now that's what I'm dealing with.

208
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,573
[phone chimes]

209
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:29,819
Yes.

210
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,772
- [Henry] Here it is.
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,158
Yeah. Okay. Now, hold on a second.

212
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,326
Think we might have missed a page.
Oh, boy.

213
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,964
Don't you wanna go
ride a real double-decker bus?

214
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,631
After we finish.

215
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,670
Mm-hmm. See? I like that.

216
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,883
First we gotta build it,
then we can ride it.

217
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,634
It's kind of a Field of Dreams paradigm.

218
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,087
[chuckles] Okay.

219
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,136
Well, six hands are better than four.

220
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,095
[soul music playing]

221
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,406
[song continues]

222
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,537
[song fades]

223
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,669
[Ted] Good morning.

224
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,053
Hey, how you doing?

225
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,302
- Hey, look at that scarf. I like it.
- Oi! Wanker.

226
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,215
Don't you fuck up the match.

227
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,724
I appreciate you.
We'll see what happens, huh?

228
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,190
Hey, check it out.

229
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,230
You never...
Never seen one of these before.

230
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,944
That right there, that's a scone, okay?

231
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,337
It's like a muffin, except
it sucks all the spit out of your mouth.

232
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,571
There's your breakfast. All right?
Hey! What do you say?

233
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,945
Thanks, Dad!

234
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,741
Okay. There you go.
Some people's kids, holy moly.

235
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,166
- It's pretty nice out there, isn't it?
- Oh. Yeah.

236
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,883
- Hey.
- I can make us some breakfast.

237
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,133
What's wrong?

238
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,384
Nothing. I think I'm just
a little jet-lagged is all.

239
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,626
I-I'm fine, Ted.

240
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,612
No, no, no, no. No.
Michelle, you gotta talk to me.

241
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,136
Okay? Hey, hey. Oklahoma.

242
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,645
Every day...

243
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:33,106
I wake up hoping that
I'll feel the way I felt in the beginning.

244
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:37,236
But... But maybe that's
just what marriage is, right?

245
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,579
I'll keep trying. You know I will.

246
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,157
Ready to go!

247
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,667
[clears throat, chuckles]

248
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,104
- I mean, you're gonna need pants, kiddo.
- [Michelle] Yeah.

249
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,048
- You know...
- Let's get some pants. Come on.

250
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,509
[exhales]

251
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,233
I mean, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

252
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,311
Marriage.
Just so, you know, so complicated.

253
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,305
So many different challenges and...

254
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,568
I think... I don't know. [stammers] Sorry.

255
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,860
You ever been married?

256
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,113
Ha!

257
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,450
Yeah, Nate.
Coach's views on romantic relationships

258
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,911
are not too dissimilar
from his views on cooking steak.

259
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,372
You know, you spend any more than
five minutes on one, loses its flavor.

260
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,714
- That sound about right, Coach?
- Yeah.

261
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,789
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question then?

262
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,785
Fire away.

263
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,270
If you were worried
about your relationship,

264
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,094
then why did you fly 4,438 miles away?

265
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,763
That is a very specific number
to know off the top of your head.

266
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,722
Oh, well, uh,
my dad used to be a cartographer.

267
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,468
Used to say I was .001 miles tall.

268
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,306
[chuckles]

269
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,521
Yeah. Well, it's a good question.
Why do it?

270
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,694
I think at some point I realized

271
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,493
that me being around so much
was doing more harm than good.

272
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,203
Like, anytime I tried
to solve any of her problems, or...

273
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,159
do something sweet for her,
it just would backfire.

274
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,251
And then she and this therapist
we were working with

275
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:15,803
decided that maybe the best thing to do
would be to give her a little space.

276
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,759
And so, um...
well, I gave her 4,400 and, um...

277
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,843
Thirty-eight.

278
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,184
Thirty-eight miles worth of it.

279
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,474
[knocking]

280
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,687
Sorry to interrupt.
I was told one of you had my phone.

281
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,305
Ah. Thank heavens.

282
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,726
I deleted some apps
to optimize performance.

283
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,355
Not Battleships, I hope.

284
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,571
Ah. Oh, well.
I was playing that too much anyway.

285
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,322
I'll leave you lads
to your match day planning.

286
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,275
Now, well, hold your horse there, amigo.

287
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,155
You mind if I get your take on something?

288
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,292
Wow, of course. Uh...

289
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:52,039
Very exciting to be, uh, invited
into the inner sanctum.

290
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,214
Um, Team Lasso, as it were.

291
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,594
You and the missus.
Y'all been together a while, yeah?

292
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,175
- Oh, yes, uh, 28 years.
- Oh.

293
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,468
Five boys, three dogs,

294
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:07,392
one 20-year-old cat whose impending death
will wreck me emotionally,

295
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,602
and, uh, one small house
that manages to fit us all in it.

296
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,689
Sounds like a full life right there.

297
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,570
But I assume y'all have had your
fair share of hard times though, yeah?

298
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:20,857
Did you not hear the five boys,
tiny house, dying cat part?

299
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,204
[mewls]

300
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,659
[chuckles]

301
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,966
That's the thing though, isn't it?

302
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,950
If you're with the right person,
even the hard times are easy.

303
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,867
- Mm-hmm.
- [Ted whistles]

304
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:36,075
Someone call 911.
I want to report a truth bomb.

305
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,837
- I think... think they do 999 here.
- [Nathan] It is 999.

306
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,399
- [Higgins] Yes. It is, yeah.
- [Ted] For emergencies?

307
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,013
Boy, that seems troublesome to me.

308
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,431
You know,
toddlers and, just, butt dials and...

309
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,696
- Oh, 'cause it's one key.

- [Coach Beard] Yeah.

312
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,619
- Well, that happens a lot, doesn't it?
- It does. Yeah, yeah.

313
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,693
- That explains it, actually.
- There you have it.

Get in a fucking circle.

00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,527
'Cause I'm trying to think of a reason
you didn't put your hand in

326
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,471
with the rest of the team.

327
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:27,592
Didn't want to.

328
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,678
Mm-hmm.

329
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,700
I gotta say, man, sometimes you remind me
of my grandma with the channel hopper.

330
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,234
You just push all the wrong buttons.

00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:39,146
Well, then how's about
you and me make a deal?

332
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,611
Okay, I'm listening.

333
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:44,571
You get to keep on preaching
all of your yeehaw bullshit,

334
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:49,833
and in exchange, I'll keep ignoring you,
because this team is tragic.

00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,253
I score all the goals,
and I'm the only one they come to see.

00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,827
Does that sound fair? Hands in.

337
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,644
You know, I'd love to hash out
some of the nuances there,

He has Obisanya on the right.

No, he's doing it himself.

And you have to say he got off easy there.
And Obisanya is still down.

There you go.

Kent and Tartt

- [Chris] No, but I've wanted to.

403
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,932
[Arlo] We haven't seen this
since 2001 in Newcastle.

404
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:01,102
And a season of lows for Richmond
sinks even further still.

Honestly, it doesn't even hurt anymore.

No. Listen.

Tartt steps up to take the free kick,
with an opportunity to tie the game.

00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,387
Will he find a teammate or go for glory?

420
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,484
With Tartt, that's usually
a rhetorical question.

from Ted Lasso there.

So whatever you decide,
you have my full support.

00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,287
He's taking off his best player.

461
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,836
And with less than a minute remaining
in the half.

462
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,940
- Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!
- [announcer] Number 16, Robbie Roberts,

463
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,514
for number 9, Jamie Tartt.

464
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,527
Hey, way to play out there.
Way to get us back in.

465
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:43,971
Shut up. Fucking stupid twat.

466
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,474
[chanting continues]

467
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,676
[Arlo] The referee looks at his watch,
and that's halftime.

468
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,597
What kind of reception awaits Lasso
in his locker room?

469
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,321
[players murmuring]

470
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,616
Oi, sit down and listen.

471
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,066
[Ted] We got ourselves a tied game.

472
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,335
Nice work.

473
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:23,085
Fellas, we're broken. We need to change.

474
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:25,757
And, look, I know change can be scary.

475
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:29,766
One minute, you're playing freeze tag
out there at recess with all your buddies.

476
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,230
Next thing you know,
you're getting zits, your voice gets low.

477
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:36,612
And every time your art teacher,
Ms. Scanlon, leans over your desk

478
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,190
to check and see how your project's going,
you feel all squiggly inside.

479
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,742
[chuckles]

480
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,529
Mm.

481
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:48,541
She was a striking woman.
Not classically beautiful, but striking.

482
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,459
- First time I ever saw tan lines.
- [players chuckle]

483
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,638
Most of the time, change is a good thing.

484
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,289
Now, I think that's what it's all about.

485
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,337
Embracing change.

486
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,256
Being brave.

487
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:06,851
Doing whatever you have to,
so that everyone in your life...

488
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,965
can move forward with theirs.

489
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,017
'Cause maybe...

490
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,806
it's the only way
you can truly help her be happy.

491
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,411
Obviously by "her,"
I'm referring to Lady Football.

492
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,872
Good save.

493
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,834
Sam, we're gonna shift you to midfield
for the second half.

494
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,173
And Beard's gonna walk y'all
through the rest of the changes.

495
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,961
Oh, hey, hey, hey. One last thing.

496
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,444
And I want everyone's eyes on me
when I say this. Look at me.

497
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,595
[player claps hands]

498
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
[chattering]

499
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,975
- Never really liked Tartt.
- [Sam] We know, Roy.

500
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,479
Everybody, come on.

501
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,809
[Arlo] Two minutes
of added time remaining.

502
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,017
Still level at two goals apiece.

503
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,608
Richmond have played well,
even without Jamie Tartt.

504
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:04,704
[Ted] Here we go.

505
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,777
Oh, he's open. He's open. He's open.
There you go.

506
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:10,735
[Arlo] A through ball from Cockburn.
And Kent is off to the races!

507
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,696
Come on!

508
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,365
Kent has only one man to beat.

509
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,913
He could take it himself,

510
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:20,538
but he makes the extra pass
to a wide open Obisanya!

511
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,339
- Oh! And he buries it!
- [cheering]

512
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,144
Oh, my God! Whoo!

513
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,930
[Arlo] Richmond take the lead with
barely a minute of stoppage time left.

514
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:45,943
[announcer] Scorer for Richmond's
third goal, number 24, Sam Obisanya.

515
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:51,197
- [whistle blows]
- [cheering]

516
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,957
[Ted] Yeah!

517
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,919
- I'm so sorry! I'm just so happy!
- No, I love it! I love this energy!

518
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,710
- Here, Coach. Take this guy from me.
- Oh, yeah!

519
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,014
[cheering, applause]

520
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,066
[Ted] That's the way you do it!

521
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,260
Nicely done, gentlemen! Nicely done!
Way to do it! Yes! Yes! Yes!

522
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,260
Took balls, what you did.

523
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,717
[announcer, indistinct]

524
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,476
That's all we got is balls, Roy.
It's all we got.

525
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,559
All right! Yeah!
There you go. Way to play.

526
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,726
- [crowd chanting, clapping]
- How about that, Coach?

527
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,780
You hear that, Coach?

528
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,442
- [chanting] Wanker! Wanker!
- [rhythmic clapping]

529
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,238
[Ted] Well, same word, ain't it?

530
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,989
- [Coach Beard] Yeah, but different.
- [chanting, clapping continues]

531
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,285
Yeah, kinda like back in the '80s
when bad meant good, right?

532
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,408
Who was president back then?

533
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:43,292
- Ronald Reagan.
- "Ronald Reagan? The actor?"

534
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:48,167
Oh, man. I love it when you do Doc Brown.
You walked me right into that.

535
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,547
[chanting, clapping continues]

536
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,812
Daddy! Dad!

537
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,642
Hey! There he is!

538
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,437
Yoo-hoo-hoo!

539
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,311
How about that, huh? We won one.

540
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,398
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

541
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,822
What's a wanker?

542
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,646
Well, kiddo. That is a, uh...

543
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,824
That's a man that likes to be alone
with his thoughts. Make sense?

544
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,287
Let's give you a better view
of all this. Ready? [grunts]

545
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,179
- Get up there, kiddo. Look at that.
- [crowd cheering]

546
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,873
Wave to the people. That's it.
Let them know. Let them see, huh?

547
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:24,417
[cheering continues]

548
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,251
Oh, shit.

549
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,381
[girl] Yeah.

550
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
One touch.

551
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,178
I just keep thinking about
the first time we met, back at school.

552
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,597
[Michelle chuckles]

553
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,444
Us being the only two people in that big
old parking lot at the exact same time.

554
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,072
[Ted chuckles]

555
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,652
So random.

556
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:53,606
No way for us to know that it was going
to be the start of something.

557
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,527
[shouts] Oh!

558
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,026
- Hey.
- Did I scare you?

559
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,907
You snuck up on a woman
in a parking lot at night. [chuckles]

560
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,672
Yeah, Roy, well done. [chuckles]

561
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:06,789
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.
I was also an idiot yesterday, so...

562
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
It's okay.

563
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,426
Good night, Keeley.

564
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,638
Good night, Roy.

565
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,517
[Ted] I look back at everything
we've been through,

566
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,230
and I wouldn't change a single thing.

567
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,272
Even now.

568
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,527
What are you saying?

569
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,781
Michelle, if there is something
I could... do

570
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:39,494
or something I could say
that would make you be happy...

571
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,077
just being with me, I'd do it.

572
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,373
I'd do it in a nanosecond.

573
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,626
But I ain't got no control
over any of that.

574
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:47,708
[sniffles]

575
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,669
You don't have to keep trying anymore.

576
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,172
It's okay.

577
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I'm gonna be okay. Yeah?

578
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,429
[sniffles]

579
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:02,644
[Henry, girl laughing]

580
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,351
[girl] Okay, quick feet. There we go.

581
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:08,437
[Ted] Shoot.

582
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,522
[sighs]

583
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:13,364
I promised myself
I would never quit anything in my life.

584
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,489
But you're not quitting, Ted.

585
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,368
You're just letting me go.

586
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,409
[sniffles, exhales]

587
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:24,912
Yeah.

588
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,497
[girl laughs] Come on.

589
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,173
- Oh.
- [Michelle clears throat]

590
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,054
[girl] You ready?

591
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,565
- [Ted] Yeah.
- [Michelle] Yes. Thank you.

592
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,829
- It's all right.
- I appreciate you, Shannon. Thank you.

593
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:39,553
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna see you
the second after the season's over, okay?

594
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,346
And we're gonna talk every day?

595
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,930
Absolutely. Just like we do, big guy.
You know it. Okay?

596
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,306
Well, gimme a hug, please. Yeah.

597
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,613
Okay now, okay.

598
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:55,404
- Hey, I love you. Go ahead, get on.
- [Michelle chuckles]

Oi, wanker. Good job tonight.

605
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,718
Thank you, sir.

606
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:08,426
Keep an eye on us.
We might be turning this thing around.

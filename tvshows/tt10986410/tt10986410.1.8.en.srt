Hello, <i>mon cher.</i>

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,439
Coach! Over here.

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,527
Oh.

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,570
Thank God.

8
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,239
[Sam] Z-man, Dani.

00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,866
[speaking French]

10
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,537
- He looks like a beautiful angel-man.
- [Sam laughs]

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,250
Good morning, sunshine.

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,668
You okay?

13
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,128
Oh, I didn't want to miss the bus,
so I just slept in here.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,630
Sorry, I'm gonna vomit. Sorry.

15
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,419
[muffled] Oh... Oh, my God.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,743
[whispers] Wait. What am I doing?
This is my fucking room.

17
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,352
Oi! Out.

18
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:05,858
[Sassy] Hey, you.

19
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,694
Hey. Good morning.

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,529
I... I got you a coffee.

21
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,155
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,323
You been up long?

23
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,325
Um... hour or two.

24
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,161
You know? I guess three hours total.

25
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,539
Last night was fun.

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,876
Oh, yeah. Five stars. Certified fresh.

27
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,337
- Mm. Have you got to go?
- Uh, yeah.

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,923
But, you know, you don't need
to rush out or anything.

29
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,758
I got you a late checkout.

30
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,595
Oh. That's very thoughtful of you.

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,555
Go on then. You go.

32
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,931
I'm gonna go back to sleep,

33
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,894
and then I'm gonna order
a huge breakfast on your tab.

34
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,979
- That's a pro move right there. Yeah.
- [chuckles]

35
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,440
Hey, I'll be your Underhills anytime.
[chuckles]

36
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,943
Okay. Well, um...
I'll see you around, I guess.

37
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,904

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,651
[Coach Beard] Coach.

40
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,363
Hey, Coach.

41
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,740
- Coach.
- Yeah?

42
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,825
- Something on your mind, Coach?
- No, why?

43
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,370
We just had a five-hour bus ride
where you didn't talk a lick,

44
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,455
and that's a record by about five hours.

45
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,292
[clears throat]

46
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,170
Okay, look. I'm gonna tell you something

47
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,357
but then I don't wanna talk about it
ever again, okay?

48
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,966
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

49
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,489
I don't want to make jokes about it.

50
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,970
I don't want you giving me
any knowing glances.

51
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,493
- You know what I mean? Okay.
- Okay.

52
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,139
Um...

53
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,642
Last night, I, uh...

54
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,187
I slept with Rebecca's friend Sassy.

55
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,942
- Want to talk about it?
- I'd love to. Yeah. Immediately.

56
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,405
There you are.

57
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,156
I thought this room was haunted.

58
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,409
No. We sorted that.

59
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,786
Is now a good time?

60
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,139
Yeah. You can come in.
She can't hear anything with those in.

61
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,164
You sure?

62
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,626
Gail, you think the royal family
are lizards, right?

63
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,256
- [Roy groans]
- Twenty-three. So young.

64
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,674
What's she listening to?

65
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,467
Always murder podcasts.

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,805
Last night was crazy.

67
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,975
Right, yeah. It was pretty sloppy.

68
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:50,022
[exhales] I could really use a bucket
of coffee to nurse this hangover.

69
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,943
Do you wanna go get one with me
when you're done?

70
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,696
Not today. I can't. I'm busy.

71
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,989
He's lying.

72
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,534
Right. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave,

73
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,638
'cause she's about to go to town on my
hamstrings and I make a lot of noises,

74
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,414
and I don't like people hearing my noises.

75
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,708
Cool. All right.
I'll see you around, yeah?

76
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,376
Okay.

77
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,504
[grunts, whines]

78
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,757
'Cause, look, it's just not something
I've ever done before, okay?

79
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,260
And look, I got no judgment on people
that have one-night stands, okay?

80
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:24,473
I mean, if you are, you know, nuts
for butts, have at it. That's what I say.

81
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,682
Coach, did you have fun?

82
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,393
Oh, come on, Coach.
I don't like all that kiss-and-tell stuff.

83
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,021
Coach, did you have fun?

84
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,359
And did she have fun?

85
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,156
Mm. Yeah, that movement's,
uh, making me feel queasy.

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,009
- [groans]
- Okay. So, then what's the problem?

87
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,744
I mean, maybe I just haven't really
come to peace with the fact

88
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:50,082
that I went from having a mental breakdown
at a karaoke joint in Liverpool

89
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,543
to, uh, you know,
sleeping with a woman I just met.

90
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,087
And then somewhere in between there,
getting a divorce.

91
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,798
- Well, it makes sense to me.
- I must say that this is lovely.

92
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,633
Ever since I was little,

93
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,903
I always used to dream
about sitting down with a bunch of mates

94
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,167
talking about the complex dynamics
between men and women.

95
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,077
Okay, here's another question for y'all.
Uh, should I tell Rebecca?

96
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,186
- [all] No.
- Oh, come on now. Why not?

97
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,270
I mean, it'd break my heart if I found out
she was hiding something from me.

98
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,817
- [gags]
- [gags]

99
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,422
- What's happening? You having a meeting?
- Yep. I'm having lady problems.

100
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,286
- I'd love to get your perspective on it.
- No.

101
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,010
Ted, can I be honest with you?

102
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,244
Come on, let it rip.

103
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,290
You seem intent on going 12 rounds
with yourself. Why?

104
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,250
What did you do wrong?

105
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,085
He's right.

106
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,254
Time to get you some of these.

107
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,672
What, scissors?

108
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,507
Yeah. To cut yourself some slack.

109
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,760
Wow.

110
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,014
Y'all stuck the landing on that.
That was nice.

111
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,808
Tell you what, I gotta get you all
some satin jackets made,

112
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:53,478
with "Ted Lasso's Personal Dilemma Squad"
embroidered on the back there.

113
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,623
That's a clunky name.
There's gotta be something better here.

114
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,151
Let me think. Oh, I know.
How about, uh, the "EQ Warriors"?

115
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,278
The "Knights of Support"?

116
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,239
Mm. Nah. Sounds like a brand of jockstrap.

117
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,868
Um, the "Proud Boys"?

118
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,287
[vomits, groans]

119
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,830
What about the "Diamond Dogs"?

120
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,501
Attaboy, Nate. Diamond Dogs it is.

121
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,668
Whoo!

122
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,754
[howls]

123
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,761
[Keeley] Oh, come on, Roy.

124
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,182
[doorbell rings]

125
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,901
I thought you were supposed to be
in Manchester.

126
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,983
We played West Ham, so I'm in town.

127
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,654
Yeah. Come in. How you doing?

128
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,863
Uh, yeah, I'm good.

129
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,075
I had ten touches,
I had two completed dribbles,

130
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,053
and in the 89th minute
they let me take a free kick.

131
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,870
I scored. Got half a chub.

132
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,123
Ah. So you thought you'd bring
your half-chub over here then, right?

133
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,793
No. No, I just, uh, wanted to talk.

134
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,797
You know, everything happened so fast
when Lasso dumped me.

135
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,676
Oi. Come on. Lasso didn't dump you.
Man City wanted you back.

136
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,470
No, no. Lasso could have stopped it,
but he didn't. Yeah.

137
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,181
- Ah. Mm...
- [stammers] Just let me finish, yeah?

138
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,852
I dated a lot of girls, right?

139
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:19,731
But you, you saw an even greater Jamie
inside an already great Jamie.

140
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,858
[chuckles]

141
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,527
You made me cultured.
Took me to plays and shit.

142
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,945
You hated all of that.

143
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,148
Yeah, 'cause it's confusing.

144
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,324
They do all these emotional things,
make you feel all these emotional ways.

145
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,660
And then they get mad
when you start trying to shout out

146
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,370
and talk to them during a performance.

147
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,539
- [laughs]
- It's weird.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,669
You also taught me to try
to not get in me own way so much.

149
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,256
So... thank you for that.

150
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,509
You're welcome, Jamie.

151
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,409
You know, this is the first time
you've been over to this house

152
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,473
and you haven't sent me
some, like, weird sex emoji.

153
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:01,064
- Like the eggplant or the squirting water.
- Or the little squirrel.

154
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,192
The little squirrel.
I never understood that one.

155
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,295
Well, he's, uh,
he's holding a little nut, isn't he?

156
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,528
- Yeah.
- [chuckling] Yeah.

157
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,779
He is. Yeah.

158
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,241
Right.

159
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,868
Do you wanna have a drink with me?

160
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,912
Eh... nah.

161
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,959
Unless by "drink" you mean...

162
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,212
[door closes]

163
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,714
So that's how you get sex?

164
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,300
By not trying for sex?

165
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:33,679
Sometimes that is exactly how it works.

166
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,557
Ah. I never knew that.

167
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,558
[Keeley laughs]

168
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,313
- Morning, boss.
- [chuckles]

169
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,734
Now, you don't just get biscuits today.

170
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,570
I also got you a little box
of chocolate truffles.

171
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,907
- Oh, you fucker. Don't do this to me.
- [Ted chuckles]

172
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,593
What you should do is take
one of them truffles

173
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,304
and smoosh it in between the biscuits
like it's a little breakfast sandwich...

174
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,704
Yeah, there you go. You got it.

175
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,998
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- [moans]

176
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:04,670
Yeah. And hey, I wanna thank you again
for being there for me up in Liverpool.

177
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,923
- Oh. It was nothing, Ted.
- No, no. It was something.

178
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,843
You got a coupon for life, young lady.
Yeah. I got your back.

179
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,221
Think of me as your own
personal metaphorical Saint Bernard.

180
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,890
You don't need to be dealing
with a metaphorical avalanche

181
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,227
to avail yourself to the metaphorical
bourbon hanging around my neck.

182
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,937
Metaphorically speaking. Okay?

183
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,021
All right now.

184
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,857
- Oh! Actually, Ted.
- Mm.

185
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,775
If you do want to be there for me,

186
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,112
I have a meeting later
with two minority owners of the club.

187
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,196
The Milk sisters.

188
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,407
The most horrible human cocktail

189
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,994
of being terribly dull
and yet, they never shut up.

190
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,078
Please join me.

191
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,329
Done and doner.

192
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:43,041
[exhales] Perfect.
I can just introduce you all,

193
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,836
leave you wittering on,
and slip out and do anything else.

194
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,105
How much of the club they own?

195
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,297
2.9%.

196
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,301
I'm gonna round that down to two.
Then I can call those gals the "2% Milks."

197
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,969
Oh, God. They're gonna adore you.

198
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,805
It's gonna be fun. All right.
I'll leave you be. See ya now.

199
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,578
In my experience, I've always found
that endorsements work best

200
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,079
if you really believe in the product.

201
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,731
So, I can find good opportunities
for you guys

202
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,524
if you let me know what you're into.

203
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,817
I love Air Jordans.

204
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,069
I'd fuck a pair of Jordans.

205
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,447
All right. So, athletic wear then, yeah?

206
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,532
I'm into issue-oriented products.

207
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,409
You know,
pro-environment or anti-pollution.

208
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,535
That kind of thing.

209
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,412
Oh, and also Air Jordans.

210
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,265
- But I don't want to sleep with them.
- [Keeley] Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,749
Isaac, what about you?

212
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,501
Uh, Rolos.

213
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,546
So, sweets and chocolate then?

214
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,299
No. Just Rolos, yeah?

215
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,885
And none of that Sour Patch
bullshit either, yeah?

216
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,512
Okay.

217
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,139
Well, that's a great start from you guys.
Thank you.

218
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,351
[Isaac] Hey, Captain.

219
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,230
What's all this?

220
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,208
Oh, Rebecca's letting me use this room
as my office

221
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,943
until she sets me up with somewhere
proper. That's why I have this.

222
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,746
So if they need to use the room,
I can just shove everything into it.

223
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,822
Efficient.
Do you want to see a movie later?

224
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,492
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

225
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,762
I asked you if you wanted
to go get coffee with me yesterday

226
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,538
- and you said you were busy.
- I was busy.

227
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,040
- You never texted me back last night.
- Yeah. I was busy.

228
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,101
What about the kiss?
You took off like it was a shit kiss,

229
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,002
and it was not a shit kiss. I was on fire.

230
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,880
- I agree.
- So what is your fucking problem, Roy?

231
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,299
Listen, I'm a professional footballer.

232
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,510
I have had a million one-night stands.

233
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,594
- So have I.
- Great.

234
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,572
- I don't know why we're bragging about it.
- Neither do I.

235
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,599
And they always feel empty.
Well, not the first part.

236
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,702
- No, at first they're wicked.
- They're fucking great.

237
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,020
- But when it's all done, I feel like...
- Like shit.

238
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,148
Exactly. And I always end up
with my watch being stolen

239
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,632
or a story in the press
about how my penis has a curve in it.

240
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,986
Does it actually?

241
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,964
No, I just make it feel like it does
with my hips.

242
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,782
Anyway, the point is,
I'm trying to do this differently.

243
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,452
I should have told you that. I apologize.

244
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:48,584
And I am trying to be more honest.

245
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,294
Thank you.

246
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,087
Okay, then.

247
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,884
[sighs] I think you should know
that I slept with Jamie.

248
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,051
Yes, I am aware of that.

249
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,511
I mean last night.

250
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,890
I didn't think you were into me.

251
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,451
I didn't know what you wanted,
and I knew exactly what he wanted.

252
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,204
So you fucked him to get back at me
for something I didn't even know I did.

253
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,898
[scoffs] No. I... No.

254
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,649
No.

255
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,734
Yes.

256
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,236
Yup. That's exactly what I did.

257
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,488
[grunts softly]

258
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,991
I fucked up, Roy. I'm really sorry.

259
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,077
But I need you to be okay with this.

260
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,412
[grunts]

261
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,975
Um, well, why don't you just come
and tell me how you feel about it

262
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,679
once you've figured out
how to speak again?

263
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,128
[grunts]

264
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,756
[door slams]

265
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,350
Hi, Roy.

266
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,144
[grunts]

267
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,106
Something on your mind?

268
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,525
[grunts]

269
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,277
Is that grunt all I get to go on?

270
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,947
That's okay. I'll give it a shot here.
Uh, let's see.

271
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,950
You are thinking about
buying your first house.

272
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,202
No, not that. Okay.

273
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,497
You just realized your dad
might be a little racist.

274
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,124
Stop. He's in his 60s
and he's from South London.

275
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,602
Of course my dad's a little racist.

276
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,379
Look, me and Keeley
might be starting up a thing,

277
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,882
but every time I think about her,

278
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,260
all I think about is Jamie fucking Tartt.

279
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,637
Ooh-whee!

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,599
Sounds to me like someone's trapped
inside life's most complicated shape.

281
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,684
A love triangle.

282
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,937
Second place of course is
the "I just walked in on my mother-in-law

283
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,106
changing into her swimsuit" dodecahedron.

284
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,900
Does my face look like it's in the mood
for shape-based jokes?

285
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,318
No, Roy, it does not.

286
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,946
But, in my defense, it rarely does.

287
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,073
Oh. I know exactly what to do here,
though.

288
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,576
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

289
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,661
Don't you fret, my fine furry fella.

290
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,707
In a matter of minutes, your relationship
dilemma will be in the past.

291
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,168
For I am rounding up the Diamond Dogs.

292
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,295
Who the fuck are the Diamond Dogs?

293
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,672
It's just a group of people who care, Roy.

294
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,884
Not unlike folks at a hip-hop concert
whose hands are not in the air.

295
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,136
Okay, so this is about
you and Keeley, right?

296
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,806
- Saw this coming.
- Nothing like the early days of courtship.

297
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,600
Okay, this is my fucking nightmare.

298
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,519
I think the idea of you and Keeley
is like cookies and cream.

299
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,898
And I think we all agree, two great tastes
that go great together, right?

300
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,250
- [Higgins] Yeah.
- Perfect analogy.

301
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,027
Yes, I am into her.
But we all know who her ex-boyfriend is.

302
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,154
The prince prick of all pricks.

303
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,364
And I've got him stuck right in here.

304
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,824
I don't understand the problem.

305
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,576
I mean, Keeley's just so kind.

306
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,330
You know, to be liked by someone like her
must be... 's wonderful.

307
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,349
Mm. Shout out to the Gershwin brothers
right there.

308
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,767
[Coach Beard] Fuck yeah, the Gershwins.

309
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,478
But dang it, fellas,
you're still not getting it!

310
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,502
Thank you.

311
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,423
Sure, Roy here has slept with
a bunch of different people in his past.

312
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:45,552
But Keeley's got her own romantic
and sexual history that predates Roy.

313
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,970
And that's not okay!

314
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,223
Oh, he means the opposite.

315
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,183
I love it when Coach does sarcasm.

316
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,227
I can't control my feelings.

317
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,188
Well, then by all means
you should let them control you.

318
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,315
Ah! He's doing it again.

319
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,067
[chuckles] Good eye.

320
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,986
Look, Roy, all this Chandler Bing-ing
aside, do me a favor.

321
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,364
Don't let her past muck around
with y'all's future, okay?

322
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,574
She slept with him last night.

323
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,038
- I mean, are you two officially dating?
- No.

324
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,082
- Have you already slept together?
- No.

325
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,792
Coach, you wanna bring this home?

326
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,629
Grow up and get over it.

327
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,467
The Diamond Dogs have struck again.

328
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,220
[howling, barking]

329
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,722
You're all pricks.

330
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,933
[howling, barking]

331
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,855
All righty. See the Milk sisters anywhere?

332
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,791
You want me to go skim the back room?
[chuckles]

333
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,293
- [sighs] Don't make me regret this, Ted.
- Oh, don't worry, don't worry.

334
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,986
I'm gonna be an udder gentleman, okay?

335
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,865
Hey, I wonder if they've ever seen
the movie, uh, <i>Bridget Jones's Dairy</i>.

336
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,510
Sorry, that's not my breast milk pun.
I can do better.

337
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,054
Oh, my God, this was a horrible idea.
Seriously, please go home.

338
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,414
- Oh, come on. It's gonna be fun.
- Stop.

339
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,750
There she is.

340
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,606
Rupert, what are you doing here?

341
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,382
We came to celebrate.

342
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,676
Uh, Rebecca, Rebecca. Rebecca, Rebecca.

343
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,094
It's nice to see you again.

344
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,847
- And this is Ted.
- Howdy.

345
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,765
Yeah. Uh, join us for a drink.

346
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,226
Here you go, Rupert. Anything else?

347
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,354
A couple more glasses
for our friends here. Thank you, Mae.

348
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:23,400
You are as delicious as ever.
From your West End to your Marble Arch.

349
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,985
Keep your Big Ben in your pants.

350
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,029
[laughing]

351
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,072
[Mae chuckles]

352
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,300
Thank you for your invitation,

353
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,177
but we're actually here
to meet with the Milk sisters.

354
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,577
Oh, they won't be coming now.

355
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,329
Oh, no. Did they expire?

356
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,413
What?

357
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,832
Um, so, yeah, I, um...

358
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:44,588
I know I'm not allowed
an ownership stake in the club,

359
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,509
but, um, they were nice enough to sell
their minority share to Bex here.

360
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,720
I always, uh, thought I'd finish
paying off my student loans

361
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:55,057
- before I purchased a football club.
- [Rupert laughs]

362
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,894
Obviously, she needed a little,
um, financial aid from yours truly.

363
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,356
But, um, well, when we're married,
what's hers will be mine

364
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:07,027
and what's mine... well, that'll stay mine
'cause I've learned from you. [chuckles]

365
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:08,779
You're engaged?

366
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,156
[both squeal]

367
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,032
[kisses]

368
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,826
Hey. Congratulations.

369
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,262
So you better join us for a drink.

370
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,830
Everyone! Drinks with us. It's on me.

371
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,708
[cheering]

372
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,503
Three lagers, please, Mae.
They're free. We want the boots.

373
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:27,505
To Richmond!

374
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,342
[chanting]
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

375
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,386
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

376
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:37,182
Right. The... The product you'd most like
to get into business with is joy?

377
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,101
<i>Sí. Mucho, mucho</i> joy.

378
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,104
I don't know if I can get you paid
for that though, Dani.

379
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,356
I like to give away joy for free.

380
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,025
- Oh. All right, thanks, Dani.
- You're welcome.

381
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,988
Hey. Football is life, <i>Capitán.</i>

382
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,447
Yup.

383
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,241
[Dani singing in Spanish]

384
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,285
[chuckles]

385
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,329
I'm done being mad about Jamie.

386
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,832
I'm a grown man. I'm not a baby child.

387
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,668
I'm over it.

388
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,379
Right. Would you mind saying that
to the rest of the room?

389
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,007
I mean, the press deserves to know.

390
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,891
Mr. Kent!

391
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,727
- Yeah.
- Hi. Keeley Jones, The Independent Woman.

392
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,354
Would you please repeat
what you just said?

393
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,899
I'm over it.

394
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,276
Can I take you out tonight? Please?

395
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,908
Uh... yeah. You.

396
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,328
Keeley Jones,
The Independent Woman Online Edition.

397
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,955
So, why should I trust
this sudden change of heart?

398
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,292
'Cause I like you more than I hate him.

399
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,880
I mean, barely. It's very close.

400
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,425
Yeah. Woman with the hair.

401
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,469
Keeley Jones,
The Independent Woman Magazine.

402
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,263
Where would you take me if I did say yes?

403
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,517
- I don't know. Coffee?
- [scoffs] Can't do any better?

404
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,727
- Dinner.
- Yeah, that sounds great.

405
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,151
Yeah, woman with the fucking eyes.

406
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,029
Keeley Jones,
The Independent Woman insert on Sunday.

407
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,948
Could you please elaborate
on the hip movement

408
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,408
that makes your penis feel
like it has a curve in it?

409
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,869
Right, no more questions.
We'll see you on the pitch.

410
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,206
[chuckles]

411
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,832
To Rupert!

412
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,584
[cheering]

413
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,629
Friends, Richmonds, countrymen.

414
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,841
Our club's nightmare is over now.
I'm back.

415
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,885
Thank God. 'Cause Ted Lasso sucks.

416
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,929
- No offense, Ted.
- Oh, all good, Baz.

417
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,012
You, Jeremy, and Paul
have been refreshingly candid

418
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,307
about y'all's feelings.

419
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,351
Pretty cool Premier League gaffer
knows our names.

420
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,103
- I know, right?
- Shut up, you twats.

421
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,438
I'm trying again. No help.

422
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,357
Right. So, if she hits the board,

423
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,484
I want it to sound like
we just won the FA Cup.

424
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,697
[cheering]

425
00:19:58,907 --> 00:19:59,908
You wanna leave?

426
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,593
I don't wanna give him the satisfaction.

427
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,832
[Rupert] So, Rebecca,
it's time to be friends again.

428
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:11,170
Especially since Bex and I
are gonna be sitting with you

429
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,630
every week in that owner's box.

430
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:14,882
I'm not going every week.

431
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,425
[Rupert] Well, I am.

432
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:21,346
And, um, every week,
when they shove a camera in my face

433
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,309
and ask me how I think you're doing,
I will tell them.

434
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,896
It'll be relentless.

435
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,440
Mm.

436
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:35,986
So, Rupert, y'all take your darts
over here pretty seriously, huh?

437
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,906
This and, uh,
what's the billiard game y'all do

438
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,866
that sounds like a brand of cookies?

439
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,285
- Snooker?
- That's it. That's the one, yup.

440
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,788
Boy, I'd love to curl up on a couch
under a weighted blanket,

441
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,708
watch <i>You've Got Mail</i>
and devour a box of Snookers.

442
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,752
[Ted chuckles]

443
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:52,836
See what we got here.

444
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,005
Hey! There it is.

445
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,842
- Do you like darts, Ted?
- Oh, they're okay.

446
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,179
I'm more of a, you know,
cornhole man myself. Yeah.

447
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,181
- Oh.
- Huh.

448
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,265
How about a game?

449
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,561
We could, you know,
maybe wager, say, £10,000?

450
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,230
[patrons] Oh!

451
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:14,650
Well, as my doctor told me when
I got addicted to fettuccine Alfredo,

452
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,527
that's a little rich for my blood.
[chuckles]

453
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,196
Uh, how about this? If you win,

454
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,199
I'll let you pick the starting lineup
of the last two games of the season.

455
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,410
But if I win, you can't go
anywhere near the owner's box,

456
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,096
at least not while Rebecca's
still in charge.

457
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,914
- Ted.
- Mm?

458
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,415
What the hell are you doing?

459
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,227
I believe some folks call it
white knighting,

460
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,520
but I'm just following my gut here.

461
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:34,545
- It's okay.
- No. Ted.

462
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,464
- What do you think?
- You're on.

463
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:39,800
- Okay.
- Uh, double in, double out.

464
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,718
Whatever you say, Rupe-a-dupes. Yeah.

465
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,555
Just let me know
if I'm winning or losing, all right?

466
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,557
- [chuckles]
- Oh, I forgot I had these on me.

467
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,141
[patrons gasping]

468
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,394
Mm. Yeah. Oh, wait a second.

469
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:52,938
I forgot I'm left-handed.

470
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,416
- [gasps, chuckles]
- [patrons] Oh!

471
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,984
Oh, this is gonna be a hoot.

472
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,481
- So where are we going for dinner?
- It's a surprise.

473
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,031
Cool.

474
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,536
I need to ask you something.

475
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,290
So, the other day when you said
you were too busy to text me back...

476
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,833
Yeah, 'cause I was busy.

477
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,877
But you never told me
what you were too busy with.

478
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,420
Yeah, 'cause it was private.

479
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,506
Are you dating other people?

480
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,319
It's okay if you are. It's just that
I wanna know so that I don't look stupid.

481
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,053
It was yoga, okay?

482
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,264
I do yoga with a group of women
in their 60s.

483
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,640
They have no idea who I am,

484
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,726
it's twice a week
and it's really good for my core.

485
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,371
Normally only takes an hour,
but Maureen's been going through a divorce

486
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,373
and she needed to talk about it
and blow off some steam.

487
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,274
We all ended up at G-A-Y till 2:00 a.m.

488
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,818
and then we had crepes in Balham
with some drag queens.

489
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:44,114
Like I said, it's private.

490
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,532
I'm gonna kiss you now.

491
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,951
Unless it's gonna make you run away again.

492
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:51,914
I know that you wanna take this slow
and I really do respect that, but it...

493
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:56,376
Maybe I could just touch your arse
a little bit or you could touch mine...

494
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,885
[shutter clicking]

495
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,597
- Where's your manners?
- [grunts]

496
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,600
You're supposed to ask
before you take something.

497
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,685
For example, may I take this?

498
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,521
- No.
- Well, I'm fucking taking it.

499
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,565
Here. It's pictures of our first date.

500
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,318
Come on. I'm cooking for you.

501
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,155
[cheering]

502
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,407
[Mae] One hundred and eighty!

503
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,867
Well in, Rupert. Get in!

504
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:31,453
Shut your stupid little twat mouth
or I will shut it for you.

505
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,332
Shall I be giving you
the lineup card now, Ted?

506
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,378
I shall be putting Obisanya
back on defense where he belongs.

507
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,421
That's exactly what I said, didn't I?

508
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,507
Now, now, it's not all Ted's fault.

509
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,469
My ex-wife's the one who brought
the hillbilly to our shores.

510
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,179
I know she's always been a bit randy,

511
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,474
but I never thought
she would fuck over an entire team.

512
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,309
- [patrons gasping]
- Hey!

513
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,688
Better manners when I'm holding a dart.

514
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,856
Please.

515
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:00,774
Hmm.

516
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,279
Mae. What do I need to win?

517
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,447
Two triple 20s and a bull's-eye.

518
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,617
[chuckles] Good luck.

519
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,077
Mm.

520
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:17,082
You know, Rupert, guys have
underestimated me my entire life.

521
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,752
And for years, I never understood why.
It used to really bother me.

522
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,505
But then one day,
I was driving my little boy to school

523
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:27,092
and I saw this quote by Walt Whitman
and it was painted on the wall there.

524
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:30,220
It said, "Be curious, not judgmental."

525
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,306
I like that.

526
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,100
[patrons cheer]

527
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,604
So I get back in my car
and I'm driving to work,

528
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,731
and all of a sudden it hits me.

529
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:45,652
All them fellas that used to belittle me,
not a single one of them were curious.

530
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,657
They thought they had everything
all figured out.

531
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:52,201
So they judged everything,
and they judged everyone.

532
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,913
And I realized
that their underestimating me...

533
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:59,750
[exhales]
who I was had nothing to do with it.

534
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:00,834
[chuckles]

535
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,588
'Cause if they were curious,
they would've asked questions.

536
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,381
You know?

537
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,885
Questions like,
"Have you played a lot of darts, Ted?"

538
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,263
[patrons shouting]

539
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:17,434
To which I would've answered, "Yes, sir.

540
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,646
Every Sunday afternoon
at a sports bar with my father,

541
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,649
from age ten till I was 16,
when he passed away."

542
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,906
Barbecue sauce.

543
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:34,034
[cheering]

544
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,998
- Good game, Rupert.
- Come on, let's go.

545
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,253
You are a very lovely consolation prize.

546
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,589
Rebecca, Ted, enjoy your evening.

547
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:48,966
Mae, as always.

548
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,261
- Holy shit, that felt good.
- [taps bar top]

549
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,137
- That was fun. Yeah.
- [chuckles]

550
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,515
- Only one thing left to do now.
- What's that?

551
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,185
Do I have to?

552
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,312
[sighs]

553
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,023
- Drinks are on me!
- [pounds bar top]

554
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:07,150

- [bell clanging]

[blows whistle]

557
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:21,832
Fellas, I could watch you do this jaunty
North Korean military thing

558
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,750
you do all day, but I need a favor.

559
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,127
We'll die for you, Coach!

560
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,491
That's a little dramatic, Sam,
but I see how you got there

561
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:28,982
with me invoking the military and all.

562
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,233
Now here's what we're gonna do.

563
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,176
How many of you fellas
ever seen <i>Sesame Street</i>?

564
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:36,972
[door opens]

565
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,309
- Good morning, Higgins.
- Ah. Good morning. One sec.

566
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,619
Yeah, that's good. Straighten up.

567
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,187
- All right.
- [Higgins whistling]

568
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,623
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold on one sec. Let me get in my spot.

569
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,524
Okay. Here it comes, here it comes.
Let's go.

570
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,031
Hi, Ted.

571
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:55,657
Can't hear you!

572
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,203
[shouting] Hi!

573
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,038
- [Ted] Yeah! Yeah!
- [players cheering]

574
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,706
We felt it, she felt it!

575
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,292
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah! Yeah!

576
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,170
- [chuckles]
- [Ted] Whoo! Got up too fast.

577
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,132
Ted embarrassed the hell
out of Rupert yesterday.

578
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,926
Oh. That's good.

579
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:15,928
Uh, bit of bad news.

580
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:21,016
Uh, we have ten thousand unsold seats
for the final match of the season.

581
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,476
Release them to the visitors.

582
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:26,855
But Rebecca, Man City will snap those up.

583
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:30,108
Our home stadium
will be a sea of sky blue.

584
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,361
[chuckles] That'll kill Rupert.

585
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:36,281
[stammers] It'll hurt our chances.
We're on the brink of relegation.

586
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,783
Just do it, Higgins.

587
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,954
Oh, you know, fuck off!

588
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,205
Excuse me?

589
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,540
I'm sick of it.

590
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:49,920
You won't take away your pain
by constantly punishing Rupert.

591
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,273
Where were these morals
when you were having lunches with me

592
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,841
so Rupert could have sex in our house?

593
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:56,677
I thought we were friends.

594
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:01,473
You had every opportunity to do
the right thing and you never did.

595
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:02,933
Fucking pussy.

596
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:07,938
You're right. I... I deserve
to carry that around. Um, I do.

597
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:13,443
I should've been braver,
and I'm... I'm sorry for that. I am.

598
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:17,239
But I'm saying this to you now. Stop it.

599
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,615
Or what?

600
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,742
I quit.

601
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,662
Oh, I know how this goes.

602
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:27,082
You'll come back, grovel for your job,
and I'll take you back,

603
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:30,085
but I will make your life
just that little bit worse.

[exhales] Hi.

608
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,939
You arranged
for the photographer to take this.

609
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,520
Roy and I found it
on a paparazzi camera card.

610
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,439
He said you hired him.

611
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:53,192
Don't deny it
or pretend that you don't know.

612
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,404
Either you come clean to Ted
or I'll do it for you.

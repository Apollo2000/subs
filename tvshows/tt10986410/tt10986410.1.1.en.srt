Rupert and I bought this
on our fifth anniversary.

13
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,335
Well, you have exquisite taste.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,603
[chuckles] Do you want it?

15
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,136
But it's a Hockney.
It must be worth a million pounds.

00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,977
Good point. You should've said yes.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,102
- Auction pile, please.
- [man 2] Right away, ma'am.

So, um, Mrs. Mannion...

20
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,027
Excuse me. Ms. Welton. [groans, chuckles]

21
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,584
George is here.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,250
If he's here, why isn't he here?

23
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,958
Oh. Yes. Good point.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,540
George.

25
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,285
- Higgy boy. [laughs]
- Oh! Good one.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,049
Hey. I love what you've done to the place.

27
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,962
Did you do it yourself
or get some poof to help you?

28
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,138
I could ask the same of your hair. Please.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,760
- She's a cheeky one, isn't she, eh?
- [chuckles]

30
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,097
Right, love.
Listen, I've got training in a minute.

31
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,733
So whatever it is
you need to get off your impressive chest,

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,481
- let me have it.
- Of course.

33
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,563
You're fired.

34
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,017
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

35
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,647
And I'll be buying out
the remainder of your contract. So...

36
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,815
Wish you the best of luck.

37
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,123

[sighs]

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,953
I suppose I could go for
any number of reasons, really.

40
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,327
Your casual misogyny, for one.

41
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,245
- What?
- I know, it's a big word.

42
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,964
Ask one of your daughters what it means.

43
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,634
Or perhaps it's your performance,

44
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,631
having led this team through
yet another remarkably average season.

45
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,296
Or maybe it's because you insist
on wearing those tiny shorts

46
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,135
that force me to see
one of your testicles.

47
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,680
And there's the other one.

48
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,429
Liam and Noel.

49
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,519
Though, perhaps not an oasis.

50
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,192
Still, if I'm being
completely honest, George,

51
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,531
you're fired because I'm the owner now,
and I don't like you.

52
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,028
[scoffs]

53
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,949
Now do piss off, you fat twat.

54
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,992
Hey, Higgy boy.

55
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,485
What do you think's worse?

56
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,746
Your husband cheating on you
or being the last to know?

57
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,958
Is there someone that could pop out
and fetch me a salad?

[scoffs]

[George] Fuck you.

61
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,263
So, what to do as far as new managers go?

62
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,885
Shall I prepare a list of candidates?

63
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,643
No. That won't be necessary.

64
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,441
["SportsCenter" theme playing]

65
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,725
This is a bit of surprising news
from the other side of the Atlantic.

66
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,607
AFC Richmond announced
the hiring of their new manager,

67
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,945
one Theodore "Ted" Lasso.

68
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,410
Recently, it was Coach Lasso leading
the Division II Wichita State Shockers

69
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,333
to their first ever national title
in American football.

70
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,923
He took the Shockers
from a garbage program

71
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,919
all the way to the promised land
in his very first season as head coach.

72
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:34,012
But for a lot of us, that's not how
Ted Lasso found his way into our hearts,

73
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,589
certainly not into our living rooms.

74
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,434
- For me, it'll always be Ted...

with the most beautiful game.

Yeah. I like that.

for doing something so stupid.

I mean, it's mental.
They're gonna fucking murder you.

Come on. Hit me with a fun fact.

They don't say "out of bounds."
They say "into touch."

Okay, you owe me five bucks
if I sneak that into a sentence later.

[woman on PA] Good evening.
We'll be dimming the cabin shortly.

110
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,345
We should get some sleep.

Hmm.

Are we nuts for doing this?

114
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,523
Yeah, this is nuts.

115
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,365
Hey, but taking on a challenge
is a lot like riding a horse, isn't it?

116
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,043
If you're comfortable
while you're doing it,

117
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,067
probably doing it wrong.

118
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,703
- Okay, good night, Coach.
- Night, Coach.

Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey!

If we see each other in our dreams,
let's goof around a little bit,

No. My brain just kept on cooking.

127
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,711
At first,
I was thinking about not sleeping.

128
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,479
Then I was thinking about thinking
about not sleeping. And that... [sputters]

That's never good.

Next thing you know,

00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,845
they're handing out
warm chocolate chip cookies

and the plane's landing.

133
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,338
I didn't get a cookie. Did you eat mine?

134
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,280
That's not part of the story.
I think this is us right here.

[Ted] Right. Not the London Bridge,
'cause this one's still up.

152
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,934
You know how they came up with soccer?

153
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,602
So, these Victorian-era headmasters,

154
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,431
all they wanted to do
was get the boys to stop masturbating.

155
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:17,187
So they invented a sport where the boys
wouldn't use their hands at all,

156
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,061
and they thought that might do the trick.

157
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,817
I'm not sure if it worked, but...

158
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,577
Feels different, Coach.

159
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,337
I mean, the same, but different.

160
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,419
- Metaphor.
- You know it, baby.

161
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,594
[man] Oi!

162
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,722
Oi! Excuse me!

163
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,009
Oi! Hello!

164
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,432
Off! Off!

165
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,100
Stop touching the grass!

166
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,889
Get off! Get off the pitch!
Stop touching the grass! Please!

167
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,367
- Yep, yep, yep. Yeah.
- Who are you?

168
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,311
I'm Ted Lasso.
Uh, this is Coach Beard here.

169
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,653
- [gasps] Oh, God. You're the new manager.
- Yes, sir.

170
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,399
- Take all the grass you want.
- Oh, no...

171
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,791
We just had it cut.
I can go through the garbage.

172
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,096
- I can get you some more.
- That's all right. No-No need.

173
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,531
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

174
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,987
- [exhales]
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,552
- Still, we got to get off the grass.
- Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

176
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,406
Do we apologize?

177
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,180
- Sorry about that, grass.
- [Coach Beard] Sorry, grass.

178
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,084
[door closes]

179
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,083
So, we're supposed to meet
with a Rebecca Welton.

180
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,475
Yeah, that's where I'm taking you.

181
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,977
Oh. Look at this guy. One step ahead.

182
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,921
Hey, what's your name, by the way?

183
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,093
- Me?
- Yeah.

184
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,551
No one ever asks my name.

185
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,671
Oh.

186
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,170
I mean, whenever you're ready.

187
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,682
Oh, um, it's Nathan.

188
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,225
Nathan! Aw, I love that name.

189
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,388
Hey, love your hot dogs.

190
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,101
Yeah. No, I know.

191
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,606
Good, good.
Y'all got Nathan's hot dogs here?

192
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,688
No.

193
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,773
Okay.

194
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,993
I love this kid. Love him.

195
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,856
I'll introduce you. Big boss.

196
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,947
- Here we go.
- [knocking]

197
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,491
Hello.

198
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,949
[stammers]

199
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,256
Hey, how y'all doing?
I'm Ted Lasso, your new coach.

200
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,718
- You must be Ms. Welton.
- Oh. Please, call me Rebecca.

201
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,010
Ms. Welton's my father.

202
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,642
If that's a joke, I love it.

203
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,520
If not, I cannot wait
to unpack that with you.

204
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,056
This here is Coach Beard.

205
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,270
It is so good
to finally meet you both face-to-face.

206
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,192
Higgins?

207
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,900
Oh. Sorry. This is Higgins,
our current director of communications.

208
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:25,982
Current?

209
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,646
Could you take Coach Beard and get him
their IDs, housing information...

210
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,236
You know, anything they need.

211
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,121
- Wi-Fi password, wet wipes.
- Humidifier. Way ahead of you, Coach.

212
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,279
Thank you.

213
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,713
- Please, take a seat.
- Okay.

214
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,350
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes, please.

215
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,394
Didn't get much sleep on the plane,
so anything you got,

216
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,298
a little boost of caffeine,
should do the trick.

217
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,166
You know, mochaccino, Frappuccino...

218
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,005
Any coffee thing, as long as
I can't taste a hint of coffee, is good.

219
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,181
How do you take your tea?

220
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,761
Well, usually I take it
right back to the counter

221
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,805
'cause someone's
made a horrible mistake. But...

222
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,889
when in Rome, right?

223
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,439
Yeah. Look at that. Okay.

224
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,348
Mm. [slurps]

225
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,437
Mm-hmm.

226
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,230
Well?

227
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,335
You know, I always figured that tea
was just gonna taste like hot brown water.

228
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,529
And you know what?

229
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,321
I was right.
Yeah, it's horrible. No, thank you.

230
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,655
Welcome to England.

231
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,260
Yeah. "Get used to it, sucker." Right?

232
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,155
Now, would you like a tour?

233
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,623
- Ooh, I'd love to see Abbey Road.
- Of the club.

234
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,794
Yeah, let's start there.

235
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:26,882
So, this hall represents
the club's long, albeit modest, history.

236
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,800
The first match was played in 1897.

237
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,049
Uh, during the war, our stadium
was used as a makeshift hospital.

238
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,593
Yeah, some of the locals claim

239
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,676
they still see fallen soldiers
wandering around the pitch.

240
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,143
Ooh. That's spooky.

241
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,063
- Oh. Do you believe in ghosts, Ted?
- I do.

242
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,352
But more importantly, I think they need
to believe in themselves. You know?

243
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,268
Okay.

244
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,896
And this is a wall of our previous owners.

245
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,782
Okay. And now look at this fella up here.

246
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,407
How 'bout the girls
and the champagne and everything?

247
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,949
He looks like a good time.

248
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,242
That's my ex-husband.

249
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,745
Well, good times aren't always
a good time, I've found.

250
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,657
You know, I heard about all that.

251
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,037
How you holding up?

252
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,609
Yeah, hasn't been the easiest year.

253
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,709
Yeah.

254
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,088
- So, we'll need you to speak to the press.
- Oh, yeah.

255
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,843
No, after a couple nights' good sleep,
I'll be happy to do so.

256
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,426
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.
They're ready for you now.

257
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,352
They're what?

258
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,719
[reporters clamoring]

259
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,017
So, without further ado,

260
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,980
the new manager of AFC Richmond,
Ted Lasso!

261
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,522
[scattered applause]

262
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,783
[clears throat] Okay.

263
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,702
All right. How y'all doing?

264
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,664
Oh.

265
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,794
There's Coach. Oluwa Ted, yo. [laughs]

266
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,161
Look, our coach.

267
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,207
Oi!

268
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,002
If I don't hear silence,
I'm gonna start punching dicks.

269
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,424
One sec. Let me just...
Throat got a little dry.

270
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,798
[grunts, coughs]

271
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,807
Did not expect fizzy water there. Sorry.

272
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,809
Look at this twat!

273
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,391
Fucking Yank!

274
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,385
Okay. So, uh, hey.

275
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,857
Why don't we just jump right in?
Anybody got any questions?

276
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,727
Oh, yeah, no. Should've saw that coming.

277
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,777
You know what?
You can put your hands down.

278
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:16,991
Real quick, um...

279
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,160
[softly] Yeah.

280
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,528
How about I go ahead and address

281
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,905
the larger-than-average elephant
in the room.

282
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:27,122
No, I have never coached the sport
that you folks call football at any level.

283
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,206
Jesus.

284
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,922
What?

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,880
Heck, you could fill two Internets
with what I don't know about football.

286
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,607
But I'll tell you what I do know.

287
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,681
I know that AFC Richmond,
like any team I've ever coached,

288
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,089
is gonna go out there
and give you everything they got

289
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,738
- for all four quarters.
- [man] Halves.

290
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,267
- What was that?
- Two halves.

291
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,599
Oh, right. Sorry. Halves, yeah.

292
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,563
They're gonna give you everything they got
for two halves, win or lose.

293
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,725
Or tie.

294
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,562
Right. Y'all do ties here.

295
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,834
Sorry. That's going to take
some getting used to for me.

296
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,688
'Cause back where I'm from,
you try to end a game in a tie,

297
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,858
well, that might as well
be the first sign of the apocalypse.

298
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,618
[giggles]

299
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,080
Now, look here.
I respect what you folks in the media do.

300
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,001
And my door is always gonna be open.

301
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,500
All right? You can ask me anything.
No topic will be into touch.

302
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,923
All right, one final question.

303
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,564
Uh, how about the fellow right there
in the second row.

304
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,588
Yeah.

305
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,715
I-I like your glasses.

306
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Oh. Thank you.

307
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,684
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

308
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,011
I just wanna make sure I have this right.

309
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,388
You're an American
who's never set foot in England,

310
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,435
whose athletic success
has only come at the amateur level...

311
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,560
A second-tier one at that...

312
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,607
And is now being charged
with the leadership

313
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,231
of a Premier League football club,

314
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,607
despite clearly possessing
very little knowledge of the game.

315
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,070
You got a question in there, Trent?

316
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,946
Yeah.

317
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,204
Is this a fucking joke?

318
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,446
[reporters laughing]

319
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,867
- Thank you, Trent!
- I love journalists.

320
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I mean, can you even name any footballers?

321
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,296
Well, yeah, you got Ronaldo
and the fellow that bends it like himself.

322
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,566
- Fucking Beckham! Made a film on it!
- You dickhead, mate.

323
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,760
Who the fuck are you?

324
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,001
Do you know how many games
are in a Premiership season?

325
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,279
Not off the top of my head, no.

326
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,683
[speaking French]

327
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,023
Nobody can understand you.

328
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,518
Who won the league last year?

329
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,640
I actually don't know the answer to that.
I'm sorry.

330
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,538
[male reporter 2] What's a goalie?

331
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,082
The fella with the big Mickey Mouse hands
and the... by the net.

332
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,566
This is bleak.

333
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,149
You need to go back to America.

334
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,694
[overlapping shouts]

335
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,782
[no audible dialogue]

336
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,790
[echoing laughter]

337
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,659
Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. No, no, I...

338
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,619
- [snorts]
- [male reporter] Oh!

339
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,077
The bubbles!

340
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,087
Fucking hell!

341
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,511
Coach Lasso.

342
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,218
Good Lord.
You must forgive my fellow countrymen.

343
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,089
Somewhere over the last few years,

344
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,386
we seem to have abandoned
all sense of manners and hospitality.

345
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,971
My, my, aren't you a salty bunch?

346
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,017
But I can't remember the last time
the press room was this full.

347
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,520
Yet here you all are.

348
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,364
Maybe you're not such a mad notion
after all.

349
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,187
And despite the number of you here,

350
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,185
there is not a single person in this room

351
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,447
who has seen Richmond play
more than I have.

352
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,370
And in all those years under
the stewardship of the previous owner,

353
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,700
I've witnessed nothing
but profound mediocrity.

354
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,576
- [murmuring]
- [reporter chuckles]

355
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,291
Am I wrong?

356
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,253
Well, it's a bit harsh. [chuckle]

357
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,500
Am I wrong?

358
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,764
[softly] No.

359
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,640
Now, Coach Lasso may not have the CV
that you all find acceptable,

360
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,928
but he does have one thing
this club doesn't:

361
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,432
a trophy from this millennium.

362
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,885
So, like it or not, Richmond
are changing the way we do things.

363
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,057
And from now on,
that way is the "Lasso way."

364
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,779
We look forward to seeing you all
at our next match with Crystal Palace.

365
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,241
Thank you so much.

366
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,034
[reporters chattering]

367
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,374
Nice meeting y'all.

368
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,738
And, uh, sorry for spittin'
on all your stuff up here.

369
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,493
Thank you.

370
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,791
I give him three weeks.

371
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:59,253
[shudders] Oh, boy. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.

372
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,594
Ted, don't you think about them
for another second.

373
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,670
You have a job to do.

374
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,844
And proving them wrong,
just been added to the list.

375
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,683
I appreciate that... Thank you, Coach.

376
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,758
Yeah.

377
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,013
[slurps] Mm.

378
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,104
See, I'm fine when there's no bubbles.
You know, I can do that all day.

379
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,806
[Ted exhales]

380
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,561
Okay. You know,
I'd love to say hi to the team, if I can.

381
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,653
Can't keep a gaffer from his pitch.

382
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,443
You can say that again. Okay.

383
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,074
I am 0 for 2 in that sentence.

384
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,284
Ms. Welton, I was a bit skeptical,

385
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,582
but after hearing you speak in there,
I'm excited by your choice.

386
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,988
Coach Lasso is just what we need.

387
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,367
Oh, he's an absolute wanker.

388
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:36,294
I know.

389
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,661
Eh, pardon?

390
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,208
I hope he fails miserably.

391
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:45,302
See, my ex-husband truly loved
only one thing his entire life: this club.

392
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,134
And Ted Lasso is gonna help me
burn it to the ground.

393
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,304
'Cause I want to torture Rupert.

394
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:57,352
I want him to feel like he's being fucked
in the ass with a splintered cricket bat.

395
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:01,564
Just in and out, over and over,
in a constant loop.

396
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,067
Like a GIF.

397
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,941
That's what GIFs do, isn't it?
They're just...

398
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,404
endless.

399
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,448
That's... [clears throat] correct.

400
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,079
Uh, though some people, um,
pronounce it "JIF."

401
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,668
- Thank you, Higgins.
- Thank you.

402
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,997
[footsteps departing]

403
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,134
Uh...

404
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,081
[Ted] Okay, let me use it in a sentence,
so it sticks.

405
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,298
The "gaffer"... me...

406
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,971
- Is going out to the "pitch"...
- Yeah.

407
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,568
- [whistle blows]
- ...the grass here... to watch practice.

408
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,432
"Training." They call practice "training."

409
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,511
All this vernacular. Gonna be tough.

410
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,200
You know what? I'm gonna get it though.
'Cause training makes perfect.

411
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,224
There you go.

412
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,809
Oh. There's our man.

413
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,861
[players yelling]

414
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,057
- [cheering]
- [player] Jesus, Mary and fuckface Joseph!

415
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,649
Eyes on the man you're marking! Come on!

416
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,026
- Ooh! Who is that?
- Roy Kent.

417
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,034
Team captain.
Classic old-school box-to-box midfielder.

418
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,407
- Definitely lost a step.
- But, you know, he's a legend.

419
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,175
Won a Champions League with Chelsea, so...

420
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,666
- Eight years ago.
- Yeah.

421
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,292
Mmm!

422
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,456
Oh, God, what?

423
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,633
That is a darn fine sports mix,
young fella.

424
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:09,844
Coach, you try this?

425
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,053
[slurps, swishes]

426
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,134
[gulps]

427
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,224
[chortles]

428
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,534
That does not come lightly
from that fella, I'll tell you that.

429
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,058
You continue to impress, Nathan.

430
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,691
You remembered my name.

431
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,194
- [man groans]
- Holy smokes! Did you see that?

432
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,284
That fella looked like a kitty cat
when it gets spooked by a cucumber.

433
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,400
- Who the heck is that?
- Jamie Tartt.

434
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,067
Top scorer on the team.

435
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,156
Fuck off.

436
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,910
- Hmm. Nate, what's he like?
- Who, Jamie?

437
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,873
- Mm-hmm.
- Eh, he's great.

438
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,205
You know, at football.

439
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,464
Yeah, I know fellas like that.

440
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,272
[Coach Beard] Sam Obisanya. He's a right
back defender outta the Nigerian league.

441
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,046
Nigeria? Like Africa?

442
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,932
So these fellas
are from all over the place?

443
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,089
I'm open, boyo.

444
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,654
I mean, he must be from England, yeah?

445
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,178
- Wales.
- Is that another country?

446
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,103
- Yes and no.
- How many countries are in this country?

447
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,353
- Four.
- Four.

448
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,228
It's kinda like America these days.

449
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,864
Right.

450
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,833
I do love a locker room.

451
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,325
Smells like potential.

452
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,713
And am I getting notes of Axe body spray?

453
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,344
- Spot on, Coach.
- Mm.

454
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,260
But I think they call it
something else here.

455
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,135
Oh.

456
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,313
- Ding, ding, ding.
- Ah!

457
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:44,849
Lynx.

458
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,154
My favorite of the jungle cats.

459
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,939
[players chattering]

460
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,320
Come here. Look at your face.
Look at your face.

461
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,493
[Nathan] Thanks, thanks.

462
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,701
[chattering continues]

463
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,752
Yeesh.

464
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,212
Last time I saw eyes that cold,

465
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,292
they were going head-to-head
with Roy Scheider.

466
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,337
- Jaws?
- No, All That Jazz.

467
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,301
I'm gonna say something. Howdy, fellas.

468
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,181
Don't stop what you're doing.

469
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,638
My name's Ted Lasso.
This here is Coach Beard.

470
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,679
I know we don't officially start
quite yet,

471
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,102
but, uh, you know,
we just wanted to pop in, say howdy,

472
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,062
let you know
how excited we are to be here...

473
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,272
[woman] Knock, knock.

474
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,311
Is everyone in here decent?

636
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,380
Yeah, you and the little guy
gotta get on over here.

637
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,631
Come check it out.

638
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:19,934
What? No, what did I say?

639
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:26,142
But that's what I'm doing though.
I'm giving you that space.

640
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:28,768
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,652
Yeah, and myself. Right. Uh-huh.

642
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:33,688
Okay.

643
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,441
No, no. That's okay. Yeah, yeah.

644
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:37,777
Hey, hey, Michelle.

645
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,414
I love you.

646
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,369
No, no, that's okay. You don't have to.

647
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,621
Really. Yeah.

648
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,591
Okay.

649
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:55,878
Uh-huh.

650
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,763
All right, now. Good night.

00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,944

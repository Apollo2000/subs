1
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,160
<i>This is George Seif, Radio Damascus.</i>

2
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,600
<i>Our army fought back and won against
the unprovoked Israeli attack last night</i>

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,960
<i>at the town of Nukieb
in the Golan Heights.</i>

4
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,000
<i>We are hearing reports
of many Israeli casualties,</i>

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,760
<i>in a battle that was won
by our brave soldiers.</i>

6
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,520
For Syria! For Syria!

7
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Yeah, yeah, Syria!
Yeah, yeah, Syria!

8
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria!

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
Yeah, yeah, Syria!
Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria!

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,200
Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria!

11
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,080
Kamel Amin Thaabeth.

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,880
I do not know if you remember me

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
from Buenos Aires.

14
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,040
Ahmed Suidani.

15
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Of course, uh...

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,040
General Al-Hafez's Chief of Security.

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,760
So you made it to Damascus after all?

18
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,640
I'm sorry, I have to, uh...

19
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
So good to see you

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,480
on this glorious day.

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria!

22
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,480
<i>...nuclear weapons...</i>

23
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,960
Everything you say,
it's a bullshit, Ma'azi.

24
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,120
I was there.

25
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,840
Nukieb is burnt to a crisp.

26
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Many died.

27
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Many on our side.

28
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,760
- Coffee?
- Sure.

29
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,976
You don't know
what you are talking about.

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
I was listening to the radio all morning.

31
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
Propaganda. All of it.

32
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,480
George Seif at his best.

33
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
We lost the damn battle.

34
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
I was at the square.

35
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,080
I saw the dead soldiers
on the burnt tanks.

36
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,920
Those are dead Syrian soldiers

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
dressed in Israeli uniforms.

38
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,760
I know I joke around about many things,
but not about dead soldiers.

39
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,680
The Israeli were extra brutal this time.

40
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
They killed dozens.

41
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,560
Now, if only we were as good in battle
as we are at spreading lies.

42
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,360
Oh, shut up, Ma'azi.

43
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,320
Shut up.

44
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,960
You don't know what you are saying.

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Al-Ard,

46
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,360
uh, George Seif

47
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,600
reads what they tell him to read.

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,960
My uncle spent hours on the phone
with Al-Kudsi

49
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,320
trying to explain how we managed
to lose so badly

50
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,200
even though it was a surprise attack.

51
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,320
Our surprise attack!

52
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,760
If you weren't
the nephew of the commander-in-chief,

53
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,600
you'd be in jail by now.

54
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,920
Besides which,
I don't wanna hear it, even if it's true.

55
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
If?

56
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,240
How long have we been friends for, Kamel?

57
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Two years.

58
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,800
Have I ever lied to you?

59
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Many times.

60
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Fuck you.

61
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,080
If you don't believe me,
I'll take you there.

62
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,240
Take me where?

63
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
The border.

64
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,600
You can't take him.

65
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
It's a restricted military zone.
No civilian has ever been there.

66
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,920
You can't take me.

67
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
I can take you there.

68
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
I can.

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,880
It is not dangerous?

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,520
I heard the Jews have sharpshooters.

71
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,840
The only Jew that will kill you...
is your wife.

72
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,200
That is true.

73
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
So?

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,320
I know the risks involved,

75
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,080
but isn't this our dream come true?

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,320
- Isn't this what we always wanted?
- His job is to watch, listen and report.

77
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Be our eyes and ears.
He's not to be noticed, Maya.

78
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,160
Noticeable spies end up dead.

79
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,160
Ma'azi Ad-Din has access and connections.

80
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
He can get whoever he wants in.

81
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,120
This is a rare opportunity.
Eli was smart to befriend him.

82
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
If he did go...

83
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Shallal,

84
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,440
that would be the number one priority.

85
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,760
We still don't know
what their secret project underground is.

86
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,200
Can you imagine the treasure trove
of information he can bring

87
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
from a visit to the most closely guarded
area in the region?

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,800
But if you think it's too dangerous,
don't send him in.

89
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
He's your man.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's your decision.

91
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,080
- Sophie, be a good girl.
- Hi, Sophie.

93
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,816
- Thanks for watching her.
- You're welcome.

94
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm so late.

95
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,216
- Say goodbye to Mom.
- I love you, baby.

96
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,080
Say goodbye to Mom.

97
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Oh!

98
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
No, no!

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
No, wait! Wait!

100
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Oh!

101
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Thank you.

102
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,800
We're late again, Iris.

103
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,080
Please stop crying.

104
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,320
You've made your point.

105
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,720
You'll get sick like that.

106
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm sorry I'm late.

107
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
For the fourth time this week.

108
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
I can stay late. I'll finish the work.

109
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
Nadia, I'm worried about you.

110
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,440
I'm just a little tired. That's all.

111
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
You've been crying.

112
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,920
You have dark circles under your eyes.
You're not sleeping.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
I can't make her stop crying.

114
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

115
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
You're not doing anything wrong.

116
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,080
You're just doing it alone.

117
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,120
You need help.

118
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
Eli's mother takes Sophie all the time.
His family helps a lot, really.

119
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,000
You didn't make these babies alone,
and you shouldn't raise them on your own.

120
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,360
- Tova, I know you're trying to help...
- When's the last time you saw Eli?

121
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,720
Eleven months ago.

122
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
He was here for a few weeks
and had to go back to Europe.

123
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,840
He never even saw the baby.

124
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,280
He's making a big sacrifice for our future

125
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,120
and... I can't be ungrateful.

126
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Yes, you can.

127
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
Nadia, I want you to go home.

128
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,640
I'm not firing you.

129
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sending you home to rest.

130
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,160
Instead of falling asleep here
in front of my fan, sleep in your bed.

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Oh...

132
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,760
I was expecting something less
conspicuous, like a Jeep or something.

133
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,080
- This is so, uh...
- Amazingly cool? I know.

134
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,040
...ridiculous.

135
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
<i>Yalla.</i>

136
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,560
Ooh-ah!

137
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
<i>Yalla.</i>

138
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,760
Wait, wait, wait. Stop the car.

139
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Stop the car!

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Lake Tiberias.

141
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,400
In all its glory.

142
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,840
And there is Israel.

143
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
So close.

144
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,480
The most fertile soil ever.

145
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,120
Beautiful lakes,

146
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,040
mountains,

147
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,560
waterfalls,

148
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
landmines.

149
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,520
Our country is the most beautiful
in <i>all</i> the world.

150
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Mm.

151
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
I'll take your word for it.

152
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,720
You know, I... I never really left Syria.

153
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,680
- Oh.
- Well, once.

154
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,600
Been to Beirut for a few days, but, uh...

155
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,240
- you've been to the Alps...
- Mm.

156
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,480
...to South America,

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
to Paris!

158
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,320
All of them together, Ma'azi,

159
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,120
don't come close
to the majesty of this land.

160
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,240
If you say so.

161
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
What's that?

162
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Oh.

163
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
New deal with the Soviets.

164
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,200
Khrushchev is supplying us with a lot more
than he's admitting to the world.

165
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
And they are...

166
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,400
They are 120-millimeter mortars.

167
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Not even the Israeli have those.

168
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Good for us.

169
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,640
Are you coming?

170
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Of course.

171
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
<i>Yalla.</i>

172
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,440
<i>These are the soldiers
from the Nukieb battle.</i>

173
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,880
<i>They have lost more than half their men.</i>

174
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,440
They bombed from the air

175
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,000
when most men were asleep.

176
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,200
They died in their beds.

177
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,120
They didn't even give them the chance
to die like heroes.

178
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
The injured...

179
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
We couldn't get to them,

180
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,080
'cause Israeli tanks arrived
and mowed everything down,

181
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,960
and shot at everything moving.

182
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,360
They turned Nukieb into one big graveyard.

183
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,400
Hey.

184
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Ma'azi.

185
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,640
I heard you were in my sector.

186
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,520
And I heard about your visitor.

187
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,720
Kamel Amin Thaabeth,

188
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,760
meet Sheriff Hatoum.

189
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,400
Sorry, Colonel Hatoum.

190
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,800
Mr. Thaabeth.

191
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,120
Please, call me Kamel.

192
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,840
Forgive me, but we don't get many
Syrian visitors here, Mr. Thaabeth.

193
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,360
Ma'azi might think that this is a museum,

194
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,080
but in fact, it's a closed military zone.

195
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
- I spoke to my uncle about it...
- Yes, yes.

196
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,376
- I know.
- If my presence is in any way a problem...

197
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,720
- Marouane!
- ...I will...

198
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm assuming you're telling
Mr. Thaabeth about our victories here.

199
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
How, despite the violent attack on us,

200
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,680
we managed to get three tanks
and kill some of the occupiers.

201
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,480
Yes, I was getting to that.

202
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,800
Mr. Thaabeth, join me in my car.
I'll give you the right kind of tour.

203
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,400
- Thank you.
- Ma'azi, your uncle is coming tonight.

204
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,440
I'm meeting him for dinner at Honitvah.

205
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,960
Wh... I didn't know he was coming.

206
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm relieved to hear your uncle doesn't
share all state secrets with you.

207
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,040
The advantage we have is
one of unpredictability and height.

208
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,800
From here, we do our surveillance,

209
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,440
and, when needed,

210
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,640
we can respond with force.

211
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,800
Looking for something?

212
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, yes.

213
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,280
Where are our soldiers?

214
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Our bases?

215
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,440
Now, this is brilliant.

216
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,680
Come on, I'll show you.

217
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,400
You wanted to meet the brave soldiers,

218
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
here they are.

219
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,240
We have the entire area covered

220
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,960
in bunkers like this.

221
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,080
The Zionists can't see them
from the sea or sky.

222
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,640
This is unbelievable,
absolutely incredible.

223
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,640
So, tell me, what are we looking at here?

224
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,280
The Ein Gev kibbutz.

225
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Fishermen, mostly.

226
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,040
The Zionists like to play victim.

227
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,080
As if we are shooting indiscriminately.

228
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,240
But they are stealing our land

229
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,120
and fishing in our water,

230
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,920
despite international agreements.

231
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Mm.

232
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,560
So you can see them
up close and personal.

233
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,280
Thank you.

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
The enemy.

235
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,640
They look like us.

236
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,600
What did you think they'd look like?

237
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
Octopus?

238
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,720
Would you like to shoot one?

239
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Please,

240
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,360
my present to you.

241
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,040
Retaliation for Nukieb.

242
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Are you serious?

243
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Please.

244
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,880
I'm not a soldier, I'm sorry.

245
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,920
It's easy. You point...

246
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,880
and you squeeze the trigger.

247
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Is there a problem?

248
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
On the contrary.

249
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,760
Don't be confused.

250
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,120
They might wear civilian clothes,

251
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,960
but each one of them is a Zionist soldier.

252
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,440
Even the young ones.

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
Simply choose a target.

254
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,640
Put your finger on the trigger...

255
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
and now,

256
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,760
when you're ready...

257
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,360
Step away from the rifle.

258
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,160
What are you trying to do, start a war?

259
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,320
That was a good one.

260
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Oh!

261
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,240
Colonel,

262
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
this heat,

263
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
it's torture.

264
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,800
How come our soldiers don't have
any shade?

265
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Surely they deserve the best conditions?

266
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,960
You're right, Kamel,

267
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,800
but our government has limited funds,

268
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,960
and sometimes,

269
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,520
far from the capital
also means far from the heart.

270
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Yes.

271
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,520
You're gonna love it.

272
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,480
This is the best food in all of Syria.

273
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,520
Looks delicious.

274
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,160
<i>- Shukran.
- Shukran.</i>

275
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,320
Brought in especially for Colonel Hatoum.

276
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,960
I guess it's the advantage
of being the commander of the sector.

277
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,920
Leave them here.
We'll get them ready for the Colonel.

278
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,800
- Here.
- Thank you.

279
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
I should've called one of Eli's brothers,
but I'm...

280
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,680
quickly running out of favors.

281
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,560
It's okay, I, uh...

282
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm glad you called.

283
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,720
It's been a very long time.

284
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,240
I'm sorry I didn't, uh, reach out myself.

285
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
I... I wanted to...

286
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
to make sure you're okay.

287
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm a mess.

288
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,960
Sorry, I don't mean to burden you
with all this.

289
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,280
It's okay, I... I...

290
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I was just running a few errands.

291
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,160
How about you join me?

292
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,440
Shouldn't take too long,

293
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,120
then maybe we can eat.

294
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,680
It will make you feel better.

295
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Yeah.

296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,840
This is the best-kept secret

297
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,040
in the Golan Heights.

298
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,880
A vestige of the Roman Empire.

299
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,240
A place where their senators would come to
decompress, and to share state secrets.

300
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
A place where revolutions are planned

301
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,280
and executions are ordered.

302
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Uncle!

303
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,920
I'm so happy to see you.

304
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,240
The Romans sure knew how to live.

305
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,696
It's good they raped and pillaged
their way across the world,

306
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,880
or we wouldn't have all this.

307
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,960
I've heard so much about you.

308
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
I feel we practically know each other.

309
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
I feel the same.

310
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,200
I'm ashamed to say this,
I'm somewhat of a fan.

311
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,680
In Buenos Aires,
I actually had a photo of you

312
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,440
up on my mantelpiece.

313
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
As... Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,000
Aah!

315
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,400
Now this is bliss.

316
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,680
So,

317
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
what brings you here tonight, Uncle?

318
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,800
Well, whatever it is,

319
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,520
I'm glad we get to spend some time
together.

320
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
General,

321
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,920
I feel so privileged to have had
this opportunity,

322
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,040
you know, to be able to observe our enemy

323
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,240
from such proximity.

324
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
Their houses...

325
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,960
I saw their villages.

326
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,920
And Lake Tiberias.

327
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,800
- I always imagined it would be bigger.
- Hm.

328
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,640
Do you know why the Lake Tiberias,
the Sea of Galilee, as they call it,

329
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,760
is so important to the Israelis?

330
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,040
Water is the most vital substance
for a living organism,

331
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,200
and for a country.

332
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,320
Without it there is no life, only death.

333
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,240
The Sea of Galilee is the only
water source the Israelis have.

334
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,640
It feeds all their citizens,

335
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,480
north all the way down to the desert.

336
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,400
General, they're getting ready.

337
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,120
You're leaving?

338
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Yes, unfortunately, the world continues,

339
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,800
even though here, it seems to pause.

340
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,400
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
It was a pleasure to meet you.

341
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,720
I hope we can continue it soon.

342
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm jealous of you.

343
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Of me?

344
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Why?

345
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,240
Everyone respects you,

346
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
likes you,

347
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
from the moment they first meet you.

348
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
Oh, it's no different with you.

349
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
No.

350
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,320
When you walk into a room...

351
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,480
everyone wants a piece of you.

352
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,440
Did you see how my uncle

353
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,200
immediately took to you?

354
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,360
It's because I have money, Ma'azi,
nothing more.

355
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,200
I have my jokes,

356
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
my connections,

357
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
my uniform, but...

358
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
I don't have that thing you have.

359
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Strong hashish, Ma'azi.

360
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,560
What... What are you talking about?

361
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,720
Sometimes I feel like...

362
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,440
my whole life...

363
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
is just one big lie.

364
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
That's all.

365
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,680
How come...
How come you're not in a relationship?

366
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Every woman in Damascus would love to be
with you.

367
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,040
I suppose I haven't met the right one yet.

368
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,160
What about Saliha?

369
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,960
Abu Mahmoud's daughter?

370
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,960
Too early to tell.

371
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Did you...

372
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Did you fuck her?

373
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Why are you asking?

374
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,120
I'm sure you've had many...

375
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
women?

376
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,600
Uh, I'm talking too much.

377
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,600
The heat. The hookah.

378
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I better go.

379
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,440
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

380
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,560
Hatoum sent me.

381
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,240
One moment, I'm just getting dressed.

382
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Wait.

383
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,520
There's no need to do this.

384
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I cannot.

385
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Why can't you?

386
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Yes...

387
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
why can't you?

388
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Oh!

389
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,640
It's a miracle.

390
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,480
It's the most she's slept
since she was born.

391
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Is she breathing?

392
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Here, Sophie.

393
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,800
Here, give her to me.

394
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
You should go to bed for a bit.
I'm fine keeping an eye on them both.

395
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,280
- No.
- I don't have to be back at work today.

396
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll wake you up in a few hours.

397
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,920
- Are you sure?
- Please, for me.

398
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,720
Dada!

399
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,040
- Aah...
- Hello!

400
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,480
What you doing there?

401
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,560
Is it a duckie? Is that a duckie?

402
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,160
The Israelis will learn a lesson tonight.

403
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,800
You are leaving in exactly 14 minutes.

404
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,680
You will blow up the water pipe
only at three o'clock exactly.

405
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Come on.

406
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,600
Tiberias, Tiberias.

407
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Do you copy, over?

408
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,760
Tiberias, Tiberias.

409
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,160
Do you copy, over?

410
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,360
Hello. Hello.

411
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,560
Can you hear me, over?

412
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,440
Israel, Tiberias.

413
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,760
Can you hear me, over?

414
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,720
Tiberias. Israel.

415
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,680
Can you hear me, Israel?

416
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,160
Uh...

417
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Don't shoot.

418
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,760
I'm just here to get my cow.

419
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,320
I'm not looking for trouble.

420
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
What's your name?

421
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
Shmulik.

422
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Dagan!

423
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Dagan!

424
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,360
Quiet!

425
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,960
<i>You couldn't stop them,
the army couldn't stop them,</i>

426
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
<i>so I had to.</i>

427
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,400
<i>That's why I didn't call them.</i>

428
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,840
<i>Oh, God...</i>

429
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
He drove himself.

430
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
On a tractor.

431
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,080
And you were the first one to talk to him?

432
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,680
I'm the only one he talked to.

433
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,440
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Dagan.

434
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm the commander here.

435
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,360
Shlomo, but everyone calls me Shmulik.

436
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,120
Okay, I understand you have something
you want to tell me.

437
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,280
Wake everybody up.

438
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
Everyone.

439
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,360
The whole sector.

440
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Where the hell were you?

441
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,120
I was looking all over for you.

442
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,400
I was out smoking.

443
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,120
And jogging?

444
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,320
It's a long story.

445
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,640
I heard a noise. I went outside.

446
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,640
I thought maybe it was an Israeli.

447
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,040
Turned out it was a wild pig.

448
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,720
I was afraid that, uh...

449
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
maybe you left.

450
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,920
Why would I do that?

451
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Well, uh...

452
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,680
things got a bit, uh...

453
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,840
You know, I... I was high, and...

454
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,000
perhaps my behavior...

455
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,440
it was...

456
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,120
Sorry for the interruption.

457
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,320
There was an incident at the border.

458
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,640
Don't leave your rooms tonight, okay?

459
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,440
What kind of incident?

460
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,320
What happened?

461
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,200
I just know that you're supposed
to stay here.

462
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Okay.

463
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,800
I should head back, then.

464
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,760
I think we could both use some sleep.

465
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,320
Why is your leg bleeding?

466
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
What?

467
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Your leg.

468
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,680
It's an old wound that opened up.

469
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
About tonight...

470
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,880
I... I don't want you to think that...

471
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,840
You know, I... I value your friendship.

472
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,760
- Wouldn't want to lose you.
- You can trust me...

473
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
with your life.

474
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,480
I hope I can do the same, Ma'azi.

475
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,320
We all have secrets.

476
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Good morning.

477
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,200
I made coffee.

478
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,560
I don't know how you take your eggs,
but I made scrambled.

479
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,680
Hopefully these are good.

480
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
It's been a while.

481
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,760
What are you doing here, Dan?

482
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I mean, really?

483
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,400
Wh... What are you really doing here?

484
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
Eli can't be your only employee.

485
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
No.

486
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
No, I have a few.

487
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,720
Do you spend your nights
with their wives as well?

488
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,080
Making them breakfast?

489
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,400
I'm sorry if I offended you,
I just wanted to help.

490
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
You want to help?

491
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,640
Where is my husband?

492
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,160
I think you should go.

493
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,280
Eli is enough.

494
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,320
Sometimes he doesn't realize it,

495
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,160
but he is enough.

496
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,640
In his mind, he needs to provide better,

497
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,040
to do great things with his life,

498
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,720
to live up to his own expectations,
but all of that is not true,

499
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,320
because he is enough.

500
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,240
He told me that working for the government

501
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,560
might lead to him being
an ambassador one day.

502
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
He looked at me,

503
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,640
and said that I will be Mrs. Ambassador.

504
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,680
But I don't want to be Mrs. Ambassador.

505
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,600
I want to be Mrs. Eli Cohen.

506
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,080
That's all I ever wanted.

507
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,000
I know that by giving him this job,
you made his dreams come true,

508
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,120
but by making his dreams come true,

509
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
you've ruined mine.

510
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,720
You really want to help?

511
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,080
Bring me back my husband.

512
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,040
<i>♪ Lo sai ♪</i>

513
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
♪ <i>Non è vero ♪</i>

514
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,120
♪ <i>Che non ti voglio più ♪</i>

515
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,320
<i>♪ Lo so ♪</i>

516
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,720
<i>This is George Seif, Radio Damascus.</i>

517
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,680
<i>Israeli officials report
a Syrian unit was captured</i>

518
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,960
<i>while crossing the border
early this morning.</i>

519
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,640
<i>Syria is denying any knowledge
of this operation,</i>

520
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,200
<i>blaming Zionist propaganda
for this false report.</i>

521
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,400
This will be so demoralizing
for the soldiers we met.

522
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,200
I'm going to send them a gift.

523
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
What kind of gift?

524
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,160
This is amazing.

525
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,240
Amazing.

526
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,360
He wants this much for eucalyptus trees?

527
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,800
Why?

528
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,920
Fuck.

529
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Uh...

530
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,200
Mr. Suidani.

531
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,360
I'm sure...

532
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,720
this must seem strange.

533
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,920
I do not usually show up uninvited.

534
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,240
Can I help you in any way?

535
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
It's hot.

536
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,880
Could I bother you for some water?

537
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,800
Forgive me.

538
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,160
I should have offered.

539
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,920
It's just I was a little surprised.

540
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,920
I was just taking a nap.

541
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,200
You live in this big apartment
all by yourself?

542
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,160
Well, as far as I know.

543
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,720
I mean, it's big enough for somebody

544
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,200
to live here without my knowledge,
you know?

545
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,880
Here.

546
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,680
You've made a nice life for yourself
here in Damascus.

547
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,120
Your friends are powerful people.

548
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,560
These things...

549
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,040
do not go...

550
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,920
unnoticed.

551
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,520
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

552
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,000
- I would like you to come with me, please.
- Now?

553
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,080
I hope you don't mind.

554
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Not at all.

555
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,280
Wait here, please.

556
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,040
Do you know who I am?

557
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,960
Of course, you're Michel Aflaq,

558
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,120
the author of <i>The Battle for One Destiny</i>

559
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,840
and the leader of the Ba'ath movement.

560
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Hm.

561
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,640
Freedom of thought is always a scary thing
for those who are in power.

562
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,040
So they give you a title,

563
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,800
which makes it easy for them
to get rid of you.

564
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,320
Let me get to the point, Mr. Thaabeth.

565
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,680
Certain people told me
you might be a supporter.

566
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
Is that true?

567
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,320
It is treason to support the Ba'ath.

568
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,160
In these times,
one can never be too careful, true.

569
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,840
But our movement is spreading all over
the Arab world,

570
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,600
and soon we'll take over it,

571
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,680
<i>inshallah,</i>

572
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,560
with the help of young leaders
like Saddam Hussein in Iraq

573
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,640
and here in Syria.

574
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,240
Is this why you brought me here?
To quiz me about my politics?

575
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,480
It wasn't me who brought you here.

576
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,480
General.

577
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
Kamel.

578
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
- So good to see you again, my friend.
- You, too.

579
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,320
I, uh... apologize for the secrecy.

580
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,120
Ah, think nothing of it.

581
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,280
So this means you're officially back?

582
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,880
Uh... Not officially, no.

583
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,360
Well, we were just discussing
Kamel's dedication to the cause.

584
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,720
Well, you know me.

585
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,280
I'll do anything you need.
What is it that you want?

586
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,880
I need to ask you for a favor.

587
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,200
We, uh... need you to throw a party.

588
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
A party?

589
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,840
Yes.

590
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,320
You'll be given a date,
sometime in the future,

591
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,560
and you will start inviting certain people

592
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,360
to extravagant parties at your place.

593
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,320
You need to make sure
that your friend's uncle, General Ad-Din,

594
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,800
attends these parties,

595
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,480
together with
these members of the Cabinet.

596
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,480
Welcome, Mr. Thaabeth.

597
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,200
Welcome to the future of Syria.

598
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,960
So, what's going on?

599
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,880
It seems we have struck luck
for the second time this week.

600
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,640
What are you talking about?

601
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,000
In addition to the anonymous tip
we got about the infiltration,

602
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,440
it just became a lot easier to pinpoint
the location of the Syrian fortifications.

603
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,160
How?

604
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,000
Take a look for yourself.

605
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,440
Move.

606
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,920
They are planting trees.

607
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
Probably for shade.

608
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,120
It's happening all across the border.

609
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,200
North to south.

610
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,200
Ah!

611
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,280
Indeed...

612
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,880
luck has struck again.

1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,680
Zero, three, one, two.

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Close it.

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
Good.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,400
Each of these contains
hidden plastic explosives,

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,360
should you need extra cleaning power.

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,280
I'd advise you to keep them separate

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,360
from the rest of your bars of soap,
so there's no mix-up.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
- This is...
- I know what that is.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
If all is lost. If I am caught.

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
Learn this by heart.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,240
The sheikh is your only way in.

12
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,360
You cannot make it across the border
on your own.

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,080
You will need him.

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,280
The letters are not enough.

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,280
If you come alone,
then you will arouse suspicions...

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Yes, I know this.
We've been through this already, Salinger.

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,160
Once you are in, if you are in,

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,320
do not transmit for at least eight weeks.

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,080
Don't take any unnecessary risks.

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,760
Enough, he knows.

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
He knows.

22
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>Sheikh Majid Al-Ard,</i>

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
successful landowner,

24
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
married to a Jewish Syrian.

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,120
Spends a lot of money on cars,

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,760
jewelry and expensive wine.

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
Make sure he notices
how rich you are.

28
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,360
<i>...nuclear weapons...</i>

29
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,440
Just one. Thaabeth.

30
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,280
Yes, please. Follow me, please.

31
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
Uh, by the window.

32
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Yes.

33
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Oh. Thank you.

34
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
Would you like something, sir?

35
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,080
I'll have
the '45 Château Mouton Rothschild.

36
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,720
We only sell that by the bottle.
The price is...

37
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,160
I... I know the price.

38
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,160
I'll have a bottle. Thank you.

39
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
You're welcome, sir.

40
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,000
Delicious.

41
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,480
I remember a time when
political debate was won by reason,

42
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
not by volume.

43
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
They are young.

44
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
They had too much to drink.

45
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Speaking of...

46
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,280
There is no way I can finish this myself.

47
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,560
No, no, no. Let me.

48
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,160
Thank you.

49
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
It's delicious.

50
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,040
Last time I had a glass

51
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,760
of '45 Mouton Rothschild,

52
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,400
I was in Monaco.

53
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,120
- Single and happy.
- Oh!

54
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Thank you.

55
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
Are you eating alone, Mr., uh...

56
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,240
- Uh, Thaabeth.
- Majid Al-Ard.

57
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,600
Please, join me,

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,560
if you are not waiting for someone.

59
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Please.

60
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Please.

61
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,000
So...

62
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,160
It's a big risk leaving your life
for a new one.

63
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,200
You have a thriving business.

64
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,600
You don't know anyone.
You don't know the country.

65
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,480
Are you sure about this?

66
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,400
My business is thriving
precisely because I take risks.

67
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,360
Change is part of the game,
you know this as a businessman.

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
Besides which,

69
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
my reason for moving is not financial.

70
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,160
You see, Syria...

71
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,200
Syria's my true home.

72
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,480
It's wonderful to hear
someone like you speak this way.

73
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,840
Most of the young people in our country

74
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,880
have lost their way.

75
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
May I ask you a question?

76
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Of course.

77
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,040
As a landowner,

78
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
- now that the Nasser influence has gone...
- Hm?

79
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
...are you at all concerned
that the Ba'ath may take over?

80
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Let me give you a piece of advice,
Mr. Thaabeth.

81
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,480
- You are moving from Argentina to Syria.
- Hm.

82
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,280
There are things that one does not discuss
in open places.

83
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Things you have talked about openly
where you have come from

84
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
will get you killed
in the place you are going to.

85
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm so sorry.
I'm concerned about Syria's future...

86
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,440
- and...
- Oh, it's late...

87
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,720
Bed. I should go to bed.

88
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Yes?

89
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Just a second.

90
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Mr. Thaabeth.

91
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,160
I know it's late, uh...
but I had a feeling you'd still be up.

92
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,320
Listen, I apologize if I may have
come across as rude before.

93
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
As a peace offering, I was thinking,

94
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm hiring a driver in Beirut
to take me all the way to the border,

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,840
and it would be my pleasure
if you would accompany me.

96
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,160
Thank you, thank you.

97
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,360
But I'm okay.

98
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,480
I don't need a ride.

99
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,600
Have a good night, Mr. Thaabeth.

100
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Have a good night.

101
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,760
Be careful!

102
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Slowly, slowly!

103
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Slowly, slowly.

104
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Slowly, slowly.

105
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,360
Be careful. Be careful with it!

106
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,360
You scratch, you pay!

107
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
Why is this funny to you?

108
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,480
Because it's not my car.

109
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,040
Peugeot 404.

110
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,960
Have you heard of this car?

111
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,760
1.6 litre.

112
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,680
Four-cylinder petrol engine.

113
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,040
74 horsepower.

114
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
Styled by Pininfarina.

115
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,680
It's the Super Luxe edition.

116
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,800
And it's not on the market.
How the hell did you get it?

117
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,960
I'm only the seventh person to have one.

118
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
- She's beautiful, I'll buy her from you.
- Don't wait for that.

119
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,760
Very well then.

120
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,680
Hope to run into you again sometime.

121
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,480
Come on.

122
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,680
Are you still planning on hiring a driver?

123
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,720
Unless there's a better option, yes.

124
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Look, uh...

125
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,000
I've made the drive
from Beirut to Damascus many times.

126
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
But truth be told, it can be very dull.

127
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,400
So if you need a ride,
you can ride with me.

128
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,000
Do you have the recommendation letters?

129
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,480
- Yes, yes. Of course.
- Give them to me.

130
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,440
Abu Haldon, my friend.

131
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,520
Good to see you again.

132
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,760
This time not alone.

133
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes. I met him on the boat.

134
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,560
Yes, I met him.

135
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,360
Very good.

136
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Kamel.

137
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,520
Kamel Amin Thaabeth,

138
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,440
this is our customs officer, Abu Haldon.

139
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,240
<i>Assalaam waalaikum.</i>

140
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,560
<i>Waalaikum assalaam
wa rahmatullahi wa baraktuh.</i>

141
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,040
Why don't you both come in for coffee,
until we clear your papers?

142
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,760
Ah, sure, sure. Sure.

143
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Thank you.

144
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,440
Underneath, you'll find another letter
from General Al-Hafez.

145
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
Where is the toilet?

146
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Abu Haldon!

147
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Abu Haldon.

148
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,680
Sheikh Al-Ard,

149
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,600
he told me what very, very close friends
you are.

150
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,000
Since this is such a great day for me,
I want you to have a reminder of the time

151
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,760
that you let a humble patriot
back into his homeland.

152
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,920
Please, I insist.

153
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,560
Open it all up.

154
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Abu Haldon.

155
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,560
Abu Haldon.

156
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,880
May I speak with you in private?
For a moment, just please, one moment.

157
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,320
It's not worth opening it up.

158
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,840
There are some...
materials in there that are...

159
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
a little bit, uh... sensitive.

160
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
It's fine.

161
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,400
Put it back in the trunk.

162
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
<i>Shukran.</i>

163
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,640
Since you're risking my neck
as well as yours,

164
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
I think I deserve to know...

165
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,000
why didn't you want them
looking through your things?

166
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,360
I'm a single man,

167
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,800
and I have needs,

168
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,480
and I have some...

169
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,640
extremely graphic pornography
in my suitcase.

170
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,920
You're a naughty man.

171
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,160
You're a naughty man, Kamel.

172
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Mr. Thaabeth.

173
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,160
They closed Ibn Barekeh.

174
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,760
Some accident,
so I had to go around, sorry.

175
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,840
It's fine.

176
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,040
It's on the top floor, as you requested.

177
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
This one?

178
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
And like the other places,

179
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
it's quieter.

180
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Good.

181
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,280
It's more expensive than what you wanted,

182
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,000
but, as you can see, it's very spacious.

183
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,120
Hm.

184
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,640
The owner would like
4,000 Syrian pounds per month.

185
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,240
It's actually a very good price
for the size of the apartment.

186
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,080
I promise you, you won't find better.

187
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,680
Five bedrooms.

188
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,400
Four baths.

189
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,760
It's not as big as the last one
I showed you, but, uh...

190
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,640
you won't find better.

191
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,560
What's this building over here?

192
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
That's...

193
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,880
the Second Bureau.

194
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,640
Military headquarters.

195
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,040
It sometimes gets noisy,

196
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
so I could, uh... maybe convince the owner

197
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,720
to go down to 3,900.

198
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
But there are other people interested,
so...

199
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,440
I'll give you six months in advance.

200
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Cash.

201
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
Now, when can I move in?

202
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Yeah.

203
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,680
Sir, we received a message from 88.

204
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
What?

205
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Jacob's looking for you.

206
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,800
You weren't at the office.

207
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,000
- You weren't at home.
- Did something happen?

208
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,200
He didn't tell me.

209
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,080
Okay, I'll just drop these off
and then we'll go to the office.

210
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
No.

211
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
This is wrong.

212
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Leave it.

213
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,400
I'll have to tell Jacob about this.

214
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,720
There is no "this." This is nothing.

215
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm doing my job.

216
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,680
Your job doesn't include buying produce

217
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,240
- and diapers for the wives of agents.
- She just had a kid

218
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,920
and I sent her husband away.

219
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,760
I promised him I'd look after her,
there's nothing more to it than that.

220
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,960
What you're doing with her,

221
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,640
what you are feeling for her,

222
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,240
endangers the whole operation,

223
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,480
not just your job.

224
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,680
Get back in the car right now, Dan.
Hate me...

225
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,520
fire me, I don't care,

226
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,040
but I can't let you do this.

227
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Good.

228
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,880
Yes, I'll tell him.

229
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
He's standing right here in front of me.

230
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
You too.

231
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,040
Harel wanted me to congratulate you
on a job well done.

232
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,440
"88. Found apartment.

233
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,040
Across from Second Bureau.

234
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,320
Starting work."

235
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,520
Map, fast.

236
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,440
We told him to wait eight weeks
to transmit, it's hardly been two.

237
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Don't do that.

238
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
This is good.

239
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,280
He's in.

240
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
He's alive.

241
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,760
He's good at this
and that's because of your training.

242
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,640
I'm sure he wouldn't have transmitted

243
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,880
if he felt...

244
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,280
Second Bureau.

245
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Yes.

246
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,600
Okay, there are a few options,

247
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,440
but only two in the center of town.

248
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,880
One of them is here,

249
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,720
Al-Zahra al-Jadeeda.

250
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,240
What kind of neighborhood is it?

251
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,040
Uh, low class. The surrounding streets,

252
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,600
- they're all body shops.
- No.

253
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Okay. Um...

254
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,760
Abu Rummaneh.

255
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,640
The only other facility

256
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,400
we know nothing about is here

257
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,800
in the middle of
the Abu Rummaneh neighborhood.

258
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Very affluent.

259
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
This is where diplomats, foreigners

260
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,320
- and businessman live.
- Yes.

261
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,880
Moussa Ibn Nousser street.

262
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,760
If you lived here,

263
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
you'd be able to see the headquarters

264
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,200
from your apartment.

265
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Here too.

266
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
He's in one of these two buildings.

267
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,560
A toast to Operative 88,

268
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,720
our man in Damascus.

269
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
You have taste.

270
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,040
They are the finest quality.

271
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
The finest.

272
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,440
And for you, an excellent price.

273
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,640
Two for 150.

274
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
No, no, no, no!

275
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
Those are not...

276
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
ready yet.

277
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,440
Two for 140.

278
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,840
I'll give you 60 for each table.

279
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
60?

280
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,240
Get the hell out of my shop!

281
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
You donkey.

282
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,520
No, 60 for each, for all of them.

283
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,280
- What do you mean "all of them"?
- I mean, I want them all.

284
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Every one out there
and every one being made in the back.

285
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,040
And I'll be needing more.

286
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,080
In fact, I need whatever you have.

287
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
Now, tell me...

288
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,360
do you happen to have a truck?

289
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,960
Careful, careful!

290
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,200
Come up a bit more.

291
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,920
Abdul, stop!

292
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,920
Saif. Abdul, up a bit.

293
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,280
<i>Keep all the newspapers.
They're more important than the furniture.</i>

294
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,200
That. Give me that.

295
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Oh, my God.

296
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Wow.

297
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,960
- This is priceless.
- Dan, look.

298
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,720
It's a new model.

299
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,200
This is unbelievable.

300
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
What do you have?

301
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,920
- That's good.
- This is it.

302
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,000
- That's it, the Second Bureau?
- Exactly.

303
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,560
Aah!

304
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,520
Wrap them all up.

305
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
This one is mine.

306
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,840
<i>It's pretty incredible...</i>

307
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,920
what he's accomplished
in the time he's been there.

308
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,000
Look around, everyone's sitting on
Syrian chairs and desks.

309
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,080
I can stay a little bit longer...

310
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,400
if you want.

311
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,320
How long is
this boycott going to continue?

312
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,880
You know, he passed all the exams
with flying colors.

313
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,360
He was the quickest
to identify surveillance.

314
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,920
Fastest with transmission.

315
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,960
He knew more about Islam than most imams,

316
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
and he was only 19.

317
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,120
One of the best agents I've met
in all my years.

318
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,840
There was only one point of concern...

319
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,320
He wanted it so much.

320
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
He was eager.

321
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,920
Eager to serve. Eager to please me.

322
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,320
But the office needed someone
in the Arab villages east of the Jordan

323
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,720
as soon as possible...

324
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,960
so I ignored the warning signs.

325
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,480
It's not your fault.

326
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,920
They tied him to a motorcycle...

327
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,760
and dragged him through the village.

328
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,720
He was still alive.

329
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,960
Made everyone come out of their houses
to watch,

330
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,800
even those who didn't want to.

331
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,240
They tied his hands...

332
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,160
behind his back...

333
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,720
and his legs together...

334
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,720
and they dragged him.

335
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,880
On the way, people spat on him...

336
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,560
stabbed him, kicked him.

337
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Enough.

338
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,840
It's not your fault.

339
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,040
He trusted us.

340
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,720
His family trusted us.

341
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,360
I should have stopped it,

342
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,360
but I didn't.

343
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,240
I thought this would be great
for the country, great for my career...

344
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,840
but I saw the signs.

345
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
I did.

346
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,280
I've never met anyone

347
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,680
so sure of his abilities

348
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,840
and so eager to prove he could do it...

349
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,240
until I met Eli Cohen.

350
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Kamel!

351
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Oh.

352
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,920
Hi, friend!

353
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,160
- How are you?
- How are you?

354
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Yeah, okay.

355
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,680
Uh, this is my daughter, Saliha,
the one I told you about.

356
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,320
Your father talks about you all the time.
He loves you very much.

357
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,336
He speaks very highly of you as well.

358
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,040
Well, I should hope so,
I pay him handsomely to do that.

359
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,040
You two should get together.

360
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,640
A movie or dinner.

361
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,600
Father...

362
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,800
Take a taxi home.

363
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,320
I will continue with Kamel.

364
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,000
Pleasure meeting you.

365
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,240
Ah! She's wonderful, I told you, huh?

366
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
Ah, and beautiful too.

367
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,680
Are you sure you're her father?

368
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,480
We all benefit from this arrangement.

369
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,480
Why would you want to change it?

370
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
This is true.

371
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,520
But you have been particularly successful.

372
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,960
It is his business.

373
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
You're right.

374
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
I have been particularly successful.

375
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,400
Business is going well and I have been

376
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,440
reaping almost all the benefits.

377
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
But you

378
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,640
have sold more in the last four months
than you did all of last year.

379
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,400
How is this not a good outcome?

380
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,000
What do you think is fair?

381
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,880
We would like, uh...

382
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
thirty percent.

383
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,800
Do you mind?

384
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,720
- Who is he?
- Ma'azi Zaher Ad-Din,

385
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,000
the nephew
of the Syrian commander-in-chief.

386
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,840
He only gets away with that behavior
because of his uncle.

387
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,760
You will take 22 percent.
That's a significant increase.

388
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,680
And you will not renegotiate
for two years.

389
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,840
If you even attempt to, you're out.

390
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,560
Bye-bye.

391
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,800
- Pleasure.
- Next.

392
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you. See you soon.

393
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Tea, please.

394
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,160
It's been bothering me all night.

395
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,200
Who do you look like? An actor.

396
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
Guys,

397
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,160
who does he look like?

398
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,760
You remind me of someone I just saw...

399
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,400
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Jean-Paul Belmondo.

400
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Yes!

401
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,080
Exactly!

402
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,640
Belmondo.

403
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

404
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Hold this.

405
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,560
Pretend to shoot me.

406
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,720
No, no, thank you.

407
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,560
I said hold the gun, aim at me.

408
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Do it.

409
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Here.

410
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Aah!

411
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,240
Now, do the lip thing, you know,
with the thumb.

412
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,680
I'm busy. I have other customers.

413
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,760
It appears Monsieur Belmondo is taking
a break from acting.

414
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Monsieur,

415
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,200
please, I am such a fan.

416
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Please.

417
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,800
It's Belmondo!

418
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,120
- That is Belmondo.
- Yeah?

419
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,480
That is Belmondo.

420
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,480
- Happy now?
- I'm very happy.

421
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,680
Now, if you will, Mr. Belmondo,

422
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,840
pour another round for me and...

423
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,600
Omar Sharif. No, it's Kamel.

424
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,680
My new friend, Omar Sharif.

425
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,320
<i>♪ You are my best-kept secret ♪</i>

426
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,040

00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,440

431
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,880
<i>♪ You kill me with your secrets ♪</i>

432
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,040
You live here alone?

433
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
I do.

434
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,240
What is it that you do?

435
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,720
I'm a businessman.

436
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,880
And how about you?
I can see that you're in the military.

437
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,520
But given your current state,

438
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,680
I sincerely hope

439
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,080
that you are nota fighter pilot.

440
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Lieutenant.

441
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Army.

442
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,680
Southern sector.

443
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,800
I am honored to make your acquaintance.

444
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,440
A few months ago,
I was living far away from here,

445
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,400
and now I'm in the presence

446
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,720
of a real Syrian soldier.

447
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,080
And one who tonight
single-handily defeated

448
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,880
two whole bottles of vodka.

449
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,720
<i>♪ You are my strength ♪</i>

450
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Tell me,

451
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,200
have you ever met General Ad-Din?

452
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Yeah.

453
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
He's my uncle.

454
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
What?

455
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Oh.

456
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,800
I admire this man.

457
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,440
He's such a patriot.

458
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
If you say so.

459
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,440
I'm gonna make you
some strong Turkish coffee, okay?

460
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,880
Then we can talk some more.

461
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,680
Where are you posted?

462
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Who are you?

463
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
My name... My name is Kamel.

464
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,280
- Who?
- We met last night,

465
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,680
at the Morocco restaurant.

466
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,240
Why did you bring me here?

467
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,400
Answer me!

468
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,960
You were too drunk to drive home.

469
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,560
So I let you stay here.
You fell asleep on the couch.

470
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,840
That was so easy.

471
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,880
Ah, you should see your face,
like, it's so white.

472
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,360
You look like a ghost.

473
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

474
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,240
I didn't mean to offend you, like,

475
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,000
I was just kidding.

476
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,520
You pointed a gun at me,

477
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
in my house.

478
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,480
I want you out, now.

479
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,840
Uh... Look, I was... I was simply like...

480
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,560
Listen, I'm not one of your friends,
you entitled dog!

481
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,920
So take your things and go,

482
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,920
and I will be sure to report this
to your commanders.

483
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,320
I... I didn't mean to offend...

484
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,680
You son of a bitch.

485
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,680
Now we both look like ghosts.

486
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,680
Come on.

487
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,000
Ah, that was a good one.
That was a good one.

488
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,560
Let's eat.

489
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,680
Hi, Nadia.

490
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,120
Hi.

491
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,320
Hi, here you go, Grandma.

492
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,600
Ohh... Ooh!

493
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,800
- What? Too much?
- Don't be ridiculous, you look beautiful.

494
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,280
Oh, thank you.

495
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,640
I left food in the fridge.

496
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,640
I made your favorite cake, Maurice.

497
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,800
You shouldn't have baked for him.
He doesn't deserve it.

498
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,120
Maybe I should stay.

499
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,240
Nonsense. It's been five months.

500
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,840
I know, I just don't want to go anywhere
without him, it's not fun.

501
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,000
Enough, go.

502
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,920
You can't put your life on hold
because my brother isn't here.

503
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,360
You deserve a night off.

504
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,520
Here, I brought you.

505
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,680
Thank you, Sarah, thanks.

506
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,440
Who are you going with?

507
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,280
Just a woman I work for.

508
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,200
Her husband couldn't make it,
so she had an extra ticket.

509
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,640
I'll put the necklace on.

510
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
Thank you.

511
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,520
Why do you need pearls?

512
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,440
She's just going out to a concert.

513
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,720
- You're right. I shouldn't...
- It looks beautiful on you.

514
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,360
And you know how those Tel Avivians are.

515
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,200
You're going to show those snobs
who the most beautiful woman is.

516
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,080
Thank you.

517
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,120
If she starts crying...

518
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,360
I have raised eight children.

519
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,520
- You're right.
- Go.

520
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,240
Come, Maurice.

521
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,160
What? Oh.

522
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,360
Good boy.

523
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,800
- Where are you going?
- To do the dishes.

524
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,176
- No, there's no need.
- Ah-ah-ah!

525
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,000
Nadia, just go, please.

526
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,640
And enjoy your evening.

527
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,320
Say bye.

528
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Goodbye.

529
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Bye-bye.

530
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,960
- Tova.
- Hi.

531
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,520
- Hi.
- Hi, Nadia.

532
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,480
- You look gorgeous.
- You too. You too.

533
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,040
Nadia, I'm so sorry. I tried to call you.

534
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,360
What's wrong?

535
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,680
I'm so sorry.
I thought he couldn't make it.

536
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,040
He told me he couldn't make it,
but he left work early especially.

537
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,280
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

538
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,640
I'd tell him to go home and invite you,
but these tickets were so expensive.

539
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
Yeah.

540
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,880
That didn't come out right.

541
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,280
- Nadia.
- It's fine, Tova.

542
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,080
I understand.

543
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
I'm fine.

544
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,920
I know how excited you were to see them.

545
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,920
How about you go with Arik
and I can I can go to some other...

546
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Nonsense. You will go and you will enjoy.

547
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,080
I'm fine.

548
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,400
- You sure?
- Yeah.

549
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
- Hey, good to see you.
- Hey.

550
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,720
<i>Voy.</i>

551
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,680
Thank you.

552
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Go. Go.

553
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,480
Thank you.

554
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,440
You're the best. Thanks.

555
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,600
They are almost all...

556
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,560
Kamel!

557
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
Oh, Ma'azi!

Mm-hm.

Seif.

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,000
- I have news, <i>habibi.</i>
- Good or bad?

90
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
I don't know.

91
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,800
Hafez asked me to be
Minister of Information.

92
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,200
- So, what happened to the last one?
- Exactly.

93
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,400
They're going through ministers
faster than Hatoum goes through whores.

94
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,480
Suidani's becoming more and more paranoid.

95
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,440
Speaking of...

96
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,560
Ah, shit.

97
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,040
They arrested
the Deputy Minister of Defense last night.

98
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,680
Suidani thinks he sold information.

99
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
- To whom?
- It doesn't matter.

100
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,600
To the Americans and the Saudis,
who knows if it's even true?

101
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,080
They threw him in Mezze prison now.

102
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
So you're gonna get his job too?

103
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,800
No, Hafez Al-Assad would want
that position, you know?

104
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,280
He’s sick of running the Air Force.

105
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Kamel!

106
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,120
Kamel!

107
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Kamel!

108
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Who is that?

109
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,920
It's, ah... I don't know.

110
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,840
Probably the next Minister of Information,
eh?

111
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,120
Today marks the 18th anniversary

112
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,560
of Syria's independence from foreign rule.

113
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,880
The 18th anniversary

114
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,040
of the creation
of the greatest nation state

115
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,840
the Arab world has ever known.

116
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
Under the lead of our president,

117
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,760
Amin Al-Hafez, <i>hafidallah,</i>

118
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,760
Syria will continue to grow.

119
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,240
Not only among Arabic states,

120
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,400
but among all the countries of the world.

121
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,800
Independence has not been easy.

122
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,040
Many have feared
what a strong Syria could accomplish,

123
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,920
and so they have attempted
to drive us apart.

124
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,400
But no longer.

125
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
On this day of independence,

126
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,880
we acknowledge the struggles
of the past...

127
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,520
- I'll be right back.
- ...but we also look forward to a bright,

128
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,120
united, and glorious future

129
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,280
for all Syrians under the Ba'ath party.

130
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
Thank you.

131
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,400
His name is Mohammed Bin Laden.

132
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,400
He's a construction giant
from Saudi Arabia.

133
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,960
What's he doing in Syria?

134
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
We don't know.

135
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,960
We also don't know
how long he's been there.

136
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,200
Bin Laden's been involved in some of
the biggest construction efforts

137
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,320
in the Middle East,

138
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,400
including the reconstruction
of Al-Aqsa Mosque.

139
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,600
If he's working on something in Syria,

140
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,480
something no one knows about,

141
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,680
something the Syrians don't even trust
their own people with...

142
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,080
maybe it's...

143
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Shallal.

144
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
So tonight, send a message to 88
to follow the lead,

145
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
but he's not to make contact,
no matter what.

146
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,720
He should find out what
Bin Laden's working on, but that's all.

147
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,640
You used to be able to keep up.

148
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,720
Just be happy it's not yours.

149
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,760
Congratulations to me.

150
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,800
You tell him to stick to eight a.m.
and eight p.m. transmissions.

151
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Nothing more.

152
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
Golette?

153
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,840
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry about it.

154
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,320
- Traffic.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,160
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

156
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,480
The diagonal lines mean that it's
a top-secret document, you know.

157
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,800
Of course I know.
Those are the interesting ones.

158
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
Mohammed Bin Laden.

159
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,800
The construction billionaire?

160
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,800
I saw him talking to the president
the other day.

161
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,040
What brings him to town?

162
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,400
Kamel, <i>habibi,</i>
it's not like they tell me everything.

163
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,360
Don't lie, my friend. I know when
you're not telling me the truth.

164
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,000
It's like listening to you
on the radio all over again.

165
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Why so discreet?

166
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,640
Why the sudden interest?

167
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
'Cause I don't trust people
who are richer than me,

168
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,520
and I don't trust
a Minister of Information

169
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
who claims to have no information.

170
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,880
There are secrets,
and then there are secrets.

171
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,320
The ones that might get you murdered
are the ones that I'm discreet about.

172
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
By the way,

173
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,960
do you mind if I use
your beautiful apartment this weekend?

174
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Again?

175
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Who now?

176
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,000
Rita, you can take the cups.

177
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
<i>Kalb.</i>

178
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
You are a dog.

179
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I know.

180
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Okay.

181
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,360
I'll see you later, yes?

182
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,760
<i>- Shukran, habibi.
- Shukran illa.</i>

183
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
What do you think?

184
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,520
It's almost as beautiful as you are.

185
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,160
Is it better than the blue one?

186
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,040
They're both amazing. Let's get them both.

187
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Thank you, Kamel.

188
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,240
Thank you so much.

189
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,520
- I'm really excited about tonight.
- As am I.

190
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,200
But if we don't hurry,
there's not gonna be a tonight. Come on.

191
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,040
I'll take both dresses.

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,480
That's a good choice, especially for me.

193
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,240
- Ow!
- What?

194
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,000
Mmph.

195
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Again.

196
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,640
I'd like to kill this machine,

197
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,896
- before it kills me.
- Show me.

198
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Show me.

199
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,240
I can give you a good price for that.

200
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Can you ship it?

201
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,640
If you pay enough,
I can ship it to the moon.

202
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,640
- That's wonderful, thank you.
- You're welcome.

203
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,480
Oh, the smell of
Zeinab's cooking is killing me.

204
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,880
Ah! I'm famished!

205
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,080
You won't be when I'm done with you,
I promise.

206
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,200
The girls have been cleaning fish
all day long.

207
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Aah.

208
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,280
Well, yes. Quite a handful.

209
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,680
General Ad-Din tried to kill himself.

210
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
- What?
- Tried to hang himself.

211
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,240
Couldn't take the torture.

212
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,480
This isn't appropriate conversation.

213
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,720
It is not public knowledge.

214
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,840
I can't believe anyone trusted you
with the Information Ministry.

215
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,760
Oh...

216
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,360
They entrusted
our nation's greatest secret

217
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,520
to a bigger gossip than my wife.

218
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,160
We're among friends, Michel.
Calm down, come on.

219
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,480
You seem upset, Kamel.

220
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,520
Is it because you used to know his nephew?

221
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,520
No, it's not that at all.

222
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,520
It's because of the people.

223
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,080
They don't understand our purpose.

224
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,160
I speak to them on the street, you know,

225
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,240
those who were my friends,
my business partners, vendors.

226
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,840
They think this is just another shift
in the balance of power.

227
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,600
They don't know Al-Hafez like I do.

228
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,040
He cares about Syria,

229
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
about our children,

230
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,520
about making this a proud,

231
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
independent Arab nation again.

232
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,600
They're afraid of change,
but there's no progress without change.

233
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,440
- Hm.
- What they do not realize

234
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,880
is that the Ba'ath is the future,

235
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,000
and that the president

236
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,760
is actually saving Syria.

237
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Oh.

238
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
I apologize, I would never have been
so bitter if I knew you were there.

239
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,680
No, no, no, no, no.

240
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,920
I very much enjoyed listening
to your impassioned speech.

241
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,000
It's rare that one gets to hear
what is said behind his back

242
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,880
and even more rare when what is said

243
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,120
is good.

244
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,680
Thank you.

245
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Um...

246
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,280
I'm going to steal him for a bit, okay?

247
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Come.

248
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,440
I hope you know I meant every word.

249
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,440
The Ba'ath has become like a home to me.

250
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,360
I'm so happy.

251
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,200
This is as personal to you as it is to me.

252
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,400
Can I ask you to do something for me,
Kamel?

253
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Anything.

254
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
After dinner,

255
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,960
go to the terrace.

256
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Sure.

257
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,320
Enjoying the view?

258
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Magnificent.

259
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,240
Mohammed Bin Laden.

260
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Ah.

261
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
- Kamel Amin Tha...
- I know. I know.

262
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,160
Al-Hafez tells me you have
a big import-export business.

263
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,560
Well, it's adequate.

264
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,120
Mainly furniture and textiles.

265
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,720
And these shipments of furniture,

266
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,760
what European ports do you use?

267
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,760
A variety.

268
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,360
Gent, Narvik, Marseille, Split.

269
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,000
We need to get something into the country.

270
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,200
A few things, actually.

271
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,800
We've been having a hard time
doing it discreetly, you know.

272
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,360
These are things we don't want
other governments to know about.

273
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,000
So if we use the regular channels,

274
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,600
no doubt the information will leak out.

275
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,760
So what exactly are we talking about?

276
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,280
Nothing that would get you into trouble.

277
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,640
Not arms or anything of the sort,
I can assure you of that.

278
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,360
Just a few... pieces of machinery
that I'm missing.

279
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,480
Missing from what?

280
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,280
I do not even know what line of business
you are in.

281
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,760
We'll just say, um...
agro project, Yugoslavia.

282
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,480
Osama, I told you to stay inside.

283
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,320
Go to the kitchen, I'll be back soon.

284
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
<i>Yalla. Yalla.</i>

285
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,520
Now, in terms of the boat schedule,
what would be...

286
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Uh, hold on.

287
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,080
You are asking me to risk my business.

288
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,040
I deserve to know
what you would use it for.

289
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,600
I apologize,
but that's not how this will work.

290
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
I will tell Al-Hafez this isn't for you.

291
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,320
We'll find someone else.

292
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
W... Wait.

293
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,880
Why is he transmitting
outside of his regular schedule?

294
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,800
He has something against us sleeping.

295
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,480
<i>I can get to Split
in a couple of days.</i>

296
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,880
And how do you make sure
that they don't findthe tracking device?

297
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,320
It's very small.

298
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,960
And even if they do,
it can't be tracked back to us.

299
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,920
It's made by the Soviets.

300
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,200
Okay, then. Let's do it.

301
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,240
Jacob, and when it's done,

302
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,000
when the shipment reaches
its destination,

303
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,360
we bring him in for a debrief.

304
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,800
We schedule him a business trip.

305
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
He hasn't been home in a very long time.

306
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,040
Every agent needs to come up for air,

307
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
or they drown.

308
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Right.

309
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Good.

310
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,640
So, when you get to Split,
how will you get into the warehouse?

311
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,960
I don't know if I've ever seen you
so busy.

312
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,840
The business must be going well.

313
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,640
It is.

314
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,680
It's been overwhelming.

315
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
I apologize.

316
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,360
Well...

317
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,440
I'm glad that we could finally find
the time to be together.

318
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,800
Mm. Me, too.

319
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,160
- My father...
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
- He's been asking about you.
- Oh?

321
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,960
He's been asking if and when
are you planning on proposing?

322
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,320
I told him, of course,
that it wasn't my place to say.

323
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,520
That I didn't know your mind
or your heart.

324
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up.

325
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,280
I ruined the dinner.

326
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Nonsense.

327
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Kamel!

328
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
You're just going to ignore that I'm here?

329
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Again?

330
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,440
Just wait inside.

331
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,560
What are you doing here, Ma'azi?

332
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
It's not safe for you to be seen here.

333
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,680
- You should go...
- You worried about me?

334
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,120
Do you want to get yourself killed?
Is that it?

335
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,680
These people are dangerous.

336
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,400
Your new friends, you mean?

337
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,560
Get your fucking hands off me!

338
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,920
Stop following me around.

339
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Did you know they were going to arrest
my uncle at your party?

340
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,920
My uncle treated you with kindness.

341
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
So did I.

342
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,640
I went above and beyond for you.

343
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,600
I thought you were my friend.

344
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,320
I am your friend, I am.

345
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Did you know?

346
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
What did he want?

347
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,640
He seemed very upset.

348
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,520
Nothing, it's fine. Let's go upstairs.

349
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Kamel?

350
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Go home.

351
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,560
Tell your father it's off.

352
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
What's off?

353
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Me and you.

354
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
It's over.

355
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
<i>Khalas.</i>

356
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Go home.

357
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
Just go home.

358
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Sophie,

359
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,160
would you go and check the mailbox?

360
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Okay, Mommy.

361
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,720
Mommy, I got a letter from Daddy!

362
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,920
<i>Guys, come on, the game is starting.</i>

363
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,360
- So sorry I have to leave.
- Don't worry about it.

364
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,520
I'm just glad I can help.

365
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,080
The Egyptian desk gets boring.

366
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,720
Well, he should be transmitting
at eight p.m. sharp.

367
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,200
Got it, don't worry.

368
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,760
Same protocols as our desk.

369
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,200
Except this is 88.

370
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,440
Aah...

371
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,760
Ah, come on.

372
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Oh...

373
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,960
Eh...

374
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,920
- Yes!
<i>- Yes!</i>

375
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Every time.

376
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
What do you mean...

377
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
"every time"?

378
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,440
These... interferences
you are talking about,

379
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,360
how often do they take place?

380
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,680
I don't know.

381
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,320
Every morning, every night.

382
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,680
At what time?

383
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,800
Hey, what's the code "singer" mean?

384
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,920
We don't use it on the Egyptian desk.

385
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,560
Just hand it in.
They'll deal with it upstairs.

386
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Okay.

387
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,840
Were you expecting something else?

388
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
To be frank, yes.

389
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
What is this?

390
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,600
Agricultural equipment?

391
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,480
You're using my shipping service
to become a farmer, Bin Laden?

392
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Perfect.

393
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,240
You've done a great service.

394
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,200
But from here, I will take care of it.

395
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
<i>Shukran.</i>

396
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Shallal.

397
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
What did you say?

398
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,720
I've heard the name whispered, the rumors.

399
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,360
I've proved that I can be of service.

400
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Take me there.

401
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,440
Show it to me. I can help.

402
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,480
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

403
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,880
<i>Shtuglun, yalla.</i>

404
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,960
Yes, yes, I'm sure he's not home.

405
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,160
He gave me the key
and I called him before.

406
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,680
Aaah! Here you go.

407
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Give me one kiss.

408
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,200
Stop it! Not here.

409
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,440
Aah!

410
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,120
Pumping station?

411
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,160
Mr. Thaabeth.

412
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,640
I was looking for George.

413
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,800
We have dinner plans.

414
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Come with us.

415
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Sit.

416
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
Water,

417
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,000
the source of life.

418
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,400
No creature, no matter how primitive,
can survive without it.

419
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,880
No civilization can thrive without it.

420
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,920
That is why mankind has always fought
over sources of water.

421
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
For years,

422
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,720
we've been playing a deadly game
with our neighbors.

423
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,360
They steal the water they claim is theirs.

424
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,080
We, uh, damage their main pipes,
blow them up,

425
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,120
but they fix them and life goes on.

426
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,560
It's a stupid cycle.

427
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,920
Lake Tiberias may be in Israel,

428
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,600
but the two rivers that feed it are not.

429
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,320
The Banias and the Hasbani.

430
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,360
Without those rivers...

431
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,640
As they say,

432
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,960
<i>l'chiam.</i>

433
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,280
Why are you telling me this?

434
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,920
Prime Minister Eshkol,

435
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,160
it is an honor to meet you.

436
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
Agent 88.

437
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,000
We don't have much time.

438
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
So,

439
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,560
tell us exactly what he said.

440
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,840
I have been thinking a lot
about what you said

441
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,360
at the dinner a few weeks ago,

442
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,600
about feeling like a part of us.

443
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,680
I feel the same.

444
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,600
All this whispering behind my back,

445
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,560
scheming, conspiring...

446
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,600
I can't sleep at night.

447
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,800
I'm going to ask you a question,

448
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,640
and I want you to answer me honestly.

449
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,240
Of course.

450
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Anything.

451
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,560
Suidani is convinced
that there is a spy working against us.

452
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,160
He thinks it explains
many of our failed operations.

453
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,240
I got rid of my Deputy Minister of Defense
because Suidani didn't trust him.

454
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,280
I'm telling you all this because
you've become a part of the family.

455
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,360
I would like you to be our new
Deputy Minister of Defense.

456
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,520
So what will be my answer?

457
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,880
Hey, sorry I'm late.

458
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,240
Hey, Maurice. Sit.

459
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,920
- The food is still hot.
- Hey, everyone.

460
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,080
Thank you.

461
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,720
- Hey.
- What?

462
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,120
Did you wash your hands?

463
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
No.

464
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,480
Um...

465
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay. Okay!

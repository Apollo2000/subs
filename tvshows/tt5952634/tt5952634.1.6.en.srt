1
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,400
Are you finished with your meal?

2
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
You didn't touch your food.

3
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,880
<i>Mesdames et Messieurs, nous allons
bientôt atterrir à Paris-Le Bourget.</i>

4
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,920
<i>Nous vous demanderons de garder
vos ceintures attachées jusqu'à...</i>

5
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
Jacques Mercier.

6
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,800
How was your flight, Mrs. Cohen?

7
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Okay.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,680
We are right on time.
They should be expecting us.

9
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,520
We will be holding the press conference
this afternoon,

10
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,840
after our meeting in my office.

11
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,920
Nadia,
if there is anything else you need...

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Thank you.

13
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,920
Are you sure you're up to this?

14
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,840
<i>Passeport, s'il vous plaît.</i>

15
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,040
<i>Dan Peleg, Nadia Cohen
for the Ambassador, please.</i>

16
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,216
<i>Je suis navré, c'est impossible.
L'Ambassadeur n'est pas ici aujourd'hui.</i>

17
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,920
<i> Comment?
Nous avions rendez-vous.</i>

18
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,816
<i>Ils s'en sont occupés il y a plus d'une
semaine. Le président lui-même...</i>

19
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,601
We were told we could meet
the Ambassador. This is unacceptable.

20
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
Dan, let me, please.

21
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,080
<i>Je demande à comprendre.</i>

22
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,240
<i>Je suis sûr que ce rendez-vous
était confirmé par...</i>

23
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,600
We came all the way from Israel
to meet with the Syrian Ambassador.

24
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,360
<i>Pouvez-vous vérifier...</i>

25
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,960
<i>- Tu avais semblage...
- Bon. Monsieur, écoutez-moi...</i>

26
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Nadia.

27
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Nadia.

28
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
You are?

29
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,360
My name is Nadia Cohen.

30
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,360
You've arrested my husband for espionage.

31
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,440
<i>...nuclear weapons...</i>

32
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,160
Hello!

33
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,400
Mm.

34
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Hey.

35
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Say hello.

36
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
What did I say?

37
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,960
I brought you some Swiss chocolate.

38
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
- Hey, come here.
- Come. Come, come, come.

39
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
You want some chocolate?

40
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,480
Irit, come.

41
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
You want some?

42
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,320
Do you remember me?

43
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
Aah, you grew.

44
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,840
Mommy, he looks like Daddy.

45
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,760
This is Daddy, sweetheart.

46
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Oh!

47
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,800
A pumping station will divert the waters
of the Hasbani and Banias rivers,

48
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,160
hence drying up the Sea of Galilee.

49
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
So...

50
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,000
what are we waiting for, huh?

51
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Good. We are in agreement, then.

52
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,720
Get me a plan as soon as possible.

53
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,520
We don't know how many people know
about this project.

54
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
Especially civilians.

55
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
- Dan.
- Look...

56
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,520
Shallal is a top-secret project,

57
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,960
so secret that the Syrians brought in
a team from Saudi Arabia to build it.

58
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Very few civilians know about this.

59
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,960
Al-Hafez told this to 88 personally.

60
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,080
Your point?

61
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Attacking Shallal

62
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,360
will make 88 an immediate suspect.

63
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,920
Shallal is an existential threat
to the state of Israel.

64
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,080
It will put us in danger.

65
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,800
An air strike will put our agent
in immediate danger.

66
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
If we attack Shallal,
we should consider not sending him back.

67
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,080
- What are you talking about?
- He's done his job.

68
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,760
He's gone above and beyond.

69
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,760
Let's bring him home.

70
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
We have an opportunity

71
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,280
of having a Deputy Defense Minister

72
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,880
in the Syrian government.

73
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,640
It is an opportunity once in a lifetime.
It will not happen again!

74
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,360
- I understand. But...
- This is bigger than you and him, Dan.

75
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
He's going back.

76
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
This is bigger than all of us.

77
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,920
This is too good an opportunity.

78
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,640
The benefits of us having
a Deputy Defense Minister in Syria

79
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,280
outweigh the risks of him getting caught.

80
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,480
Coordinate the attack in a way
that keeps him clear of suspicion.

81
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,000
Attack when he's already back in Syria,
after the position is his.

82
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,160
We... We could also possibly allow
some minor victories by the Syrians

83
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,200
after his appointment
to help bolster his image.

84
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Who is she?

85
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,760
Someone who shouldn't be talking.

86
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
But she's right.

87
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,240
So I said, "Well, would you feel
more comfortable if I flew the plane?"

88
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,720
Tell us about Rome.

89
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,240
I have the postcard you sent from there
on my refrigerator.

90
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Every time someone comes into my house,
I show it to them.

91
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,840
Yes, she's shown it to everyone.

92
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
My son...

93
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,800
man of the world.

94
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,600
It's one of the most beautiful cities
in the whole world.

95
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Oh!

96
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,160
Did you stay in a hotel there?

97
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,640
Yes, I... stayed in this amazing hotel

98
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,920
- with the most updated facilities...
- What was the name of it?

99
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,080
I forgot.

100
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,200
It just flew out of my head.

101
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
Nadia, the food is really delicious.

102
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,760
- Mm. Delicious.
- Great job.

103
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,400
- Thank you.
- What was your favorite place?

104
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,880
- Where?
- In Rome.

105
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
It was all gorgeous.

106
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,360
The Colosseum, if I had to choose one.

107
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
It's so magnificent.

108
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,400
You're standing there and you feel tiny.

109
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
What else?

110
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,840
- Apart from the Colosseum?
- Mm-hm.

111
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,520
Not all of us are so lucky
to travel as you, Eli.

112
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,520
We want to hear about it.

113
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,720
I want to hear, too.

114
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
Leave him alone, Maurice.
I don't know what's got into you.

115
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,920
He's just got back.

116
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
Now, where is the kucheri?

117
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,640
Are we going to eat it
or are we going to keep it in the kitchen?

118
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,760
It's on the way.

119
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
I'll help you.

120
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
So, what have I missed?

121
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,880
Did you manage to replace your car yet?

122
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Fuck you, Eli.

123
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm so sorry. I don't know what
the matter is with him.

124
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,440
- I'll go see him.
- No, no, no. I'll go.

125
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm sure it's nothing.

126
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
<i>Eema.</i>

127
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
It's all good.

128
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Maurice.

129
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Maurice.

130
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,560
What's wrong? You're acting strange.

131
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm worried about you.

132
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Hey.

133
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,080
What are we doing, Eli? Huh?

134
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,600
- What do you mean?
- I know, Eli.

135
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
I know.

136
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,040
Or should I call you Agent 88?

137
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,920
A few weeks ago,
I replaced an analyst on the Syrian desk.

138
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,080
Did "N" get a sewing machine?

139
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,040
You're not making any sense. What...

140
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,800
Stop, Eli. Stop!

141
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,320
You are talking to me.

142
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
I'm a buyer for the Ministry of Defense.

143
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,760
I go round the world
and I purchase office furnitures,

144
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,560
but nothing even dangerous,
so whatever else you think you know,

145
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,800
- you're mistaken, okay?
- No.

146
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,720
Okay?
No.

147
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,640
So we're gonna go inside now and enjoy
the food that Nadia prepared for us.

148
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Please.

149
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
Please don't go back, Eli.

150
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Quit.

151
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Today.

152
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
For your sake.

153
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,960
For your children's sake.

154
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,320
If something happens to you,

155
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,640
the family will be destroyed.

156
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,320
She spent the whole day
cooking in the kitchen.

157
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,000
The least we can do is sit together,
as a family.

158
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
- Here, Maurice.
- Thank you.

159
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Maya.

160
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,560
- Hello.
<i>- Maurice, my brother, he knows.</i>

161
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,360
Eli. Eli, slow down.

162
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
What happened?

163
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,280
Maurice, my brother, knows.

164
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,200
He was put onto my line by accident.

165
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,640
<i>Somebody in the office</i>

166
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,840
<i>replaced an analyst with my brother.</i>

167
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,720
How could you be so fucking incompetent?

168
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,560
- I'm out there, risking everything, and...
<i>- </i>Did he tell anyone?

169
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,280
That's not the point.

170
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,720
We need to be sure he didn't.
Let me take care of it.

171
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Do you think I need this added pressure?
Do you?

172
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,360
<i>Can't you people do your fucking job?</i>

173
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,840
I'll take care of it, Eli, I promise you.

174
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,320
You need to rest. You... sound on edge.

175
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,120
- You should...
<i>- Just fix it!</i>

176
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,200
How the fuck did that happen?

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,440
I don't know, but I'll find out.

178
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,760
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

179
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
What was that about?

180
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,480
I had to call somebody from work.
I don't want to talk about it.

181
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,640
Why are you so upset?

182
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,680
I'm not upset.

183
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,640
Since when do you smoke?

184
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,160
Recently.

185
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Is this about the argument
you had with Maurice?

186
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,760
What happened between you two?

187
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,920
I did not have an argument with Maurice.

188
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,680
It's just I don't want
to have to cross the damn street

189
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,520
or go to a neighbor's apartment
just because we don't have a phone.

190
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,360
You should have your own phone.

191
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,760
I mean,
after everything I do for this country,

192
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,560
the least they can do is look after
my family when I'm not here.

193
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,000
Is this the prize I get
for you being gone?

194
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,680
- A phone?
- Everybody has their own phone

195
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
and television set.

196
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,840
I mean,
what if I want to watch the football?

197
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,280
You know, these are basic things, Nadi.

198
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,040
In the apartment I have, I have both of
these things. You should have them too.

199
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,880
I thought you stay in hotels
when you travel.

200
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
What?

201
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,080
You said you have a phone
in your apartment.

202
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
What I mean is in th... the hotels.

203
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,360
In the hotels that I stay in,

204
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,840
they have better conditions
than in my own home.

205
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,080
What I'm saying is I have nice things,
Nadia, and I want you to have them too.

206
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't want you to be left... left behind.

207
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
I have... I have six suits.

208
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,040
I have expensive watches.

209
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,800
And the people there, the people...
the people, they love me!

210
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,160
- You know, they admire me, Nadi!
- Eli, what are you talking about?

211
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,840
What are you doing tomorrow morning?

212
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,880
The TV is too big, Eli.

213
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,280
We can still return it.

214
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,800
It won't fit through the door.

215
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
So I'll buy a bigger door.

216
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
It is perfect.

217
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
It's too much money.

218
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Why do I work?

219
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
What?

220
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,400
You've come a long way
since you worked here, Eli Cohen.

221
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm very proud of you.

222
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,440
Do you have a receipt for these items?

223
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,480
Excuse me?

224
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,400
A receipt for all this,
and your papers, identification.

225
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,000
Wh... Why would we need papers?

226
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,720
We are paying customers here.

227
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,720
We do not need to show you anything.

228
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm just doing my job.

229
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
- Items have been stolen.
- So... Sorry.

230
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Now I am a thief, is that it?

231
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,480
You don't think I can afford this?

232
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,600
Eli, he didn't say that. Just show him.

233
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Listen to your little wife.

234
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,000
My little... My little wife?

235
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,800
You will apologize to her,

236
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,920
and then you will apologize to me.

237
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,320
Who the hell do you think you are?

238
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,760
- You are nothing!
- What are you doing, Eli? Stop.

239
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,880
- Calm down and stand to the side.
- All right, get your hands off me now

240
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,800
- or I will...
- Or?

241
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,560
I said get your hands off me.

242
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,696
- Get away from me!
- Where are you taking him?

243
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,120
- What is this?
- Stop it!

244
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,840
Right now!

245
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,400
- Settle down!
- Where are you taking him?

246
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,680
Stop it! Stop it.

247
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,280
I spoke to the department store
and to the police officers you attacked.

248
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
I didn't...

249
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,320
I didn't attack anybody.
They harassed me.

250
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
- Regardless, no charges will be filed.
- I defended myself.

251
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
- They understand.
- Okay, thank you.

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,320
- Okay, it's good that you called me.
- They understand?

253
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,720
Understand what?

254
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,000
What's gotten into you?

255
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,000
Normal people don't go around
behaving like this.

256
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,920
This... This happens, Nadia.

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,680
We probably overworked Eli.

258
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,840
- Hm.
- That's all.

259
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,960
He just needs some time to...
to rest and readjust. That's all.

260
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,400
This isn't uncommon.

261
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Really?

262
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,360
This happens to many people who buy
furniture for the Department of Defense?

263
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,720
Do you think I'm that big a fool?

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,160
- Nadia, please...
- Let's have a real conversation, for once.

265
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,080
The three of us. Finally.

266
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Let's have an open, honest conversation
on what my husband does.

267
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,976
- Nadia...
- And if either of you tell me

268
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that Eli's buying furniture,
I will break his face.

269
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Where did you buy me the sewing machine,
Eli?

270
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
Where did it come from?

271
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,440
Everything is going to be okay,
I promise you.

272
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,520
- He just needs some time...
- Where did you buy me the sewing machine?

273
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,720
- I bought it in the Galer...
- Don't you dare!

274
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,760
You mumble in your sleep.

275
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,120
You sometimes shout out names.

276
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
Who is Ma'azi?

277
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,880
And don't tell me it's your friend
from Paris.

278
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Who's Saliha?

279
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,080
<i>What do we tell her?
She won't buy this.</i>

280
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,600
We'll think of something.

281
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,640
No, she's too smart to lie to.

282
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,120
Why can't we just tell her the truth?

283
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,120
The truth is probably worse
than anything she can imagine.

284
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,520
Maybe, uh, we tell her you're in
a friendlier Arab country.

285
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,496
I don't know. I'll think of something.

286
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,560
Eli, are you okay?

287
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm different.

288
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,680
When I first became Kamel, it was...
it was just an act, you know?

289
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,200
I was aware of how I held myself,

290
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,720
my accent,

291
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
my posture,

292
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
everything.

293
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,920
I thought of Nadia every moment.

294
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,760
But now those nightmares
that she was talking about,

295
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
they're not even mine, they're Kamel's.

296
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,240
Taking off the clothes,
it doesn't work anymore.

297
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,960
I can't put him away.

298
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
I'm pretending to be me.

299
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,160
You just need more time to decompress.

300
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,640
These shifts are very difficult,
and you've been gone for a long time.

301
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,000
But you'll remember who you are.

302
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,760
You will, I promise you.

303
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,960
What if I don't want to?

304
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,720
Don't want to what?

305
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,360
Listen to me.

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,480
Kamel isn't real.

307
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,800
That life isn't real.

308
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,560
You are not invincible,

309
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,920
and you are not above suspicion.

310
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,640
Ma'azi, Seif, Al-Ard,
they are not your friends.

311
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,160
You are not Kamel Amin Thaabeth,

312
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,440
you are Eli Cohen,

313
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,800
and whatever it takes,
you need to remember that.

314
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
Do you understand me?

315
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
The office...

316
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,600
The office hasn't decided
on a timeline yet,

317
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,400
but you'll be going back soon.

318
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,400
And once you are back,
Shallal will be attacked

319
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,800
and you will accept the minister position.

320
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,280
You cannot afford to be careless.

321
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,040
You cannot afford to be confused.

322
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,800
And you will apologize to Saliha.

323
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,080
Make up with her. You need that cover.

324
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,840
You need to put down roots.

325
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,200
You're too old to be single.

326
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,560
Don't want them thinking
you're funny in that way.

327
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,600
And if I accept this position...

328
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
how long...

329
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,520
how long do you expect me to stay there?

330
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,080
For now, go be with your wife, Eli Cohen.

331
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Eli.

332
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Eli.

333
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
What?

334
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,600
You are the love of my life.
I need you... I need you to know that.

335
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,120
You are the love of my life.

336
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
Whatever happens to me,

337
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
I need you to know.

338
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,120
I know, Eli, I know.

339
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,160
But I need you to be honest with me.

340
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,560
I need you to talk to me.

341
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,360
Ah, my hands, my hands.

342
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,320
My hands are on fire.

343
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
What?

344
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Why?

345
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,840
If I go back...

346
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm scared.

347
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Say no.

348
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,200
Say no, Eli.

349
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,960
Whatever they want you to do, say no.

350
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Stay.

351
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,680
Please stay.

352
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,760
<i>Ready to go, Kamel?</i>

353
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Goodbye.

354
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,200
Kamel? Look, what are you doing there,
standing like a fool?

355
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,560
This is your welcome party.
Come in, come in!

356
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,280
Hey, how are you?

357
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,920
Oh, General.

358
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,160
- How are you?
- When did you get back? Huh?

359
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,480
Only a few days ago.

360
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,640
- See?
- How was Zürich?

361
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Well...

362
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,000
it was wealthy and boring, much like you.

363
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,520
So...

364
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
Aah...

365
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,080
Don't hold back.

366
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,840
Everybody wants to know.
What are you going to tell him?

367
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,840
Am I sitting with the next
Deputy Defense Minister?

368
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,280
Well, I would like to announce

369
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,280
that after much consideration...

370
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,000
I will have a large whiskey with soda
on the rocks.

371
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Waiter, please.

372
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,000
As for the other matter,

373
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,080
I will tell him in private.

374
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,080
The President deserves to know first.

375
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,400
Makes sense.

376
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,600
Listen, Kamel,

377
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,600
the President needs some good news now,

378
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,520
especially after this...

379
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,720
mess with these spies.

380
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,280
He needs people around that he can trust.

381
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,120
Who were they? How did they catch them?

382
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,320
Military officers.

383
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
High level, too.

384
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,200
Suidani suspected something

385
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
and had them followed
straight to the American embassy.

386
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,200
Broad daylight.

387
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,160
They met with a CIA operative,
Walter Snowden.

388
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,280
The Americans managed to get him out,
but...

389
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
l...

390
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
What is this?

391
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,960
This is the third time
since I've been back.

392
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,840
It's not the same city you left, Kamel.

393
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,680
How accurate are these?

394
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,480
You make sure the neighborhoods
we are scouting have no power.

395
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,040
This is very, very accurate.

396
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,320
It's... It's bad.

397
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,920
Head north into Abu Rummaneh quarter.

398
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,440
Two minutes to Abu Rummaneh.

399
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,640
Turn off power to the neighborhood.

400
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Illegal signal.

401
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,000
West.

402
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Now.

403
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
It's gone. It's gone.

404
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
Yes.

405
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Thank you.

406
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,600
The planes are in the air.

407
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,720
Seven minutes.

408
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,720
He's a hero to his people.

409
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,640
He's in Jordan right now,
but he'll soon join us in Syria.

410
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,920
I've been reading about this, uh...

411
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,680
Yasser Arafat

412
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and his PLO.

413
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
What brings him here?

414
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,760
Ah, politics, again and again!

415
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,800
Ever since you became the president,
we don't do anything fun.

416
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh, yes, we do.

417
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,160
I miss fun.

418
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Saliha...

419
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,840
Careful. Be careful with him.

420
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,440
Don't let him turn into my husband.

421
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,240
- You know, I'm fascinated by all of this.
- Ugh.

422
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,640
Please, continue.

423
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,840
Well, I agreed to fund the military wing
of the PLO, the Fatah.

424
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,560
Arafat will be training
guerrilla soldiers here

425
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,800
to infiltrate and seed fear
into the Zionists' heart.

426
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,440
A little terror will drive Israel crazy,

427
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,200
but they won't get the world's support,
and they can't blame us.

428
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Brilliant.

429
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Brilliant.

430
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,120
We're on the verge of doing
great things together, Kamel.

431
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,720
A toast, then.

432
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,080
To my president

433
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,960
and to his new Deputy Minister of Defense.

434
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,920
A-ha.

435
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,560
And to my future wife.

436
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
To wives.

437
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,440
What is that? Get down!

438
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,760
- Get down!
- What is happening?

439
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,040
Please, Mr. President.

440
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,920
Follow me.

441
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,960
Hurry.

442
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,280
Mr. President.

443
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Shallal.

444
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Faster!

445
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Damn it!

446
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,440
Take me to Suidani.

447
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Stand back!

448
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,360
You are going to send a message

449
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,400
to your friends.

450
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
Tell them...

451
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
the game

452
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
is over.

453
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Jacob!

454
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,480
Maya, I'll do it.

455
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,080
Sophie, take your sister inside.

456
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Sophie, do it now.

457
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
But...

458
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,360
I need to tell you something.

459
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,080
Don't say another word.

460
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,960
No. No.

461
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
No.

462
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
Are you sure?

463
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,240
Absolutely positive?

464
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Maybe... May...

465
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,320
- Maybe this is a mistake.
- We caught him in the act.

466
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,960
All this time.

467
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Years!

468
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,920
- How could he have fooled us like this?
- Mr. President,

469
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,760
- I warned you from the beginning not to...
- I want everyone who was involved!

470
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Do you hear me?

471
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,280
Everyone!

472
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,040
I didn't know.

473
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,680
You and all your friends ate from
his hands.

474
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,200
Fucked in his parties.

475
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,560
You helped him, not me.

476
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,440
Ah!

477
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,680
<i>Eli Cohen, known in Syria</i>

I don't want it. Take it away! Now!

491
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,480
Hey.

492
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,880
<i>Mesdames et Messieurs, nous allons
bientôt atterrir à Paris-Le Bourget.</i>

493
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,960
<i>Nous vous demanderons
de garder vos ceintures attachées</i>

494
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
<i>jusqu'à l'immobilisation complète de...</i>

495
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,040
I was on the phone with Jacob.

496
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,680
The Prime Minister has authorized us
to make any deal possible to free him.

497
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,320
We're going to do anything possible
to bring him back.

498
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,040
- Nadia, I know this...
- Did you read today's newspapers?

499
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,920
The Lebanese papers?

500
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,760
The Iraqi papers?

501
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,600
The Egyptians?

502
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,400
They're all making fun of Al-Hafez.

503
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,880
Saying Eli turned Syria into a joke.

504
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,280
They are going to kill him.

505
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,120
You're ready?

506
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,720
Thank you for coming here today.

507
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,680
My name is Jacques Mercier.
I'm a human rights lawyer,

508
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,200
and I represent Mrs. Cohen and her family,

509
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,400
who have hired my services

510
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,720
to advocate and demand
the just release of her husband,

511
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Eli Cohen,

512
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,120
who has been detained in Syria.

513
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,720
How was Damascus?

514
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,760
I need to talk with
the Israeli Prime Minister.

515
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,240
<i>Merci.</i>

516
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,680
Hello.

517
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Rabbi Endebbo?

518
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,920
- Yes.
- Come with us.

519
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,800
Did we hear from the Frog?

520
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,320
Yes.

521
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,120
Thank you for coming this late.

522
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,200
This is George Seif, Radio Damascus.

523
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,400
<i>A few minutes ago, our beloved president,
Amin Al-Hafez,</i>

524
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,240
<i>asked me to read this announcement.</i>

525
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,880
<i>The Zionist spy, Eli Cohen...</i>

526
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,600
<i>...known in Syria as Kamel Amin Thaabeth,</i>

527
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,640
<i>has been found guilty of treason.</i>

528
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,800
<i>Therefore, our beloved president</i>

529
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,360
<i>has decided that Cohen
will be executed tonight in Marjeh Square.</i>

530
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,400
No!

531
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,320
No!

532
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,320
No! No, no, no!

533
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,640
No, no, no, no, no!

534
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,880
No!

535
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,520
Now, sign your name.

536
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,040
My poor boy,

537
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,120
you do not know who you are.

538
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,960
We don't have much time.
Please, sign your letter.

539
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,440
- Dan, this is...
- Hello.

540
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,280
Thank you for coming.

541
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,920
Please, sit.

542
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So,

543
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,680
do you know who we are?

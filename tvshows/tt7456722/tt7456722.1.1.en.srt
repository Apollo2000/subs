BIFF (Southern accent):
And I says to him,

00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,982
"Never again, Mr. President,

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,318
can we let the Chinese motorboat
our tits like that."

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,571
I says, "Who's negotiating
your treaties?"

6
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,240
Jimmy looks at me with that
peanut farmer grin of his

7
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:34,052
and says,
"Biff, you are now, friend,

8
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,495
"but don't you ever talk
about motorboating titties

Dad, he's doing it again!

Biff Jr., kiddo,
lay off your sister,

Your new boss lives here?

When you're
the Under Secretary of State,

18
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,601
I imagine the world's
your oyster, hon.

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,228
(chuckles) There's nothing
to be nervous about.

20

It's Biff Simpson, hon.

He decides if I sink
or swim this year.

22
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,442
You're Carl Hirsch, sweetheart.

23
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:08,652
He's lucky to even wade
in the same pond as you.

Wow. Well, okay, then, Biff.

Oh. This here's my wife Helen.

gonna come bomb his parents,

(laughs softly)

159
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,364
You think you're funny,
you fat shit?

160
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,576
Could hear the fucking nerd
mating call from down the block.

161
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,415
First time, huh, Heidel-bitch?

162
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,461
Jesus, it's like doing
a fucking heroin deal

163
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,172
with Mr. fucking Rogers.
Come on.

164
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,132
Show me what you got.

165
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,636
Uh, yeah. Right.

166
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,854
- Sell me on it.
- (stifled laugh in distance)

167
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,774
S-Se-Sell you?

168
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,859
(dog barking in distance)

169
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,862
Uh... (stammers) Yeah, man,

170
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,658
look, I-I'd try to sell you
on it, but that'd be like...

171
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,577
like Buddha trying to hawk you
a timeshare in Nirvana.

172
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,956
Ooh. Tagline and everything.

173
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,500
Okay, look,
I do $15 per quarter.

174
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,628
Jew gets right
to the bottom dollar, huh?

175
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,046
(jocks snickering)

176
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,049
Just give me
two ounces, shit-tard.

177
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,677
Okay, yep. That's, uh, $120.

178
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,309
I'll give you $60.

179
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,686
(jocks laughing)

180
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,690
CAROL:
Dennis, stop. Come on.

181
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,566
JONAH:
Uh, no. Uh, look,

182
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,236
- I said it's $120, it's $120.
- I don't think that you're understanding me.

183
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,447
- No. This isn't a negotiation.
- And I don't speak little bitch.

184
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,658
So let me translate.

185
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,369
- Dennis. Dennis, stop. Come on.
- Come on.

186
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,620
Give me my,
give me my shit back.

187
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,038
Aw, you putting on
a show for Carol

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,832
so she can see you
act all tough? I mean,

189
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,959
you've had a hard-on
for her for years, haven't you?

190
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,379
Guess what. She is never gonna
suck your tiny kosher wiener,

191
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,965
- Art Gar-fuck-el.
- CAROL: Are you kidding me?

192
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,591
Give me my, give me my shit.

193
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,097
What the fuck
are you gonna do, kike?

194
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,143
- JOCK: He's gonna cry.
- (laughter)

195
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,438
- Give me my fucking bag back.
- No, no...

196
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,274
- No. No, Dennis, stop. Stop.
- BOOTYHOLE: Get the fuck off, dude.

197
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,151
What are you doing, asshole?
Get off me, man.

198
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,903
- As soon as this little Jew bitch quits begging for more.
- Stop. No. No!

199
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,489
Get off of me!
Step the fuck off.

200
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,409
Dennis. Stop.

201
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,162
Just leave... Dennis.
Stop. Enough.

202
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:25,083
(panting):
Stop. Stop. Stop.

203
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,002
BOOTYHOLE:
Dennis, this is not cool, man.

204
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,962
CAROL:
You're an asshole, Dennis.

205
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,589
Carol.

206
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,967
- Carol.
- You're a fucking asshole!

207
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,011
Stop.

208
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,606
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

209
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,024
REPORTER (over radio):
...warning everyone to lock their doors.

210
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,234
I'll see you guys.

211
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,529
With the Son of Sam killer
still terrorizing New York...

212
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,367
(piano playing)

213
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,378
RUTH:
Jonah?

214
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,174
It's just me, Safta. I hung
around for the double feature.

215
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:18,553
Did your black eye and bloody
lip hang around, too, darling?

216
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,015
(sighs)

217
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,102
JONAH:
It looks worse than it is.

218
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,520
RUTH:
I'm thinking you need a stitch.

219
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,979
JONAH:
No. No, I won't.

220
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,649
- RUTH: I don't know.
- It's fine. Trust me.

221
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,527
- It looks bad.
- Looks worse.

222
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,532
Go on. Eat some of this.

223
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:42,202
It heals all aches of the body
and all matters of the soul.

224
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,620
Hmm.

225
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,123
That's some Walt Whitman shit
right there.

226
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,208
You should write that down
in one of your cookbooks.

227
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,091
How'd you know?

228
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,218
I'm your safta.

229
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,262
I know everything.

230
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,266
And Mrs. Schlosstein saw you
walking on Avenue J.

231
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,767
She gave me a call right away.

232
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,395
Mm, the bubbeleh bat phone.

233
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,899
You think you're a big man
for getting in a fight?

234
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,571
I was just defending myself.

235
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,408
Oh, don't touch,
don't touch, don't touch.

236
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,660
I'll get a bandage.

237
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,377
- (rustling)
- RUTH: What?

238
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,753
- What is this?
- Hmm?

239
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,839
- A drug dealer? A criminal?
- Oh, shit.

240
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,215
Safta.

241
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,341
- How could you?
- Please.

242
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,385
- Please...
- How could you?

243
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,429
This puts food
on our table, okay?

244
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,889
This puts a roof over our heads.

245
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,725
I would rather starve
on the street

246
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,352
than have my grandson be a thug.

247
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,688
Everything I do is for you.

248
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,024
You think I want to be
doing this?

249
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,193
You don't think I want to be
at some WASP college

250
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,112
we can't afford actually
making something of myself?

251
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,780
I do this so we can survive.

252
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:06,328
Look. You were meant
for more than this.

253
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,747
A brilliant mind.

254
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,832
You see things no one else can.

255
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:15,587
It's a gift from God,
and this is how you use it?

256
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,216
To put this chazerai out
into the world?

257
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,634
Ah, you're worried about
the world. Well, the world

258
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,552
sure as shit's
not worried about us.

259
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:27,349
Everything you do, it's a choice
between licht un finster.

260
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,976
Light or darkness.

261
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,562
You must choose well.

262
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,273
Sometimes when you're
trying to survive,

263
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,858
you don't have a choice.

264
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,156
- There's always a choice.
- (gasps softly)

265
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,700
Safta.

266
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,911
- Safta, I'm...
- I love you.

267
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,414
I love you the most.

268
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,709
Everything I'm doing is for you.

269
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,675

- (clattering)

288
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,051
- (Ruth speaks indistinctly)
- I won't ask you again.

RUTH:
You will be brought to justice.

MAN:
How did you find me?

Go ahead, shoot, shoot.

I am not afraid.

293
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,519
- You can't hide.

00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,522
You can't hide.

Oh, Jesus.

299

Safta, hey, stay with me,
stay with me.

300
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,377
Stay... Help!

301
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,420
Help! Help!

302
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,673

Oh, fuck.

303
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,384

00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:22,939
I suppose I watch too much Kojak
in my old age.

477
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,399
A potato of the couch.

478
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,199
"You can't hide.
You can't hide.

479
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,784
You can't hide."

480
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,160
That's what she said to him

481
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,621
right before he killed her.

482
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,581
"You can't hide."
And it just... it sounded...

483
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,416
it sounded like she knew him.

484
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,627
- It sounded...
- Personal.

485
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,796
Yeah.

486
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,091
I suppose every murder
is personal.

487
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,388
Oh. I'm sorry.

488
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,181
I am sorry.

Well, I'm sure
the police are on it.

491
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,904
Wise that we let them
do their work.

492

Your grandmother was a fighter.

493

And I trust

494
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:24,250
it courses through your veins
as well as hers.

495
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,586
But if you ever need anything...

496
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:32,591
money, assistance,
anything at all...

497
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,884
you come to me.

498
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,512
This is not charity.

499
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,806
It's a debt I owe her.

500
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,063
You know,

501
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:50,526
you have an intimate
relationship with death.

502
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:55,823
But know it not to be a curse
but a blessing.

503

One that will bring you
closer to life.

504

As the Talmud tells us,

505

Morris, you've been
with the Bureau for ten months.

It's 11 months, sir.

you're gonna make it harder
on yourself than it already is.

And I want my own case.

And it can't be any harder
than it already is.

Okay.

You want your own case, Morris?

Tampa called this one in,

647
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:41,116
but they don't have
the manpower to handle.

00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:46,953
Yeah. Well, listen good,
you Peter Parker pig fuck,

820
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:50,707
there are three things
I hold sacred: Jesus,

821
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,542
pussy, and Groovy Gutterball

823

that I'm gonna...

824
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:56,713
Are You My Mother?

825
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,550
He loves that book,

826
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,010
Dick Jr.

827
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:07,807
Your wife was asleep,
and I saw his night-light on.

828
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,393
"'Are you my mother?'
the baby bird asked a cow.

829
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,520
"'How could I be your mother?

830
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:15,732
"I am a cow.'

831
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,193
"'Are you my mother?'

832
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,571
"'No. No, I'm not your mother.

833
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,198
"I'm the man
who'll cut your throat

834
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,991
"unless your father

835

paid him to do.'"

836
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,038
TERRY:
Dick, this guy bothering you?

837
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,419
Am I bothering you, Dick?

838
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:39,506
Listen, ass-munch, I don't know
who the fuck you think you are.

839
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,883
We got a problem?

840
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,844
What the fuck?

841
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,888
(shouting)

842
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:57,148
I know you'll keep tonight
between us,

843
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,527
make sure your boys
keep their mouths shut.

844
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,112
Otherwise, I can keep
their mouths shut for them.

845
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:07,617
Please, no,
we-we'll-we'll keep quiet.

846
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,039
Dick Jr. asked
if I was the monster

847
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,209
under his bed.

848
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:18,419
He said he was sure

849
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,838
there was a monster
living there,

850
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,882
but every time you would
go in to check...

851
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,760
under the bed, in the closet...

852
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:29,305
you could never see it.

853
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,892
Tell me, Congressman,

854
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,144
do you see me now?

855
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,257
DETECTIVE GROTON:
Mr. Offerman put up your bond, son.

856
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,802
$1,200.

857
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,495
You're free to go, for now.

858
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,166
His driver's waiting
outside for you.

859
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,209
(sighs)

860
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:44,714
I wasn't there to sell.

861
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:47,133
I know why you were there.

862
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,013
This has to stop now,

863
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,891
before you get hurt.

864
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,811
Leave the detective work to us.

865
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:02,106
Detective work

866
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,109
would be realizing
that the pattern

867
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:08,404
of the locations
of your mystery rapist's crimes

868
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,865
fits the A35 bus route

869
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:13,785
to a T,

870
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,579
so he must be taking
that bus line

871
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,831
to his victims' apartments.

872
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,463
Detective work

873
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:29,258
would be finding
who killed my grandma.

874
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,969
You're not doing detective work.

875
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,555
All you're doing
is sitting around

876
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,600
circle jerking to police
sketches of Son of Sam.

877
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,021
Don't let me keep you
from busting a nut.

878
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:07,755
Holy balls.

879
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,841
He's expecting you.

880
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,017
Well, I never.

881
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,729
Holy mackerel, I don't know
how you boys do it.

882
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,773
Doc, it's a masterpiece.

883
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,109
Good work.

884
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,741
"And God appointed a great fish

885
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,076
"to swallow Jonah up.

886
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:41,456
"And out of the belly of Hell,
Jonah cried

887
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,792
and God did hear his voice."

888
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:48,129
You should read the Torah more.

889
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:51,507
It is the original comic book.

890
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,761
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

891
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,846
Your face still looks like shit.

892
00:50:56,888 --> 00:51:00,099
- At least mine will heal.
- You will h... Uh, yeah.

893
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,226
Well, you didn't tell me
you were Bruce Wayne rich.

894
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,395
Well...

895
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:06,689
What are you doing with this
Hell Devils? What is that?

896
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:07,982
Please, can we...

897
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,151
- Does that seem wise?
- I'm gonna pay you back,

898
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,944
- every single penny of my bail.
- What? No.

899
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,988
- I don't want your money, please. Ugh. No.
- Just don't give me a speech.

900
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,866
I forgive the loan
in its entirety.

901
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:20,620
All I want from you
is the thrill

902
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:24,791
of besting a Torah-ignorant punk

903
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,001
in a chess match.

904
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,045
What do you say?

905
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:34,342
You know, there was
a very famous prisoner

906
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,595
in Auschwitz

907
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:42,141
named Markus Roth.

908
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:45,812
He was the Bobby Fischer
of Germany.

909
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:50,316
And as fate would have it,
one of the Nazi guards,

910
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,653
a sadistic man named
Heinz Richter,

911
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,198
he had always aspired
to be a great chess player, too,

912
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,367
but for years, in tournaments,

913
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:04,080
he was, he was trounced
by the chess-playing Jew,

914
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,415
who was now his prisoner.

915
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:09,377
Now, one morning in the camps,

916
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,462
Richter rounded up Markus

917
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:14,340
and 32 others,

918
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:17,552
marched them into the woods.

919
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,805
Each day, more prisoners

920
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:24,225
were led into those same woods.

921
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:27,895
One morning,

922
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:31,983
your safta's younger sister

923
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,651
was taken.

924
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,322
Your safta,

925
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:42,201
foolish and fearless,

926
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:46,831
was determined
to rescue her dear Chava,

927
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:50,793
so we snuck into the dark woods

928
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,129
after them.

929
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,757
And? What did you see?

930
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,136
- Well, in a small clearing...
- (man speaking German)

931
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,931
...Richter had constructed
a human chessboard.

932
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:06,309
(woman screaming, crying)

933
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,562
On those squares
stood the prisoners...

934
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,817
...each one with a blade.

935
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:30,416
Richter commanded the black,

936
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:33,961
forced Markus to play
with the white.

937
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:35,004
Bishop...

938
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,759
to E3.

939
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,179
I'm sorry, Chava.

940
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,769
(crying)

941
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,572
Chava!

942
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,240
(shouting in German)

943
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:26,138
Chava didn't fare well.

944
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:34,271
After seven days
of this torture,

945
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,191
Markus Roth grabbed a blade,

946
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:41,445
tried to kill
the barbarous Heinz Richter.

947
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:45,616
Markus, of course,
was shot dead,

948
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:49,328
but not before
he gave Richter a scar

949
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,705
across his throat

950
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,541
in the shape of an "X."

951
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:57,336
Markus never lost
one match, however.

952
00:54:57,378 --> 00:55:00,464
Not one.

953
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:06,804
Perhaps we can take
some solace in that.

954
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:11,600
What I'd give to have killed
those motherfuckers.

955
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:15,312
Your grandmother never told you
of such stories?

956
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,607
Of our history? No?

957

Gretel was a chemist.

MAN:
Dr. Fischer was...

1041
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,385
working on a chemical solution

What-what are... what truth?

what you're looking for.

1068
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,257
No, wait.
What are you talking about?

1069
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:14,059
The Russians used to send each
of their cosmonauts into space

1070
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:16,061
with a sawed-off shotgun.

1071
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:18,146
It wasn't for protection
against aliens.

1072
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,857
Nothing ridiculous like that.

1073
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,860
It was because
on their return to Earth,

1074
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,487
if they landed off course,

1075
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,197
they'd have to hike
hundreds of miles

1076
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,283
through the Siberian tundra
and they needed protection

1077
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:33,120
against the bears
and the wolves.

1078
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:38,834
When you land, Agent Morris,
and you will,

1079
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:43,589
you won't be in the tundra,

I, too, would carry protection.

1278
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:40,490
(telephone continues ringing)

1279
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:50,792
BIFF (over phone):
You did good.

1280
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,379
The Colonel wishes to meet you.

1281
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,048
Me?

1282
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,885
MEYER:
A year ago, your safta

1283
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:03,471
came to me in a panic.

1284
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:10,395
We hadn't seen one another
in 30 years.

1285
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:15,358
So, one morning, at the market,

1286
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:20,113
she told me she noticed a man

1287
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,365
picking cantaloupes.

1288
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:25,993
She recognized him
as a Nazi doctor

1289
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,996
from Auschwitz.

1290
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:33,960
A man who would rip out
every tooth from a child's mouth

1291
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,170
just for sport.

1292
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,464
And there he stood,

1293
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:42,176
a free man in America.

1294
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:46,264
He had been a pediatrician
on Long Island

1295
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:50,309
for d-decades.

1296
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:55,273
Ruth discovered his sister,
a Nazi chemist...

1297
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:58,734
she also escaped here.

1298
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:03,656
We believed that these two vile
creatures were in our midst,

1299
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:08,119
so we thought there could be
others here.

1300
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:11,581
- Did you tell the authorities?
- Well, we tried, but...

1301
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:14,000
We went through
all the proper channels, so...

1302
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:19,505
law enforcement,
the courts, INS.

1303
01:19:19,547 --> 01:19:22,300
But whether out of incompetence,

1304
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,802
ignorance, or animus,

1305
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:26,262
we were laughed at.

1306
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,264
They didn't believe us.

1307
01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:31,767
So I took the matter
to the senators I knew,

1308
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:34,353
the congressmen
who I got elected,

1309
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,939
but they ignored me.

1310
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:41,569
No one cares
to stake their reputation

1311
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:46,407
on investigating
some Jew killers.

1312
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:50,203
So, with nowhere else to turn,

1313
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:52,330
we made a vow.

1314
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:57,293
We would find
these criminals ourselves...

1315
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:02,673
...and bring God's justice

1316
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:05,009
to their doorstep.

1317
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,389
You mean murder them.

1318
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,390
Murder?

1319
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,435
No. No, Jonah.

1320
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:16,479
This is not murder.

1321
01:20:17,605 --> 01:20:21,651
Before Jews even existed,

1322
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:25,238
hatred and slaughter
waited for us.

1323
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:28,533
For thousands of years,

1324
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,869
from Masada to Munich,
we have been massacred.

1325
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:36,832
Pharaohs and popes and princes
and popular votes

1326
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:40,836
calling for our blood.

1327
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,838
Now?

1328
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,591
We survive the war,

1329
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:49,679
we survive the greatest
mass eradication

1330
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,764
in modern history,

1331
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:55,685
and we arrive home to find

1332
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,979
that the people
who did this to us,

1333
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,190
they're our neighbors.

1334
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:05,570
So tell me, what should we do?

1335
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,364
Shake hands?

1336
01:21:08,406 --> 01:21:11,033
Turn a blind eye?

1337
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:14,453
Forget? No, no.

1338
01:21:17,832 --> 01:21:21,919
The greatest single gift
of the Jewish people

1339
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:24,880
is our capacity...

1340
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:27,967
our capacity to remember.

1341
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:33,556
And it's because of our memory

1342
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:37,101
that we know this is survival.

1343
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,732
This is not murder.

1344
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,358
This is mitzvah.

1345
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,361
The man from the market...

1346
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,156
became our first.

1347
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:55,036
Heinz is number seven.

1348
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:59,874
We number our kills.

1349
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,543
Eye for eye.

1350
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:07,381
Jonah, this is not because
we want for this.

1351
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:11,260
Because we have no choice.

1352
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:15,848
We must instill fear...

1353
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,392
send a message.

1354
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,270
Let them know...

1355
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,939
not again.

1356
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,775
No more.

1357
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,862
No more, Jonah.

1358
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,199
Nip it in the bud.

1359
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,288
Who is that? The Wolf?

1360
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:44,460
The Nazi doctor from Auschwitz.

1361
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:46,587
The monster of my story.

1362
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:50,257
Still haunts me to this day.

1363
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,141
The Talmud is wrong.

1364
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:02,061
Living well is not
the best revenge.

1365
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:04,063
You know what
the best revenge is?

1366
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:06,524
Revenge.

1367
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:13,698
I want in.
I want in.

1368
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:19,578
Your grandmother protected you
from all this.

1369
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,707
She risked her life
so you could live out yours.

1370
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,876
She's dead because of me.

1371
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,878
I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

1372
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,339
I have to do this.

1373
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,593
I can't allow it.

1374
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:35,803
No, it's my right.

1375
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:37,471
It's my choice.

1376
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,306
I found him.

1377
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,559
I did.

1378
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,937
You found what I could not.

1379
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:58,325
You found what I could not.

1380
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:04,248
Your grandmother said,
"A brilliant mind...

1381
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,709
from God, a gift."

1382
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:12,840
But you followed
in her footsteps today.

1383
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:15,801
You held her dagger.

1384
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,056
You did her work.

1385
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:26,020

1
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,061
Weiter!

2
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,356
Weiter!

3
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,952
Do you hear that, Jews?

4
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,246
It's the music of kings!

5
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,789
Of Wagner! Of the Reich!

6
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,793
Weiter, weiter.

7
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,925
Wonderful.

8
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,769
It's now or never...

9
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,858
One... Two... Three!

10
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,166
Stop the Jew music!

11
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,840
Stop the damned Jew music!

12
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,300
You hear me?

13
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,762
Didn't you hear me?

14
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:35,971
What did I say?

15
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,097
Stop!

16
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:40,684
Enough!

17
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:41,852
Stop it!

18
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,689
What is wrong with you?

19
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,399
Do you all want to die?

20
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,113
Stop!

21
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,533
Enough!

22
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,618
Stop!

23
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,189
Well...

24
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,899
What is it?

25
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,067
Go on!

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,569
Enough!

27
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,653
March on...

28
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,405
Immediately!

29
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,489
Go on!

30
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,116
Weiter, weiter!

31
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,045
And on the Second Day,
God created...

32
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,255
The Hunters.

33
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,174
- Come on, let's go.
- Meyer...

34
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,592
- Another sweep of files.
- Didn't realize we were

35
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,552
running a kindergarten.

36
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,013
There may be something
in Richter's things here,

37
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,223
if we dig.

38
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,225
So let's dive in.

39
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,977
Mr. O, I'm not risking

40
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,271
going to jail 'cause you got
a soft spot for Ruth's grandkid.

41
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,148
Now, you're not paying me enough
for this shit.

42
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,067
Oh, you're the only one
he's paying at all, dearie.

43
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,860
Some of us got responsibilities.

44
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,613
Meyer,
Ruthie... zikhronah livrakha...

45
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,448
wanted the boy

46
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,242
- kept from this place.
- That's right.

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,910
- He is meant to be here.
- No, he is not.

48
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,745
- Yes, he is.
- You're gonna come at me for my kid?

49
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,166
But she didn't want this.

50
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,794
Trust me. Trust and you'll see.

51
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,900
- Who's "Karl Holstedder"?
- What did you say?

52
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,653
- Who's "Karl Holstedder"?
- Holstedder.

53
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,988
- Uh...
- Yes.

54
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,407
Gene Martin,
aka Heinz Richter...

55
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,576
- Yes.
- This letter was among his things

56
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,036
in the toy shop.

57
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:31,248
Every eighth letter:
"Send instructions #4...

58
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,959
- Right.
- "...to Karl Holstedder.

59
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,546
- 147 Ocean Way..."
- Oh, yeah.

60
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,214
"...Port Washington, NY."

61
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,924
- It's a coded message.
- Yes.

62
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,385
Encyclopedia Brown-stein
over here.

63
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,096
You can't
change a creature's nature.

64
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,514
A bear hunts.

65
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,141
A hog shits.

66
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,727
A Nazi plots.

67
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,563
There's no Karl Holstedder
on the list.

68
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,899
So we search the Ark.
Come on.

69
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,650
Let's do it.

70
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,402
We're all gonna fit in here?

71
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,905
Bringing the kid
was a big mistake.

72
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,574
You know what?
I-I'm not a kid. Okay?

73
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,659
I was bar mitzvahed
seven years ago, Sister.

74
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,871
Chanted a little Leviticus,
boogied to Mungo Jerry.

75
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,539
After my haftorah, got
an over-the-pants hand job

76
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,583
from Ruchel Rekenstein.

77
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,376
I know you think
I'm this undescended testicle,

78
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,878
but I'm old enough
to drink, smoke,

79
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,255
enlist in the Army, so...
I'm not a kid.

80
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,966
And unless you want to Greyhound
over to the Indian casino

81
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,761
and recruit
the Navajo Windtalkers,

82
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,429
I think you fucking need me.

83
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,187
One misstep
and I will do things to you

84
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,189
so traumatizing,
you'll wet your knickers

85
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,234
any time you even see Mary
fucking Poppins on the telly.

86
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,612
Are we clear, boy?

87
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,700
You like bar mitzvahs?

88
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,786
Welcome to ours.

89
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,913
You're on, Lonny.

90
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,708
Well, this movie star
needs no introduction,

91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,171
but let's tell the kid who he's
ménage-à-ocho-ing with, huh?

92
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,006
Take it away, Ruchel.

93
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,384
Shalom, goys and gals.

94
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,846
Former MI6,

95
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,223
now you run logistics
and mission-planning fun.

96
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,726
Sister Harriet,
come light candle number one.

97
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,731
Hallelujah!

98
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,568
Thank you, thank you.

99
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,819
Amen!

100
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,320
My bedroom's covered
with posters

101
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,322
of this dreamy, hunky Jew.

102
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,492
Lonny Flash,
master of mimicry and disguise,

103
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,703
come light candle number two.

104
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,086
It's him! It's really him!

105
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,880
Oh, my God, I love your movies!

106
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,007
Like a Jewish Robert Redford,
I'm telling you!

107
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,842
A black power activist,

108
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,678
no detail escapes
Roxy Jones of NYC.

109
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,514
Will this counterfeiter, forger,
and crime scene cleaner

110
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,141
light candle number three?

111
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,565
Power to the people!

112
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,025
Groovy, baby!

113
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,655
This human weapon is home from
'Nam after three long tours.

114
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,701
Joe Mizushima, forever soldier,
light candle number four.

115
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,750
God bless America!

116
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,461
Got a nice tochis, that one!

117
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,129
Mindy and Murray,
you've survived

118
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,756
the greatest horror in life.

119
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,258
Will you genius, gadget-making
weapons experts

120
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,676
light candle number five?

121
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,980
Baruch Hashem!

122
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,691
And finally, my bat mitzvah bash

123
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,402
wouldn't be possible
without this titan of design.

124
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,821
Meyer Offerman,
millionaire bankroller,

125
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,907
master plotter,
and chief vigilante,

126
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,534
come light this sixth candle
of mine.

127
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,466
Okay, everybody, say cheese!

128
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,634
Cheese!

129
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,594
Marvelous.

130
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,597
Now that we're all mischpocha,

131
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,934
let's go find this
Karl Holstedder motherfucker,

132
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,352
shall we?

133
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,063
Leave no stone unturned.

134
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,482
- No.
- Pore over every file.

135
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,609
Look for anything connected
to a Karl Holstedder

136
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,695
or 147 Ocean Way.

137
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,530
So this is...

138
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,407
The Ark.

139
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,618
This is the house
that Ruth built.

140
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,371
She did this.

141
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,456
Like Noah before her,

142
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,500
Ruth built a vessel

143
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:48,547
to guard from extinction
today's endangered species:

144
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,216
memory, truth.

145
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,010
How?

146
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,720
How did she do all this?

147
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,557
She unearthed
all the classified files,

148
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,434
records,

149
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,020
interviewed
thousands of survivors.

150
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,823
Wish I knew about all this
while she was still around.

151
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:18,201
She's still around, kindeleh.

152
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,538
The Ark breathes of her.

153
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,749
It beats of her.

154
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,251
Can't you feel it?

155
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,295
She is here.

156
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,817
Where do I start?

157
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,992
Sommers!

158
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,869
Sommers, open up!

159
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,246
Hey, lady,
it's 5:00 in the fucking morning!

160
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,248
Sir, if you know
what's good for you,

161
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,541
you will go back to watching

162
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,335
your penis pump commercial,
okay?

163
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,337
I'm tired, I'm hungry,
I'm in fucking Florida.

164
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,839
Don't fuck with me
right now, okay? Sommers!

165
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,466
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey.

166
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,009
You...

167
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,887
I went by Gretel's place.

168
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,347
What, you been there all night?

169
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,182
Uh-huh.

170
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,267
I had a hunch.

171
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,437
So... I scoured again.

172
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,523
And I found this.

173
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,538
- But NASA said she was a war refugee.
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,456
And yet here she is,

175
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,750
looking as excited
as a white girl

176
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,003
at an Engelbert Humperdinck
concert.

177
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,298
So you think she was a... Nazi?

178
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,426
I think she was a Nazi chemist.

179
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,762
Zyklon B.
Industrial-grade pesticide.

180
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,932
That was the same shit
used to gas her.

181
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,394
Like I said, it felt personal.

182
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,980
I think...

183
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,816
Gretel had something
to do with the gas chambers.

184
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,401
Jesus.

185
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,069
How'd a Nazi get
into the States?

186
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,155
I'm on the first flight
back to New York to find out.

187
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,782
Talk to INS, the Bureau,
see what they can tell me.

188
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,785
Yeah, I'll do some digging
around here. See what comes up.

189
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll give you a call
if I find something.

190
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,875
She looked so little,
didn't she?

191
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,501
She didn't look like no monster.

192
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,212
She looked old and little
and ordinary.

193
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,965
Monsters can be little.

194
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,010
Monsters can be old.

195
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,804
Hell, monsters can be us.

196
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,973
This is your captain
speaking. We're at 35,000 feet...

197
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,018
- When are we gonna get there?
- Stop. Stop, put your foot down.

198
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,354
I want to see
Tyler Tiger at Wally World.

199
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,522
- Shh.
- Peanuts?

200
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,608
No, he's allergic.

201
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,736
I'll have.

202
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,697
There you are.

203
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,532
Peanuts?

204
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,870
Is it bad?

205
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,084
His allergy.
Is it... deadly?

206
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,505
It can be, yes.

207
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:24,179
Scary.
What a way to go.

208
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,932
Well...

209
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,851
there'll be a cure soon.

210
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,520
I won't rest till there is.

211
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,272
Oh, you and me both.

212
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,819
You know...

213
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,365
allergies are
a modern invention.

214
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:48,245
Like depression
or schizophrenia.

215
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,458
Because once upon a time,
we let nature reign,

216
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,380
and it weeded out the sick
and the weak from our gene pool.

217
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,800
It kept us... pure.

218
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:09,224
These days, well,
there is a drug for everything.

219
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,477
Yet suddenly the whole
population is now sick,

220
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,772
and the sick have created
so much violence and suffering

221
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,692
that a person has to hop on
a plane and pay a small fortune

222
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,569
to take pictures
with anthropomorphic animals

223
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,612
just to keep himself sane.

224
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,824
All because we tell
the nice stewardess

225
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:30,495
a little boy shouldn't have
any Miss Petunia's Peanuts.

226
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,539
Or perhaps he should.

227
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,834
Because he is the poison,

228
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,130
and this is the cure.

229
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,925
So... peanut?

230
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,350
Tonight on First with Frist,

231
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,812
Biff Simpson on the tragic
massacre of his family.

232
00:14:55,854 --> 00:15:00,025
It'll be the little things
I miss most.

233
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,653
Eating Little Caesars pizza...

234
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,156
watching Six Million Dollar Man,

235
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,199
cuddled on the couch.

236
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,412
Just telling 'em "I love you."

237
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,376
I wish I could have done more.

238
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,549
I wish it'd... it'd been me.

239
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,679
But my Lottie always said...

240
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:36,561
...love means never having
to say you're sorry.

241
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,406
This has been
a special presentation

242
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,116
of First with Frist.

243
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,827
And now back
to your regular programming,

244
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,163
Me and the Chimp.

245
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,297
You don't remember us, do you?

246
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,883
I don't think so.

247
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,511
My mother always said, "Murray,
you have a forgettable face."

248
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,680
Ages five to eight,
she reintroduced herself

249
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,098
every time she saw me.

250
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,058
True story.

251
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,644
Oh, well, you-you were

252
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:22,315
just a yingeleh...
f-five or six years old.

253
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:27,278
Your safta took you to meet us
at Art's Deli.

254
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,322
- Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Remember that, Murray?

255
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:33,243
Cute as a kugel you were.

256
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,788
You looked just like him.

257
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,541
Hey, got something.

258
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,001
An SS roll from Buchenwald.

259
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,296
Names a Nazi engineer,
Karl Holstedder.

260
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,007
Buchenwald. Engineer.
10-4, Eleanor.

261
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,261
Yeah.

262
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,849
Karl Holstedder,

263
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,019
the Pied Piper of Buchenwald.

264
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,647
He was the emcee
of the Buchenwald camp.

265
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,024
A brilliant radio engineer,

266
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,694
he ran the camp's
control center.

267
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,572
But on Saturday, Shabbos,

268
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,491
he held his horror show,
The Star of Buchenwald.

269
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,410
Good Evening, Buchenwald!

270
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,786
Your master of ceremonies,

271
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,164
Hauptsturmfuhrer Holstedder
here.

272
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,332
Back for another episode of

273
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,544
THE STAR OF BUCHENWALD!

274
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,725
It was a singing competition.

275
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,561
A sadistic Gong Show.

276
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:46,524
Every Shabbos,
Holstedder rounded up ten men

277
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:51,112
and made them sing
for their lives.

278
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,829
If you sang out of tune...

279
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,998
It's a D-flat,

280
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,042
Number 218763.

281
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,351
If you forgot the words...

282
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,937
Come on, 217742:

283
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,652
"In the Graceland
of our Fathers."

284
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,789
Someone is
a quarter step ahead...

285
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,087
Until there was only one left.

286
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:02,016
Well, Mr. Holstedder...

287
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,811
come on down.

288
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,279
So, how do you like The Hunters?

289
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,406
They scare the shit out of me.

290
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,827
Yes!

291
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,789
How'd you recruit 'em, anyway,
Professor X?

292
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,295
No.

293
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,716
Well...

294
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,928
...I went to a matchmaker.

295
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,732
Yes, thank you.

296
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,237
Oh, my God.

297
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,324
- Shalom, my dear love.
- I can't believe this.

298
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,035
- Oh, I can't either.
- Mwah.

299
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,121
- My darling.
- Come sit, Meyerleh, sit.

300
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,582
Eh, what a neighborhood.

301
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,250
I know. Very fancy.

302
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:14,213
It is fancy. I'm so glad I dressed.

303
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,049
30 years in our new shtetl
of Manhattan,

304
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,219
you don't break fast with me,
you don't venture to my sukkah.

305
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,806
What did a little old matchmaker
do to deserve such kavod?

306
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,934
Well, I wasn't looking
to be matched, Hilda.

307
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,227
So, if that's all right
with you...

308
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,147
It's 40 years pining
only for Ruth.

309
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,358
This is the oldest
"Will They or won't They"

310
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,568
in the world,
since-since Jacob and Rachel.

311
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,986
Oh, God.

312
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:41,449
You have a lot of security
for a little old matchmaker, no?

313
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,161
Well, you know, can you think
of a creature more dangerous

314
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,372
than a Jewish mother
with an unwed daughter?

315
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,002
Matchmaker in the daylight.

316
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,922
But don't sell yourself short,
because you've commodified

317
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,800
the occupation of yenta.

318
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,261
You weaponized the Rolodex.

319
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,264
You are the Jewish world's
fixer, no?

320
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,933
Hmm?

321
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,310
So...

322
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,313
if not for a bride,
or even a shtup,

323
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,817
you know, one might ponder why
the gentleman from Park Avenue

324
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,152
comes all this way to see me.

325
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,905
Hmm? Cut to the liver, darling.

326
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:27,036
Well... Ruth and I,

327
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,914
we found something.

328
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,209
Two Nazi doctors...

329
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:37,505
living here among us.

330
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,800
So, we need you, Hilda.

331
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:45,388
I help you with this,
it makes noise.

332
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,433
In my line of work,
noise is death.

333
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,065
31 years since liberation.

334
00:21:56,107 --> 00:22:01,029
You know, in that time,
I have made 345 matches,

335
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,074
producing 957 new Jewish souls.

336
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:09,412
And, and seven more imas-to-be
are pregnant as we speak.

337
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,833
It should be enough
for Hashem, Meyer.

338
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,759
I suppose so, too,
comes the responsibility

339
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,764
to make the world better
for these 957 lives.

340
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,102
You say there are Nazis
among us?

341
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,607
I suppose, then,
you are asking me for...

342
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,942
A team.

343
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:44,864
I need highly skilled.
Covert. See?

344
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,157
This is no team, dear.

345
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,492
- No.
- No?

346
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,078
This is appointed by God.

347
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,706
This is a, is a congregation.
A tribe.

348
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:57,710
What you need is a group
who knows how to bend the rules.

349
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:02,173
A collective who will take
justice into its own hands.

350
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:05,009
Ragtag, just like,
like The Dirty Dozens.

351
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:11,849
957.

352
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,395
Hilda, if God does not
hear that,

353
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,773
then He is deaf.

354
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,692
957.

355
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,367
It's still 5,999,043 short.

356
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,618
Yes.

357
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,038
But we have time yet, yeah?

358
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,207
Yes.

359
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,251
Come on,

360
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,504
let's go find you these rascals.

361
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,297
You went to a matchmaker
to put together

362
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,549
a group of Nazi hunters?

363
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,885
That's... the Jewiest shit
I've ever heard.

364
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,053
Why'd they say yes?

365
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:55,601
In time, you'll come
to know their stories.

366
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,520
Their secrets.

367
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:01,107
And perhaps you'll come
to tell them yours.

368
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:07,196
We leave shortly.
Time for a hunt.

369
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,241
Just... I said
no. I am not sitting

370
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,243
your beached whale of a cousin,

371
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,370
the insufferable
Eileen Shekenstein,

372
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,788
anywhere near us, Murray.

373
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,041
It's Amy's wedding. She'll sit
where Amy wants her to sit.

374
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,252
You know she's still never
apologized to me

375
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,212
for missing
Simchas Torah dinner.

376
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,964
Her husband died
the night before.

377
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:28,134
Well, exactly. That gave her
a whole day to RSVP.

378
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,969
Get in the car.

379
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,849
Um... Oh.

380
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,517
Okay.

381
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,147
Uh... sorry, man.

382
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,816
Bet you never met
a movie star before, huh?

383
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,402
Judah Macca-bro,
how's it hanging?

384
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,446
Uh, fine, yeah.

385
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,449
You know, the fear goes away.

386
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,075
What? No, no.

387
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,162
No, I'm-I'm... I'm cool.
I'm just, uh...

388
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,580
As scared as an
uncircumcised schlong

389
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:00,541
at a mohel convention?
I was, too.

390
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,835
Gets easier, trust me.

391
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:10,635
You know, I loved Ruth
like she was my own bubbe.

392
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,095
Though, if only she was
a couple years younger,

393
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,014
I might've loved her
a little differently.

394
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,934
Know what I'm saying?
Mazel'd her Tov.

395
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,518
Gefilte'd her fish.

396
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,104
- That's fucked up, man.
- Hey, she found me at rock bottom.

397
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,399
Okay, she kicked my ass
into shape.

398
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,526
Not as good a shape
as Kris Kristofferson's ass.

399
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,612
That ass should be
in the Louvre.

400
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,364
That's a, that's a thing
of miracles,

401
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,074
but she saved me.

402
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,992
- She saved you?
- Oh, yeah.

403
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,120
Yeah, she was
one special lady, Ruth.

404
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:42,083
And because I loved her,
I love you, brother man.

405
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:46,003
So if any of these dicks
mess with you, I will...

406
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,463
Well, I'm-I'm not gonna
fuck with them

407
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,131
'cause they scare
the shit out of me,

408
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,883
but I will definitely be like,

409
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:54,220
"Yeah, they suck"
behind their backs with you.

410
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,306
Anything you need,
Lonny Flash has got you.

411
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,559
Cheeks and Bootyhole are never
gonna believe this shit.

412
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,436
Oh, yeah, who's Bootycall?

413
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,481
Bootyhole and-and Cheeks,
they...

414
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,566
They're just some kids
on my block.

415
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,861
Yeah. Well, if only
they could see you now, right?

416
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,572
A real life fucking
Jew-per hero.

417
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:18,160
Don't be nervous, man.
This shit'll be fun.

418
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,788
It's just like the movies, huh.

419
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,172
This summer.

420
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,841
Nazis beware.

421
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:37,263
This Army of the Night
is out for your head.

422
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:40,850
Reich? Wrong.

423
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,520
Orion Pictures presents

424
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:47,064
The Hunters.

425
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,817
With newcomer Jonah Heidelbaum

426
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,237
as The Codebreaker.

427
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,573
Jonah?

428
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,785
You good?
You were mumbling to yourself.

429
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,247
Oh, yeah, I'm good.
I just, uh, had a little...

430
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,333
tickle in my throat, you know?

431
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,461
Little cough.

432
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,879
Time to go,

433
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,340
Codebreaker.

434
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,647
Immigration
and Naturalization Services.

435
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,150
Hey, Betty, it's Millie.
Uh, my flight was delayed,

436
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,110
but I'll be across town
in an hour, so...

437
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,446
Don't bother, Mil. I pulled
the file you called about.

438
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,656
- Yeah?
- Gretel Fischer. Ain't nothing in it.

439
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,533
What do you mean
there ain't nothing in it?

440
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,703
I don't know. It's been
cleared out. It's empty.

441
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,956
- Your files are all empty?
- No, just hers and one other.

442
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,042
Looks like her brother,
a Hans Fischer.

443
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,502
Hans Fischer?

444
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:52,755
The family's files
are just gone.

445
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,886
My mom made me work out
with her this morning.

446
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,597
She made me do the rhythm method
with her.

447
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:05,059
Bro, you think the rhythm method
is something

448
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,685
it definitely ain't.

449
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,649
Fucking stairs.

450
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,360
Yo, J-Money.

451
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,696
He's not gonna answer.
He's mad at us.

452
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,990
You're gonna have
to talk to us, bro.

453
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,618
Yeah, we shouldn't have
left you. We should...

454
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,370
Look, we're-we're sorry, okay?

455
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,830
We should... We shouldn't have
chickened out.

456
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,498
He ain't home.

457
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,461
I haven't seen him in two days.

458
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,881
Two fucking days?

459
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:39,635
I was actually starting
to get worried.

460
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:43,681
Shit's fishier than a mermaid's
cooch at a dolphin orgy.

461
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,434
Where the fuck did he go?

462
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,687
Yeah, Hans and Gretel

463
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,981
hadn't spoken for years.

464
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,276
- You know how siblings can drift apart.
- Mm.

465
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,154
But when her son called
about the accident,

466
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,531
I-I was beside myself.

467
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,325
She was such
a sweet woman, Gretel.

468
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,619
- Oh, thank you, Ms. Fischer.
- There you go.

469
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,205
- Um, if I may...
- Mm-hmm?

470
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,583
...why is the FBI involved?

471
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,878
Well, uh, she worked for NASA.
Just standard procedure.

472
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,254
Oh.

473
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,716
Actually, Frannie, I was hoping
I could speak with your husband.

474
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,385
Uh, well,

475
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,804
that won't be possible,
unfortunately.

476
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:28,642
Uh, Hans died in a car accident
six months ago.

477
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,728
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,399
Yes, he... he drove home late.

479
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,528
A chicken pox outbreak in town

480
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,198
that kept him at work.

481
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,492
He never let a single child

482
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,369
go untreated.

483
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,039
Police said it looked like

484
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,082
his engine exploded.

485
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,295
The force

486
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:59,465
ripped his teeth
right out of his mouth.

487
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,060
Did you notice anything strange
before your husband died?

488
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,729
Was he on edge?

489
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,148
Anyone bothering him?

490
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,027
No. What do you mean?

491
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,488
Oh, I'm just turning over
every stone.

492
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,454
He was very handsome.

493
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,331
I read that Hans

494
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,291
was a German war refugee
like his sister.

495
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,834
What did he do during the war?

496
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,337
Hans was a doctor.

497
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,464
Red Cross.

498
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,345
- Did he have to help any Jews?
- Yes.

499
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,389
How did he feel about them?

500
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,351
Well, how does anyone feel
about them, dear?

501
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,520
They're Jews.

502
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,817
I'm s... Do you have a bathroom
I can use?

503
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,802
What are you doing in here?

504
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,973
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

505
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:35,120
Oh, shiz, oh, shiz, Captain!

506
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:38,415
Kirk, Captain Kirk! Say it!

507
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,876
Oh, God, Captain Kirk!

508
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,962
Ah, fuck me, Spock.

509
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,048
Fuck my photon torpedo bay,

510
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,841
you half-Vulcan fuck.

511
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:56,266
- Good morning, Senator O'Heir.
- What the fuck? Y...

512
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,019
I'll have you arrested.
I'll have you killed!

513
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:03,190
No, no, no, no, dear, you won't.

514
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,568
You're a fan of role-play,
so let's partake.

515
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,613
Here's what will happen,
Mr. O'Heir.

516
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,533
You will end your filibuster
against lifting sanctions

517
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:16,787
for South American goods,
and if you don't,

518
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:20,124
these photos will be on the
front cover of every newspaper

519
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,292
from here to planet Vulcan.

520
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,378
Who the fuck are you?

521
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:29,007
We're the good guys,
Captain Kirk.

522
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,845
We're trying to save the world.

523
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,194
Let's drop the needle
on Karl Holstedder, shall we?

524
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,197
Hmm. I'll ring us on in.

525
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:56,243
Roxy will draw the curtains.

526
00:33:56,285 --> 00:34:00,122
Joe will admire the view.

527
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:04,042
Murray and Mindy
will set the mood.

528
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,795
Lonny...

529
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,840
will do whatever
the bloody fuck you do.

530
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,595
Um...

531
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,222
What do I do?

532
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:20,768
The adults will make
their grand entrances

533
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,103
here, here,

534
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,189
and here at the illustrious

535
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,357
147 Ocean Way.

536
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,359
The sodding fat cat
music producer

537
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,196
is in his recording studio.

538
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,198
We'll take our seats,

539
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,992
and then Meyer
can do a little dance,

540
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,827
make a little love,

541
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,205
and get down tonight.

542
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,500
So let's get to tickling
the ivories

543
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,961
of this torturous twat,
shall we, loves?

544
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,499
Looks like a 247B switch.

545
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,961
No, moron, that is a 247A.

546
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,838
All right.

547
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,132
- Wait.
- I'm waiting.

548
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,760
Go.

549
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,432
Wow. It's like
the entire guest list

550
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,435
of Freddie Mercury's
annual Vaseline party.

551
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,228
That's where I got
that accidental hand job

552
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,647
from Peter, Paul and Mary.

553
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,733
Classic P, P and M.

554
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,401
Erik Folsom.

555
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:38,071
Almost as shitty of a stage name
as Lonny Flash.

556
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,533
Hey, you can call me
Leonard Flazenstein

557
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,285
any día of the semana, baby.

558
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,329
Come on.

559
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,859
Shalom, Karl.

560
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,654
For far too many winks,

561
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,949
you were our nightmare.

562
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,036
Now let us be yours.

563
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,166
Oh, my God.
I'll have you arrested.

564
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,126
- Rounded up and...
- And shot?

565
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,587
Gassed? Buried alive?

566
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,884
I never liked your music.

567
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,138
It, uh...

568
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,474
For your kind, it was...

569
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:50,018
music was always for violence,

570
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,562
vanity,

571
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,147
death.

572
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,566
But for us,

573
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,403
music is remembrance,

574
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,947
it's rebellion,

575
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,658
it's life.

576
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,538
In the music our people survive.

577
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,415
Wha-What is he doing?

578
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,461
He's giving him the thing
our people never received:

579
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,714
a trial.

580
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,757
Oh, you are my judge,

581
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,175
jury,

582
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,345
executioner, Juden?

583
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,723
No, I am nobody.

584
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,059
I am but the stenographer here.

585
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:36,273
They... the millions...
are the judge and jury.

586
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,735
The millions who call out
from the grave...

587
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,611
for justice.

588
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,198
We are holding you on a charge

589
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,076
of a thousand counts of murder

590
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,911
of Jews at Buchenwald.

591
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,874
And also on a charge of
the murder of millions

592
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,376
as accessory to the Nazi regime.

593
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,879
So, how do you plead?

594
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,006
I plead that you go to hell.

595
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:05,552
We shall present
the evidence now.

596
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,975
Testimonies from survivors.

597
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:16,646
Nazi SS rolls declaring
Karl Holstedder

598
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,858
as Hauptsturmfuhrer of the SS.

599
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,736
Finally, a photograph
from Nazi records

600
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:27,240
identifying this man
as Karl Holstedder.

601
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,744
Can you verify
that this is you, sir?

602
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,913
That is me, yes.

603
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:39,628
But I did not do the things
you accuse me of.

604
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,755
We have testimonies.

605
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:45,509
- Yeah.
- Firsthand accounts from survivors.

606
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,429
From Hiram Flaustein...

607
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:52,015
he's from Brooklyn, New York.

608
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:55,644
Survivor of Buchenwald. And...

609
00:39:55,685 --> 00:40:01,108
from Ralphie Schneider,
a survivor of Buchenwald.

610
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,694
From Jerome Putnitsky.

611
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:09,449
From... from Mordecai Klinger.

612
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,910
From Alexander Cohen.

613
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,079
From Lloyd Evan
and from Ludwig Platz.

614
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,498
From Samuel Cantel.

615
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,084
Shlomo Waxman.

616
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:22,420
From... I...

617
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,926
It's propaganda.

618
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,678
It's lies.

619
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,077
Rox?

620
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,912
Karl Holstedder,

621
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,331
on the thousand counts
of murder,

622
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,834
you have been found guilty.

623
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,421
Go To Hell!

624
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:09,718
Hell is not so bad

625
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,220
as the way to it.

626
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:28,111
What the fuck?

627
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:36,494
- Want to sit down? All right.
- Sure. Sure, of course.

628
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,705
- What is it?
- It's a homegrown radio station.

629
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,665
They're broadcasting something.

630
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,959
Well, they're communicating
with each other,

631
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,378
- that's what they're doing.
- Yeah. -Communicating what?

632
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,549
What? Uh, here, let's see
what's going out live.

633
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:03,396
"Two little boats
at night on the sea.

634
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,399
Ten ducklings in the barn."

635
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,947
- "Six mothers moved east."
- Yeah?

636
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,411
"And a little child was born."

637
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,831
Third Reich Sesame Street's
creepy as shit.

638
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,584
Remind me never to play it
for my future kids.

639
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,670
I'll first remind you
never to procreate.

640
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,006
What if it's those
"instructions #4"?

641
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,218
What if they're sending out
some heavy-ass hidden message?

642
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,887
Well, then we bloody will
shut these twats up.

643
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,305
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

644
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,431
Hold the horses now.

645
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,141
If you stop it,
then they'll know, right?

646
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,852
- They'll know that we're onto them.
- Yes, they will. Yes, yes.

647
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,313
Where is this broadcasting to?

648
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,190
How far? To how many?

649
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,817
Well-well-well-well,
we don't know.

650
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,694
We would have
to reroute the sync.

651
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,446
Okay, well, find out,
find out quickly.

652
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,532
In the meantime...

653
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,951
I'm gonna make the piano man
sing us a song.

654
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,494
I have to
take off the whole back.

655
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,662
Well, then do it.

656
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:05,333
Hello, Karl.

657
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:11,881
Now, we can make
this interrogation painless

658
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,300
or painful.

659
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,635
Depends on you.

660
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,345
What do you think?

661
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,265
Let me ask you:

662
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:23,268
who are you communicating with?

663
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,895
What are you broadcasting?

664
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,482
Lullabies for the children.

665
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,610
- Ah.
- Broadcast symphonies, too.

666
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,571
Operas.

667
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,408
Even ABBA when it tickles me.

668
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:45,123
I give away freebies sometimes
to the first caller.

669
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,083
Okay, Joe.

670
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,836
I think we're ready.

671
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:53,048
The ears are the most sensitive
part of the body.

672
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:57,469
They control balance
and bodily function.

673
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:12,984
Now, Karl,

674
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:15,278
last chance.

675
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,076
Okay, Joe, let's do it.

676
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,679
What are you broadcasting?

677
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:45,642
I don't know
what you are talking about!

678
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,940
Oh, my God.

679
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,535
Stop, stop, stop. Stop.

680
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,619
Please.

681
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,623
Fucking Christ, come on, man.

682
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:12,252
You're gonna burst
his fucking eardrums, stop.

683
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,754
What the fuck are you doing?

684
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:24,764
Oh, my God!

685
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,975
- It's all right.
- His fucking ear's bleeding. Stop it, man!

686
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,518
We know it.

687
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,440
My God, I just...

688
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,233
I just...

689
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:36,776
They mail me tapes.

690
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:40,572
I p... I broadcast them,
that's all I do!

691
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,366
Who? Who-who tells you
to play them?

692
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,787
There's a man, a man...

693
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,414
One man, I don't...

694
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,291
He's the only one
I've ever seen.

695
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,001
Richter?

696
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,545
I don't know any Richter!

697
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,089
I swear, I don't,

698
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,924
I don't know his name.

699
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,969
We don't use our real names.

700
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,471
Oh, my God.

701
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,015
He's a man like me.

702
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,145
A man who was brought here.

703
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,022
Brought here?
Brought here by whom?

704
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:19,861
By you!

705
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,823
By you.

706
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,408
Meyerleh, we need you now.

707
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,660
Broadcasting
to the whole tristate area.

708
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,956
Watch him.

709
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,509
Water. Water.

710
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,762
Water. Please.

711
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,390
Oh, God.

712
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:56,439
- I didn't do what they say.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

713
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,653
But I was your age
when I first heard him.

714
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,738
I don't want to hear
your Hitler fan fiction.

715
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,283
Not Hitler. Wagner.

716
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:11,204
My father was a cruel man.

717
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,748
He believed music was weak.

718
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,963
If you even dared hum,
he beat you senseless.

719
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:25,385
But when I was 17, I heard it.

720
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:30,223
Coming from the halls
of the Berliner Philharmonie.

721
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,102
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

722
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,147
I was just a boy...

723
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,901
following orders.

724
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,281
Perhaps like you.

725
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,782
Shut the fuck up.

726
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:51,369
- Shut the fuck up.
- If you keep on this path,

727
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,913
you will hear it, too.

728
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,040
Forever.

729
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,210
The ringing in your ears.

730
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,879
That is why...

731
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,757
I made them sing.

732
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,926
To drown it out.

733
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,178
The ringing.

734
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,766
S-So I could hear
the music again.

735
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,397
I need water.

736
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,107
- All right, all right.
- I need the water, please.

737
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,401
- Fuck, okay. Okay.
- Please.

738
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:25,069
Thank you. Oh...

739
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,863
Just tilt your head back.

740
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,243
Fuck.

741
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,748
Hey. Take it easy.

742
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,500
If you want the boy to live...

743
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,794
you will let me out
of this fucking...

744
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,338
No!

745
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,173
What?

746
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,430
What the fuck did you do?

747
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:54,849
He was our only fucking lead.

748
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:56,434
- You fucking child!
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

749
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:58,478
- You did this! I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- Come on!

750
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,396
- I didn't mean to.
- Piece of shit child. -You're okay.

751
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,398
Kid fucked up,
got Holstedder killed.

752
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,025
It blew the broadcast.

753
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,016
We got to go.

754
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,434
We got to go. Come.

755
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,852
Get, uh, whatever you can.

756
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,270
Take it, take it.

757
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,073
Jonah!

758
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,580
Hey.

759
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,207
Yeah. Jonah, Jonah.

760
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:02,792
Yeah.

761
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,377
Here, come here.

762
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,045
- Jonah.
- I got him killed. I got him killed.

763
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,089
No, no. A Nazi, yes.

764
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,967
And he would have killed you
if it weren't for Joe.

765
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,969
- He would've killed you.
- No. Were you still gonna kill him?

766
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,053
Were you still gonna kill him

767
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,888
if you got everything
that you needed?

768
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,890
Were you still gonna kill him?
Were you still gonna kill him?

769
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,101
I would have
delivered justice, yes.

770
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:23,062
- Yes.
- No. No, no.

771
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,314
Fucking shit.
We should've brought him in.

772
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,066
- What?
- We should've brought him in.

773
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,484
- To whom?
- We could've brought him in. We could've brought him in.

774
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,069
Who do we bring him in to?

775
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,654
The fucking... the police.
The fucking police, the Feds.

776
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,406
Oh, no. Jonah, Jonah,
I told you this.

777
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,074
The fucking... the people who
take care of this fucking shit.

778
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,160
I told you this before,
didn't I?

779
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:42,623
In this country, Lady Justice
may be blind to all,

780
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,375
but to many of us,

781
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,085
she is also deaf.

782
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:51,424
Do you know how many Nazis
the U.S. executed at Nuremberg?

783
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:53,676
Twelve.

784
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:58,473
12 perpetrators
out of eight million.

785
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:02,685
And they're on the march again,
these forever soldiers.

786
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,271
These monsters.

787
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:07,857
No wonder they thought
they could come here.

788
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:12,862
So we are left... us...
to do God's work.

789
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,363
Ruth's work, Jonah.

790
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,824
Ruth's.

791
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:17,867
Come.

792
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,077
We are missing maariv.

793
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,746
What the fuck is maariv?

794
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,748
It's evening services.

795
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,168
To say Mourner's Kaddish
for Ruth.

796
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,878
- No, I don't believe in that.
- Oh, Jonah,

797
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,797
it doesn't matter
if you believe or not believe.

798
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,007
I don't care if you believe
in Santa Claus.

799
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,552
It doesn't matter.
It's about Ruth, not about you.

800
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:40,723
It is the duty of Ruth's family
to pray for her soul.

801
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:45,353
And if ever a soul deserved it,
it would be hers. No?

802
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,689
Come, Jonah. Come.

803
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,961
You didn't get me a souvenir?

804
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,004
No Mickey ears or some shit?

805
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,847
How much did you miss me?

806
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,312
What's wrong, mama?

807
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:45,830
You know,
people think flamingos are pink.

808
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:52,837
It's a common misconception.

809
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:55,673
They are white.

810
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,134
Pure white.

811
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:03,639
It's the red blood of
what they eat, their prey,

812
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,766
that gives them their color.

813
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:14,525
Why were you looking into
Gretel Fischer, Detective?

814
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,736
What did you find?

815
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,365
Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

816
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,451
It's okay.

817
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,453
Hey, hey, hey. Listen.

818
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,331
Shh. Shh.

819
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,670
I know undue stress
can be bad for the baby.

820
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:42,553
So how about we play
a little game instead, hmm?

821
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:45,222
Fowl-inspired, of course.

822
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,686
Duck.

823
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,146
Hey.

824
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,150
Duck.

825
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,864
Goose.

826
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,282
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

827
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:04,492
Hey! Hey!

828
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,118
No! No!

829
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,670
There was a photograph.

830
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,713
Of Gretel and Hitler.

831
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,049
She was a Nazi.

832
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:23,094
- Who else knows about this?
- No one but me.

833
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,515
Fun. Another round.

834
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,517
No. No. No! No!

835
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,312
Hey.

836
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:34,772
Spaghetti.

837
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,651
Spaghetti.

838
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:43,698
- Meatball.
- No.

839
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,700
No, no, no!

840
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:00,214
She was an FBI agent.

841
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:03,592
She's... her name's Millie.

842
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,052
Millie Morris.

843
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,727
Hansel and Gretel...
do you know that story?

844
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:21,027
Two German children...
blond-haired, blue-eyed...

845
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:25,656
find this rich old witch
living in the woods.

846
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:29,910
The... the kids claim that the
witch wants to eat them alive.

847
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,957
You know, use their good
Christian blood for food.

848
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:40,963
And so the German children
push her into an oven,

849
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:45,718
watch her burn alive,
and steal her fortune.

850
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,762
And that's the happy ending.

851
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:57,188
I think... the witch was a Jew.

852
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:03,736
You know, I think
they called her a witch, but...

853
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,780
but they really meant Jew.

854
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:12,661
This old Jewish woman,
living in the woods,

855
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:17,750
banished from town,
not doing anything to anyone.

856
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:21,212
And then Hitler Youth
just burned her alive.

857
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,761
Yeah.

858
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,556
Fairy tales
aren't written for us,

859
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,559
but we're the ones that are
meant to fight the monsters.

860
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,019
You know?

861
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:43,776
I'll write you a fairy tale.

862
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:46,779
A new one.

863
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:49,031
For you and me.

864
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,961
- Hello?
- You catch me on First with Frist?

865
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,296
The Post called me braver than

866
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:08,384
a stewardess
on a Palestinian-hijacked 747.

867
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,636
Get her for me,
would you, champ?

868
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:15,766
What is this regarding?

869
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,810
Uh, what?

870
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:20,980
Uh, we've got Carter, the ports,

871
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,315
- the sanctions...
- We'll be in touch.

872
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,776
If there's something
to be in touch about.

873
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:21,874
- Amen.
- Amen.

874
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,838
All those
saying the Mourner's Kaddish,

875
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,509
please remain standing, as
we honor those who have passed.

876
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,316
You will hear it, too.

877
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,485
A ringing in your ears.

878
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,321
- Amen.
- Amen.

879
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:08,671
Can I say it for him, too?

880
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,132
For who?

881
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,531
No, I can't do this.

882
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,574
- Uh... No.
- I can't do this.

883
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,535
No, Mindyleh.

884
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,665
Jonah.

885
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:46,834
Jonah!

NYPD's calling for backup.

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,029
I told you, you fool!

38
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,240
I told you!
Any blood on those streets

39
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,843
is on your hands!

40
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,410
I need more than your word!

41
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,120

42
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,705
"Proof"? Look, look, look!

00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,707
The plague is here...

00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,000
Damn you!

45
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,210
Listen to me.

46
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,588
I'll tell you all I know
about the Fourth Reich,

47
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,631
but you will take
these shackles off.

48
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,258
I will not.
You are a criminal.

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,093
- I am not a criminal. Please!
- You are a murderer.

50
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,636
No, I'm a savior!

51
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,347
Do you understand that?
I'm a savior!

52
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,266
Look at that.
That's a cross.

53
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,685
You are a woman of God, are you?

54
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:05,769
Are you?!

55
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,646
- I am.
- Yeah, okay.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,234
Darkness was only
the ninth plague.

57
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,654
Did nuns ever teach you what
the tenth and final one was?

58
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,364
The death of the firstborn.

59
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,408
Death, death of millions.

60
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,160
The death of millions.

61
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,579
And if you hope to stop it,

62
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,582
we must go now.

63
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,919
This is a fucking
one-night stand.

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,170
Clock strikes midnight,

65
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,671
and I'm back
to hunting your ass.

66
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,923
Give me your hands.

67
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,925
Hunting me?

68
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,760
I swear to fucking God,
you try anything,

69
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,261
- I will shoot you.
- Yes, I'm sure.

70
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,023
Come here!

71
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,242
Why didn't you save me?

72
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,119
You did this to me!

73
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,337
It's your fault.

74
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,265
How the bloody fuck

75
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,434
do we know
that we can trust her?!

76
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,103
Because if anyone
found out what I'm doing,

77
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,063
I'd be going
on a ride 25-to-life

78
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,482
alongside you Village People
cover band motherfuckers.

79
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,775
- All right, stop. Enough.
- No.

80
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,443
- Enough! Stop!
- Meyer!

81
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,863
They just blew up
a goddamn power plant.

82
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,782
They ravage a city.

83
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,659
We need her.

84
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,120
We need her resources.

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,894
Where's Jonah,
and where's, uh, Murray?

86
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,169
We got separated.

87
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,587
And Murray ain't winning

88
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,090
the New York City Marathon
anytime soon.

89
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,967
And I'm-I'm fine, too,
thank you.

90
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,760
I can feel the concern.

91
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,559
Jonah.

92
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,022
I'm so sorry.

93
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,982
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,901
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,989
No.

96
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,616
Oh. Oh, no.

97
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,330
Oh, God.

98
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,499
Today...

99
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,336
we, too, are in total darkness,

100
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:40,257
because Murray was our light.

101
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,302
It's no secret

102
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,680
that in the shadows
of the Shoah,

103
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,433
Murray turned away from God,

104
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:53,312
as he asked,
"How can God exist?"

105
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,482
The irony

106
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,610
is that the answer
to the question

107
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,029
is Murray.

108
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,031
A man like this

109
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:08,035
is the greatest evidence
of Hashem.

110
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,995
Not the burning bush,

111
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,790
not the great leviathan,

112
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,835
but a man who ushered
others to safety

113
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:21,256
during that subway accident
last night.

114
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,635
A man who came
to my office last year,

115
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,970
unbeknownst to Mindy,

116
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,807
and as a final gift

117
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,518
to his faithful wife

118
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,394
said, "Rabbi,

119
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,941
"when she's finally succeeded
in nagging me to death,

120
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,319
"I want the service in shul.

121
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,822
"I want a Jewish ceremony.

122
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,492
"Not because I believe in him,

123
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,703
but because I believe in her."

124
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,292
Now, forever,

125
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,629
let us believe in Murray,

126
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:05,008
for because
we have known Murray,

127
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,762
we will forever know the light.

Maybe Murray stopped it.

Maybe they just wanted

blow up the subway,
kill hundreds,

No...

We didn't foil shit.

They all said The Ghost

more powerful than the A-bomb.

00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,563
How many do you think
she's worth?

334
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,856
No, Meyer!

335
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,574
- Meyer. Meyer.
- How many?

336
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,079
Please, Meyer.

337
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,998
Meyer, choose me.

338
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,550
And I said...

339
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,192
Perhaps this is a story...

340
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,737
that is not meant
to be told today.

341
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,073
Today is for Murray.

342
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,200
We must grieve for him.

343
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,369
We should not desecrate that.

344
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,247
And there will be time
for this story.

345
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,001
It deserves time.

346
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,558
I'd recognize
those hooker heels anywhere.

347
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,019
Didn't the nuns raise us
to be chaste?

348
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,898
Keeping up this act

349
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,817
finally netted you
something valuable, huh?

350
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,528
To be perfectly frank,
I'm still shocked

351
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,115
your off-brand Brady Bunch
hasn't figured you out yet.

352
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,366
Tamp down your titties,
Patricia.

353
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,368
What's wrong with it?

354
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,120
Nothing at all, dear.
That's the point.

355
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,746
At least on first glance.

356
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,832
No, that's impossible.
You have to cultivate it again.

357
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,417
Well, I cultivated
the blood again.

358
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,045
It's infected, but with a strain
I've never seen before.

359
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,256
Near invisible.

360
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,676
No symptoms, no indications...

361
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,637
until six weeks after exposure,

362
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,890
and suddenly it detonates
inside the body like the plague.

363
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,934
You won't know you're living
with a disease

364
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,269
until it's too late.

365
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,522
And with that
replication pattern,

366
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,983
there is no cure.

367
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,078
Hey, Mom.

368
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,539
She's been out for a few hours.

369
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,583
Well, I came as soon as...

370
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,418
Are you limping?

371
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,713
Some looters shoved me down
on 114th. I'm fine.

372
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,049
We found an embolism.

373
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,842
We need to monitor her closely.

374
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,886
Keep her on blood thinners.

375
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,347
Thank you.

376
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,103
I went to a funeral this morning

377
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,023
for a survivor
of the Nazi death camps.

378
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,320
They told a story
about how this man and his wife

379
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,322
were imprisoned
in different camps,

380
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,240
held apart for years.

381
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,242
But there was this one gate

382
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,704
that all the prisoners
were marched through every day,

383
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,832
and so this man
would pick a dandelion

384
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,336
or a weed
or whatever he could find,

385
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,465
and he... he'd tie it
to the fence of the barbed wire

386
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:06,385
so that his wife would see it
when she would walk by.

387
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,263
Because...

388
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,433
even in...
all the horror and the death,

389
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,143
he still wanted to tell her

390
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,062
that everything
was gonna be all right.

391
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,023
He still needed to tell her,
"I love you."

392
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:22,193
And I got this feeling,
you know?

393
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,028
And I... I called you...

394
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,616
...because I...

395
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,202
needed...

396
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,662
I needed to...

397
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:36,124
I needed to let you know...

398
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,209
- I... I lo...
- Nice of you

399
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,378
to finally show up.

400
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,048
I'm late for my rounds.

401
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,092
Please stay and pray with us.

402
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,136
For Viola.

403
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,808
Almighty and Eternal God,

404
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,893
you are the everlasting health

405
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,062
of those who believe in you.

406
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:02,108
Hear us
for your sick servant, Viola,

407
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,528
for whom we implore
your tender mercy.

408
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,405
Through Christ our Lord.

409
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,407
Amen.

410
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,579
I'll let you all visit.

411
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,082
Hi.

412
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,419
I'm here for you anytime, Viola.

413
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,297
Do you want some water?
How are you feeling, Mom?

414
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,132
Oh.

415
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:29,635
Mm. I'm-I'm fine, baby.

416
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,845
I'm fine.

417
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,930
You don't check in for days,

418
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,683
and now you care
how she's feeling?

419
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,102
Your sisters were here all day.

420
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,437
Enough, Lou.

421
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,064
Oh. Go to the cafeteria.

422
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,441
Cool off.

423
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,988
I'm really sorry

424
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,990
- I wasn't here sooner.
- Oh, it's okay.

425
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,117
How you doing, baby?

426
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,827
How are you doing, Ma?

427
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,454
I'm fine.

428
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,915
Maria made sure
I was in good hands.

429
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,963
I would have thought she had
enough with her own patients.

430
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,758
Oh, Melinda.

431
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,719
My nervous system is failing me,

432
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:15,014
but my eyes still work
right fine.

433
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,600
Oh...

434
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,685
I've known the rhythm
of your heart

435
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,271
longer than you.

436
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:27,068
And I've felt all the ways
it's made you you.

437
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,111
Ma, whatever's
got you worked up...

438
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:32,865
And as good as God, I know
when it makes you flutter.

439
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,453
She took good care
of me, Millie.

440
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,498
She took good care of me
for you.

441
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:46,379
And if what I think's
going on between you and Maria

442
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,464
- is really going on...
- Ma...

443
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,884
...then God don't
take these things lightly.

444
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,262
Love...

445
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,265
is his greatest gift...

446
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,268
and is a treasure
you must hold on to

447
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,186
at all costs.

448
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,522
Don't throw it away.

449
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,570
Don't throw it away.

450
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,035
Oh, baby.

451
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,331
Ah, baby.

452
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:26,877
I see you. I see you.

453
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,754
And that's right.

454
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:29,797
Looks like the lights
are finally

455
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,426
back on in the Big Apple.

456
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,306
Right, doggy?

457
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,809
Bad dog.

458
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,061
She sure hates you.

459
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,400
Did you know that there are
2,500 unique species

460
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,609
of mayfly in the world?

461
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,404
Yes, siree, Bob.

462
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,490
They're unique because
they live out their entire lives

463
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,160
in the span of a single day.

464
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,537
Birth, maturation.

465
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:06,125
They buzz and dance
and buzz and fuck.

466
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,544
After 24 hours,

467
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,380
they've served their entire
life's purpose.

468
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,883
And then they do
the dignified thing.

469
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,968
- They drop dead.
- What's your point?

470
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,345
My point...

471
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,724
My point is that
these Jewish insects

472
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:25,728
- simply won't die.
- Hmm.

473
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,814
They defy the course
that nature has set for them.

474
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,317
Why? Why do they refuse

475
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,194
to know their place
in the world?

476
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,447
What is it that
keeps them buzzing?

477
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:40,576
The way you speak
about these Jews...

478
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:44,622
sounds like they excite
your little penis.

479
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,208
Maybe that's why
you never kill them

480
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,252
when you have the chance,
American.

481
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,922
♪ Put your head ♪

482
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,801

485
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,476
Will you do me a favor?

486
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,604
Open the glove compartment.

487
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,362
That's your brother's.

488
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,908
They begged.

489
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,536
It was so cute.

490
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,958
You think that I'm weak?

491
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,920
That I'm defected
and deficient?

492
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,274
If you all were
so good and pure,

493
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,651
why didn't your families get it
right the first time, hmm?

494
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:58,529
The villainy you teach,

495
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,282
Americans will always
better the instruction.

496
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,702
Hitler was five-nine.

No Kristallnacht,

506

no camps, no crematoria.

507
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,176
Now just a series
of manufactured cells.

508
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,470
So, that's what made The Ghost

509
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,931
look like what Zsa Zsa Gabor
leaves in the toilet

510
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,517
after borscht night
at Milos Forman's.

511
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,393
Aren't you glad you're back?

512
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,021
Why wasn't it part of the bombs?

513
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,190
Because it isn't
an airborne contagion.

514
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,525
It's a pathogen.

515
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,776
A poison.

516
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,238
It has to be consumed, ingested.

517
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,281
Pat said
if you wanted to infect,

518
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,450
say, the entire of Manhattan,

519
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,078
you would need barrels
of this stuff.

520
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,830
Wait, the subway.

521
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,457
The subway. The blast.

522
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,794
I-It pulled all available cops
from nearby stations

523
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,796
to Midtown Manhattan,

524
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,048
leaving open the bridges.

525
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,216
So what?

526
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,135
S-So...

527
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,888
Th-There aren't any factories
in Manhattan,

528
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,723
s-so they had to bring
the stuff in.

529
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,976
What-what if
they were trying to...

530
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,979
Wh-What if they were trying
to create a distraction

531
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,855
in order to transport
the poison in?

532
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,857
Yeah, but the city
was shut down.

533
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,025
They closed
the bridges and tunnels.

534
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,069
Yeah, but what about the ports?

535
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,867
Yeah.

536
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,412
I know, and I can explain.

I'll meet you there.

543
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,519
Schidler Corporation.

544
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,188
Port supervisor said
it was the last ship in

545
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,356
before the blackout hit.

546
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,609
It is a food conglomerate
in Argentina.

547
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,735
I pulled everything
I could find on them.

548
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,862
Tax returns, earnings reports.

549
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,447
Uh, they've got five properties
on the eastern seaboard,

550
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,407
but their HQ is here
in the city.

551
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:52,870
Looks like Schidler Corp. made
a hefty donation to Rocket Man.

552
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,497
- Whoa.
- Seems he's also on the board.

553
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,832
Who's Rocket Man?

554
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,627
Rocket Man is Wernher von Braun.

555
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,962
He's a Nazi rocket scientist.

556
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,547
He was a genius

557
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,466
and my golden goose.

558
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,093
He used thousands
of Jewish slaves

559
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,095
to build the V-2 rockets
for Germany.

560
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,264
Those rockets killed thousands
in Britain,

561
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:16,060
and 20,000 camp prisoners died
in his factory.

562
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,313
Soon as the war was over,
he was recruited by NASA.

563
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,982
His work on Saturn V
begat the Apollo 11 mission,

564
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,485
which propelled the U.S.
to the Moon.

565
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:28,697
Moonman was more beloved than,
if you can believe this, me.

566
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,824
Graced the cover of Time.

567
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,118
Starred in Disney's TV shows.

568

00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,590
We bring the men and women

661
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,925
who authored the murder
of our people

662
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,052
to finally meet their maker.

663
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,762
Before what tribunal?

664
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,431
Before what jury?

665
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,267
Before a jury
of six million Jews

666
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,729
calling out from their graves
for justice.

667
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,439
Do you hear their calls, Simon?

668
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,940
I have devoted my life

669
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,611
to finding compensation
for their clamor.

670
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,447
But we are meant
to be consecrated

671
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,866
to a greater law.

672
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,994
The Nazi Hunter
is the prime of our people,

673
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:47,164
but this is a profession
of angels, my friend.

674
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,042
Angels do not get blood
on their wings.

675
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,085
Well, perhaps...

676
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,755
the age of angels is over.

677
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,341
You kill these people
in cold blood, Meyer.

678
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,592
You're damn right.

679
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,678
And this is Jewish?

680
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,140
You ask what's Jewish.

681
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,101
Moses. Esther. Judah.

682
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:12,189
Our forefathers who fought
for their right to exist.

683
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,858
That's what we do.

684
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,195
But what is not Jewish,
what can no longer be Jewish,

685
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,491
is to allow these murderers
to strike again.

686
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,786
If we follow your path, Simon,

687
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,413
they will eradicate the Jew

688
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:32,167
before we ever have a chance
to fight them back.

689
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,878
But, Meyer,
if we follow your path

690
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,674
and compromise our morals,
what makes us us,

691
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,926
then we Jews
will eradicate ourselves.

692
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:43,929
We will cease to be Jewish.

693
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,390
We'll become another creature.

694
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,601
Golems, perhaps.

695
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,773
Simon,
we could argue this all day.

696
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,483
I come here for a favor.

697
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,193
I need everything you have

698
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,611
on von Braun.

699
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,613
Oh, you're a spiritualist now?

700
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:04,491
Well, you see, he died.

701
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,535
- He died.
- Mm-hmm.

702
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,245
You saw the body?

703
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,580
We've heard many ghost stories

704
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,291
of men bigger than Wernher.

705
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,877
Yeah, y-you're
on a fool's errand, Meyer.

706
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,629
What? What?
Come on, what do you want?

707
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,214
What do you want?

708
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,842
If he's dead, we go on a
wild fucking goose chase, right?

709
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,343
Keeps us from knocking off

710
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,053
another one of these
motherfuckers.

711
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,055
You can go back to your whole
Atticus Finch routine.

712
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,391
Isn't that what you want?

713
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,809
You are Ruth's grandson.

714
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:34,021
Mm.

715
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,192
You desecrate her memory
by choosing this.

716
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:54,499
All right, I'll give you
what you ask for...

717
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,877
send you on your fantasy hunt.

718
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,336
On one condition.

719
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,422
That you never come to me again.

720
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:03,050
All right?
Not for anything.

721
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,094
We have a deal, brother.

722
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:10,098
Meyer...

723
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,269
remember, before the night fell,

724
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,646
we were just people
listening to music,

725
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:20,650
playing with our children,
telling stories.

726
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,486
But we were chosen, Meyer.

727
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,279
We were.

728
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,699
Sometimes I wish we weren't,
but we were chosen.

729
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,744
Now, perhaps this is God's
ultimate test.

730
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,872
Not the slavery in Egypt,
or Rome, or the pogroms.

731
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,416
Not even the Shoah.

732
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,005
Perhaps this is
the greatest test of all...

733
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,342
is what we choose to do now.

734
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:51,056
Meyer, remember who we were.

735
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:54,434
Remember who we are. Re...

736
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:06,947
Thank you... for the facts.

737
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,367
Let's go.

738
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,332
Schidler Corp. 5623

739
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,168
West Fifth...
that's what the file says.

740
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,670
Million-dollar
corporation operates

741
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:25,006
out of a fucking
bunion boutique?

742
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,896
What'd Joe do,
hire a Coldwell Banker lady

743
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,481
for an open house
at von Braun's?

744
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,066
Let's go already.

745
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:45,318
He needs to scope it out first.

746
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,571
He'll be back soon enough.

747
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,950
You stole from him,
from Wiesenthal.

748
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,703
Files on The Wolf.
What'd you find in them?

749
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,746
Not much.

750
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,165
Your safta took the files.

751
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:02,377
She wanted to learn more
about The Wolf.

752
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:06,715
What Wiesenthal said
about her...

753
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,676
I mean, it's bullshit, right?
It's-it's fucking bullshit.

754
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,052
I'm not desecrating shit.

755
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,305
- I'm fucking honoring her.
- Of course you are.

756
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,723
What we're doing, it's...

757
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,641
I mean, you said it.
You said it.

758
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,394
It's... The Hunt is Jewish.

759
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,354
And-and our forefathers
did it, too.

760
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,440
They fought for their existence.

761
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,983
They killed their enemies.

762
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,735
They ended shit.

763
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,446
Of course they did.

764
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,868
How many people
did you kill that night?

765
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,503
Eleven.

766
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,009
Eleven men.

767
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,639
Eleven innocent souls.

768
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,934
In that moment,
I made a choice.

769
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,435
To protect the woman I love.

770
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,647
And in doing that,

771
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,691
I became a different creature.

772
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,447
The Wolf had won,

773
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:15,617
and I never saw
the sun rise again.

774
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,456
It cost me my world.

775
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,420
But it turned me
toward the man

776
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,714
I was destined to be.

777
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,176
Now in darkness,

778
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,512
I could protect the light.

779
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,848
I became the night

780
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,935
so that the day would live.

781
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,482
That is the mark
of a hero, Jonah.

782
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:50,568
Not the one who does
what is right,

783
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,364
but the one who does...

784
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,533
what is necessary.

785
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:10,130
You sure you're
gonna be okay alone here, Ma?

786
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:14,718
Yeah, darling, please, I'm fine.
You-you go.

787
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,595
Don't forget to wear
that sweater.

788
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,097
It's July, Ma.

789
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,515
I know, but you know,

790
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,560
they blast that air-conditioning
everywhere.

791
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,145
Okay.

792
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,939
You know Carol Smolinsky.

793
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,692
She went into the movie
theater to see

794
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,527
Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo.

795
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,530
She left there with pneumonia.

796
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,282
I'll wear the sweater, Ma.

797
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:39,284
- Okay?
- Yeah.

798
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,328
Good girl.

799
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,539
You all right there?

800
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,958
Yeah. Are you?

801
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,376
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

802
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,670
I'm fine. Go, go, go.

803
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,633
- Yeah.
- Okay.

804
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:01,222
Hey, Ma. Love you.

805
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,740
Well, you know,
Irene Schlosstein,

806
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:22,077
she just could not
keep her mouth shut.

807
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,371
And the waterworks.
It was like

808
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,624
it was her husband's shiva.

809
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:32,504
That Hymie Herschel, he-he
smelled up the whole apartment,

810
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:36,257
of course, you know.

811
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:41,179
And the insufferable
Eileen Shekenstein came,

812
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,556
but you know,

813
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,893
she-she gave me a nice hello,

814
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,312
and that-that counts
for something.

815
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,398
Yeah, it sure does.

816
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,859
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

817
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,237
- Oh, the rabbi...
- Oh.

818
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,280
No, no, tell me
all about the rabbi. What?

819
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,449
Well, he gave
a beautiful service.

820
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,617
Yeah, you know what
the only perk is

821
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:04,035
about being blown up to bits?

822
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,412
I didn't have
to sit through that.

823
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,498
Oh, please. You're just
such a wise-ass.

824
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,960
Yes, well, some things,
Mindeleh, are eternal.

825
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,136
Who is going to fix
that leak in the sink?

826
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,847
You'll get a handyman.

827
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,892
And who's going to change
the light bulbs?

828
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,854
You'll ask the boys.

829
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,611
Who is going...

830
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:41,781
to put his arm
around me at night?

831
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:46,327
Who is going to groan when
I pass a little gas,

832
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:50,915
and rub my bunions and...

833
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:55,420
Who is going to know
the stories, you know,

834
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:58,840
that gave me these wrinkles?

835
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,342
Who's going to watch over me?

836
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:04,095
I will.

837
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,555
I always will.

838
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,104
Are you with him?

839
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,898
I am.

840
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,985
How does he look?

841
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,653
Just as you remember him.

842
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,697
Yeah?

843
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,035
- Is he safe?
- Safe.

844
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,871
- Is he happy?
- Oh, he's happy.

845
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,293
Is he him?

846
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,214
He's him.

847
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:51,476
Does he forgive us
for what happened?

848
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:54,187
And for living on...

849
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,231
without him?

850
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:59,526
Yeah, he does.

851
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,569
But he misses you.

852
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,531
He misses you.

853
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,617
- He misses your scent.
- Ah.

854
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,702
He misses your rugelach.

855
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,788
And he misses the way

856
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,040
you used to kiss him,

857
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,793
even though he was pretending
to be sleeping.

858
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:23,007
Mm. Would you like to see him?

859
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,302
Murray.

860
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,554
Yeah. Come.

861
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,222
- Murray. Murray!
- Come, come.

862
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,891
- I-I see him?
- Come.

863
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,317
Where is he?

864
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,361
- You'll see.
- Oh.

865
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,047
Aaron?

866
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,632
- Come.
- Ah.

867
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,551
Aaron. Oh.

868
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:09,971
Ketzeleh. Ketzeleh.

869
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:13,016
Oh. Oh.

870
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,062
Oh.

871
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,106
I missed you, Mama.

872
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,108
Oh.

873
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,152
My boy,

874
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:27,113
I missed you.

875
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,949
Oh.

876
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,411
Did you do all this?

877
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:36,873
So that when you and Tata came,
you'd feel at home.

878
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,043
It's beautiful.

879
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,295
Oh, it's so beautiful.

880
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,881
Do you want
to make something, Mama?

881
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,883
Oh.

882
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,260
I'd rather not dare.

883
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:53,097
Whatever I make...
it will not compare,

884
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,099
because many years ago,

885
00:48:55,141 --> 00:49:00,647
I already made the most
beautiful thing of all.

886
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:10,073
Mindeleh, it's time to go now.

887
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,200
Yes. Say yes.

888
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,202
Before it's too late.

889
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:18,164
Mindy, it's not time
for you to stay here with us.

890
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:20,458
- Not yet.
- Mm.

891
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,502
Aaron.

892
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:26,255
Aaron, you say goodbye
to your mama.

893
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,257
Yeah.

894
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,473
- Yeah.
- Time.

895
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,850
Come.

896
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,186
Hey, Aaron, Aaron?

897
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,357
Go.

898
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:46,150
Come.

899
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,610
Ooh.

900
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,991
Yeah? Come.

901
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,706
You don't have
to worry about him.

902
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,000
I will take care of him,
I will never let him go.

903
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,004
I know that.

904
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,383
You-you never did.

905
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,638
And he will take care of you

906
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,892
for a time
until I see you again.

907
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,936
Yeah.

908
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,948
One last thing.

909
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,576
Aaron asked

910
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,913
that you show to Moritz mercy.

911
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,499
That is his wish.

912
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,809
You have a guardian angel,
Moritz.

913
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,438
An angel, I say.

914
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,231
Yeah.

915
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,026
- Huh.
- You-you deserved

916
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,403
so much worse.

927

Hello, Wernher.

928
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:40,032
Hello.

929
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,869
How are you?

930
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:48,499
Can you imagine
our eyes seeing you?

931
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:50,167
You are a ghost.

932
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,919
I don't want any trouble.

933
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:55,756
Give Rocket Man a chair
to sit in.

934
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,352
So, Wernher,

935
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,439
do you really believe

936
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,318
that landing
on the moon was worth

937
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:20,197
the lives of millions of people?

938
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,953
The science...
that I created led

939
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,331
to great inventions,

940
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,791
led to medical innovation,

941
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,169
to longer lives,

942
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,963
to peace around the world.

943
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:39,175
My work always was one
for peace... and progress.

944
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,760
Shut the fuck up!

945
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,762
Hey, enough. Enough.

946
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,056
Listen,
we've heard it all before.

947
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,390
"I didn't know
what I was doing."

948
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,642
"I was just
following orders."

949
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,060
"I'm sorry for what I did."

950
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,811
"I thought we were building
a better world."

951
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,605
We've heard 'em all.
All the reasons.

952
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:54,607
All the excuses.

953
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:57,568
You did horrible
fucking things.

954
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,779
You enslaved hundreds of people.

955
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,114
You killed thousands
with your weapons.

956
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,576
Then you come
to the United States.

957
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,578
You live a life of celebrity,

958
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,873
sipping mai tais, gargling
Walt Disney's Jew-hating balls.

959
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,917
We don't need another excuse.

960
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,835
We don't need
another fucking lie.

961
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:18,255
We are spent.

962
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,884
Now you're gonna
skip the bullshit,

963
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,636
and you're gonna
give us an answer.

964
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:25,638
What do you know
about the Fourth Reich?

965
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:29,517
- The what?
- The what? The what?

966
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,060
The Fourth Reich.
What do you know about it?

967
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,687
What do you know
about the fucking Fourth Reich?

968
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,314
I don't understand.

969
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,149
Don't play fucking stupid.
What do you know

970
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,567
- about the Fourth Reich?
- I swear!

971
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,782
I swear.

972
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,553
So Schidler Corp.'s been
in the news

973
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,388
on this South American
trade bill.

974
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,432
Was a guy named Biff Simpson
behind it,

975
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,434
the Under Secretary of State.

976
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,644
And wouldn't you know,
he's on the fucking I am,

977
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:16,272
chief suspect
in a double homicide.

978
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,025
That guy whose family
was murdered at that barbecue?

979
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,027
Everyone but him,
and not only that.

980
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,070
There was a woman killed,
a Helen Kirsch.

981
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,948
She's a survivor
of the Nazi death camps.

982
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,993
So where's Biff Simpson up here?

983
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,724
Been a long time, friend-o.

984
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:01,400
Now, Wernher.

985
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,653
You need to tell us everything
you know.

986
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,366
Or we're gonna light you up...

987
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:12,244
...brighter
than the stars above.

988
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,250
What is the Fourth Reich?

989
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,753
I don't know.

990
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,220
Hold it, Joe.

991
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,016
Let the boy do it.

992
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,608
It's for the light.

993
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,411
Mm.

994
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,425
What is the Fourth Reich?

995
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,678
I said I don't know.

996
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,019
Well, I don't believe you.

997
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,063
Maybe this will help you
remember.

998
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,192
You sure about that?

999
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:27,153
Huh?

1000
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,780
- Hmm.
- What is the Fourth Reich?

1001
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,782
- I don't understand.
- What is the Fourth Reich?

1002
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:34,451
What is the Fourth Reich?

1003
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,329
No?

1004
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:41,458
Okay.

1005
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,421
What is... the Fourth Reich?

1006
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,715
Tell us what you know.

1007
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,550
Tell us

1008
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:51,635
- what you fucking know!
- Stop. Please. Please?

1009
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,763
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you.

1010
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,899
I didn't know the extent.

1011
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,361
I only joined
because she promised

1012
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,322
there would be no money issues.

1013
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:15,159
The Fourth Reich would fund
projects the prudes at NASA

1014
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:19,496
never would dare... Mars,
distant galaxies, black holes.

1015
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:23,459
She said that if I helped her
take the world,

1016
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,586
I could rule the stars.

1017
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:28,297
She?

1018
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:30,299
"The Colonel."

1019
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:31,967
The Colonel?

1020
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,928
I-I don't know her real name.

1021
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,430
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

1022
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:38,432
I just...

1023
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:42,269
I wanted the moon.

1024
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:44,647
I wanted the stars.

1025
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,524
So...

1026
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,693
I helped them...

1027
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,695
create it.

1028
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,365
The Solution.

1029
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:57,159
Wait. The pathogen.
The pathogen, right?

1030
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,370
Where is it being released?

1031
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,372
Where are they fucking
releasing it?!

1032
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,165
Everywhere.

1033
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,001
It's in everything.

1034
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,505
It's in food and drink,
medicines.

1035
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,924
It's a new creation.

1036
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:15,261
It's a new weapon.

1037
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,388
A food substitute soon

1038
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:22,059
to be on every shelf
in America.

1039
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,520
Targeting the inner cities.

1040
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:28,732
Glucopyranose monohydrate.

1041
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,319
Corn syrup.

1042
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,157
Corn syrup.

1043
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,577
Corn syrup.

1044
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,002
Like that? You like that?

1045
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,962
- What are you doing?
- Tell us what you fucking know... He's lying.

1046
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:52,006
- Tell us what you know. Tell us everything.
- Swear...

1047
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,341
- I swear!
- Everything that you know!

1048
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:55,676
- Tell us! Come on. Tell us.
- I swear.

1049
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:56,969
Jonah, that's enough.

1050
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,181
Tell us. Come on.

1051
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,309
Meyer.

1052
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,686
Enough, Jonah.
Meyer, make him stop.

1053
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:06,979
We got what we needed.

1054
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:08,647
He's not, he's not fucking
telling us the truth.

1055
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,566
Come on. We'll fucking cook you.

1056
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,192
You don't want to speak? Huh?

1057
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,819
No? Okay.

1058
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,279
Meyer, make him stop!

1059
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,613
Cut it.

1060
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,954
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1061
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,790
- Why? What'd I do?
- Get back to the car.

1062
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,250
Now!

1063
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,558
Mercy.

1064
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,312
Mercy.

1065
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:50,981
Mercy.

1066
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,377
No.

1067
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,295
No.

1068
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:16,673
No. No!

1069
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:17,883
No!

1070
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,709
Do you like sugar?

1071
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,169
Do you like sweets?

1072
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:57,047
Do you like yummy,
tasty treats?

1073
01:01:57,089 --> 01:02:00,634
Then get ready for corn syrup.

1074
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:02,803
Mama, what's corn syrup?

1075
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:04,638
What's corn syrup, you ask?

1076
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,182
It's a new substitute
for sugar.

1077
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,601
A substitute
that is cheaper, healthier

1078
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,689
and most importantly, sweeter
than your wildest dreams.

1079
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,107
Americans foolish.

1080
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:18,152
The junk food rots
your teeth, man.

1081
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,903
Why did we move
to this silly country?

1082
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:21,655
Back on an ocean.

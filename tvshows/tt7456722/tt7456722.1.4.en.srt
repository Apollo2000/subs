1
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,464
Mama?

2
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,348
Jakob Schneider!

3
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,767
Jakob Schneider!

4
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,803
Next.

5
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,879
I know a way out of here.

6
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,917
You like our humble institution?

7
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,587
It is impressive, I must say.

8
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,548
Fredric Hauser.

9
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,967
- Meyer Offerman.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Offerman.

10
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,177
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

11
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,013
I must say, given your stature
as a businessman,

12
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:49,641
I'm surprised we haven't
crossed paths before.

13
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,642
Perhaps, uh,
we weren't fated to.

14
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,898
Let me show you
my pantheon of fortune.

15
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,197
Tell me, Mr. Offerman, uh,
can you keep a secret?

16
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:07,534
Well, I suppose that depends
on the secret. Hmm?

17
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,953
A very fine answer.

18
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,705
Well...

19
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,791
But in this bank,

20
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:18,212
our answer is always
a resounding yes.

21
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,254
Yes.

22
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:26,720
Secrecy is our currency,
Mr. Offerman.

23
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,891
Let me ask you,

24
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,309
do you think...

25
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,981
...that your money is being
protected right now?

26
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,400
Hmm? No.
It is being taxed

27
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,694
and tallied and scrutinized.

28
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,613
But here,

29
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:49,159
we operate on one
simple philosophy:

30
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,497
they cannot take
what they cannot see.

31
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,415
Ah.

32
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,396
Jonah.

33
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,231
Jonah?

34
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,652
Come on, son, talk to me.

35
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:27,239
Your friend was shot twice
during his shift.

36
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,741
Nothing stolen,
nothing taken from the register.

37
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,663
Any idea why this happened,
why he might have been targeted?

38
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,956
No idea.

39
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,375
Did you get a look at the guy?

40
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,965
No. It was too dark.

41
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,553
What?

42
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,722
You had to have seen him.

43
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,307
It was too dark.

44
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,268
I didn't see shit.

45
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,061
After your grandmother's murder,

46
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,731
you came in here
spouting off every detail.

47
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,983
You can remember how the guy
escaped down the alley,

48
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,944
how he was wearing sweats,
how he had a black hat.

49
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,407
And now your friend's dead, that
you hurried past the killer,

50
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,992
and you got nothing for me?

51
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,827
Jonah, you got to
help me out here.

52
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,370
I don't know what to say.
I told you, it was dark.

53
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,748
I-I couldn't see shit.
It was dark.

54
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,335
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

55
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,878
You want me to...
repeat myself all night?

56
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,547
I... my best friend just got...

57
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,008
My best friend just got fucking
shot to death. Fuck this.

58
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,426
Jonah.

59
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,507
Jonah?

60
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,181
Jonah Heidelbaum?

61
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,642
This is Agent Morris
with the FBI.

62
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,435
I want to talk to you
about your grandmother.

63
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,605
I got your name
from Rabbi Grossman.

64
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,734
Jonah. Jonah?

65
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,320
I just want to talk with you.

66
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,282
Can you let me in?

67
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,374
He's not home.

68
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,800
- Any idea where he is?
- You with the police?

69
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,719
FBI.

70
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,555
I'm Millie.

71
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,016
- FBI?
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,642
You here about Arthur's murder?

73
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,561
Who's Arthur?

74
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,563
Our friend,
who got fucking murdered

75
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,733
while selling fucking
comic books.

76
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,985
I'm so sorry. When?

77
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,530
Last night.

78
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,991
Listen, if, uh...

79
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,952
if you hear from Jonah,

80
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,079
tell him I need to talk to him,
all right?

81
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,082
He's not in trouble.
He's not in trouble.

82
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,793
I'm just worried about him.

83
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,591
Yeah. Me, too.

84
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,979
FBI? What the fuck's Jonah into?

85
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,606
I don't know.

86
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,191
But he was late for his shift.

87
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:53,278
It was supposed to be Jonah
behind that counter.

88
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,702
The boy
just got his friend killed.

89
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,412
You want him to get
one of us killed next?

90
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,164
If they're onto him,
what's to keep them

91
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,917
from following him here, to us?

92
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,588
He stays here.
It's my house. It's my decision.

93
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,799
It could threaten everything
we've worked for.

94
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,937
The day of doom is July 13.

95
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,398
Well, that's just weeks away.

96
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,567
And our only lead is, what,
some bank the Nazis visited?

97
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,279
And these keys to some bank,

98
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,534
built on the backs
of a genocide.

99
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,495
Fredric Hauser, the banker,
financed his empire

100
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,872
on stolen Jewish loot.

101
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,084
Fortunes, heirlooms.

102
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,961
Old women's gold teeth.

103
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,965
And I have no doubt
that his Swiss paws

104
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,300
are keeping Nazi eggs warm.

105
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,722
What is inside

106
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,976
box 630?

107
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,478
Oh, God, here we go.

108
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,605
Excuse me, I want back in.

109
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,066
I'm helping you take down
these Nazi fucks.

110
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,068
- Meyer, he should never have been allowed...
- Excuse us a minute.

111
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,572
Jonah, come here.
Come on.

112
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,240
For fuck's sake.

113
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,868
That anger burning in your soul,

114
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,953
it can put us all in peril.

115
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,538
It's a conflagration,

116
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,207
and if you're not careful,
it will consume you.

117
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,750
Enough with this fucking
backwards bullshit.

118
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,751
You said revenge is
the best revenge.

119
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,044
That's what you said.

120
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,963
It was about your guy.
It was about your number one.

121
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,923
It was about The Wolf.

122
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,302
Well, that beady-eyed Nazi fuck

123
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,513
- who killed my best friend is mine.
- Personal revenge. Payback.

124
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,517
That comes later, Jonah,
if ever.

125
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,729
What we must do first
is about justice.

126
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,940
It's about justice
for 11 million people.

127
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,193
Your revenge is about you.

128
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,153
I don't think you understand.
It's either you let me in

129
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,404
to your little fucking
tea party,

130
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,948
or I'm going out there
and I'm finding the motherfucker

131
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,742
who killed
my best friend myself.

132
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:13,168
Ma, Dad, I came as soon
as I heard.

133
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,003
- Well, better late than never.
- It's nothing.

134
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,506
Ma, it's not nothing, it's MS.

135
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,299
You shouldn't have
left work for this.

136
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,509
I'm fine.

137
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,846
You're an angel, but I'm fine.
Really.

138
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,891
She had another flare-up.

139
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,435
But she's okay.

140
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,811
We're taking good care of her.

141
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,438
And speaking of angels,

142
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,943
Maria has just been
the greatest blessing, as usual.

143
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,612
The only one to ever take
proper care of me

144
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,405
in this god-awful place.

145
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,034
I'll give you some privacy.

146
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,994
I need to run
to the restroom, Ma.

147
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,333
- What?
- Are you gonna let me apologize?

148
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,834
You sure you know how
to do that?

149
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,253
Look, I know I shouldn't
have reacted like that,

150
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,129
but I just... I...

151
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:07,639
I wish I was better at this.
For you.

152
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,183
Me, too.

153
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,935
Dr. Richardson, 2315.

154
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,812
I got to get back.

155
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,690
Dr. Richardson, 2315.

156
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,116
Fucking surveillance duty?

157
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,618
It's what they have
the fat cops do.

158
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,622
You're not on duty.
You're only here because

159
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,915
Meyer wants us to keep you safe.

160
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,417
You're the baby,
and I'm the bloody sitter,

161
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,960
so just shut up.

162
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,878
Mind your little
sausage fingers.

163
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,881
And don't get hurt.

164
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,516
Besides, I had to push papers
for a full year at MI6

165
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,644
before I was even allowed
on stakeout duty.

166
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,979
You should consider
yourself lucky

167
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,940
because surveillance is an art.

168
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,111
What are we looking for, anyway?

169
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,738
Stillness in the chaos.

170
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,703
Speaking of chaos,
your friend sure pulled

171
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,830
the muddy end
of the shit stick, didn't he?

172
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,167
No, I pulled it for him.

173
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,918
Well...

174
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,421
sometimes, when you're trying
to protect your own world,

175
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:25,383
you threaten the worlds
of those you love the most.

176
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,638
If Ruth were here,
she would have told you that.

177
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah, well, she didn't get
her best friend killed.

178
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,313
She came damn well close enough.

179
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,905
Your grandmother
told me a story once

180
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,866
of when she was in the camps.

181
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,787
She made a grave impression
on a Nazi doctor,

182
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,789
Wilhelm Zuchs.

183
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,749
The Wolf.

184
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,126
Very early in her imprisonment,

185
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,337
she did something
that caught The Wolf's eye,

186
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,840
when she saved the life
of a young girl.

187
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,596
He became fixated by her.

188
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,100
Ruth had no idea.

189
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:19,229
She spent her days
just trying to survive.

190
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,148
Trying to steal a look
from her love, Meyer,

191
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,442
not knowing that all this time

192
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,988
The Wolf was stalking her,
his prey.

193
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,451
And then, one day,
The Wolf finally made his move.

194
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,914
I was hoping to find you here.

195
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,875
I'm in need of a personal
secretary at the clinic.

196
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,961
I've met with a few German girls

197
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,629
from the steno pool,

198
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,466
but needed someone...
exceptional.

199
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,593
And I thought of you.

200
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,139
You'd get your own room.

201
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,893
A warm bed. Proper food.

202
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:03,606
Only catch is
you'd have to work for

203
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,236
a painfully disorganized doctor

204
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:12,198
and make sense
of all his paperwork.

205
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,164
Is this a choice?

206
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,874
Or an order?

207
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,128
A choice, of course.

208
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,132
In that case,
I appreciate your offer.

209
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,553
But I think I'll stay here.

210
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:46,608
I hoped you'd have chosen
more wisely.

211
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,653
But no meal
or warm bed would ever

212
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,781
make up for the shame
that she would have felt

213
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,492
if she had accepted
the devil's offer.

214
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,328
And in that moment,
with that decision,

215
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,038
Ruth threatened Meyer's world

216
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,582
more than she could have ever
intended to.

217
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:07,378
And The Wolf turned
his focus on Meyer.

218
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,680
What'd he do to him?

219
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,684
Well, that's not
my story to tell.

220
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,397
But you're not
the only one, Jonah.

221
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,691
Your grandmother...

222
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,485
from that moment on,

223
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,987
she felt forever
what you're feeling now.

224
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,325
It's the reason
she made The Wolf

225
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,410
number one on our list.

226
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,499
It wasn't Meyer who did that?

227
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,293
Enough jibber jabber.
The old bag's going in.

228
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,845
Thank you.

229
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,097
I feel very special.

230
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,682
Thank you.

231
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,184
- I'll be right outside.
- Oh, thank you.

232
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,028
Yes.

233
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,488
Exact.

234
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,203
All right. 630.

235
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,163
630.

236
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,250
600.

237
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,127
It wasn't there.

238
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,879
- Huh?
- Well, the numbers only

239
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,589
went up to 600. That's...

240
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,257
You're positive?

241
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,302
What, are you questioning
my ability to count now?

242
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,636
Not at all.

243
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,346
I was questioning your eyesight.

244
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,598
Uh, yeah.
Uh, no, ah-ah-ah.

245
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,266
Okay. All right, look.

246
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,811
But this key is the exact type
of key the Nazis had.

247
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,938
It's the same kind.
It's the same bank.

248
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,899
So it's got to be there, right?

249
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,484
Uh, maybe it's hidden
some place secret.

250
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,029
Like in a preferred Nazi
business lounge or something?

251
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,656
Well, I don't know how
we are supposed to find

252
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,243
a secret box in the city's
most secretive bank. How?

253
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,288
Well, every secret
has to start somewhere, hmm?

254
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,376
Nothing some biscuits
won't solve.

255
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,170
Where the hell is she going?

256
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,548
Always speaking in riddles,
these Catholics.

257
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,069
Ooh, yummy.

258
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,102
Well, I-I can't taste
any difference.

259
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,939
Well, what you don't taste
is a cost-cutting elixir.

260
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,651
It's going to revolutionize the
way you sweeten your products.

261
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,528
No more importing
expensive sugar.

262
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,947
This is patented, FDA-approved,

263
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:24,575
made from a surplus crop
right here in the United States.

264
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,453
Gentlemen, the only thing
sweeter than your product

265
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,913
will be...

266
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,957
will be your profit margins.

267
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,333
Pardon me one moment.

268
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,336
What?

269
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,587
I'm sorry, Ms. Low,
but there's been

270
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,047
an incident at the factory.

271
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,632
- Incident?
- Some of the "parts"

272
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,009
we were assembling
in the basement

273
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,427
had a "combustion" of sorts.

274
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,554
Enough with
the fucking code speak.

275
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,180
Were there any casualties?

276
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,850
Two workers,
and two more were injured.

277
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,061
The shipment from Argentina?

278
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,731
On standby, just waiting
on sanctions to be lifted.

279
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,399
Cutting it close.

280
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,234
I apologize.

281
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:59,986
Where were we?

282
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,487
- Profits.
- Profits.

283
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,281
Truly the sweetest part.

284
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,949
Let's talk numbers.

285
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,919
How do you know
you can trust her?

286
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,129
Because I'm in love with her.

287
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,968
And to find love
in a place like this?

288
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,345
God is already on my side.

289
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:31,184
Your plan only works if everyone
follows through.

290
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,602
God included.

291
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:36,522
God will and so will she.

292
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,155
Where is my cap?

293
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,199
You didn't wear it here, sir.

294
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,536
And when we get out of here,

295
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,581
I'm going to give her a ring
that belonged to my mother...

296
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,875
and her mother before that.

297
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,088
Find it now

298
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,216
or I find
another rat spinster...

299
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,343
who won't misplace my things.

300
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,639
Well. With a face like yours,
you'll need a nice ring.

301
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,059
I just hope she's worth it.

302
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,735
You know what?

303
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,030
I think I left it
in the barracks.

304
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,801
Hold on.

305
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,469
You're saying Jonah
went looking for the guy

306
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,054
- who shot his grandmother?
- That's right.

307
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,514
His grandmother is shot dead.

308
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,641
Jonah goes looking
for the perp who did it.

309
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,768
Then, days later,
his best friend's murdered

310
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,186
during Jonah's shift.

311
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,896
You don't think this all
might be connected?

312
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,398
Yeah, I do, but I got nothing

313
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,817
to connect Arthur's murder
to Ruth's.

314
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,360
The kid knows something.

315
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,903
You let him go.

316
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,655
You got to break a kid
like that.

317
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,740
Find out what he knows.
Find out the fucking connection.

318
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,409
I'm not holding
a 19-year-old boy all night

319
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,162
without something
to fucking hold him on.

320
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,746
He's a good kid, Morris,

321
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,540
who got dealt
a shitty hand in life.

322
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,916
He's got no family, no money.

323
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,002
A kid like that
knows how to survive.

324
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,129
A kid like that doesn't break.

325
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,676
Got no money?

326
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,137
Then who posted his bond?

327
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,181
Friend of the grandmother's.

328
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,268
Meyer Offerman.

329
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,769
Detective Groton?

330
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,438
Be right back.

331
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,818
Murphy, line five.

332
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,904
All right, ladies and Jewishmen.

333
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,239
Here we have the main floor
of our bank.

334
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,282
Vaults,

335
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,035
teller stations, offices,

336
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,494
surveillance room, toilets,

337
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,121
storage, boiler.

338
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,373
About as titillating
as the Mormon Kama Sutra,

339
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,375
I know, but then there is this:

340
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,294
a room with no name,

341
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,630
designed to house nothing,

342
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,382
with a steel reinforced door.

343
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:13,512
If box 630 is in that bank,
that is where you'll find it.

344
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,224
Well, every prison has a warden.

345
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,850
Somebody has access.

346
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,103
Showtime.

347
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,360
Hi.

348
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,112
It's your favorite star
of screen and stage,

349
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,571
and I want to give you
all my money.

350
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,573
Okay, I'm the executive
branch manager.

351
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,617
An associate is normally
in charge of opening accounts.

352
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,536
Yeah, well, I don't know
if you recognize me,

353
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,621
but I'm a lot of bit famous,

354
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,956
and I don't really want
to go over

355
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,833
to "normally" and get mobbed.

356
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,961
Let me help you out.
We look different in the flesh.

357
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,589
I'll give you a hint.

358
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,718
I... O...

359
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,637
N...

360
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,140
N...

361
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,685
Y Flash.

362
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,271
Lonny Flash.

363
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,647
Kendra Conrad.

364
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,232
She's got the only keys.

365
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,109
She wears them on a chain.

366
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,360
I tailed her.

367
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,154
She takes 'em home every night.

368
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,823
But I will find a way
to get them.

369
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,409
If we go anywhere

370
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,746
in that bank in the daytime,
there's a hundred witnesses.

371
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,456
If we go at night,
there's alarms,

372
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,874
there's cameras,
there's armed security.

373
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,125
Yes, and that alarm,

374
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,918
it's a private one
just for them.

375
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,795
It can't be cut. It will go off.

376
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,131
It will alert the guards.

377
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,592
And just to add a cherry
to that shit sundae,

378
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,594
even if we do manage
to break in,

379
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,263
they cannot know we got
into their secret vault.

380
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,141
The moment we show
we know it even exists

381
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:25,353
is the moment the Nazis know
that we are onto their course.

382
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,573
You know how
heartbroken we all were, Biff.

383
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,785
How have you been doing?

384
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,329
I ain't gonna lie.

385
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:46,624
It's been tougher
than a two-dollar steak.

386
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,292
But...

387
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,087
there's work
that needs finishing.

388
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,382
Actually, that's why
I come to see you.

389
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,509
What is it?

390
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,968
The trade bill.

391
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,637
South America?

392
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,806
I guess losing my family

393
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,058
has made me
a real bleeding heart.

394
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,851
But if we lift sanctions,

395
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:09,355
we're letting
those South American dictators

396
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:13,818
abuse human rights all they want
with no consequences.

397
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,363
And what kind of message
is that sending to the world?

398
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:20,282
You have been arguing the
exact opposite for months now.

399
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,951
And I was wrong.

400
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,411
We all were.

401
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,455
Is it ever too late
to admit you're wrong?

402
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,665
Yes.

403
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,042
Exactly right now is too late.

404
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,128
The bill has passed
both chambers.

405
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,255
It's awaiting
Carter's signature.

406
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,923
You're suggesting we veto it?

407
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,134
Not veto it.

408
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,387
Postpone it while we study it.

409
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,180
Have you told the president?

410
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,433
I have no problem doing so,

411
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,018
but I come to you first,
as a friend.

412
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,898
It's what my Lottie
would've wanted.

413
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:58,988
She was always
quite fond of you.

414
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,325
Okay,
so the alarms are still a problem.

415
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,702
- The alarms are a problem.
- I don't think there's enough time.

416
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,162
No, but you said the alarm

417
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,164
- goes off no matter what.
- No matter what.

418
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,417
So we make the guards
believe we're crooks,

419
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,210
we're stealing cash
from the vault...

420
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,837
While the rest of us are
breaking into the secret room.

421
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,088
- Yeah, but how-how...
- So you want us

422
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,048
to rob hundreds
of thousands of dollars

423
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,717
- from a heavily guarded bank?
- Right.

424
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,093
And what about security?

425
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,137
Harriet takes care of security.

426
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,930
I'm quite sorry, sir.

427
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,517
A woman from the FBI
is at the door.

428
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,895
She wants to speak to the boy.

429
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,341
Silly accomplishments

430
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,218
of a vain old man.

431
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,387
No, I get it.

432
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,139
I still have my fifth-grade
spelling bee certificate

433
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,349
on my fridge.

434
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,558
Ah.

435
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,477
I should take them all down.

436
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,396
But then I'd probably forget
that I was ever good-looking.

437
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,690
Meyer Offerman.

438
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,401
Special Agent Morris.
Call me Millie.

439
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,778
Millie.

440
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,447
This here's Jonah.

441
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,991
- Hello, Jonah.
- Hi.

442
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,993
You know, a lot of people
are worried about you.

443
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,039
I happen to be one of them.

444
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,875
- Jonah's been through quite a lot lately.
- I know.

445
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,877
I'm very sorry for your loss.

446
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,128
You know, Jonah has already

447
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,630
given his statement
to the police

448
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,298
about his friend's murder.

449
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,926
Yes. Uh, actually,

450
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,803
I'm here to talk to you
about your grandmother

451
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,846
and was wondering if you could
answer a few questions for me.

452
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:51,225
Did-did you find something?
A lead?

453
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,312
No, but I was hoping it would
help if we talked privately.

454
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,774
I'll be right outside.

455
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,282
- You play?
- Yeah, a bit.

456
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,367
You?

457
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,954
Not really. I'm not very good.
I'm told I'm too aggressive.

458
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,999
Mm. Queen's Gambit.

459
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,167
What's that?

460
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,338
It's a strategy the...
masters use.

461
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,965
Hmm.

462
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,842
You attack
from the very first move,

463
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,511
advance your queen,
put constant pressure

464
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,346
on your opponent till they fold.

465
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,348
Well, that just sounds more
calculated than what I do.

466
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,812
Plus, it only really works if
your opponent makes a mistake.

467
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,860
Can I be honest, Jonah?

468
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,196
I'm no good at games 'cause
I just don't like playing 'em.

469
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,283
Here's what I know.

470
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,744
I know that your grandma
was killed.

471
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,455
I know you told Detective Groton

472
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,290
you didn't think it was
a robbery, and I know that,

473
00:31:56,332 --> 00:32:00,294
days later,
your best friend was murdered

474
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,463
during what was supposed
to be your shift.

475
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,382
And I cannot imagine what
all that must be like for you.

476
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:11,180
No. No, you can't.

477
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,766
I also know you went looking
for the person

478
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,017
who killed your grandma.

479
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,938
And, you know, if someone hurt

480
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,900
the person I loved,
I would do the same thing,

481
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,780
but there is a right way
and a wrong way to get justice.

482
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,116
You can still choose
to do the right thing here.

483
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,994
You got to come clean, Jonah.

484
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,918
Why do the good guys

485
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,255
always have to choose
to do the right thing?

486
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,925
Doing the right thing didn't

487
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,888
help Bruce Wayne get justice
for his family,

488
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,350
or Frank Castle,

489
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,644
Peter Parker.

490
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,979
Are you trying
to tell me something?

491
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,818
No, I'm just talking comics.

492
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,573
We found a kid's jacket
at a murder scene.

493
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,450
Couldn't figure out
who it belonged to.

494
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,494
But get this,

495
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:19,790
the victim had surveillance
photos of your grandmother,

496
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,959
almost like he'd been
tracking her.

497
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,003
Jonah, does this jacket
belong to you?

498
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:34,972
See, I think you went
looking for justice

499
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,724
and you got in over your head,

500
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,392
and I think
you didn't do it alone.

501
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,019
Okay? So listen to me,
I can protect you,

502
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,940
but you have got to tell me
what is going on.

503
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,486
Maybe what's really going on is,

504
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,698
you're the one
in over your head.

505
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,908
Where were you three nights ago?

506
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,910
He was with me.

507
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,245
Here.

508
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,665
Any other questions,

509
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,626
feel free to direct them
to the boy's attorney.

510
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,255
Of course.

511
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,014
You know,
it isn't that the good guys

512
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,850
always have to choose
to do the right thing.

513
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,852
It's that choosing
to do the right thing

514
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,146
makes them the good guys.

515
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,109
Good day, Millie.

516
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:37,951
She lied. She is good at chess,

517
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,705
and she's not
on our side, Jonah.

518
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,662
How did you know
this is the way in?

519
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,997
Because I built it.

520
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,043
Quicker, Jakob!

521
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,686
Praise be to God.

522
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,859
Okay. Final step.

523
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,277
Are you ready?

524
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,112
Ja.

525
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,657
Everyone has certain assets
they'd rather not

526
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,617
see dragged into the light.

527
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:05,122
I pride myself on knowing
how to keep things in the dark.

528
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,293
Which is precisely
why I came here to you...

529
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,129
...a man whose eyes
have adjusted

530
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,882
to see in the darkness.

531
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,467
Your German is perfect.

532
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,927
We all had to learn

533
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,971
new things to survive the war.

534
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,306
Speaking of,

535
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,808
and at the risk
of sounding uncouth,

536
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,518
I'm afraid I must inquire

537
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,231
because my investors will,
what did you do during the war?

538
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,609
I maintained a policy

539
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,903
of neutrality, and neutrality

540
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,155
ensures stability.

541
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,532
See no evil. Hear no evil.

542
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,117
- Speak no evil.
- Hmm.

543
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,119
But the evil still exists,
doesn't it?

544
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,163
Right before your closed eyes

545
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,874
and your sealed ears
and your muted tongue.

546
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,751
And if one isn't careful,

547
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,961
such willful blindness

548
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:56,131
leads to rather
unsavory fortunes

549
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,132
being procured.

550
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,886
How disappointing.

551
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,931
I thought you were different
from the others.

552
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,182
What others?

553
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,643
Oh, come now.
Surely we can both admit at the

554
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:12,064
cruel jest being lectured

555
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,191
on the ethics of moneylending

556
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,234
from a Jew,

557
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,613
and a hypocrite Jew as well.

558
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,366
Where did you make your money
after the war, Mr. Offerman?

559
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,576
And was it all as pure

560
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,496
as the Matterhorn snow?
No, no, no.

561
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:32,459
All fortunes are unsavory.

562
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,586
There's not a dollar
on this earth

563
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,463
that doesn't have
a little dirt on it.

564
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,173
There's a difference between

565
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,676
dirt and blood.

566
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,679
Not if you clean it well enough.

567
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,015
Blood always leaves a stain,
my friend,

568
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:51,853
whether you can see it or not.

569
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,565
If there's nothing else,

570
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,861
I think I will show you out.

571
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,619
- Hi.
- You again.

572
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,038
Yeah. Look,

573
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,873
I learned a few lessons
in Hollywood.

574
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:15,168
One, never agree to a casting
session after 8:00 at night.

575
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,546
And two, if you see
something you want,

576
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,215
don't be afraid to ask for it
or you'll never get it.

577
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:21,508
Life is short, huh,

578
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,594
you only get so many shots,
you know? Kendra...

579
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,266
...there's something
happening between us.

580
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,475
We both feel it.

581
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,685
I don't even know your movies.

582
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,979
- They're films, they're films.
- But my husband,

583
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,065
I called him and told him
that I met you.

584
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:40,902
- He's a big fan.
- Yeah? Huh.

585
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,031
How big?

586
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,130
What is that,
what-what-what you just said?

587
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,716
Oh, just-just a little prayer,
you know.

588
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,469
"Fear not.
Be strong and courageous."

589
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,387
You know, all that good stuff.

590
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,890
Yeah, nothing like a pep talk
from the Torah

591
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,142
- to help you commit a felony.
- Oh.

592
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,186
My safta used to say it.

593
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,858
Cutting it close.
Did you get the mold?

594
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,485
Yeah,

595
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,028
and possibly gonorrhea.

596
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,237
You okay?

597
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,365
Not emotionally. To get that,
I basically had to

598
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,535
play the kid in a very X-rated
version of Kramer vs. Kramer.

599
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,245
Have a coffee, Romeo.

600
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,207
- Your day's just beginning.
- I don't ever want that back.

601
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,293
All right,
let's carve some keys.

602
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,545
Helen? You ready?

603
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,964
Ja.

604
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,927
It's the best I could make.

605
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,681
It's perfect.

606
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,020
Remember...

607
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,398
You believe it, they believe it.

608
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,400
Drive straight through.

609
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,298
Helen...

610
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,263
Will you...?

611
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,597
We have to go, now.

612
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,226
I'll ask you in a moment.

613
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,190
Halt!

614
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,316
What is this?!

615
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,151
Jakob!

616
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,153
Go! Now!

617
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,279
Jakob!

618
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,539
Stop them!

619
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,626
Open the gate!

620
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,170
Right now!

621
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,448
Colonel,

622
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,742
the compensation for Maryanne's
family is prepared.

623
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,914
I just have...

624
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,790
President Carter has decided to delay

625
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,626
the signing of the
South American Trade Bill.

626
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,544
The bill, which passed
by a slim margin

627
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,671
in the Senate last week,
would have lifted

628
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,925
sanctions against several
countries. In local news...

629
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,426
She's gonna kill him...

630
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,303
...appears to be imminent
in the case of...

631
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,682
Uh-huh?

632
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,309
What did you do?

633
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,562
Oh, nothing
that can't be undone.

634
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:05,565
As soon as she remembers
how valuable I am

635
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,776
to this organization.

636
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,948
Uh, you know what?

637
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:16,785
Let it ring.

638
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,537
Everything else can wait.

639
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,956
Scheisse!

640
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,833
- Right?
- That is right.

641
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:28,088
- One day at a time.
- Mm-hmm. Mmm.

642
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,091
Oh...

643
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,449
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Sorry.

644
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,387
Finish up in here, fast.

645
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,017
Sorry.

646
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,492
Bank's blind.

647
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,165
- We're moving.
- Come on, let's go. Come.

648
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:49,502
Listen, the second,
the instant that door is opened,

649
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,547
the alarm is tripped, the guards
will know they've been breached.

650
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,215
Right now.

651
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,759
There's two guards.

652
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,637
Lonny and I will keep them
occupied for as long as we can.

653
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,098
Whoa. Get back
to the fucking van.

654
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,308
- Joe, I'm...
- Go.

655
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,561
You're just gonna
fuck things up in there.

656
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,859
- Get on the ground now.
- Help, please.

657
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,235
- Now! Get on the ground!
- Please help!

658
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,488
Help me, please!

659
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,989
Open up this vault.

660
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,617
Open up the vault
or I'll shoot this bitch.

661
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,494
Drop your guns,
slide them over here.

662
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,995
So help me, I'll kill her.

663
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,955
Tell that to someone
who gives a shit.

664
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,292
Please, please, please
do as he says, please.

665
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:30,877
I will kill her!

666
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,797
- I said drop your guns.
- I have the shot.

667
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:45,308
Oh, he's got the shot, huh?
Look at him, huh?

668
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,019
He can't wait to kill me.
You're just like a real cop.

669
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:49,646
Huh! Fucking murderers,

670
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,856
and you get away with it
'cause it's your job.

671
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,609
Just like the movies, right?
Huh? Yeah. Attica!

672
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,945
Attica! Attic...

673
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,158
Oh... fuck!

674
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,041
Freeze! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

675
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,376
Drop the fucking gun

676
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,253
or I'll fucking
blow your brains out.

677
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,713
Drop the gun!

678
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,427
Stand up, asshole. Turn around.

679
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,389
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

680
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,071
Easy.

681
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,120
Fuck.

682
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,333
Guess I didn't fuck up, did I?

683
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,918
Come on.

684
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,090
It's here.

685
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,886
Wait, what...

686
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:06,139
What?

687
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,312
Bubkes.

688
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,064
Fucker's dead. Careful.
The bitch is in on it.

689
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,363
Bitch sure is.

690
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:39,005
Ghost bullets, I presume.

691
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,218
Oh, shit!

692
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,678
Mine are the real kind.

693
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,687
Get up.

694
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,566
Oh, for fuck's sake.

695
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,861
And scene.

696
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,866
Thank you.

697
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,368
Thank you so much.

698
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,120
Now kindly

699
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,956
point us to the fucking money.

700
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,918
All right,
guys. What the fuck do we do now?

701
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,046
I don't know. I mean,
this key, this box, all a dead end.

702
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:21,464
There's nothing here.

703
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,092
This room isn't big enough.

704
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,386
- Huh?
- The dimensions in the blueprints,

705
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,555
it's smaller than
it should be. It...

706
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:35,353
Just by a few feet,
but still, it's-it's this wall.

707
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:38,940
- It's-it's, i-it's too close.
- What are you saying?

708
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:40,858
He's saying this wall
isn't a wall.

709
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,319
There's something behind it.

710
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,871
What?

711
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,215
But according to the plans,

712
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:06,884
this building doesn't
have a basement.

713
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,178
- But it does now.
- So,

714
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,016
Joe, after you?

715
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,208
Please tell me
this isn't what I think it is.

716
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,041
Meyer said that
Hauser helped to hide the Nazi loot

717
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,085
stolen from Jews during the war.

718
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,755
I, I didn't think
he, he meant this.

719
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:31,344
This is... this is...

720
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,221
Everything.

721
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,891
Down to their jewelry.

722
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,814
M-Mindy and I, we were there
when they took it all from us.

723
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:45,858
You know, they had
to put it somewhere.

724
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,867
How many lives do you think
are in this room?

725
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,496
He knew this was
happening and did nothing.

726
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:02,375
He didn't do nothing.
He built himself a big old bank.

727
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:20,518
That's just like Aaron's.

728
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,191
Every piece,

729
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:30,653
every single token, has a story.

730
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:05,813
Guys. It's time.

731
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,609
- We got to go.
- No, no, we...

732
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,527
We can't leave this here.

733
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,947
We have to.
No footprints, remember?

734
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,991
We'll lose our lead.

735
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,079
Write for yourselves this song.

736
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,040
I got another idea.

737
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,130
What?

738
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,340
Okay.

739
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,761
- Sorry. We do need to go.
- Yeah.

740
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:39,430
- Okay.
- Mindy.

741
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:44,268
- M-Mindy.
- Jonah?

742
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,270
- Mindy.
- Yeah.

743
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:49,106
Okay, Jonah.

744
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,776
Jonah. We got to go.

745
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,402
We're exiting.

746
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,780
Copy. We'll meet you outside.

747
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,120
Thanks, fellas.

748
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,749
This is why you came,

749
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,293
like the others,

750
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,588
to hurl baseless accusations
without proof?

751
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,800
I came with the proof...

752
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,639
...of the fortunes you plundered

753
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,141
from millions of dead Jews,

754
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,811
that you now have hidden

755
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:29,897
beneath your bank.

756
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:36,737
The innocent souls
that perished in agony

757
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,574
while you looked the other way.

758
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:44,328
Then raked in
what was left of them.

759
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,123
Their rings,

760
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,793
their rattles, their teeth.

761
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,421
Look at them. Here.

762
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,801
Photographs can be doctored.

763
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,720
Doctored?

764
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,223
Oh, yes.

765
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,145
Can you doctor this?

766
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,608
Look at it.

767
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,194
- Can you doctor this?
- I have seen enough, sir.

768
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:19,697
Now I will go.

769
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,162
Quiet, quiet. Quiet.

770
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,580
Quiet.

771
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,916
It's your life if you're quiet.

772
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:33,210
Do you understand?
Just listen to me.

773
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:37,965
Next, these photos go
to the war crimes tribunal.

774
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:41,177
Then to the victims' families.

775
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:45,681
Then to the Nazi pigs whose
troughs you failed to protect.

776
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,725
What do you want to know?

777
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:50,728
Who owns box 630?

778
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,397
That's all. Tell me.

779
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:57,193
I will leave your vile history
right where it is,

780
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,945
in the past.

781
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:02,615
If I tell you, he will kill me.

782
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:05,701
Don't let him know you told me.
That's all.

783
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:08,454
You can keep a secret,
can't you?

784
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,872
- Can't you?
- Yes.

785
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,249
All right.

786
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,962
You tell me.

787
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,924
Tell me.

788
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:26,931
Oskar Hauptman.

789
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,811
- Try again.
- Oskar...

790
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:35,106
- Hauptman.
- Hauptman died 30 years ago.

791
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,565
No, no...

792
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,776
- You think I don't know this?
- No, no, no, no.

793
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:40,444
- What?
- Hauptman,

794
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:44,073
he's still alive, Jew.

795
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:50,621
Thank you.

796
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,486
I love you, Maria.

797
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:29,285
When the time is right,
we can get the rest.

798
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,581
But until we find its home,

799
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:38,210
consider it a reminder
of your birthright.

800
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:47,678
What we did to Holstedder,

801
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,722
it felt wrong.

802
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:55,061
It felt like it wasn't
my problem, 'cause,

803
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,937
you know, it didn't affect me.

804
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:03,861
- When I saw that room...
- Yeah, when you saw that room,

805
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:06,572
you realized what it is
we're doing here.

806
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:12,161
That ring belonged to someone

807
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:15,206
who lived, who dreamed.

808
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:19,126
One moment alive,
one moment... gone.

809
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,336
No more.

810
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,881
And it was one ring

811
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:26,801
in one room.

812
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:30,429
Imagine how many
other stories there are.

813
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:32,848
Imagine.

814
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:37,061
You're one of us now.

815
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:40,356
It's so good to have you here.

816
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,566
- My boy...
- Ah...

817
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:45,194
- Eh.
- It's just a little...

818
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,403
- I know.
- ...tender.

819
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:49,990
I need to learn how to fight
fucking Bruce Lee-style.

820
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:53,035
Well, I'll see what I can do.

821
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,704
I know a few people, you know?

822
00:56:57,123 --> 00:57:01,752
But first... here's someone
you should see.

823
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,757
Oskar Hauptman.

824
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,884
The Ghost.

825
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:12,930
A Nazi doctor so sadistic,

826
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:15,975
he could make
even Mengele squirm.

827
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:21,438
It appears
he may still be alive.

828
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,025
And it would be
our job to find him.

829
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,987
The owner of box 630.

830
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,242
Come.

831
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:35,077
Let's go tell the others.

832
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,252
Hunters,

833
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:47,131
come meet Oskar Hauptman.

834
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,353
Excuse me.
You're Danny Rohr, right?

835
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,980
No soliciting, thank you.

836
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:05,399
Millie Morris, FBI.

837
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:07,401
Can I ask you a question?

838
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,612
Journalism 101 tip:

839
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,697
never waste a question asking
if you can ask a question.

840
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:15,159
You wrote a few puff pieces
on Meyer Offerman.

841
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,452
You even quoted him
in a real article

842
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,495
about Jewish philanthropy.

843
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:20,539
I called the Times.
They said you lost your job.

844
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,875
Look, lady, cartoons start
in 15 minutes.

845
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,877
I'm thinking today's the day
Tom finally gets Jerry.

846
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:27,129
What do you want?

847
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,592
I want you to tell me everything
you know about Meyer Offerman.

848
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,136
Hi, herzli.

849
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:37,473
Oh, don't forget we have a
dinner with the Lindts this, uh,

850
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,100
next weekend,
to Peter Luger, huh?

851
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:42,478
You remember? Good.

852
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,314
All right, my darling.

853
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,274
I love you very much and...

854
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:49,902
I'll see, I'll see you soon.

855
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:52,363
All right. Bye-bye.

856
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,008
Oh, my God.

1
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,907
Hello?

2
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,301
Millie Morris?

3
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,785
Who is this?

4
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,331
Look outside your door.

5
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,126
Who the fuck is this?

6
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,170
Merry Christmas.

7
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:56,510
- Hmm.
- Should we tell the others?

8
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,138
Tell the others? No.

9
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,347
No.

10
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,309
This is from the Shlieffle file.

11
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,773
They deserve to bloody know
what happened here.

12
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,610
What, then? You didn't hear me?

13
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,990
I wasn't clear?

14
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:22,202
They will know
when I need them to know.

15
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,204
Not before.

16
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,540
We'll salvage it all.

17
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,792
Now get back to work.

18
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,764
One more, Safta. Please?

19
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,515
Tell me the one of you and Saba.

20
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,726
- Again, kindelah?
- Please?

21
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,269
Okay.

22
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,480
But then, bedtime.

23
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,566
I mean it, Jonah.

24
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:57,404
Once upon a time,
there was a princess.

25
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:02,493
And she loved to laugh and swim
with her sister Chava.

26
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,914
And then, one day,
a scary wolf king came

27
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,124
and he captured her
and her sister

28
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,379
and he took them
to his fortress in the forest.

29
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,094
And he kept them there
for a very long time.

30
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,262
And then it was
no more laughing,

31
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,473
there was no more smiling

32
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,602
and not even enough food
for everybody.

33
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,314
One by one, the wolf king's
army took away

34
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,776
all the other prisoners,
even the princess's sister,

35
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,779
until no one was left but her.

36
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,741
And once she was alone,
that wolf king

37
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,995
tried to win her heart
by giving her gifts,

38
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,373
but she wouldn't take
nothing from him.

39
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:54,795
And she just grew sadder
and sadder and more lonely.

40
00:04:54,837 --> 00:05:00,009
But then, one day,
some fairy helpers appeared.

41
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,639
- - And
the wolf king was so afraid

42
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,643
that he ran away
and no one saw him ever again.

43
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:15,024
And then, she saw him,
a brave green knight

44
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,444
who was the leader,
the king of the fairy helpers.

45
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,280
- Saba.
- That's right, Jonah.

46
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,491
He nursed her back to health
and he promised to protect her

47
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:29,246
and take her to a land where
the wolf king would never go.

48
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:34,710
And she knew that he loved her
and she loved him.

49
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,712
And he's in heaven with Mommy?

50
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,381
Yes. And I'm here

51
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:43,218
with the best present ever.

52
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,471
- Me.
- That's right.

53
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,141
Her sweet little boy Jonah.

54
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,143
The end.

55
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:55,606
And now, it is shluffy time.

56
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,406
- Love you.
- I love you.

57
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,336
So your safta kept

58
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,255
a Jew necklace she said
your grandpa gave her.

59
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,299
And Meyer said he traded
his back in the day

60
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,592
to get his dick wet.

61
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,594
Hardly proves he's your gramps.

62
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,764
My whole life, I was told
this guy was my grandfather.

63
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,100
His name's not on my mom's
birth certificate.

64
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,268
It's blank,
like a fucking Mad Lib.

65
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,480
And Mindy, she said
that my safta and Meyer

66
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,107
had a "complicated"
relationship.

67
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,484
What's more complicated
than, u-uh,

68
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,319
knocking someone up and bailing?

69
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,405
Do me a favor. Quit crying like
you're a junior mitzvah scout

70
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,866
at Camp Kinder Ring
and just call him already.

71
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:52,830
We got más grande shit
on our plato, hombre.

72
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,415
Like this día de... doom.

73
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,960
So let's get in there
and find what we can.

74
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,171
If The Ghost worked for the Army
under the name Timothy Randall,

75
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,340
this place has got
to have a file on him.

76
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,926
And you're not calling anyone.

77
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,886
All you're gonna do
is sit your ass in this van

78
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,304
and keep the engine running.

79
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,515
Sweet. Yeah. I'm the wheelman.

80
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,933
You're not the wheelman.

81
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,518
You're the guy who waits
in a parked car

82
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,770
and makes sure no one takes it.

83
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,986
Yeah, I'm the f...
fucking wheelman.

84
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,039
O-Oh.

85
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,668
Couldn't have lifted
those sanctions

86
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,587
without you, Mr. President.

87
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,507
Biff has got something
up his sleeve.

88
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,926
I know it.

89
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,554
You've still got a marker
with our friend at The Post.

90
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,764
If Biff's hiding something,
she'll find it.

91
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,892
She can dig up anything.

92
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,021
Make the call.

93
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,306
He has to eat, too, doesn't he?

94
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,144
Why? He's gonna die anyway.

95
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,647
Hmm?

96
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,983
But he has to live
long enough to suffer.

97
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,277
You said it yourself.

98
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,321
And I meant it.

99
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,200
He's gonna die a horrible death.

100
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,415
He's gonna pay
for what he did to Aaron.

101
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,835
How?

102
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,716
H-How?

103
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,638
You know, 34 years I've been
dreaming about this day,

104
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,517
but I-I... I never got that far.

105
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,990
My ex stopped bringing
the kids around.

106
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:38,203
Guess they got tired of hearing
their dad scream at 3:00 a.m.

107
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,414
That's when I knew
I needed help.

108
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,541
- So I started going to therapy...
- You know I love

109
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,836
a good circle jerk,
but this shit is a snoozer.

110
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,672
Records room is down the hall.

111
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,340
Just wait for the right moment.

112
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,259
We wait any longer
and we're gonna be Sieg-heiling

113
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,469
in front of the Reichsfuhrer
by next week.

114
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,139
- Who's up next?
- I'll go.

115
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,600
What brought you here today?

116
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,729
What brought any of us here?

117
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,231
I'm in pain, Sarge.

118
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,567
Can't sleep.

119
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,778
Can't get Charlie
out of my head.

120
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,575
It's almost like I...
like I miss it.

121
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,618
Is that sick?

122
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,120
We've all been there.

123
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,789
Haven't we, fellas?

124
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,418
Ugh, I just... just want
to feel alive again.

125
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,920
You know? Like I did
when I was tiptoeing

126
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,548
through that minefield
in Khe Sanh.

127
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,552
Or watching that napalm strike
from a hilltop in Hue.

128
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:39,389
And the silence
we heard right after.

129
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,309
You know what we call that?

130
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,730
The deafening quiet
after our boys rain hellfire

131
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:51,360
down on Charlie
like a Louisiana deluge?

132
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,030
We call it the death spiral.

133
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,074
Hold up.

134
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,785
- Man, I've heard that story before.
- You'll get your turn.

135
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,787
We all have.

136
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,288
It's from Death Spiral 2.

137
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,374
- That's right.
- Yeah.

138
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,250
Got to be honest, fellas,
didn't think

139
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,668
anyone had actually
seen that one.

140
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,504
Not in this country, at least.

141
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,383
I'm Lonny Flash.
Thank you for your service.

142
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,426
Is this
some kind of joke to you?

143
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,428
Just researching a role,
meant no offense.

144
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,305
Lee Strasberg would've
done the same thing.

145
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,225
Man, get the fuck out of here.

146
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,561
There's no silence
after a napalm strike.

147
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,606
Just screams.

148
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,486
Anyone who's ever seen one
up close would know that.

149
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,247
We were patrolling a village
along the Mekong

150
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,040
when we came under fire.

151
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,752
VC all along the tree line.

152
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,589
I got separated
from the platoon.

153
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,634
The other guys pulled back
and my LT called in the nape.

154
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,806
When the smoke cleared,

155
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,892
there was this little girl,

156
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:11,148
maybe six, burned,

157
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,943
holding her arms out,
begging to be picked up.

158
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,822
I tried to help her.

159
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:23,243
Her skin peeled off
in my hands.

160
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,662
Wasn't till later I realized...

161
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,542
...she didn't want to be held.

162
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,003
She just wanted to be
put out of her misery.

163
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,673
And so...

164
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,927
...I did.

165
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,640
She needed a weapon.

166
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,021
I was it.

167
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,488
Thanks for sharing.

168
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,530
You're back
in the world now, man.

169
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,615
Exactly.

170
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,388
Don't make me regret this...

171
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,687
Thank you.

172
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,729
You're welcome.

173
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,415
You are a decent man.

174
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,167
- I can tell...
- Not another word.

175
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,920
I know who you are...

176
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,589
- Ah...
- You are the Markowitzes.

177
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,424
Enough!

178
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,634
Your boy. Aaron was his name?

179
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,094
- Shut up.
- You let him go.

180
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,470
You broke your promise to him.

181
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,180
Die!

182
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,099
Die!

183
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,642
Die!

184
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,269
Die now!
Die!

185
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,370
Mindy?

186
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,164
And the Jews

187
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,626
smote their enemies

188
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,879
with the stroke of the sword,

189
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,343
and with slaughter
and destruction.

190
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:29,054
They did as they wished...

191
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,138
No, no. No, please!

192
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,598
- No!
- ...to those

193
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,683
who...

194
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,311
hated them!

195
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,400
Your son.

196
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,818
He's watching.

197
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,987
He knows you are a murderer.

198
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,781
Monster!

199
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,966
Jesus.

200
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,927
Did you find anything
on Paperclip?

201
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,054
Okay, come on in, have a seat.

202
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,599
I'm poking around, Morris,
but it's gonna take some time.

203
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,601
And if your source
is telling the truth,

204
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,728
I'm hard-pressed to believe
that anyone I talk to is

205
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,146
gonna be forthcoming about
covering up the greatest

206
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,898
mass conspiracy
in our nation's history.

207
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,982
Hm.

208
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,319
We may not need them to.

209
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,821
That crusty white guy

210
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,864
is Heinz Richter, the toymaker.

211
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,950
- Someone was surveilling him.
- Yeah.

212
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,827
All this showed up
on my doorstep

213
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,580
with a note saying that it was
taken from Offerman's place.

214
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,832
Well...

215
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,500
They send a return address?

216
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,961
We need to send these good
Samaritans a fruit basket.

217
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,254
This is real, boss.

218
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,297
Judge is gonna love
hearing that.

219
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,966
'Cause that's what you're
asking for, right?

220
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
You want a warrant to go
after Meyer Offerman,

221
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,761
based on this
trove of information

222
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,471
that magically turned up
at your door.

223
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,265
I know a murder charge
won't stick,

224
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,142
but there's a lot more
where this came from.

225
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,560
Richter, the Fishers...

226
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,520
Offerman's clearly
working off a list.

227
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,772
And if we get the government
to come clean about Paperclip,

228
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,274
maybe we can get Offerman to.

229
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,820
I just need to get
into his house...

230
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,741
find his files, and then
I can bust this thing open.

231
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,577
Well, those no way you can
legally get inside his house.

232
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,832
Okay.

233
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,626
But... that doesn't mean

234
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,045
you can't get inside his house.

235
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,176
You know how it's done,
don't you?

236
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,888
You get creative with the truth.

237
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,974
You tell the judge
what he needs to hear.

238
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,727
And you get...

239
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,146
comfortable
with being uncomfortable

240
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,690
with your conscience.

241
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,108
Best agents around here,

242
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,569
they do what it takes.

243
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,155
Others put in 20 years,

244
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:55,408
get a pension.

245
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,744
Question is, Millie...

246
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,537
which one are you?

247
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,670
I feel like he's here.

248
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,422
Who?

249
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,758
Aaron.

250
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,094
I feel like he's watching us.

251
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,433
If he sees us, Murray,

252
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,894
what would he think?

253
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,525
That man...

254
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,193
robbed us.

255
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,237
That man...

256
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,783
...robbed us
of our beautiful boy.

257
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,828
And I'm gonna kill him.

258
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,082
So, this revenge we seek,

259
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,211
is it for Aaron?

260
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,755
Or is it for us?

261
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,014
I'm gonna do it tonight,
and it'll be done.

262
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,190
Whatever we do,
we do together.

263
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,613
Yeah.

264
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,116
According to his file,

265
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,076
Timothy Randall lives with

266
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,536
someone named Una Randall.

267
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,749
If this shit's going down today,
you really think

268
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,501
we're gonna find some guy
whose nickname

269
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,295
is The fucking Ghost?

270
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,088
Holed up in some
lily-white suburb

271
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,508
ripping silent-but-deadlies
in his fucking La-Z-Boy?

272
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,927
Eichmann wasn't
in some Argentinian mansion.

273
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,388
When they found him,
he was working in a factory,

274
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,223
living in a shack.

275
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,476
Oh, shit, we have movement.

276
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,438
Yep, probably our girl Una.

277
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,232
Mid to late 50s, blond.

278
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,192
Looks like it could be
his daughter.

279
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,779
Either that,
or Cheryl Ladd's stand-in.

280
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,491
Actually, Cheryl Ladd's stand-in

281
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,285
has tits like vanilla ice cream.

282
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,203
And I know...

283
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,706
'cause I had two scoops.

284
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,916
Let's go find The fucking Ghost.

285
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:08,917
Yeah.

286
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,280
Yeah, I'm not going first.

287
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,067
Holy shit.

288
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
What the fuck?

289
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,135
Whoa!

290
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,470
Are you sure you want
to do that?

291
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,315
Who are you communicating with?

292
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,943
What are they broadcasting?

293
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,203
Doesn't look like him.

294
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:36,916
Dieter said they were

295
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,292
working something big.

296
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,418
They made biological weapons

297
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,170
at Edgewood.

298
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,548
Maybe this guy
is his test subject.

299
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,991
Behind his ears.

300
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,246
Half the widows on Rodeo
got these tiger stripes.

301
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,874
Plastic surgery.

302
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,803
Nine fingers.

303
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,847
This isn't The Ghost's
test subject.

304
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,267
This is him.

305
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,062
Maybe the plastic surgery
was to help him disappear.

306
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,694
Did you have a good time? Ja?

307
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,949
Don't move! Don't fucking move! Stop!

308
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,910
- Calm down, take whatever you want.
- Don't fucking move.

309
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,453
Please don't hurt us!

310
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,330
- Lonny! Joe!
- You're scaring him!

311
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,497
Stop fucking moving! Stop!

312
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,458
- Please!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

313
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,459
- What happened?
- Shit.

314
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,336
- What happened?!
- She had a fucking kid

315
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,378
- in her arms!
- What the fuck?

316
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,504
What the fuck?!

317
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,137
Shit.

318
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:20,645
With a backswing, you'll
pull it all over the place.

319
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,190
Now, I'm telling you, fellas,
it's all about wrist strength.

320
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:27,193
Actually, Pete,
isn't your Kori pregnant?

321
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,737
Hell, you'll be
scratch in no time.

322
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,490
Biff Simpson.

323
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,242
Josie Parker, Washington Post.

324
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,701
I'm writing a piece
on Carter lifting

325
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:36,869
the South American sanctions.

326
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,080
And this one's above the fold.

327
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,499
Guess I'll see you fellas later.

328
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,001
And now, uh,

329
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,379
Miss Parker, is it?

330
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,422
You were about to ask me about

331
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,133
a stellar piece of legislation.

332
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,593
Actually, I was
gonna ask you about

333
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,053
your connection
to Schidler Corp...

334
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,680
a South American corporation?

335
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,891
You attended the past
three Schidler corporate

336
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,935
retreats... gave the keynote
at the last one.

337
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:04,563
Uh, where I convinced them
to set up shop right here.

338
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,066
Create American jobs.

339
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,694
Well, I'm impressed
with your patriotism.

340
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,281
But I have to ask,
what else was in it for you?

341
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,157
That bill was on life support,
then my source says

342
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,159
you bulldozed your colleagues
to bring it home.

343
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,079
I'd be wary about trusting
that source of yours.

344
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,831
Juanita is sensitive.

345
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,666
It affects her credibility.

346
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,126
Fact remains,

347
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,794
you're awfully cozy
with the company

348
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,338
set to profit most
from lifting the ban.

349
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,007
I got a "C" in Latin,

350
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,092
but I'm pretty sure if I dig,

351
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,970
I might find a quid pro quo.

352
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,638
You won't.

353
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,016
And I don't need the heartburn.

354
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,060
Juanita is old news.

355
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,104
F-Forget this...

356
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,231
and I'll give you
access to the Oval.

357
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,986
Hmm, you'll be above
the fold every day.

358
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,199
Thing is, Biff.

359
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,035
Carter's gonna have you
out on your ass

360
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,786
the second this hits the stands.

361
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,086
They say you Orientals
are good at math.

362
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,672
And this...

363
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,258
it isn't gonna add up
to anything good for you.

364
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,844
Kill the story.

365
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,771
We grabbed what we could.

366
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,230
His face was different.

367
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,607
Scarred up by surgery.

368
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,984
But I'm telling you,
it was him.

369
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,611
It seems The Ghost got himself

370
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,571
a brand-new look that
wouldn't get him recognized.

371
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,948
And Jonah found a music box

372
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,700
right next to The Ghost's
AM/FM radio.

373
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,494
Playing a similar
creepy-ass tune

374
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,621
to the one we heard
at Holstedder's.

375
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,414
I think I figured it out.

376
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,291
The code. Come on!

377
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,127
Murray and Mindy couldn't

378
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,296
crack the code
because they-they,

379
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,715
they didn't have the cipher...
the notes from the music box

380
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,384
are the exact same as
the notes from the lullaby,

381
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,260
only they're organized
in different time signatures.

382
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,638
Ten years of piano

383
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,680
with Nettie Zuckerman.

384
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,016
It's a polymeter.

385
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,352
This is why we found the music
box next to the radio.

386
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,437
The-the lullaby's in 3/4 time,

387
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,940
the music box is in 4/4,
therefore,

388
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,525
if you play them together,
they sound completely off.

389
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,984
But every fourth measure
of the lullaby

390
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,821
lines up exactly
with the music box.

391
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,115
Yeah, I failed "Do Re Mi" math,

392
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,616
so can we speak English?

393
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,911
The music box is the key to

394
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,414
understanding the code.
Murray said that

395
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,416
the Morse Code following
the dates was just a bunch

396
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,626
of gibberish, but if we only
pay attention to the parts

397
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:33,087
of the code where
the measures of the music box

398
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,672
and the lullaby overlap,

399
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,799
this is what you get.

400
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,300
Coordinates.

401
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,345
Good, good.

402
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,097
Thank you, Lonny.

403
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,516
Thank you.

404
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,103
All right, if the coordinates
are correct,

405
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:52,314
the targets are in Buchanan

406
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,985
and right by

407
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,820
Grand Central Station.

408
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,531
I've messengered that blood
sample to a friend at Columbia.

409
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,074
It's going to take
a few days to analyze,

410
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,076
but she thinks that
Joe could be right.

411
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,787
It's likely we're dealing
with a biological weapon.

412
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,372
If that's the case,
even a small amount

413
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,040
in a crowded area would...

414
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,417
If this is going down tonight,

415
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,877
we're going to need
Murray and Mindy.

416
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,420
And Roxy, too.

417
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,588
- No.
- Joe...

418
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,922
Leave her out of this.

419
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,757
Joe, go get her, come on.

420
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,551
Come on.

421
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,428
She may be done with The Hunt.

422
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,555
But The Hunt
isn't done with her.

423
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,225
It's an order...
you want me to say it?

424
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,562
I'll deal with Mindy and Murray,
all right?

425
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,606
Yes.

426
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,779
Hey, wait.

427
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:44,783
Why, uh, why weren't you
in the story?

428
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,369
What? What story?

429
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,456
My safta used to tell me
a story when I was a kid.

430
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,458
It was The Princess
&amp; The Green Knight.

431
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,251
It was her way of telling me
how she survived the war,

432
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,669
how she met my grandfather.

433
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,172
But you... you weren't
mentioned in it.

434
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,675
This guy was.

435
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,302
This guy.

436
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,387
- Yeah...
- Nathaniel Heidelbaum.

437
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,223
- Yes.
- All right? He was one of the G.I.s

438
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,226
- at the DP camp.
- Yes, he was very good to her.

439
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,269
And to us.

440
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,105
- He was.
- He wasn't my grandfather, was he?

441
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,900
No.

442
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,944
No. No.

443
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,991
That's because you are.

444
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,451
Am I right?

445
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,913
Come on, tell me.
Tell me, please.

446
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,752
Y-Yes. Yes, uh...

447
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,511
- I am.
- Why? Why? Why?

448
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,638
- Why what?
- Why-why d-didn't you want me

449
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,682
to know who my grandfather was?

450
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,101
Why was it better for me
to not know that you existed?

451
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,561
Why lie to me?

452
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,230
No, no, no, no, no.
She didn't lie to you.

453
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:59,191
She lied for you.

454
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,610
There's a difference.

455
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,238
She was protecting you.

456
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,368
A lie, sometimes,
is a very unselfish act.

457
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,078
- Sometimes we tell...
- Sir.

458
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,706
- What?
- The FBI is here.

459
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,133
Put your fucking gun down now!

460
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,595
Stop! Stop! Stop.

461
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,724
Please.

462
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,271
Now...

463
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,650
...what can I help you with?

464
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:44,695
I have a warrant
to search the premises.

465
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,904
Right.

466
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:49,992
Baruch haba.

467
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:52,161
Fan out, upstairs.

468
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,413
You're with me.

469
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,749
I was really hoping I wouldn't
see you here, Jonah.

470
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,467
And where does this go?

471
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,719
- The attic.
- Oh, what's in the attic?

472
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,680
Ghosts.

473
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,807
Show me some ghosts.

474
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,947
It's, uh...
no, it's to your left.

475
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,991
Here.

476
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:50,177
Like I said, there's nothing
of interest in here.

477
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:53,055
Looks like there
was a fire in here.

478
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,848
And a recent one, too.

479
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,726
Yes, there was a,
uh...

480
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,229
what is a... oil lamp... fell.

481
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,231
Poof.

482
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,566
Led to fire...

483
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,989
But clumsiness, that's not a
crime, is it, uh, Agent Morris?

484
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,334
Meyer Offerman,

485
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,628
you're under arrest
for the murder of Heinz Richter.

486
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,213
- Hey, hey... No. No, no.
- You have the right to remain silent.

487
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:27,673
- You can't fucking do this.
- Anything you say can and will

488
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,258
- be used against you...
- You have no right...

489
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,760
- Jonah... Jonah, please.
- He's telling the truth.

490
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,595
- Excuse us, Jonah.
- No. They have no right to do this.

491
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,222
- See to your business.
- Excuse us.

492
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,641
How is this legal?
How is this fucking legal?

493
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,686
Excuse us, Jonah.

494
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:43,647
This is fucking bullshit.

495
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,109
I said no more
disturbances today.

496
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,694
There's a reporter on the line.

497
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,529
A Josie Parker
from The Washington Post.

498
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,948
Something about Biff Simpson.

499
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,201
Put it through.

500
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,544
- Katarina Low.
- This is Josie Parker from The Post.

501
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,837
We're doing a story
about Biff Simpson...

502
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,839
I see.

503
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:12,843
Uh, n-no, in-in that case,
uh, my official statement

504
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,345
is, uh,
Biff Simpson is a patriot.

505
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,806
And we at Schidler Corp.
are grateful for his service

506
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,600
and proud to call him friend.

507
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,602
No, that's all I have to say.

508
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,562
Thank you.

509
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,240
862. Yeah, we have a problem.

510
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,867
Uh, let me rephrase.

511
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,203
Simpson's got one.

512
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,714
Who are you? Why am I here?

513
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,549
Huh?

514
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,886
Huh? W-Who the hell
are you people?

515
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,930
Huh?

516
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,226
Your name...

517
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,104
Your name is Moritz Ehrlich.

518
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,733
You were the Kommandant

519
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:13,237
sorting new arrivals
at Auschwitz-Birkenau

520
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:18,408
on the morning
of 18th March, 1943.

521
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,496
You leveled your Luger
at a boy that day.

522
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,748
Shot him point-blank.

523
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,375
No. No!

524
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,836
Yeah, you tore him
from the arms of his father

525
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,587
and you shot him dead.

526
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,508
That boy, he was our son.

527
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,761
He cried so much...

528
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,139
I'm not the man
who did this to your child.

529
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,519
I saw it...

530
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,982
With my own eyes.

531
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:58,073
My eyes.

532
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,951
I am the witness.

533
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,379
Well, tell me you remember.

534
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,257
I don't. It wasn't me.

535
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:18,677
His name...

536
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,098
was Aaron Efraim Markowitz.

537
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,519
He loved riding on the horses

538
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,689
with his cousins from Lublin.

539
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,691
And watercolors.

540
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,903
He loved watercolors.

541
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,531
And music. Klezmer music.

542
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,409
And he liked to read...
loved to read.

543
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,662
Especially the stories...

544
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,168
...the stories about
the Seven Wonders of the World.

545
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,588
He loved that.

546
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,091
Did you know that
when you pulled the trigger?

547
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,053
- Nein.
- Nein.

548
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,222
He was a human being

549
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,976
w-with hopes

550
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:13,440
and dreams
and love in his heart.

551
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,194
And you can't even remember

552
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,280
firing the shot.

553
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:23,533
No... No, it's not true...

554
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,369
No, no, no. Mindy. Mindy.

555
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,954
He doesn't deserve to...
doesn't deserve,

556
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,206
doesn't deserve
to know our pain.

557
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,749
Doesn't deserve it.

558
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,877
Finish it already, Murray.
Finish!

559
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,844
Wait.

560
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,262
Don't shoot.

561
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,807
I remember now. Please.

562
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,016
Please.

563
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:51,728
He was auburn-haired boy

564
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,232
with a cherubic face
and a little scar on his chin.

565
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,652
- Shoot, Murray.
- I remember.

566
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,320
We couldn't tear him away.

567
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:04,616
Four guards tried,
but you wouldn't let us.

568
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:09,329
You held him long past
the moment of his death.

569
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:14,584
Please.

570
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,800
I can't do it. I can't...

571
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:25,012
Why?

572
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,764
Uh, no, no, no.

573
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,850
- Please. Please.
- Mindy.

574
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,060
Murray, please.

575
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,605
No,
stop. You don't have to do this.

576
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,651
Mindy! Murray!

577
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,739
Hello?!

578
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,409
Open up. It's Jonah.

579
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:50,412
- Wait. Be careful. Careful.
- Mindy.

580
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,830
- Careful.
- Murray.

581
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,833
- Come on.
- That's Jonah?

582
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,543
- Careful. - What's going on?
- The feds.

583
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,045
The feds, they got Meyer.

584
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,796
Someone tried
to burn down the Ark.

585
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,173
- Shit's going down.
- Just, just, just...

586
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,591
- Tonight.
- slow down.

587
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,468
- Start over.
- Listen, uh, I cracked the code.

588
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:08,096
The Nazis, all right,
they're going to release

589
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,515
a biological weapon
in the city tonight.

590
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,517
I-I'll get my tools.

591
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,519
Come on, we got to go.

592
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,150
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

593
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,152
Uh...

594
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,196
Yeah.

595
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,372
How you doing, Rox?

596
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,836
Hi.

597
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,840
You're little.

598
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,761
Wasn't picturing her so little.

599
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,387
Sweetie, why don't
you head on in?

600
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,641
Mommy is right behind you. Okay?

601
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,772
What are you doing here, Joe?

602
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:00,857
Now, I made myself pretty clear.
I'm out.

603
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,859
They got
a biological weapon, Rox.

604
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,278
That's what it's all been about.

605
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,572
The radios, the Red Books.

606
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,950
- Meyer asked me to come to you...
- Joe.

607
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,869
I'm not going back.

608
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,288
I'm not asking you to.

609
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm here to tell you
that it's going down tonight.

610
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:25,006
You need to take your
little girl, leave the city.

611
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,307
Hey, Joe.

612
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,146
Thank you.

613
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:55,537
At first, Gretel Fischer

614
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,914
looked like she slipped
in the shower.

615
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,750
Until I figured out
she was gassed.

616
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,752
And her brother, Hans.

617
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,421
Died in a car crash,
but not before

618
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,089
someone ripped out his teeth.

619
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:11,178
And after them,
came Heinz Richter.

620
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,889
This one's a little sloppier,

621
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,015
almost as if
a teenager did it.

622
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,477
You take
his training wheels off?

623
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,356
You show him the ropes
of Murder 101?

624
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,194
Leave the boy out of this.

625
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,030
Why? You're
the one that jammed him up.

626
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,616
You bailed him out of jail,
took him in.

627
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,452
I think you taught him
how to kill, too.

628
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,663
You know, Jonah wanted revenge
for his grandmother's death,

629
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,583
and you showed him the way,
didn't you?

630
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,755
This is Gretel Fischer's
employment file.

631
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,798
And don't bother saying
that they're not yours

632
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,217
'cause our lab's already
comparing the prints.

633
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,635
This...?

634
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,428
Well, this sure as shit
ain't conjecture.

635
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,013
So let's stop fucking
with the undercard

636
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,556
and get to the main event.

637
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,225
For the sake of your career,

638
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,311
I suggest you set me free now.

639
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,813
Well, for the sake of your
old ass not dying in jail,

640
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,899
I suggest you start talking.

641
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,072
Dottie?

642
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,119
You will not believe
the day I had.

643
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:21,748
Why is it that every time
a woman takes a man's job,

644
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,417
she has to rub our noses in it?

645
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,176
Dottie.

646
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,263
Oh, no.

647
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,766
D...

648
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,627
Fuck your face.

649
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,046
Fuck
your face.

650
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,924
Fuck. Fuck.

651
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:16,344
Fuck your face! Fuck!

652
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:35,655
These documents are yours.

653
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,657
Now I have them.

654
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,618
So who sent them to me, Meyer?
Who wanted to see you go down?

655
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,829
Let's pretend for a moment

656
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,665
that all this nonsense
you're talking about is true.

657
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,667
Sure.

658
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,462
If I was really doing
what you're suggesting...

659
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,005
You are.

660
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:56,885
...who do you think
my enemies are?

661
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,348
Exactly.

662
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:06,186
And if, hypothetically,
those were my enemies,

663
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,355
wouldn't they want you
to have these documents?

664
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,857
So you could hold me here,

665
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,401
like you're doing right now,

666
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,529
while Nazis run amok.

667
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,742
When you interviewed the boy
at my home,

668
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:24,996
you told him he could still
choose to do the right thing.

669
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,164
I did.

670
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,541
And what about you?

671
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,211
Do you think you're choosing
the right thing now?

672
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,673
I do. It looks that way.
I'm not the one in handcuffs.

673
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,307
Look, all I'm saying is
it's the FBI.

674
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,850
Maybe we should be worried.

675
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,560
Meyer has been
in more difficult situations.

676
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,562
I'm talking
about the feds here.

677
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:53,233
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Uch, you have a funny way of showing gratitude.

678
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,735
You hear me?
You hear me, you little mamzer?

679
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,571
Meyer took you in
when you were in need.

680
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,907
All right, better late
than never, huh?

681
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:01,991
You know,
and please don't tell me

682
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,368
that you didn't know
about him and my safta.

683
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,203
Because you tried to tell me
that one day

684
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,663
when I came to your place.

685
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,499
That he bailed on the woman
that he loved.

686
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,377
Left her alone to raise
their kid.

687
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,962
And when that kid died,
giving birth to me,

688
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,338
he stayed gone.

689
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,217
That whole fucking time,
my safta and I, we struggled,

690
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:21,928
he stayed gone.
So, sorry if I'm not

691
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,014
doing cartwheels
over finally meeting Grandpa.

692
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,017
'Cause fuck him.

693
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,687
Ever stop to think that
maybe that's what she wanted?

694
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,981
For Meyer to stay gone?

695
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,190
All I'm saying is,

696
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,859
you may think
you've got Meyer figured,

697
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,694
soup to nuts, but...

698
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,363
you can never really
know a person.

699
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,449
We wear different faces
to protect each other.

700
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,205
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

701
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,334
It's him.
It's the, it's the guy

702
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,586
who killed Booty.
He's heading towards the train.

703
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:57,380
- Lonny, do you see him?
- Where?

704
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,548
I, I don't, I don't have him.

705
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,885
- The subway, dammit!
- Hey!

706
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,262
Wait!

707
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,555
Fuck a duck!

708
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,696
These are the
coordinates. A utility plant?

709
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:27,076
What the hell do you
do with a virus at a power plant?

710
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,786
Let's split up and find out.

711
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,019
Downtown express train,
wonder where he's headed.

712
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,866
Hold the
doors! Hold the doors!

713
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,979
Una had a
bag like that at The Ghost's house.

714
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,272
Are you sure?

715
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,315
Hey! Hey! Hey!

716
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,612
Shit, we got to go!

717
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,824
Fuck!

718
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,077
Shit! He's getting away!
What the fuck do we do?

719
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:56,624
We have Lonny, you beautiful
mustached motherfucker.

720
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,134
Where's his bag?
Where's his bag?

721
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:12,140
You didn't bring me here
to charge me with those murders,

722
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,392
- did you?
- Why else would I have brought you here?

723
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:17,562
Because you're lost at sea.

724
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,814
So you parade me down here,

725
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,567
put on a whole production.

726
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:25,445
The handcuffs, oh.
Nice touch.

727
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:29,240
You're forcing me to spout
some nonsense

728
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:33,036
that makes your boss...
who is behind that mirror...

729
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,246
makes him finally
take you seriously.

730
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:36,331
Is that it?

731
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,916
Agent Morris?

732
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,431
Ah.

733
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,810
This is Gretel Fischer's
INS file.

734
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:01,189
And this paper clip mark
in the corner means that

735
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,565
there was another file attached.

736
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,776
One that laid out
all of her dirty,

737
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,611
swastika-embroidered laundry.

738
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:09,906
And you knew that.
Didn't you?

739
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,743
So we both know there are Nazis
here in America.

740
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,912
And I found them
by following this trail

741
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,163
of corpses that led to you.

742
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,790
But I promise you,

743
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,542
you don't have enough life left
in your old man body

744
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,961
to go out and murder
all the ones still out there

745
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,547
drinking Budweiser
and eating sloppy joes.

746
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,007
'Cause this thing is bigger

747
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,093
than a few old-timers
hiding out in the burbs.

748
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,803
And this paper clip mark proves

749
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,096
that the government was the one

750
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,431
who moved the Nazis in
next door.

751
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,436
I'm building a case,

752
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,064
and I want your help.

753
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,693
Tell me how you found them.

754
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,320
You're right.

755
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:54,158
This is bigger
than anyone realizes.

756
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,869
They're here.

757
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,496
They are among us.

758
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:01,833
They are communicating
with each other.

759
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,252
And they have plans

760
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,255
to attack New York City

761
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,090
- tonight.
- Tonight.

762
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:12,427
Tonight. Which is why
you have to release me.

763
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,553
You have to release me now.

764
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,554
- Tonight.
- Right now!

765
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,431
That is not convenient at all,

766
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,474
is it?
Will the bogeyman be there, too?

767
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,310
Hmm. You know,

768
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,396
I really thought
that you would be able

769
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,314
- to see the big picture.
- Yes.

770
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,734
Maybe a night in lockup
will help you get smart.

771
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,194
Remember one thing.

772
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,738
- What is that?
- The blood spilled tonight

773
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,406
is gonna be on your hands.

774
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,116
On your hands!

775
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,567
Drop your weapon.

776
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:25,708
No, no, no, no, no.

777
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,462
No, no, no, no, no. Mister,

778
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,088
don't, don't, don't.
Don't touch... Don't touch it.

779
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,298
- Don't touch it. Let go.
- Hey, I found it first.

780
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,966
- I know.
- Hey, hey, listen, listen.

781
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,259
- You want some money? You want ten bucks?
- What are you doing?

782
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,344
- Ten bucks?
- Look,

783
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,221
down here, see? Scram.

784
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,097
That's bullshit.

785
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,682
- Rats.
- Are you crazy?

786
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,560
You never take cash
out of your pocket in a subway.

787
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,022
Shit.

788
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:50,817
Maybe we're gonna get lucky

789
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,318
and this is not gonna be...

790
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,279
No, it's a bomb.

791
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,462
Who the fuck are you?

792
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:14,090
Part of that tribe
hoping to stop us?

793
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,342
Such fools.

794
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,344
We won't be stopped.

795
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:21,472
Not by a kike or a Jap

796
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:24,392
or anyone else, for that matter.

797
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:27,436
You will never stop
Father's work.

798
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,026
Shalom, motherfucker.

799
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,705
What? No thank-you hug?

800
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,708
Okay, so...

801
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,502
Electronic detonator,

802
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,380
and we have dummy wires,

803
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:57,800
and, uh,
there are redundancies, too.

804
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,094
Wait, wait. What does that...
What does that mean?

805
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:02,847
- What does that mean?
- It means that if I cut the wrong wire,

806
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:05,474
then we're all gonna be having
a seder with the dead.

807
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,185
All right. You said The Ghost

808
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,813
was working
on biological weapons,

809
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,023
- right?
- Uh-huh.

810
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,859
No, this is just, uh...

811
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,861
It's just a regular...

812
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:23,618
...explosive. Hmm.

813
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,626
Yeah, listen, boychick,
uh, do me a favor.

814
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,210
All right? I want you to take

815
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,588
all these people here,
get them out of this car,

816
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,590
all the way to the back
of the train.

817
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,966
Wait, wait. What about you?

818
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:41,344
I'm gonna defuse the bomb
and be a hero,

819
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,638
- that's what I'm gonna do.
- No. No, no, fuck that.

820
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:45,306
Not "fuck that." No, no, no.

821
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:47,892
I'm gonna get the glory.
I'm gonna get the broads.

822
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:49,894
- You're gonna get out.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

823
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,270
I'm not doing that.
I'm not leaving you.

824
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,397
Listen to me right now,
you hear me?

825
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,774
You take everybody now,

826
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,401
and you get them
out of the car, you hear?

827
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,570
- Gam zu I'tovah.
- Fuck that. I'm not leaving you.

828
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,822
This, too,
is for the good, Aaron.

829
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,866
Get out.

830
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:06,786
Go!

831
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,496
Okay, listen up!

832
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,997
Come on!

833
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,541
Let's go. Come on. I'm not gonna
take your... No, no, no, no, no!

834
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,168
Go this way. This way.

835
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,212
Go! I'm not gonna take
your fucking money. Just go.

836
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,797
Keep moving,

837
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,173
or I'll fucking blow a hole
through your head.

838
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:20,800
- Go! Keep fucking moving!
- Hmm.

839
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,218
Get out of here!

840
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,512
Next fucking car! Come on!

841
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,602
Hey, you're Lonny Flash!

842
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,771
It's not all
it's cracked up to be, pal.

843
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:43,572
Move it! Next fucking car!

844
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,616
Come on! Go, go, go!

845
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,660
Come on, hustle!
Come on, go, go, go!

846
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,253
I said keep fucking moving!

847
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,713
Go! Go! Go!

848
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,626
Thank you, lord.

849
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,314
Can you... C-Can you see...

850
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,316
What's your next move?

851
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,360
Let him sit. Sooner or later,
he'll say something.

852
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,696
What the hell
are you doing in there?!

853
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:06,947
What in the damn hell?

854
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:08,949
What was that?

855
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,534
What was that there?!

856
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,079
What is going on?
You know what's going on!

857
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,330
Let me out, please!

858
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,802
- Oh, hell, no, man.
- Get the fuck out of the way.

859
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,888
All right, already!

860
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,980
Bullets on Mars, right?

861
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,149
Underrated flick.

862
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,958
There's a citywide blackout.

863
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,668
Unacceptable.
My company's been waiting

864
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,628
- on this shipment for weeks.
- Lady, I told you.

865
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,256
I got to shut this place down.
Emergency protocol.

866
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,383
Well, I'm not leaving
without it.

867
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,718
Stay there until
the lights come back on, guys.

868
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,096
Help them move. Help them move!

869
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:14,598
Don't give them access
unless they got credentials.

870
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,851
No, you see, this cargo
still needs to be inspected

871
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,562
and tested by Customs.

872
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,981
Hope you brought a sleeping bag.

873
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,691
$15 million.

874
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,401
That's how much
they'll sue you for.

875
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,111
Every day the shipment's delayed

876
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:30,281
costs my company $345,000
in profits,

877
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:32,825
which is peanuts
compared to the downstream costs

878
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,827
our 64 corporate clients
are facing.

879
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:36,453
Who do you think
I'm gonna point them to

880
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,746
when they come to collect?

881
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,624
So, no,
I didn't bring a sleeping bag

882
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,084
because I'm leaving,

883
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,461
and I'm taking
my goddamn cargo with me.

884
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,130
Are the trucks loaded?

885
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:47,882
We're ready to go.

886
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,008
Let's roll.

887
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:52,344
Put the decals on
and you'll fly through.

888
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,554
Don't stop for anything.

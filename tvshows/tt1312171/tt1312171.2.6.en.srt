00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,541
I'm your only option.

160
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,837
[scoffs softly] Not yet you aren't.

161
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,717
[Luther, mouth full]
Diego, this is a setup.

162
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,136
[Diego] Maybe. But we should go anyway.

163
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,014
Says the guy
who's already been stabbed once this week.

164
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,558
Oh, don't worry,
me and him are gonna have words.

165
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,770
- Would you tell him that he's nuts?
- I think we should go.

166
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,732
- See?
- Vanya, of all people,

167
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,151
you should hate Dad the most.

168
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,278
Come on, can he really be that bad?

169
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,072
Okay, well, let's see.

170
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,908
He isolated you
from the rest of the family.

171
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,159
Kept you hopped up on pills.

172
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,454
And he brainwashed you into thinking
you had no powers.

173
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,874
- Jesus, this guy...
- Yeah.

174
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,377
I mean, come on, I <i>have</i> to meet him.

175
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,296
<i>You</i> already know how this is gonna go.

176
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,715
Dad is gonna play
all his little mind games on us,

177
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,050
get into our heads,

178
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,178
and he's gonna turn us all
against each other. You watch.

179
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,763
Luther, we're not 12 anymore.

180
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,848
All right? We're grown-ass men.

181
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,766
And women.

182
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,893
- Hey.
- [sighs]

183
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,061
Hey.

184
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,105
We can handle him.

185
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,899
- Wanna know what's different this time?
- What's that?

186
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,067
You got me.

187
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,612
We go in there as a united front.

188
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,198
No more "Number One,"
"Number Two" bullshit.

189
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,783
From now on, it's...

190
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,744
Team Zero.

191
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,288
"Team Zero"?

192
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,124
Team Zero.

193
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,836
All the way.

194
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,764
[exhales slowly]

195
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,099
[Ben] This is a mistake.

196
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,268
Don't mess with my flow.

197
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,645
You can't just go out there
and tell them the world is gonna end.

198
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,814
You know what can happen to cults
when things go sideways.

199
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,399
First of all, it's not a cult.

200
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,568
All right? And second of all,

201
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,236
relax, all right?

202
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,780
I'll make sure there's no Kool-Aid
in the house. [chuckles]

203
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,700
[Ben] Oh, what are you gonna say?
"Prepare to die"?

204
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,911
- They deserve a better explanation, Klaus.
- What, better than the truth?

205
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,372
Listen, this whole thing started
by accident,

206
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,374
and it was fun helping people for a while.

207
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,752
Oh, this whole thing started
because you're a narcissist.

208
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,588
- Oh, is that right? [groans]
- Isn't an altruistic bone in your body.

209
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,757
If the world's gonna end, Ben,

210
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,842
these people should go back
to their families.

211
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,511
Most of them don't have families
to go back to.

212
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,889
Jill gave up an Albright scholarship
to Berkeley

213
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,182
to follow you around the world.

214
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,643
- Her parents won't even talk to her.
- Jill...

215
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,729
Jill... Oh, that's the, um...

216
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,565
[clicks tongue] ...the Dutch girl
with the lazy eye, right?

217
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,608
No.

218
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,444
- Brown skin, glasses.
- [Klaus grunts softly]

219
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,656
Almond-shaped eyes you get lost in.

220
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,787
She gave up her entire future for <i>you.</i>

221
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,207
Maybe she freed herself from the prison
of the American education system

222
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,169
and decided instead to come and learn
from the school of life.

223
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,421
- Clever girl, I say.
- Klaus, these are real people.

224
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,422
They're not just...

225
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,718
scarves you can try on and toss out
whenever you feel like.

226
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,761
You owe them.

227
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,390
You know,
it's a teensy-weensy bit frustrating

228
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,937
when you seem to always want
exactly the opposite of what I want.

229
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,231
[inhales deeply]

230
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,401
[exhales slowly]

231
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,444
All right, fine.

232
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,571
Thank you.

233
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,241
- [followers murmuring]
- [New Age music plays softly]

234
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,704
Great, cool.

235
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,081
Thank you.

236
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,879
[Klaus] Okay, thank you. Sit down.

237
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,011
My name is Klaus,
and I am an alcoho...

238
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,722
Sorry, that's the wrong meeting.

239
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,474
[chuckles, sighs]

240
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,559
Uh...

241
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,269
[clicks tongue]

242
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,148
In my walkabout,
I did a lot of thinking...

243
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,483
searching, ruminating,

244
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,986
and there's something
that I'd like to share

245
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,404
with all of you.

246
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,242
I'm a fraud.

247
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,749
Yeah, I... I've been lying to all of you
from... from the start, and, uh...

248
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,711
I'm a complete and total fraud.

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,840
[followers murmuring softly]

250
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,216
Me too.

251
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,511
I... I'm a fraud too.

252
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,597
- Uh...
- [Keechie] I'm the worst kind of fraud.

253
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,932
I... I am a fraud to myself.

254
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,726
But your scriptures say,

255
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,188
"As long as I know how to love...

256
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,399
I know I'll stay alive."

257
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,485
- I...
- That's... Ta-ta-ta-ta. But...

258
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,612
But that's not scripture.

259
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,783
Okay? That's a song lyric
by disco diva Gloria Gaynor,

260
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,367
and I stole it!

261
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,870
- Gloria Gaynor?
- [followers murmur] Gloria Gaynor...?

262
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,289
Look, eh, you guys don't wanna follow me.

263
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,957
I can't lead you anywhere.

264
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,251
I'm not a guru, I'm not a messiah,

265
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,546
- I'm... I'm a... fraud!
- [murmuring continues]

266
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,465
[Klaus] And I don't know
what I'm doing up here.

267
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,592
I... I don't. I'm just, you know...

268
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,053
- making it up as we...
- [inaudible whispers]

269
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,972
You... You people should all just...

270
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,725
go back to your families.

271
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,520
[low murmurs continue]

272
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,815
[Keechie whimpering, sobbing]

273
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,943
- Keechie...
- [Keechie moans softly]

274
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,110
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

275
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,988
Look, look, look at me in the face, okay?
It's okay.

276
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,199
It's okay, though. Listen.

277
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,702
Everything is gonna be okay.

278
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,037
Okay?

279
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,831
I understand.

280
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,499
Good.

281
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,254
When we admit our own fraudulence,

282
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,508
only then can we experience true humility.

283
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,844
No, no, no, no, no, no!

284
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,137
That's <i>not </i>what I meant.

285
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,765
- It's not what I meant.
- I too am a fraud.

286
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,435
- I am a fraud.
- I too am a fraud!

287
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,688
[voices overlapping] I am a fraud!

288
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,650
I am a fraud! A fraud.

289
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,695
[overlapping declarations continue]

290
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,489
[Klaus chuckles] Okay.

291
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,532
Well...

292
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,702
[scoffing] Dude, I tried.

293
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,829
[Keechie] I am a fraud.

294
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,084
So there was a <i>Black</i> president?

295
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,879
- [Allison] We've been through this.
- Like, "Black" Black.

296
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,215
- In the White House?
- Yes.

297
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,633
[Ray chuckles]

298
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,760
And <i>you</i> have...

299
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,221
Powers, yes.

300
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,515
For the 17th time.

301
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,851
Why are you telling me this now?

302
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,936
Because we might not...

303
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,564
[Allison sighs]

304
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,818
Because you deserve to know the truth.

305
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,030
Then prove it.

306
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,408
- Excuse me?
- [Ray] You heard me.

307
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,118
Prove it.

308
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,079
Okay, it is not just some parlor trick.
There is a cost.

309
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,166
Okay, so Wonder Woman's got powers,
but nobody can see 'em?

310
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,751
How convenient.

311
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,007
[horn honks]

312
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,092
[door bell jingles]

313
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,809
[Allison] Excuse me...

314
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,687
my husband would like to try on this suit.

315
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,316
Colored folks can't try on
the merchandise,

316
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,902
- but if you'd like to make a purchase...
- I heard a rumor

317
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,237

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,508
- Hey, Pop. How's it hangin'?
- "Dad."

632
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,928
My reconnaissance tells me
you're not CIA,

633
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,014
not KGB, <i>certainly</i> not MI5, so...

634
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,100
who are you?

635
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,563
We're your children.

636
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,148
We're from the future.

637
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:04,112
In 1989, you adopted us all and trained us
to fight against the end of the world.

638
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,365
Called us the Umbrella Academy.

639
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,035
- Why on earth would I adopt six...
- [Allison] Seven.

640
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,288
- One of us isn't here.
- Dead.

641
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,123
One of us is dead.

642
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,000
Dead, yes, but I'm here. Klaus!

643
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,877
- Yeah, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
- Tell them I'm here.

644
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,836
Enough of that now.

645
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,674
Regardless,

646
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:29,137
what would possess me to adopt
seven ill-mannered malcontents?

647
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,555
We all have special abilities.

648
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,849
Special? In what sense?

649
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,976
In the superpower sense.

650
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,561
Called me old-fashioned,

651
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,398
but I'm a stickler
for a pesky little thing called evidence.

652
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,066
Show me.

653
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,360
Everybody wants to see powers
all of a sudden. [scoffs]

654
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,653
We're not circus animals, okay?

655
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,697
We're not gonna bounce balls on our noses

656
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,575
and clap our hands like seals
for your amusement.

657
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,454
[loud metallic thud]

658
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,374
What are you writing?

659
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,543
You are zero for two, young man.

660
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,544
[Allison sputters]

661
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,130
[whispers] Stop!

662
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,506
Now that is interesting.

663
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,758
All right, uh, quick rundown.

664
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,092
Luther: super strength.

665
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,719
Klaus can commune with the dead.

666
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,888
Allison can rumor anyone to do anything.

667
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,181
Except she never uses it.

668
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,393
I heard a rumor
you punched yourself in the face.

669
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,812
Aah! [groans]

670
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,231
Damn it!

671
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,816
[slurping]

672
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,943
And you?

673
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,904
Uh, maybe we don't take Vanya
for a test run.

674
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,073
Oh, yeah, that's probably not a good idea.

675
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,824
- Yeah.
- It's fine.

676
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,786
- I can handle it.
- Handle it?

677
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,288
Last time you handled it,
you definitely blew up the moon.

678
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,247
No, Vanya, don't!

679
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,333
[overlapping protests]

680
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,710
[high-pitched tone resonating]

681
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,259
[overlapping sighs]

682
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,804
[Klaus] This is my favorite shirt. Wow.

683
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,639
Oops.

684
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,058
That was impressive.

685
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,898
Look, we know that you're involved
in a plot to assassinate the president.

686
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,943
You were recently hospitalized,
isn't that correct?

687
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,531
You still appear to be suffering from
delusions of grandeur and acute paranoia.

688
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,241
Am I?

689
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,702
Explain this.

690
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,871
That's you.

691
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,207
That's two days from now
on the grassy knoll

692
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,793
at the exact spot the president's
gonna get shot.

693
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,715
Well...

694
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,593
I suppose you've solved it.

695
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,682
You've single-handedly unearthed
my nefarious plot.

696
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,893
Is that what you want to hear?

697
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,188
You fancy yourself a do-gooder?

698
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,191
The last good man who will save us
from our descent

699
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,235
into corruption and conspiracy?

700
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,155
This is a fantastic delusion.

701
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,199
The sad reality is that
you're a desperate man,

702
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,577
tragically unaware
of his own insignificance,

703
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,247
desperately clinging
to his own ineffectual reasoning.

704
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,707
More succinctly,

705
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,084
a man in over his head.

706
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,006
[stuttering] You're wr... wrong.

707
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,265
[Five] Look, forget about the president.

708
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,143
We have a catastrophic war coming
in five days.

709
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,270
We need to figure out how to stop it.

710
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,271
War?

711
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,357
Men will always be at war with each other.

712
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,693
No, this isn't just some war.

713
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,361
I'm talking about a doomsday.

714
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,363
The end of the world.

715
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,491
Well...

716
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,035
you're the special ones, aren't you?

717
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,707
Why don't you band together
and do something about it?

718
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,169
All right. Screw it.

719
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,046
[Klaus grunts]

720
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,634
- [choked gasps]
- [Allison] Is he having a seizure?

721
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,094
Overdosing probably.

722
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,846
- Should we do something?
- [shuddering grunts]

723
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,889
[whispers] Klaus!

724
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,517
Now is not the time. What are you doing?

725
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,435
[distorted gurgling]

726
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,394
I'm...

727
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,356
- Out with it, boy.
- [gasping]

728
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,357
[Ben] ...Ben!

729
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,025
[gasping]

730
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,986
[panting]

731
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,281
[Klaus shuddering]

732
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,324
Well...

733
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,702
thank you for coming.

734
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,997
- I've seen about enough.
- No, I...

735
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,000
- [loud impact]
- [dishes clinking]

736
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,503
- [buttons clattering]
- Look at what you did to me.

737
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,005
Look at it!

738
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,091
Oh, shit. Why?

739
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:39,971
You in the culottes.

740
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,015
A word, in private?

741
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,481
Check, please.

742
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,108
[elevator doors close, elevator dings]

743
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,821
Well, that went as well
as any Hargreeves family function.

744
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,657
[sighing] I feel so violated.

745
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,368
I need an herbal bath.

746
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,455
You had no right to possess me.

747
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,876
[Ben] Oh, possession is a strong word.
I'd like to say "borrowed you."

748
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,252
Temporarily.

749
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,005
- Congratulations.
- For what?

750
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,550
I <i>think</i> that's the first time
you've ever stood up to Dad.

751
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,386
- [Luther] Hmm.
- Are you okay?

752
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,098
So much for having my back in there.

753
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,142
Team Zero, my ass.

754
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,227
[elevator dings]

755
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,531
Klaus.

756
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,492
- [Luther sighs heavily]
- [groans] Just leave me.

757
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,745
[whimpering] Just leave me.

758
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,677
You again? Why are you followin' us?

759
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,472
I just wanna show you something.

760
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,143
How did you find me?

761
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,480
This came for you at the farm.

762
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,442
Can we go somewhere?

763
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,111
Private?

764
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,954
What is this?

765
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,040
[Diego] Your boyfriend isn't the nice guy
you think he is.

766
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,000
Him and his nasty little squad
of lizard people

767
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,503
are planning to kill Kennedy
the day after tomorrow.

768
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,755
I don't understand.

769
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,299
He is going to kill the president.

770
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,385
That's ridiculous.

771
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,844
He would never hurt anyone.

772
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,930
[Diego] What do you think
he's doing here in Dallas?

773
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,975
What do you think that meeting
at the consulate was all about?

774
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,060
It is a conspiracy.

775
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,979
We have to stop him.

776
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,151
You're mistaken.

777
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,071
[Diego] Don't take my word for it.

778
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,781
Ask him yourself.

779
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,827
[retreating footsteps]

780
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,710
You seem to be the sensible one
of the bunch.

781
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,587
- [island music plays over speakers]
- That's because I'm the oldest.

782
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,173
You know, technically,
I'm older than you right now.

783
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,384
Cognac?

784
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,636
Just a smidge.

785
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,889
[Reginald] The other night
you quoted Homer at me.

786
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,932
Why?

787
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,476
You forced us all to learn it as kids.

788
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,937
In the original Greek, no less.

789
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,065
[island music continues softly]

790
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,696
[Five] Mmm.

791
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,951
This world ends in five days
if we don't get out of the timeline.

792
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,202
Worlds end.

- I botched it.
- How?

807
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,361
I jumped too far forward,

808

in an apocalypse.

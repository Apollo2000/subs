2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,732
Vanya's in the room
at the end of the hall.

3
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,526
- How do you propose we get to her?
- I haven't figured that one out yet.

4
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,403
- You can count me out.
- Klaus!

5
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,448
What? You guys should save her.
You're great at all the hero shit.

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,659
- Oh, Klaus!
- Listen, listen. Vanya would understand

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,829
'cause she has realistic expectations
of what I am.

8
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,498
And what I am is sexy trash.

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,626
- You're a big pussy, that's what you are.
- Guys, now is <i>not</i> the time.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,920
Why? Because I don't wanna die? Who does?

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,299
And martyrs aren't around
to enjoy the victory party

12
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,508
'cause they're dead!

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,635
- You are going out there...
- I'm not! Go away!

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,762
Or I'm gonna beat you,

15
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,555
- and not the way you like it!
<i>- That's</i> my cue.

16
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,348
- Hey! Allison!
- No! Allison!

17
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,147
Vanya!

18
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,775
Vanya!

19
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,293
All right. I'm going.

20
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,878
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

21
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,673
If you don't make it back,
there's one thing that I need to tell you.

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,258
- I don't have time for this.
- Please.

23
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,343
What?

24
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:38,056
You look like
Antonio Banderas with the long hair.

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,391
I just thought you should know.

26
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,103
Thanks, man.

27
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,386
Klaus!

28
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,556
I'm not gonna make it!

29
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,724
It's up to you, buddy!

30
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,309
You gotta save the world!

31
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,188
No, Diego, that's a terrible idea!

32
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,619
Okay, Klaus.

33
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,288
You can do this.

34
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,123
You fought in Vietnam.

35
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,293
You survived a family of <i>seven.</i>

36
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:53,548
And you once wore a sarong
to a fraternity party

37
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,717
and got a shitload of numbers.

38
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,315
{\an8}All right, just be cool

39
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,526
{\an8}till I finish the job on the grassy knoll.

40
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,279
{\an8}We'll get the time math
and I'll ice the squirt.

41
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,031
{\an8}I just wish there was another way,
you know?

42
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,909
{\an8}- There isn't. Look at him.
- What are you looking at?

43
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,911
{\an8}- Look.
- See something funny?

44
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,414
{\an8}Worst case of paradox psychosis
I ever seen.

45
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,083
Eh... What's wrong?

46
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,753
- Well, I... feel bad for him. You know?
- Mind your business!

47
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,214
- Or I'll give you something to stare at.
- He's just a little guy.

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,549
Everybody's a little guy to you.

49
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,884
- You wish you could pull off these shorts!
- You look like King Kong

50
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,594
and the Hitler Youth had a baby.

51
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,932
Luther, I... I don't have time for you
to tuck and squeeze here.

52
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,476
Can I count on you
to keep him under control?

53
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,106
- Yeah, I'll do my best, yeah.
- All right.

54
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,237
Hey, brother. How you doing?

55
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,616
- He's gonna kill me, isn't he?
- What?

56
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,660
What, him?

57
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,120
He's gonna kill you?

58
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,247
Yeah, right. That's ridiculous.

59
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,083
You know, you're a terrible liar, Luther.

60
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,002
You're a worse liar
than you are a spotter.

61
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,420
Okay, whose fault is that?

62
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,881
What good is having a spotter
if you won't even listen to him?

63
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,632
So you admit
you're conspiring against me?

64
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,594
Do... Do you admit that you're suffering
from paradox psychosis?

65
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,806
All I'm suffering from is bracing clarity
about you and your murderous intentions.

66
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,184
Look, it's not like he's gonna
"kill you" kill you.

67
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,977
He just wants to kill a, um...

68
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,564
- version of you.
- But <i>I</i> am that version of me.

69
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,817
Hey, I don't love it, either,
but he's actually got a pretty good plan.

70
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,739
What? The one where you guys off me
and then jump to 2019 to save the world?

71
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,450
Yeah, wait, how did you know that?

72
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,411
Because I'm him,
and that is <i>exactly</i> what I would do

73
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,413
- if I were trying to kill me!
- Okay, all I know is

74
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,581
we've got one Five too many,

75
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,417
- and you're the one acting like a maniac.
- Maniac?

76
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,127
Luther, you have seen nothing.

77
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,963
If you want a maniac,
I will show you maniac.

78
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,633
Okay, as your spotter,

79
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,593
I think the best thing
I can do for you right now

80
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,886
is put you out of your misery.

81
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,304
Okay, Luther, listen.

82
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,350
I know your feeble mind only responds
to age and authority,

83
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,227
so listen very closely.

84
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,855
Yet again,
you are experiencing daddy issues,

85
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:42,485
this time with your own brother,
which honestly is making me a bit crazy.

86
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,736
But remember this:

87
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,072
I'm 14 days older than him.

88
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,658
I have seniority here.

89
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,202
So it is <i>me</i> you should be listening to,
Luther.

90
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,995
I'm the daddy here!

91
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,958
How's it going?

92
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,836
Five, please, you're being unseemly.

93
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,795
Look at you.

94
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,216
I admit there is a possibility
that I may not be in my fully...

95
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,052
- right mind right now.
- Okay, good.

96
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,431
- But whatever I've got, <i>he's</i> got it too.
- What?

97
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,850
You two quit grab-assing. We're here.

98
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,611
Flatulence. Stage four.

99
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,947
See? What's your plan now, bucko?

100
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,411
That was just lunch, all right? Shut up.

101
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,341
Careful.

102
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,595
I want that hem straight enough
to cut throats.

103
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,599
Hmm.

104
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,687
Nice frock.

105
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,732
Is this a swearing in
or a... a coronation?

106
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,233
How's your new hire working out?

107
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,445
I heard he lasted all of ten minutes
in orientation

108
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,155
before he started running amok.

109
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,198
Oh, you know boys.

110
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,534
He's probably around here somewhere
eating a... a very large sandwich.

111
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,244
Mm-hmm. Herb!

112
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,083
Tell Lila what you told me.

113
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,129
I, uh, didn't actually offer it up.

114
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,340
You put a knife to my throat.

115
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,257
Go on.

116
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,719
Diego commandeered
the Infinite Switchboard,

117
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,554
then hijacked a briefcase...

118
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,140
and left the Commission.

119
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,225
Told you.

120
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,477
He also held a knife to my throat.

121
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,397
I knew he was a grifting little gonad.

122
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,275
So, what are you gonna do about him?

123
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,110
Me?

124
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,696
Your puppy, your responsibility.

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,282
Or are you forgetting
our little agreement?

126
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,410
You only let him stay
hoping I'd have to kill him.

127
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,787
Hmm.

128
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,330
Was this all a test?

129
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,666
Everything is a test, darling.

130
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,335
The question is...

131
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,381
Why are you failing it?

132
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,757
I'm not failing.

133
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,300
Let me handle it my way.

134
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,135
Does your way include decapitation?

135
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,845
Quartering, boiling,

136
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,558
thumbscrews, burning at the stake,
or Chinese water torture?

137
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,309
I wanna let him go.

138
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,979
Peons...

139
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,064
out.

140
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,794
Darling, blood is thicker than water,
but...

141
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,880
you can drown in either, Lila.

142
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,009
I am officially about to become

143
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,720
the most powerful woman in time,

144
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,806
and you will be my right hand.

145
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,268
But I need to know...

146
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,811
that I can trust you...

147
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,980
at all times...

148
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,524
in all ways.

149
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,154
You can.

150
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,714
740... 41... 42...

151
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,674
743.

152
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,217
Okay.

153
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,514
Oh.

154
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,367
Harlan?

155
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,246
What's wrong, baby?

156
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,914
How do I help you?

157
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,250
- Please, I don't know what to do.
- Jesus.

158
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,335
- What the hell happened?
- No, I just found him this way.

159
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,712
Vanya.

160
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,549
Vanya?

161
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,509
Oh, my God.

162
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,928
Oh, Harlan.

163
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,055
What the hell did she do to our boy?

164
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,932
Carl! Carl, what are you doing?

165
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,184
Something I should've done
a long time ago!

166
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,019
- Carl, no!
- Time to get him the help he needs!

167
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:09,979
Carl!

168
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,940
No, he doesn't belong
in one of those places!

169
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,734
Hold on, Harlan.

170
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,861
Gonna get you some help.

171
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,738
No matter what your mama says.

172
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,497
All right...

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,848
Get out of the car.

174
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,475
Sissy, don't be a fool.

175
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,060
You aren't gonna take my son from me.

176
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,562
They'll never give him back.

177
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,856
Well, maybe you don't deserve him anymore.

178
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,112
Maybe you should watch
how you talk to me for once.

179
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,952
<i>The timeline is your lifeline.</i>

180
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,954
Uh...

181
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,665
All right, sweaty gerbil man.

182
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,958
Tell me where Diego went

183
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,961
or I'll staple your colon to your nose
and let you die on your own farts.

184
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,214
That's... so... vivid.

185
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,757
Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

186
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,468
I'm on your side. No, I helped him escape.

187
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,220
If you...

188
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,137
Escape?

189
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,433
Well, he was supposed to stay here
with me. Where did he go?

190
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,726
Back to help his family.

191
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,522
Are you really going to kill him?

192
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,732
Of course not. I love him.

193
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,150
Oh, that's...

194
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,653
- Oh!
- Say a word and I'll crush you.

195
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,779
I won't.

196
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,240
I swear, I won't.

197
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,702
Uh, wait.

198
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,790
I hate to rain on your parade,
but there's something I have to show you.

199
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,667
Something big.

200
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,336
- Ugh!
- Wait, no.

201
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,295
It's...

202
00:13:59,129 --> 00:13:59,964
It's this.

203
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,227
Oh, my God.

204
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,572
<i>the Dallas-Fort Worth area broadcast,</i>

205
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,490
<i>here to bring you a special description</i>

206
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,243
<i>of the arrival
of President John F. Kennedy.</i>

207
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,705
<i>- At this moment, three special...</i>
- This is my favorite part.

208
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,959
The calm before the storm.

209
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,465
Look. The briefcase.

210
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,176
No, don't.
You won't be able to get there in time.

211
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,012
Of course I will.

212
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,722
This is our only chance.

213
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,932
Hey, uh, just remind me...

214
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,393
what was the final stage
of paradox psychosis again?

215
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,603
Homicidal rage.

216
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,104
Right.

217
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,189
That's great.

218
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,735
Five, listen to me. I...

219
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,320
No. No!

220
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,825
Oh... shit.

221
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,201
Bad idea, shit-heel.

222
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,123
Stop it! All right?

223
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,333
The <i>both</i> of you.

224
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,334
Pull it together.

225
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,046
Now, Kennedy is gonna be coming around
that corner any minute.

226
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,173
Okay? So, everyone,
let's just take a deep breath...

227
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,971
Now, we're all family here, okay?

228
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,059
So can we all just try to get along
for a few more minutes?

229
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,020
You want it?

230
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,396
Go ahead.

231
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,898
What's that?

232
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,361
Shit.

233
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,364
- Now...
- Where were we?

234
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,582
Come on, sweetie.
We'll be late for the parade.

235
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,324
Would you please...

236
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,161
Hey!

237
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm getting really sick of this!

238
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,220
Vanya?

239
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,953
Vanya?

240
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,629
Do you remember me?

241
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,888
I remember everything.

242
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,102
And I'm doing it again, aren't I?

243
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,607
What's wrong with me?

244
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,862
Why can't I control myself
like the rest of you guys?

245
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,030
It's not too late.

246
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,241
You can go back. There's still time.

247
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,243
I don't deserve to live.

248
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,703
I killed Pogo.

249
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,997
I almost killed Allison.

250
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,751
I destroyed the world.

251
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,172
I'm a monster.

252
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,597
Dad treated you like a bomb
before you ever were one.

253
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,520
He was... so scared of your power,
he never let you use it.

254
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,857
Drugged you up,
kept you numb for years.

255
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,070
That's messed up, Vanya.

256
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,407
No wonder you couldn't control it.

257
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,578
Dad couldn't handle your anger.

258
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,122
That doesn't mean you can't.

259
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:31,128
And maybe you have a right to be
pissed off and sad and messed up, but...

260
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,175
...it's a shitty world
full of shitty people sometimes.

261
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,555
You aren't a monster.

262
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,891
You're my sister.

263
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,102
And right now, our siblings
are risking everything out there

264
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,270
trying to save you.

265
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,193
You aren't alone at the table anymore,
Vanya.

266
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,779
You can do this.

267
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,795
Ben, what's happening to you?

268
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,425
I can't go back with you.

269
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,010
What do you mean?

270
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,140
- I'm hurting you, aren't I?
- It's not your fault.

271
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,518
I've been holding on
as long as I can in here, but...

272
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,940
- You shouldn't have come for me.
- Vanya...

273
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,525
I died 17 years ago.

274
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,987
All the rest of this...

275
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,365
these years with Klaus...

276
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,328
it's all been gravy.

277
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,124
At least this time I get to say goodbye.

278
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,299
- Can I ask you a weird favor?
- Anything.

279
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,552
Can you hug me as I go?

280
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,721
It's been a long time since...

281
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,859
Tell Klaus something for me, will you?

282
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,189
Get out of the car.

283
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,738
Whatcha gonna do, Sissy?

284
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,364
You gonna shoot me?

285
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,493
I don't wanna hurt you,
but you need to give me back my boy.

286
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,289
Well, he's our boy.
Maybe you and Vanya have forgotten that.

287
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,083
- Vanya's got nothin' to do with this.
- Oh, really?

288
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,253
Well, we were just fine
till that Russian she-devil showed up.

289
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,464
We weren't "fine," Carl.

290
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,132
Jesus.

291
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,427
Sayin' a lie over and over
doesn't make it true.

292
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,305
What? You love her?

293
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,057
Is that it?

294
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,559
Some girl from nowhere?

295
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,355
Probably a Communist,
who you hit with your car.

296
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,817
Yeah, Carl.

297
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,030
I love her.

298
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,575
So you should just let me go.

299
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,370
I did right by you!

300
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,414
I worked hard.

301
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,375
I was faithful.

302
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,877
I never blamed you for the boy.

303
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,631
I stayed!

304
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,717
You don't get to ask for more than that.

305
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,347
I'm askin', Carl.

306
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,017
Just not from you.

307
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,317
Harlan, baby, you get in the house now,
you hear?

308
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,236
Boy, you come here.

309
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,698
Better he sees who his mama really is.

310
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,577
- How she wants to break up the family.
- You leave him be. This is between us.

311
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:36,998
Harlan...

312
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,334
Harlan, it's okay, baby. It's okay...

313
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,669
No!

314
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,271
You okay?

315
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,361
Oh!

316
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,992
Oh, Harlan.

317
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,912
Oh, shit.

318
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,462
"...take this institution
to the heights it reached..."

319
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,464
My parents didn't die in a robbery.

320
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,718
They were executed.

321
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,053
Kill order 743.

322
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,640
And I know who did it.

323
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,911
Five killed my family.

324
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,746
- No, don't kill us!
- No!

325
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,918
And AJ Carmichael gave the order.

326
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,178
It was him who made me an orphan.

327
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,388
Darling.

328
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,142
Little one...

329
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,103
your family is right here.

330
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,524
Yeah.

331
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,986
I wonder...

332
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,326
if that's what Diego
was sneaking around here looking for.

333
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,915
Trying to bury the evidence
so you'd never find out.

334
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,378
What... What're you talking about?

335
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,672
Diego doesn't know what Five did.

336
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:53,218
Darling, I'm gonna need you to be a titch
more clever about this.

337
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,806
That clown school that Five calls
"Umbrella Academy,"

338
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,433
it may be full of assholes,
but it's not full of fools.

339
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,021
They'refamily.
What one knows, they <i>all </i>know.

340
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,441
No, no, no, no. I... I was playing Diego,
he wasn't playing me.

341
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,028
Is that why you're crying in my office
while he's out roaming free,

342
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,363
laughing at you?

343
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,497
I didn't think he was smart enough
to pull this off.

344
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,915
He isn't...

345
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,959
but Five is.

346
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,922
And Diego listens to him and trusts him.

347
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,634
Five...

348
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,681
has been playing puppet master
all this time.

349
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,436
I'd say it's time
that we solved this problem...

350
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,857
once and for all.

351
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,129
Did you enjoy the show,
you little flotsam?

352
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,386
I don't know how you did it,
but I know your work.

353
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,307
I'm sure you think you're <i>very</i> clever.

354
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,734
The thing about fish, AJ,

355
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,405
is they're no match

356
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,033
for a shark.

357
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,132
Getting tired yet?

358
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,509
I can do this all day.

359
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,553
- Guys, this has to stop.
- Eat shit, Ape Man.

360
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,394
Hey! Assholes!

361
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,064
I'm done listening to you both.
<i>I'm</i> in charge now.

362
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,859
- Now, Luther! Shoot him!
- No! Luther, shoot <i>him!</i>

363
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,570
- Shoot him!
- No, Luther, shoot <i>him.</i>

364
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,863
Luther, shoot him!

365
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,532
Luther, shoot him.

366
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,825
Now, Luther!

367
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,958
- Luther...
- I'm sorry, buddy.

368
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,219
Now! Open the portal!

369
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:43,888
Right.

370
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,586
- Are you okay?
- Vanya.

371
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,338
Physically or emotionally?

372
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,008
You're alive.

373
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,723
- Did we save the world or what?
- I think so.

374
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,224
Building's still here.

375
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,187
Kennedy's a few minutes away.

376
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,356
- I can't still save him.
- No, Diego, wait!

377
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,278
<i>President Kennedy arrives...</i>

378
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,990
I still time to stop Dad
before Kennedy makes his final turn.

379
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,867
No, no, where are you going?

380
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,411
Look, I saw the explosion.

381
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,788
I saw the tapes, Allison.

382
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,831
The explosion causes doomsday.

383
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,542
You're safe now.

384
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,711
- He doesn't have to die.
- No, no, Diego...

385
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,714
<i>are Governor and Mrs. Connally.</i>

386
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,591
<i>They have stayed in the limousine.</i>

387
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,384
<i>But the president, the First Lady,</i>

388
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,512
<i>the vice president,
and Mrs. Lyndon Johnson</i>

389
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,097
<i>are all walking along the edge
of this fence,</i>

390
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,475
<i>shaking hands with the crowd.</i>

391
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,394
<i>And they are being greeted by placards</i>

392
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,524
<i>of varying emotional and, uh,
political feeling...</i>

393
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,807
Don't even think about it.

394
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,560
- Into the vortex you go, asshole.
- Fine!

395
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,186
But give me the math.

396
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,065
So I don't end up looking like
Tiger Beat over here.

397
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,777
You stand next to the vortex
and I'll tell ya.

398
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,322
Go!

399
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,077
- Closer!
- This is close enough!

400
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,871
Now give it to me!

401
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,709
It was a typo.

402
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,085
Typo?

403
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,212
We put the decimal in the wrong spot

404
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,382
in our proof of the existence
of a bound for the number of limit cycles

405
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,552
of planar polynomial vector fields
of fixed degree.

406
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:31,014
We wrote down five-point-seven.
It should be...

407
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,057
...zero-point-five-seven.

408
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,225
Son of a bitch.

409
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,895
I <i>knew </i>that didn't look right.

410
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,606
All right...

411
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,025
I guess this is it.

412
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,192
This <i>is</i> it.

413
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,527
Go.

414
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,659
No!

415
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,122
Five!

416
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,750
It's shrinking!

417
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,260
<i>The crowd yells.</i>

418
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,763
<i>And there's the president
of the United States.</i>

419
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,516
We did it!

420
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,852
<i>I can see his suntan</i>
<i>all the way from here.</i>

421
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,562
The briefcase, you idiot.

422
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,939
What?

423
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,819
Hey, you know what?

424
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,529
A thank-you for preserving

425
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,657
- your existence would be nice.
- "A thank-you."

426
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,952
<i>And here they come.</i>
<i>The presidential car is moving out...</i>

427
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,038
Luther! Luther! Here he comes!

428
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,253
Kennedy's turning.

429
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,256
Look, there's Dad.

430
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,133
What do we do?

431
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,760
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

432
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,763
- Agh.
- Oh, shit.

433
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,806
Diego.

434
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,730
- It's happening again.
- Oh, Jackie.

435
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,498
No!

436
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,799
<i>KLIF bulletin, from Dallas,</i>

437
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,427

438
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,970

439
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,722

<i>- KLIF News is checking out the report.</i>
<i>- We will have further...</i>

441
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,518
Where the hell is he?

442
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,708
<i>This is a sad time for all people.</i>

443
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,086
<i>We have suffered a loss...</i>

444
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,298
<i>that cannot be weighed...</i>

445
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,301
Someone even notified him. Oh.

446
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,094
- Congratulations.
- And to you.

447
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,686
<i> I know that the world</i>
<i>shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy...</i>

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,146
Ah, you made it.

449
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,899
- Were you followed?
- Of course not.

450
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,984
I used the decoy.

451
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,027
Excellent.

452
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,364
- Champagne?
- There's nothing to celebrate.

453
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,910
Well, clearly, you haven't heard the news.

454
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,870
Our little Kennedy problem is solved.

455
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:44,207
He was not to be touched!
That was the deal.

456
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,294
Well, he had to go, one way or the other.

457
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,838
Pissed off too many people.

458
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,591
You lied to me.

459
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,763
We all got what we wanted.

460
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,516
The rocket technology you supplied us with

461
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,935
will enable us to beat the Russians
to the moon.

462
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,729
And in turn, when we do arrive,

463
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,023
five or six years from now,

464
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,568
your interests
on the dark side of the moon

465
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,654
won't be affected.

466
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,781
Worthy of celebration...

467
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,783
don't you think?

468
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,036
You will never contact me again.

469
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,293
Good night, <i>gentlemen.</i>

470
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,549
Don't be too sure of that, <i>Reg.</i>

471
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,553
You're gonna keep giving us
that fancy technology of yours.

472
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,346
And why would I do that?

473
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,265
Because if you don't,

474
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,894
we'll tell the world who you really are.

475
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,740
Uh-oh. Someone's ready for a fight.

476
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,708
What's he doing?

477
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,192
Oh, my God!

478
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:44,243
"This is the start
of something bigger than yourselves,

479
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,622
and I will be the ne..."

480
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,918
Now is not a good time.

481
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,544
What?

482
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,759
- Well?
- I've never seen anything like this.

483
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,969
The anomaly is off the charts.

484
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,523
Have you shown this to anyone else?

485
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,193
- N-No, only you.

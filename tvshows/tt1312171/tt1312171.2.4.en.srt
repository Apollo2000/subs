00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,787
Hey. Unacceptable, Vanya.

166
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,539
Remember, we need to stick together.

167
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,625
Oh, why, so I don't end the world again?

168
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,461
- [scoffs] Stupid...
- Were you even gonna tell me?

169
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,339
You know what? In my defense, no.
All right?

170
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,509
And can you blame me?
When you... you get angry, shit blows up.

171
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,179
Great. Are there any other family secrets
you failed to mention?

172
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,517
A boatload, Vanya, which I don't have
the luxury of sharing them with the...

173
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,812
[Five sighs]

174
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,609
The clock is ticking on doomsday.

175
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,447
Just tell me that when I need you,
you'll be ready.

176
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,200
I can't help you, Five.

177
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,369
I don't even know who I am.

178
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,912
- You're our sister.
- [starts engine]

179
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,748
And a member of the Umbrella Academy.

180
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,792
Like it or not, that's who you are.

181
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,210
Look, that's who I was, okay?

182
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,045
New timeline, new me.

183
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,547
No, that's not how it work...

184
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,259
[sighs]

185
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,809
Wonder if it's too late
to be un-adopted.

186
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,272
[rotary dial spinning]

187
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,108
[line rings, connects]

188
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,276
[Allison] Parkland Hospital?

189
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,279
Yes, I'm... I'm looking for a patient,
Raymond Chestnut.

190
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,283
He may have been brought in last night
after the riot at Stadtler's.

191
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,661
Why does that matter?

192
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,625
Of course you don't treat Negroes.
How silly of me.

193
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,044
[Allison hangs up, sighs]
Shit.

194
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,255
- You all right?
- [Allison] No.

195
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,048
Ray didn't come home last night.

196
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,343
Okay. Okay, no problem.
I'm sure he's fine.

197
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,970
First thing we're gonna need...

198
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,264
[inhales sharply] ...is coffee,

199
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,641
vitamin B12, and...

200
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,728
oh, a piping hot bowl of menudo,

201
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,105
and then we're gonna
sort all this stuff out.

202
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,691
He saw me rumor that cop, Klaus.

203
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,359
I know.

204
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,861
But, uh...

205
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,696
you... you were saving his life.

206
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,781
I mean, that asshole was gonna kill him.

207
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,452
[sighs] I'm such an idiot.

208
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,787
- No, you're not.
- [chair squeaks softly]

209
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,123
I promised myself
I would never do this again.

210
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,916
Nothing good ever comes from it.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,587
Have you ever heard the fable
of <i>The Scorpion and the Frog?</i>

212
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,840
What?

213
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,926
The scorpion wants
to get across the river,

214
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,346
so he asks the frog to carry him across.

215
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,556
But the frog's like,
"Well, what's in it for me?"

216
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642
And the scorpion's like,
"How about five bucks?"

217
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,727
And the frog says, "Make it 20."

218
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,812
- The scorpion's like, "Ten."
- The frog goes,

219
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,815
"All right, fine, 15."

220
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,984
And the scorpion's like,
"All right, fine, 15."

221
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,111
Then halfway across the river,

222
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,948
the frog feels this terrible pain
on his back, and...

223
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,494
eh... the scorpion stung him.

224
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,330
You know? And the frog's like,
"Well, what the hell?

225
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,415
We're both gonna drown now," and...

226
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,794
they both did.

227
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,299
- What the hell is the point of that story?
- The point is,

228
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,426
frogs are bitches,

229
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,471
and we do not negotiate with terrorists,
Allison...

230
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,099
No. No, no, no. I...
I actually can't deal with you right now.

231
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,725
- I'm sorry, I'm not...
- Absolutely not.

232
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,270
A morning person.
Can we do this again at, like...

233
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,191
- Where you going?
- To find my damn husband.

234
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,236
Menudo.

235
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,409
- So, what, you just let her go?
- [Five] Well, Vanya had a lot to process.

236
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,078
[sighs]
She'll come around. I know she will.

237
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,539
- What about the guys that went after her?
- [Five] The Swedes?

238
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,333
Yeah, I mean, how do you know
they won't go after her again?

239
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,669
- [Five] We don't.
- Mm, any idea who sent them?

240
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,587
Oh, I have my suspicions.

241
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,175
But right now, our priority is finding Dad
and getting answers,

242
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,802
'cause everything else depends on it.

243
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,803
Which, for the record,

244
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,722
- I found him already.
- And then let him go

245
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,932
before we could have
a meaningful conversation.

246
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,392
He stabbed me.

247
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,562
I'm surprised he waited this long, Diego.
We've all had the urge.

248
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,105
- [Lila laughs]
- [Elliott chuckles]

249
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,398
Good one.

250
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,152
Good thing I know
where Dad's gonna be tonight.

251
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,156
[sighs] Where'd you get this?

252
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,867
Found it at his office
while he was busy stabbing you.

253
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,994
- [chuckles sarcastically]
- [Lila] Hmm.

254
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,370
"Hoyt Hillenkoetter

255
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,831
and the Consulate General of Mexico
in Dallas

256
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,083
- cordially invite you to a gala."
- [Elliott] Whoa, wait.

257
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,835
Hoyt Hillenkoetter?

258
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,628
Are you serious?

259
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,589
- You know him?
- [gasps] We should go.

260
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,966
Says there's gonna be a seafood tower.

261
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,552
No, Hillenkoetter is...
is one of the Majestic Twelve.

262
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,471
- [Diego] The hell is the Majestic Twelve?
- What?

263
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,931
It's a... a secret committee.

264
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,642
Uh, scientists, military, uh, deep state.

265
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,144
No one knows what they really do.

266
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,980
- Wait, so they're government? [grunts]
- [Elliott] <i>Shadow</i> government.

267
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,941
Yeah, Kennedy was the first president
to try to push 'em into the light,

268
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,235
but these guys are not to be trifled with.
Oh...

269
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,571
Oh, here we go. Ah, right here.

270
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,448
This, uh... Oh, right here.

271
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,825
- That's Hoyt right there.
- [Five] Huh.

272
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,243
[Diego sighs, grunts softly]

273
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,079
[gasps softly]

274
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,581
I only count 11.

275
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,375
Well, that's because
they've only identified 11 so far.

276
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,668
Who's the twelfth?

277
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,763
[chickens clucking]

278
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,848
[vehicle approaches]

279
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,727
- [dog barking]
- Vanya.

280
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,571
[Sissy laughing] Ha! Thank God!

281
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,533
Oh! [gasping breaths]

282
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,159
[sighs]

283
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,454
I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,207
- Uh, I'll... I'll pay for the damage.
- Don't you start.

285
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,334
I'm just glad you're back
and in one piece.

286
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,380
You have no idea where my mind went.
[takes deep breath]

287
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,091
Harlan's gonna be thrilled.

288
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,260
He's been in a state ever since you left.

289
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,972
[chuckles softly] Now...

290
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,515
[sighs]

291
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,101
Tell me what the hell happened
out there.

292
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,313
I don't know where to begin.

293
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,693
Let's start with breakfast.
How about that?

294
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,405
[chickens clucking]

295
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,241
- [patrons murmuring]
- [man sighs]

296
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,951
Gotta hit the head.

297
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,337
Hey! Mamie Pink, right?

298
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,090
Klaus Hargreeves,
but you can call me whatever you want.

299
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,300
How's she lookin'?

300
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,759
- The latrine?
- [Klaus] Listen to me.

301
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,095
I have to talk to you
about something important.

302
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,139
- Okay?
- Okay.

303
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,518
This is gonna sound kinda crazy,
but, uh... [sighs]

304
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,814
I know you.

305
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,441
Uh, yeah, sure.

306
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,027
- From the hardware store.
- No, from before.

307
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,612
Well, after, actually. Listen,

308
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,031
I know you're thinking about enlisting,

309
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,283
thinking it's your duty
'cause your grandfather fought

310
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,410
in World War I
and your father fought in World War II,

311
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,705
and that guy you're eating brunch with
is your Uncle Ryan who fought in Korea.

312
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,540
- Brian.
- Brian.

313
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,000
And you look up to Brian.

314
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,336
And you're starting to believe
all this stuff he's saying

315
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,213
about the military making you a man.

316
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,798
[chuckles] Is this a joke or something?

317
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,135
Dave, if you enlist,
they're gonna send you out to Vietnam.

318
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,511
The heck are you talking about?

319
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,766
Fifty thousand American soldiers

00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,963
No one gets to tell us
how to deal with the end of the world.

477
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,548
Right?

478
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,551
Not even each other.

479
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,646
Have you, um,
heard from any of the others?

480
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,106
Vanya?

481
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,566
Uh, on a farm.

482
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,193
And happy.

483
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,571
Right. Weird.

484
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,490
- Uh, Diego?
- Nuthouse.

485
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,159
- [Luther] Klaus?
- Cult leader.

486
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,286
- Eh.
- [Allison laughs]

487
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,457
[Luther] And, uh,
Five turned up a few days ago.

488
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,792
So, that's it, the gang's all here.

489
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,630
Well, great. Well, that's usually
when things go sideways, so... [chuckles]

490
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,006
Yeah.

491
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,009
- About that. Uh...
- What?

492
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,094
We did it again.

493
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:14,804
Apparently.

494
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,139
Did what again?

495
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,224
Ended the world.

496
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,018
Or we will in seven days from now,
according to Five.

497
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,062
- What?
- Doomsday. [chuckles]

498
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,691
[slow mariachi music plays]

499
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,989
[overlapping chatter]

500
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,955
[Diego] I don't see Dad anywhere.

501
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,791
[Five] Just keep an eye out
for the Majestic Twelve.

502
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,084
I got the upstairs.

503
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,796
Diego, try not to do anything too stupid.

504
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,005
[Lila chuckles softly]

505
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,426
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

506
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,680
- Trying to ditch me again?
- What are you talking about?

507
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,057
Last night. Hey...

508
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,642
Where'd you go?

509
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,352
You really want to do this now?

510
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,603
Really.

511
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,896
Fine.

512
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,984
I went to the pharmacy to buy gauze
for your disgusting stab wound.

513
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,360
Is that allowed or...?

514
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,195
- [song ends]
- As a matter of fact,

515
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,281
- you owe me $1.89.
- [people clapping]

516
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,242
Or you would if I'd actually paid for it.

517
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,744
[melodic mariachi song playing]

518
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,496
They're playing our song.

519
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,857
Someone's got moves.

520
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,901
My father insisted on ballroom lessons.

521
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,697
[mimics Reginald]
"One never knows when the paso doble

children."

524
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,164
My mum used to say something
along those lines.

525
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,249
- Yeah?
- Switch.

526
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,046
What are you doing?

527
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,214
[Lila] Just follow my lead.

528

[Diego scoffs]

529
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,301
Uh, honey, no. I'm the man here.

530
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,053
Shh...

531
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,067
[Lila laughs]

532
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,537
[Lila] Well, you are easily distracted.

533
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,039
It can't be.

534

Mom.

538
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,508
[in Texas drawl]
Never heard that one before.

539
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,262
Everything all right, hon?

540
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,099
- You're real.
- [Grace chuckles]

541
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,018
If this is your idea of a come-on,

542
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,478
it's not goin' well.

543
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,313
No.

Actu... Uh...

545
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:58,153
Uh, do... do you know a... a man named
Sir Reginald Hargreeves?

546
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,780
Reggie? He's my date this evenin'.

547
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,450
Your date?

548
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,495
Ugh.

549
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,247
Do you have a problem with that?

550
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,541
No. No, no, it's... it's just, uh...

551
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,835
It's just a lot to process. The...

552
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,462
The thought of the two of you, I...

553
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,714
I can't picture that in my head.
That is...

554
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,215
That's nasty.

555
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,341
Uh... [sighs]

556
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,594
You're a little odd, aren't you?

557
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,387
- Yeah.
- [Grace laughs softly]

558
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,346
I mean, no.

Uh...

Do you know where he is?

561
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,978
He said somethin' about a quick meetin',
and he'd be right back.

562
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,313
That was 20 minutes ago.

563

Never good to keep a lady waiting.

564

Tell him that if you find him.

565

Hey, uh, Grace?

566
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,119
It was nice meeting you.

- I don't understand.
- [Vanya] Me neither.

572
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,954
All I know is that these guys
are really dangerous

573
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,664
and they're not gonna stop until I'm dead.

574
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,041
- So we go to the police.
- No, I... I can't.

575
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,042
Why not?

What... What is it?

00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,129
Are you in trouble with the law?

Maybe.

It's complicated.

- The point is, I... I can't stay here.
- Vanya...

No, I can't risk anything happening
to you or Harlan.

00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,183
I couldn't live with myself.

584
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,102
Vanya! We could go somewhere.

585
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,229
For a few days.

586
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,482
We wouldn't have to tell anyone,
not even Carl.

587
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,152
I'll bring the gun. I'll keep you safe.

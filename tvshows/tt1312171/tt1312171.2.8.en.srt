I'm Special Agent Willy Gibbs
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,317
Where's Sissy? I need to talk to her.

What's your last name, Vanya?

00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,418
Hargreeves.

15
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,712
Do you have any ID
that could attest to that?

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,882
No driver's license, birth certificate?

17
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,468
- You from around here?
- No.

18
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,429
I'm... I, uh... I'm... I'm not sure.

19
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,014
You're not sure.

20
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,684
Well, I told the other officer
I was hit by a car.

21
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,603
- I have amnesia.
- Right.

22
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:47,315
Yes, amnesia. They told me about that.
So how does that work, exactly?

23
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,484
I can't remember anything
from before a month ago.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,528
Except your name, of course.

25
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,239
Yeah, except my name.

26
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,533
[Gibbs]
Far as I can tell, it's like you simply...

27
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,160
materialized out of thin air.

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,995
Welcome to my world.

29
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,290
"Vanya."

30
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,920
That's a Russian name, isn't it?

31
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,296
I'm not Russian.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,132
If you have amnesia,
how can you say for sure?

33
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,759
In fact, I'm curious as to how you know
your first and last name

34
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,928
- but you don't remember anything else.
- I don't know.

35
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,806
- How did you send those troopers flying?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

[in Russian]
What are you doing here in Dallas?

37
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,143
[in Russian] I don't know!

38
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,900
[Gibbs] Hmm.

39
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,236
[in English] You speak Russian.

40
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,072
- I... I don't... I...
- [Gibbs] Wonderful.

41
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,742
- I must've just learned a little as a kid.
- [Gibbs] A little?

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,703
I think you speak it very well.

43
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,289
What I want to know is,
how does a young woman

44
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,832
who says she isn't Russian,

45
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,375
but speaks Russian,

46
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,003
end up working as a nanny
to some simple-headed boy

47
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,713
in the middle of nowhere, Texas?

48
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,466
I need to make a phone call.
I have the right to make a call, don't I?

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,927
If there is one thing the FBI
takes seriously,

50
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,054
it is a Communist threat to this country.

51
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,973
Now, I want answers,

52
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,641
<i>real</i> answers,

53
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,186
and I will do whatever it takes
to get them.

54
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,480
You're not going anywhere
until I find out who you really are.

00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,233
{\an8}[Five] Now nothing, Luther, all right?

66
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,943
{\an8}- Make your peace with God.
- [Luther] What?

67
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,444
{\an8}What about Allison and Vanya?

68
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,655
{\an8}[Five] Screw them both.
They should have been here.

69
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,657
{\an8}[Klaus groans] What about Diego?

70
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,993
{\an8}- He's quite a responsible young man, no?
- [Five grunts, sighs]

71
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,579
{\an8}- Something must've happened to them.
- Screw Diego, all right?

72
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,997
Screw everybody!

73
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,166
I was better off on my own
in the apocalypse.

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,168
Five! Come on.

75
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,255
You know what, Luther?
It's every sibling for himself now.

76
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,839
How 'bout that?

[whimpering] Did Five just get meaner?

79
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,390
Klaus, go check on Allison, okay?

80
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,599
Make sure she's okay.

81
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,061
Find the others and we'll meet back here.
I'll handle Five.

[Klaus grunts, sighs]

you have had

- Just stay out of me.
- I regret nothing!

[Klaus] Back off!

88
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,415
Hey! Five, doomsday is still coming.

89
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,084
- We gotta think of a new plan.
- Don't you get it, Luther?

90
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,671
- It's <i>over,</i> all right? We're already dead.
- Then where are you going?

91
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,673
I'm going to do the unthinkable.

92
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,425
- The hell is that supposed to mean?
- [sighs]

93
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,510
I was really hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

94
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,845
Come to what, Five?

95
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,014
Five.

96

00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,059
Come to what?

Five!

99
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,442
[Ray] Oh, sweet Jesus,
what the hell are we gonna do?

100
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,736
- It's okay, it's okay. Calm down, Ray.
- Calm down?

101
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,697
Allison, you killed a vacuum cleaner
salesman in our goddamn living room.

102
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,699
[Allison]
Okay, technically, his brother killed him.

103
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,702
And they were not here to sell vacuums.

104
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,621
There is a giant dead white boy
on our couch.

105
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,665
Yeah, you know, I'll admit,
that doesn't look good.

106
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,750
Oh, we're done.

107
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,086
The movement is finished, Allison.
They're gonna give me the chair for this.

108
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,213
- They're not gonna give you the...

I'm so sorry it's late, but, uh...

112
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,854
Klaus, now is not a good time.

113
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,064
[Klaus] Oh, I'm sorry.

114

Allison! Hey!

115
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,735
I was so worried about you.
Thank God you're okay.

116

What's, uh... What's the matter?

117
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,114

Oh, I see.

Yes, but I didn't mean him,
for God's sake.

142
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,713
If you don't see the problem
with hiring you-know-who's brother,

143
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,298
then you're not ready for that badge.

I'm sorry, but I really need to get going.

He is not worth it.

Mum! Oh, my God.

This may shock you,

You need fresh blood loyal to us

I've seen Diego in the field.

Why waste that when we can use it?

He'll be my personal responsibility.

- My brother has beef with everybody,

160
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,054
me included.

161
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,680
[Handler] Let me ask you something.

162
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,891
When you're looking down
the barrel of a gun,

163
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,229
where do your loyalties lie,
with your family or your principles?

164
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,522
With me.

165
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,775
I don't belong to anybody.

166
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,985
Especially Lila.

167
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,571
[Handler] That I can work with.

168
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,283
Run him through orientation,
fill out his start paperwork.

169
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:55,952
But...

170
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,746
if he ruffles even one feather,

171
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,791
you will kill him yourself.

172
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,543
- Understood?
- Thanks, Mum.

173
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,217
- [crickets chirring]
- [door opens inside]

174
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,511
[suspenseful instrumental music plays]

175
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,313
[exhales softly]

176
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
[hinges creak softly]

177
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,863
[Grace gasps softly]

178
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,939
[exhales sharply]

179
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,068
Oh, my God.

180
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,655
[Reginald]
What are you doing in here?

181
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,285
[Grace chuckles nervously]

182
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,454
Not sure what I could say that would...

183
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,956
overwrite the obvious.

184
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,958
Fair enough.

185
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,085
New question, then.

186
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,504
<i>Why</i> are you doing it?

187
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,260
Are you involved in somethin' nefarious?

188
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,264
Quite often. Did you have something
more specific in mind?

189
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,936
That... That shaggy man at the consulate,

190
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,272
the one who chased after us
with the little boy.

191
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,150
- Calls himself Diego.
- Yes, that's the one.

192
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,068
He...

193
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,906
He thinks that you want to harm
the president.

194
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,407
I see.

195
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,744
You take the word of lunatics these days?

196
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,705
Not over yours, but these...

197
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,540
these photographs,

198
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,127
they're all about the president's visit
tomorrow, aren't they?

199
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,383
You know there are aspects of my work
I cannot discuss.

200
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,969
You've always respected that line.

201
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,972
I don't need to know the details, Reggie.

202
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,101
I just need to know
that you're not involved

203
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,061
in what I'm afraid you might be.

204
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,691
What are you really afraid of, my dear?

205
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,446
There's so much about you
I don't understand.

206
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,699
I could say the same about you.

207
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,290
I want to share my life with you, Reggie,

208
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,586
but I need to know you're a good man.

209
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,632
I need to know
you would never hurt the president.

210
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,429
As I said, there are elements in my life

211
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,514
that I can't discuss with you.

212
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,641
Someday...

213
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,477
I hope to share it all with you.

214
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,397
Until then...

215
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,442
I'm asking you to trust me.

216
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,700
[sobs softly] I can't wait that long.

217
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,494
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,676
- [refrigerator opens]
- [soft rattling]

219
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,386
[grunts softly] Five?

220
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,889
[splutters, groans]

221
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,475
[Luther mutters] Shit.

222
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,059
Five?

223
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,020
Five, what...

224
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,189
You okay?

225
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,483
[Five slurping]

226
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,485
[gasping heavily]

227
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,030
- I'm gonna need to be hydrated. [sighs]
- Hydrated?

228
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,036
What's with the baby powder?

229
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,913
It'll help with the itching.

230
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,041
What itching? There's itching?
What the hell is going on here?

231
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,336
You <i>do</i> have a plan.

232
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,046
[Five exhales sharply]

233
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,466
Well, it's a desperation move, but...

234
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,384
since our brain-dead siblings

235
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,012
are incapable of meeting
a simple deadline,

236
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,014
I got no choice.

237
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,601
- No choice about what?
- I have to find myself.

238
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,812
[flicks watch open, shut]

239
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,022
I just arrived in Dallas 15 minutes ago.

240
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,567
- Should I be worried about you?
- Luther, if you recall,

241
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,279
I was sent to 1963

242
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,198
on a job by the Commission

243
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,200
to make sure the president
was assassinated.

244
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,661
Oh! So, wait,
you're <i>old</i> self is out there.

245
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,412
Precisely. [exhales]

246
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,081
What, just walking around Dallas?

247
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,293
Walking around Dallas with a briefcase
that can get us home.

248
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,255
Oh, my God. Five, you're a genius.

249
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,799
However,
there are two significant problems

250
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,925
with this plan.

251
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,886
Problem number one:
I am a trained assassin,

252
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,890
arguably the most dangerous assassin
in the space-time continuum.

253
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,477
If I know me, I'm not going
to react kindly to bumping into myself.

254
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,937
Problem number two,

255
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,064
and this is the real fly
in the ointment here:

256
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,317
you're not supposed to exist
in close proximity to yourself

257
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,569
in the same timeline.

258
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,405
The side effects can be disastrous.

259
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,615
Side effects? What sort of side effects?

260
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,203
Well, according to <i>Commission Handbook</i>
Chapter 27, subsection 3b,

261
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,747
the seven stages
in paradox psychosis are...

262
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,916
stage one: denial,

263
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,293
two: itching,

264
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,128
three: extreme thirst and urination,

265
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,713
four: excessive gas,

266
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,381
five: acute paranoia,

267
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,383
six: uncontrolled perspiration,

268
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,718
and seven:

269
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,928
homicidal rage.

270
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,181
- Homicidal rage?
- [Five] Yeah.

271
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,934
[Luther] Jeez, I don't know.
This maybe isn't such a good idea.

272
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,311
[Five] It's a Hail Mary.

273
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,479
But what choice do we got, Luther?

274
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,982
I don't know, you already seem
a bit squirrelly if I'm being honest.

275
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,900
[Five] Look, Luther,

276
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,569
I'm gonna need you to help me
get through this one, all right? I...

277
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,820
I need a spotter.

278
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,363
- A spotter?
- Yeah.

279
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,324
What is that? Like, a wingman?

280
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,327
In case the paradox psychosis
gets too severe,

281
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,162
I need you to help me stay on task,
all right?

282
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,498
So, whatever happens, whatever I say,

283
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,751
we need to get that briefcase.

284
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,545
- Okay?
- Okay.

285
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,755
Okay.

286
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,970
- Luther, come on.
- Right.

287
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,432
[Carl] <i>So, they're questioning her now?</i>

288
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,852
Well, I appreciate it. Yup.

289
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,563
Take care, now.

290
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,065
[places phone on cradle]

291
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,483
[Carl] That was my brother.

292
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,986
Well, I hope you thanked him
for almost arresting me.

293
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,030
He says I was right.

294
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,740
Right about what?

295
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,950
[Carl chuckles softly]

296
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,829
The FBI thinks Vanya
may be some kind of KGB agent.

297
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,748
That's impossible.

298
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,669
- [scoffs]
- We were both duped, Sis.

299
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,254
There's no shame in it.

300
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,717
Whatever she is,
she's not who she was pretending to be.

301
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,637
It's not your fault.

302
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,808
She led you astray.

303
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,353
That's what these commie bastards
are trained to do.

304
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,438
They prey on our weaknesses.

305
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,149
Turned us against each other.

306
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,569
Can't let 'em win.

307
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,198
What would a Russian agent
be doing out here on a farm?

308
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,116
Well, who knows?

309
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,744
Maybe she was just looking
for a place to hide out.

310
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,206
We don't know the big picture.

311
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,586
Now look here,

312
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,884
I think you should have a talk
with Reverend Moore.

313
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,764
- Carl...
- We need to work through this, damn it.

314
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,017
Then we're gonna take us a trip.

315
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,561
Somewhere far away from here.

316
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,896
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

317
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,317
Harlan needs a family,

318
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,403
not a nanny.

319
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,533
[Gibbs] Vanya, wake up.

320
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,160

474
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,361
- with my younger self.
- Older, actually.

475
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,280
I'm you, just 14 days older.

476
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,115
I have pubic hair smarter than you.

477
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,117
- How's that possible?
- [teen Five] I can explain.

478
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,995
You see, one hour from now,
on the grassy knoll,

479
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,747
before the president is killed,

480
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,375
you break your contract
with the Commission.

481
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,460
I already know you're thinking about it.

482
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,003
All those years in the apocalypse,

483
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,422
we never stopped worrying
about our family.

484
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,676
Well, today,
you are going to do something about it.

485
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,680
Today, you are going to attempt
to time travel forward to 2019.

486
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,224
However, you are going
to screw up the jump

487
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,268
and end up in this twip of a body,

488
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,563
trapped forever, small, pubescent.

489
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,064
Okay. [farts]

490
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,693
Even if I was to believe you,
what am I supposed to do about it,

491
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,861
- not jump?
- [teen Five] No, no. I need you to jump.

492
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,155
If you don't jump, I cease to exist.

493
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,700
What I need from you is to jump correctly.

494
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,577
- I'm listening.
- The first time through,

495
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,412
I got the calculation wrong.

496
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,372
That's how I ended up in this body.

497
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,208
But now, I know the correct calculation.

498
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,377
What is it?

499
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,920
I'll be glad to tell you...

500
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,382
in exchange for that briefcase
you're holding under the table.

501
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,595
[Luther] Yeah, yeah,
so you go back to 2019,

502
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,888
as planned,
but this time with the right math,

503
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,057
so you remain a full-grown man.

504
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,436
In exchange, we get that briefcase
that you no longer need.

505
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,939
Timeline restored, paradox resolved.

506
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,942
Everyone goes on existing
happily ever after.

507
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,487
That's quite a bit to take in.

508
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,282
What do you think?

509
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,123
[adult Five] I think...

510
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,292
I need to piss.

511
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,759
[Luther] Oh.

512
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,847
Well, besides the flop sweat,

513
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,266
I think that went pretty well, am I right?

514
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,768
No, no, there's something...

515
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,521
- Something doesn't feel right about this.
- What... What do you mean?

516
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,231
I don't trust him.

517
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,984
But he's you.

518
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,362
Exactly.

519
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,407
- [typewriters clacking nearby]
- [office phone ringing]

520
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,703
[gentle chime over speakers]

521
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,706
[woman over PA]
<i>A tidy workspace is a happy workspace.</i>

522
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,684
[Diego] Bingo, the Infinite Switchboard.

523
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,400
All right. [pops knuckles]

524
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,068
How hard can this be?

525
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,455
[switchboard whirring]

526
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,625
- [console beeping]
- [shouts, groaning]

527
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,508
Oh! Please don't hurt me. [panting]

528
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,676
Who the hell are you?

529
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,262
I'm Herb. I'm an analyst.

530
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,639
I'm Diego. I have a knife.

531
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,349
[breath trembling] Yes, I can see.

532
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,560
[gulps loudly] It's very shiny.

533
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,355
Oh. [inhales sharply]

534
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,815
Breathe.

535
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,443
[panting softly]

536
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,361
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Hargreeves.

537
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,612
You know me?

538
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,489
Everybody knows you.

539
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,991
I mean, you're Number Two.

540
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,159
You're a legend.

541
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,997
- Really?
- Mr. Hargreeves, you can't be here.

542
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,499
Herb, is that any way to talk to a legend?

543
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,044
You know how to work this puppy?

544
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,007
- I'm certified to operate the ISB, yes.
- Good.

545
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,885
I need you to look up a date:
November 22, 1963,

546
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,720
the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

547
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,472
Unauthorized use
of the Infinite Switchboard

548
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,348
is a clear violation
of company protocol 67D...

549
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,017
Don't be such a tight-ass.

550
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,561
You don't understand.

551
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,230
- There's been a coup d'état.
- What's that?

552
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,608
- Cadillac?
- No.

553
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,485
[huffs softly]

554
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,612
The Handler has taken over the Commission.

555
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,323
The whole place has gone to heck
in a handbasket,

556
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,657
and people are disappearing.

557
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,368
They would kill us both
if they caught us in here.

558
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,537
Well, you better get started
before they come get us.

559
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,168
One quick look, and then you gotta go.

560
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,252
My man.

561
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,797
[Herb] Okay...

562
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,425
- Oh, no. Why would you... No, no. Bad.
- [switchboard powers down]

563
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,843
Don't hurt the timeline.

564
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,386
That's a rule...

565
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,306
- that I intend to follow.
- [switchboard powering up]

566
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,391
[machines whirring]

567
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,230
This one connects to that one...

568
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,024
[Herb muttering indistinctly]

569
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,489
Okay.

570
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,200
Here we go.

571
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,287
Dallas. November 22, 1963.

572
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,707
[Diego] This is it.

573
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,418
- This is right before the assassination.
- [Herb] Assassination?

574
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,964
[Diego] Pay attention. The president
is about to turn into Dealey Plaza.

575
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,052
One more turn into Elm
and they're gonna start shooting.

576
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,472
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is that?
- [Herb] That's the FBI building.

577
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,516
[Diego] Yeah, but why the hell
did it just blow up?

578
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,018
- [Herb] That's not supposed to happen?
- [Diego] No, that's not sup...

579
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,020
He's driving away. They didn't kill him?

580
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,607
- Holy shit.
- Oh... Oy, that's <i>no bueno.</i>

581
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,152
It wasn't a gunshot, it was an explosion

582
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,364
- we heard on the Frankel footage.
- [reporter] <i>...the attack on Dealey Plaza,</i>

583
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,324
<i>as the Soviets deny all responsibility.</i>

584
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,159
[reporter 2]
<i>Moscow promises a fierce response</i>

585
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,078
<i>in retaliation to American attacks.</i>

586
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,081
[reporter 3] <i>Anchorage, Alaska, has just</i>

- <i>All citizens take cov...</i>
- [flat tone over broadcast]

590
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,966
- That's what Hazel was trying to tell us.
- Hazel?

591
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,343
I mean, this is what causes doomsday.

592
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,262
Do you have another angle
on the FBI building?

593
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,305
[Herb] Watch this.

594
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,182
And...

595
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,851
- [people screaming]
- [wreckage crashing]

596
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,311
[sirens wailing below]

597
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,898
[high-pitched tone resonating, warbling]

598
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,108
Vanya.

599
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,782
Vanya is the bomb.

600
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,200
Vanya <i>is</i> the bomb.

601
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,913
She will always be the bomb.

602
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,542
I need to get back to Dallas.

603
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,002
Now.

604
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,715
We need <i>La Résistance.</i>

605
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,800
[overlapping low chatter]

606

[group grows quiet]

607
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,809
You gotta be kidding me.

608
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,021
I know we don't look like much,
but we're resourceful.

609
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,773
Don't mess with case management.

610
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,066
Stand down, Dot.

611
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,159
{\an8}- [faucet running]
- [Irish music plays, muted]

613
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,288
[sighs softly]

614

[toilet flushes]

615
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,592
Oh. Sorry.

616
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,512
Ugh.

617
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,849
[chuckles] Yeah, that's a waste of time.

618
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,934
Trust me.

619
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,020
Then why were you holding it when
I found you dead in the apocalypse?

620
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,522
[Luther splutters] No idea.

621
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,566
But the guy it belonged to
didn't end the world. Vanya did.

622
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,652
- Timid little Vanya.
- [Luther] Yep.

623
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,154
Is more powerful
than all of us put together.

624
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,740
Turns out, she was pissed about the way
we treated her when we were kids,

625
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,244
so she destroyed the moon
and ended the world.

626
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,871
Huh. Fair enough.

627
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,833
[Luther zips pants, sighs]

628
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,126
- Yeah...
- This is perfect.

629
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,753
We now know exactly what's gonna happen.

630
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,881
Yeah, except it, uh, already did.

631
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,675
Don't think, just listen.

632
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,720
Forget about the little jerk-off's plan.
It's way too complicated.

633
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,557
A much better plan
is for <i>us</i> to travel to 2019.

634
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,809
All we have to do is make nice with Vanya,

635
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,520
stop her from destroying the world.
Easy-peasy.

636
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,397
Hmm.

637
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,566
Well, that's actually...

638
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,484
- That's not bad, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

639
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,777
But what about Five?

640
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,904
I mean, you? I mean,

641
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,323
- the, uh, young you.
- That's not me.

642
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,660
That's a prepubescent photocopy
that got botched in the time jump.

643
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,038
- Besides, it's too late for him anyway.
- Too late?

644
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,790
Paradox psychosis?

645
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,792
Best thing we can do
is put him out of his misery.

646
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,544
What?

647
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:10,089
- You're... You're saying to kill him?
- You're thinking about this all wrong.

648
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,632
- We're not killing anybody.
- No...

649
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,719
Look at me.
I'm Five, and I will still be alive.

650
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,346
All we are doing is getting rid of
a mutant doppelganger.

651
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,099
Amputating a vestigial nipple.

652
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,728
Wait...

653
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,856
are you sure <i>you</i> don't have
paradox psychosis?

654
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,941
I've never felt better in my life.

655

We good?

658
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,702
- We're good.
- You got a deal.

659
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,288
We gotta hurry. Kennedy's en route.

660
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,749
Less than an hour until showtime.

661
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,086
Why are you so anxious to get going
all of a sudden?

662
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,128
Relax.

663
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,881
- You're getting paranoid.
- [scoffing chuckle]

664
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,091
Oh, am I?

665
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,093
[both Fives farting]

666
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,344
Okay, let's roll.

[female interrogator]
<i>She'll start talking soon enough.</i>

669
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,612
Vanya, talking to us
is your only option.

670
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,117
Who is your handler? Answer me.

671
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,493
- [Gibbs echoes]
- [gasps softly]

672
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,286
- Excuse me?
- We're all waiting.

673
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,830
- [Vanya] For what?
- The answer.

674
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,707
I... I don't... I don't understand.

675
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,712
So you're not prepared,
is that what you're saying?

676
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,798
- Well, prepared for what?
- [Ben] It's not her fault.

677
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,967
She hit her head.
She can't remember anything.

678
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,469
She got overheated,
wiped her mind clean.

679
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,930
She's lazy. Didn't study.

680
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,350
- No, no, that's not it. I...
- Maybe she's been faking it all along.

681
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,145
- She's just not ready for this.
- [Reginald] You're all wrong.

682
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,815
Number Seven deliberately chooses
not to remember.

683
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,366
[Vanya] Mom?

684
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,743
Are you okay?

685
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,370
Of course I am.

686
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,038
Why wouldn't I be?

687
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,353
Something wrong?

688
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,733
- Just not hungry.
- [Reginald] Try it.

689
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,069
- It might help you remember.
- [Gibbs echoes] <i>...remember.</i>

690
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,158
[Gibbs]
Vanya, what are you doing in Dallas?

691
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,745
Keep ignoring me
and see what happens.

692
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,289
[female interrogator]
We will get you to talk.

[Vanya grunting and choking]

698
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,545
- Number Seven! Either you remember...
- [siblings laughing]

699
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,049
or you will go to your room
without dessert!

700
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,092
[cutlery rattling]

701
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,052
[Gibbs] What the hell's going on
with the lights?

702
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,971
[female interrogator]
She's not responding.

703
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,347
Let's help motivate her.

704
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,267
[electricity surges]

[shuddering grunts]

708
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,527
[Gibbs]
Are you here to kill the president?

709
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,239
[crying out, groaning]

710
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,324
[Allison panting]

711
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,079
God, why are people so much heavier
when they're dead?

712
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,622
You got a lot of practice at this?

713
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,751
[Klaus chuckles] Yeah.

714
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,338
Hey, so, what was it like
when I possessed you?

715
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,968
It was like sex
with one of the lesser Baldwins.

716
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,346
I mean, you can feel him
clattering around in there,

717
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,472
but do you really care?

718
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,184
Why? What was it like
driving all this hot business?

719
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,730
It... It was like having no skin...

720
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:40,276
but still wanting to touch... everything.

721
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,360
[whispers] Oh, yeah.

722
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,864
Okay. One... two...

- [all gasping, panting]

726
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,247
- [Allison] Oh!
- [Diego] Oh, good.

727
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,374
All right, you're both here.
All right, we gotta go.

728
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,543
Diego, Jesus!

729
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:01,380
[chuckling] Wow.
Number Two, Three, <i>and</i> Four.

730
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,050
We almost have an Umbrella
straight flush here.

731
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,803
Ray, this is my other brother, Diego.

732
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,974
[Diego] Hey, man.
Sorry to crash in here like this.

733
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,227
Hey, who is this guy?

734
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,605
Herb. He worked with Five
at the Commission.

735
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,564
The Commission?

736
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,734
We monitor and maintain
the time-space continuum.

737
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,362
- Okay.
- [Diego] No, for real. I was just there.

738
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,447
It's awesome.
Okay, I got to look at the timeline.

739
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,990
I know what causes doomsday.

740
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,326
It's Vanya.

741
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,619
Wait, what?

742
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,620
How?

743
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,538
Gonna blow up the federal building
at Dealey Plaza

744
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,249
just as the president's passing through
in less than one hour.

745
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,044
We gotta find her and stop her, now.

746
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,421
- Wait, Vanya kills the president?
- [Diego] No, no, no.

747
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,800
See, the explosion causes the motorcade
to drive off. Kennedy lives.

748
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,552
Everybody thinks Russia's behind it,
including the president.

749
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,554
He strikes back, they strike back.

750
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,515
Before you know it,
it's raining nukes.

751
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,266
- Okay, um...
- Holy shit.

752
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,810
- [Allison] Ray? Ray, baby.
- [panting]

753
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,437
- Are... Are you okay? Okay.
- No, I'm not okay.

754
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,773
First of all, this son of bitch
beams into our living room

755
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,567
with yet another one of your brothers,
and he's talking about stopping

756
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,778
one of your sisters
from blowing up some buildings,

757
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,114
and I got a dead man wrapped up
in my best rug, babe.

758
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,908
Okay. Okay, okay. Can we... Can we...
Raymond. Ray. Ray.

759
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,202
Or we can have that shampooed.

760
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,872
We also provide body removal services.
[chuckles]

761

[Raymond's breath trembling]

762
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,167
I love you, Raymond Chestnut...

763
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:26,799
and I really wish I had time
for the nervous breakdown you so deserve.

764
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,303
[Allison inhales shakily]

765
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,348
But you have to go.

766
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,767
I have to go.

767
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,064

Hey, where's that new recruit?
The shaggy hair, caveman face?

771
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,144
[instructor] No clue, sorry.

[indistinct chatter]

776
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,414
[Gibbs] Vanya, I don't wanna keep
doing this to you,

777
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,543
but I have a responsibility to the public,

778
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:48,130
- and I need to know who you are.
- [foreboding instrumental music plays]

779
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,132
[Reginald] Eat up, it's getting cold.

780
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,801
- [Vanya] I don't want it.
- I know you don't want it,

781
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,470
but you can't pretend it doesn't exist.

782
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,679
I'm not pretending.

783
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,889
[Reginald] Of course you are.

784
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,724
You choose to live in a fantasy,

785
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:02,019
a land of make-believe where you don't
have to face up to who you really are.

786
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,022
Rather than face the complexities
of your own existence,

787
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,399
you choose to hide inside someone else's.

788
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,735
A silly life on a silly farm.

789
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,533
That's not meant for you.

790
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,954
- [elevator dings]
- [foreboding instrumental music continues]

- [Allison sighs]
- [doors close]

792
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,959
- [elevator whirring]
- [Allison] I hope we find Vanya in time.

793
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,422
You can't deny your true self any longer,
even if you are afraid.

794
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,925
- [panting] I'm not afraid.
- [Reginald] Then eat!

795
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,469
One more bite, and you can go.

796
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,180
[foreboding instrumental music building]

797
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,398
[thunder booms]

798
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,157
[choking]

799
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,910
[thunder crashing]

800
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,870
[female interrogator]
What the hell is happening?

801
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,330
[Gibbs] We've gotta stop her.

802
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,332
[gasping]

803
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,917
[groaning softly]

804
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,794
[female interrogator]
You're going to have to terminate.

805
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,130
[Gibbs] I'm trying! I'm trying!

806
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,841
- [shuddering cries]
- [electricity crackling]

807
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,555
[energy crackling]

808
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,558
- [Gibbs] How is she still alive?
- [tortured moans]

809
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,892
I remember.

810
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,394
I remember.

811
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,149
[energy crackling, thrumming]

812
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,987
[rumbling, rattling]

813
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,406
[elevator creaking]

814
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,658
- [wind whistling]
- [elevator dings]

815
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,494
[all grunting, gasping]

816
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,343
[Allison cries out]

817
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,054
[gasping]

818
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,641
[grunts]

819
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,354
- [shouts]
- [energy crackling]

820
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,442
[Allison gasping]

821
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,819
[Klaus] Question, guys.

822
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,031
Who are we trying to save Vanya from?

823
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:19,948
[both] FBI!

824
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:24,161
But if they're all sucking ceiling
right now, why hasn't she stopped?

825
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,541
[intense crackling, thrumming]

826
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,180
[rock violin music playing]

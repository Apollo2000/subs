00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,389
- Wh... What does that even mean?
- I don't know. I can't explain, but...

157
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,808
I know that he needs my help.

158
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,811
[sighs softly] I need your help, too.

159
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,647
I'm scared.

160
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,151
And for the first time in my life,
I don't wanna do it alone.

161
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,071
I want my family by my side.

162

Look, I'm sorry.

163
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,665
We have other priorities right now.

164
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,543
[Five] Diego's right.

165
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,587
For once.

166
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,049
We need to make our stand here and now.

167
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,353
[Vanya] Okay.

168
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,689

Isn't he?

175
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:13,135
He traded his life for mine...
while he saved the world in the process.

00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,137
Pfft. Show-off.

178

me?

179
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,485
He wanted me to tell you
that he was too scared to go to the light.

180
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,989
It wasn't you that made him stay.

And what business is that?

As the head of the Commission,

276
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,171
I've decided to eliminate
the criminals responsible

for the assassination
of the former board of directors.

Yeah, right. We didn't kill the board.

Uh, actually, Diego,
that's not entirely accurate.

You didn't tell them.

Enough. The point is,
all of you are going to die today. Hmm?

Oh. Well, I don't like your chances.

Well, we got two choices:
fight and die now or run and die later.

- Either way, we're food for worms.
- Preference?

Luther, if you swallowed your tongue,
you wouldn't be talking, you big moron.

Someone who wants to kill your brother.

404
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,060
Well, that's understandable.
Diego can be a lot to handle.

And you don't talk back.

476
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,020
I like that.

477
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,147
[Diego] Help!

478
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,065
[groaning softly]

479
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,151
[Diego] Vanya! Help!

480
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,861
Come on, man!

481
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:48,862
Hey!

482
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,239
What took you so long?

483
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,366
Well, we're here now.
Do you wanna stop complaining?

484
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,577
- Or we could just leave you here.
- [Allison] What he said.

485
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,746
Does everything in this family
have to be a discussion?

486
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,997
[Luther straining]

487
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,582
[Allison] Go, go, go, go!

488
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,459
- [Luther] Are you out?
- [Diego] Yeah!

489
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,793
[Luther grunts]

490
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,880
- Team Zero! Unstoppable.
- All right.

491
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,256
[exhales sharply]

492
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,510
- [Luther] Uh...
- Okay, has anyone seen Five?

493
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,386
[Luther]
I don't know, he's around somewhere.

494
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,680
By the way,
your ex-girlfriend can blink like Five.

495
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,225
Yeah, that bitch just rumored me
so I couldn't breathe.

496
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,561
And destroyed, like, half the farm
with a shock wave. So unoriginal.

497
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,439
If she can do everything we can,
she might as well just be one of us.

498
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,440
[chuckles] Yeah.

499
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:28,944
[Luther] No.

500
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,946
No, there's no way. It can't be.

501
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,156
It's a reasonable conclusion.

502
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,824
Eh, but there were only seven of us.

503
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,618
Maybe we need to consider
that there's more.

504
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,286
[Allison] Are we surprised?

505
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,247
Dad never told us the whole truth
about anything.

506
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,874
But she's not our biological sister...

507
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,668
right?

508
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,048
Okay, so, if she can mirror our powers,

509
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,342
that means anything we throw at her,
she can match, right?

510
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,178
Yeah, but she can only mirror
one of our powers at a time.

511
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,305
You sure about that?

512

Harlan, my love...

516
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:11,820
I can take you to a place where
you will be properly understood,

517
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,823

I understand your kind.

Doesn't feel so good, does it?

[Five gasps]

523
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,460
I can tap into your potential,

524
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,671
and together, just the two of us,

525
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,008
we can do<i> incredible</i> things. Hmm?

Let's finish this thing.

530
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,563
[whispers] No.

[Lila panting]

533
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,193
You are going to suffer for what you did.

534
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,572
[scoffs] Lady, I got no idea
what you're talkin' about.

535
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,699
Ronnie and Anita Gill.

536
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,244
- Mean nothing to me.
- 1993, East London.

537
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,290
You hog-tied them
and you shot them in the head.

538
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,085
The flower merchants.

539
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,254
[Anita sobbing] No, no! No!

540
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,464
They were your parents?

541
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,591
- [Ronnie] No, don't! No, please...
- [casing clatters]

[silenced gunshot]

543
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,969
[Lila]
And they never did anything to anyone.

544
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,640
- They didn't deserve to die like that.
- [Five] You're right, all right?

545
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,768
I killed them. But I killed
a lot of people over the years.

546
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,729
It was all just a job. All right?
That was never personal.

547
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,565
[laughs] "Never personal," my ass.

548
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,610
Yeah, I've killed.
It's always, always personal.

549
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,528
That's why you're not cut out
to be an assassin.

550
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,947
- Bet your life on that?
- You wanna blame someone?

551
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,033
Blame the Handler, all right?
She faked the kill order.

552
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,451
Bullshit. I saw the kill order.

553
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,578
AJ Carmichael ordered it,
and you carried it out.

554
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,538
Lila, listen to what I'm telling you,
all right?

555
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,582
The Handler gave me the kill order.

556
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,876
She came on the job,
which she'd never done before.

557
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,212
You're Commission.
You know execs never go on jobs,

558
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,797
but that day in London, she was there.

559
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,801
- Ask yourself <i>why.</i>
- Stop trying to muddy the waters.

560
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,679
I never realized what she was up to
at the time, but...

561
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,681
now it all makes sense.

562
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,265
What?

563
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,478
She never cared about your parents.
She was looking for <i>you.</i>

564
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,980
[whispers] Why?

565
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,527
[Diego] 'Cause you're one of us.

566
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,073
The Handler stole you, Lila.

567
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,909
Just like our asshole father
took all of us.

568
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,828
- No. It's not the same thing.
- [Diego] You're right.

569
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,664
Because he didn't
have our parents murdered.

570
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,375
Listen to me, Lila.

571
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,587
You were born October 1, 1989,

572
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,339
the same day as all of us.

573
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,883
- Stay back!
- Hey! Hey, stop! Wait. Wait. Hey!

574
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,302
- Lila? Lila, stop.
- I trusted you.

575
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,055
I got you a job,
I even introduced you to my mother,

576
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,933
- and then you took off on me.
- Because I needed to save the world!

577
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,103
She's using you, Lila.

578
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,312
The Handler.

579
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,898
[Lila] You're wrong. She raised me.

580
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,651
- She loves me.
- Yeah, you know what?

581
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,530
Love shouldn't have to hurt this much.

582

[gags]

583
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,121
- All right, I tried.
- He's right. We have to kill her.

584
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,873
Hey! Five! Five, stop.

585
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,000
I got it.

586
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,961
Hey, Lila.

587
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,463
Truth?

588
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,923
She's dangerous.

589
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,595
And you're scared of what she'll do
with all that new power.

590
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,847
That's why you dragged me
to the Commission.

591
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,809
Because I know what it's like
to love dangerous people.

592
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,896
Difference is...

593

they love me back.

594
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,242
- Shut up.
- The only thing she loves is power.

595
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,995
Now, the minute she can't use you,

596
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:53,291
she will turn on you, and deep down,
I <i>know</i> you know that.

597
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,293
You don't know me, Diego.

598

Don't I?

599
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,431
I know that <i>we</i> can be your family...

I need to know that we can get past this,

610
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,284
be a happy family again.

1
00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:04,698
Hey, guys.
Where are Marshall and Lily?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,616
Something terrible
happened.

3
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:08,418
Are they okay?
Are they in the hospital?

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,686
No.

5
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:13,723
Somewhere much... much worse.

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:14,958
Long Island!

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,459
Tonight, we're moving
out there for good.

8
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:20,013
Yeah. Here are your spare
keys to our new house.

9
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:21,414
Long Island?

10
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,799
I don't understand.

11
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:25,001
You can get spray tans here.

12
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:26,086
I never let myself

13
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:28,221
believe this day
would really come.

14
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:29,472
It's like when
they canceled

15
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:31,758
<i>Party of Five</i>
for the second time.

16
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:36,746
I mean when they...
canceled sports.

17
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:39,549
Guys, we'll still see
each other all the time,

18
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:41,050
and we'll talk
on the phone.

19
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:43,103
And I know people say
that having kids means

20
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:44,604
you won't see your
friends anymore, but...

21
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:46,156
Oh, God, this is
good-bye, isn't it?

22
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:47,524
No. Stop it.

23
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:48,775
Guys, this doesn't

24
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:50,026
change anything.

25
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:53,280
We are only a 46-minute
train ride away.

26
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:54,414
Just pop out

27
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,749
whenever you want.

28
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:58,618
So... I guess
this seat is open.

29
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:02,839
I'll go get a chair.

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,293
So that's it.

31
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:07,744
No more Marshall.

32
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:08,795
No more Lily.

33
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:10,413
They're gone.

34
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:12,415
Which means...

35
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:15,084
no lame married couple

36
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:17,804
shooting down
all my amazing ideas.

37
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:19,889
Guys, great news.

38
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,866
I'm the new leader
of the gang!

<i>Marshall and Lily were almost</i>
<i>done decorating their new home.</i>

42
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:40,827
I like it there much better.
Yeah.

43
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:41,944
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

44
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,496
Wrong!

45
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,948
This can't go here.

46
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,051
<i>Kids, when he found out</i>
<i>she was pregnant,</i>

47
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:49,619
<i>Lily's estranged father</i>

48
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:51,805

<i>on her doorstep.</i>

49
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,807

50
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:56,493
<i>But after two weeks,</i>
<i>they'd had just about enough.</i>

51
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:57,844
That has to go there

52
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:59,729
to cover up
the splintery floorboard.

53
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,680
And you can't hang

54
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:02,098
this picture here.

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,567
This isn't plaster;
it's dried toothpaste.

56
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:08,338
Guys, you're so lucky I'm here.

57
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,023
I grew up in this house.

58
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,475
I know it like
the back of my hand.

59
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:15,195
And this lamp
absolutely cannot be here.

60
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:16,946
Why not?

61
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:19,082
Blocks my view
of the Widow Rodriguez

62
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:21,251
doing her Jane Fonda workouts.

63
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:23,169
Isn't she
a little old, Dad?

64
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:26,156
Oh, you didn't see her
when I was a kid.

65
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:29,359
In my mind, she'll always be 54.

66
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:35,181
I know he means well, but
I can't take it anymore.

67
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,999
He won't leave,
and-and he's acting

68
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,835
like this is his house.
No, I know.

69
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:41,354
And these annoying notes
he keeps leaving around?

70
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:44,057
"I need absolute silence
when practicing the drums."

71
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:47,009
"Do not touch the fudge
in my nightstand."

72
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,696
"We need ant traps
for my nightstand."

73
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:52,348
I find myself
hiding out here

74
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,317
just because it's the only room
in the house

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,485
where he can't boss us around.

76
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:56,703
Great news.

77
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:59,188
I put new batteries
in the old intercom system.

78
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,374
Now we can communicate
at all times.

79
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,543
Mickey out.

80
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,913
Look at what's become
of our booth.

81
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:09,249
Looks like my old
shop teacher's hand--

82
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,901
just sort of
missing something.

83
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,636
Enough!

84
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:16,055
I am sick of you two
wallowing in sadness,

85
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,674
instead of doing
the healthy thing

86
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:19,476
and pretending
anyone who leaves you

87
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:21,928
never existed
in the first place.

88
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,396
I hate to agree with Barney's

89
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:24,547
near-paralyzing
abandonment issues,

90
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:25,932
but he has a point.

91
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:27,100
You can't just stop living

92
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:28,885
because two of your friends
moved away.

93
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,270
Precisely.

94
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:34,107
Now, as new group leader,
I say we go out and do something

95
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,526
that we never would have done
with Marshall and Lily here.

96
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:37,944
Ooh.

97
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:42,782
Remember that amazing idea
I had that one time?

98
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:45,568
Let's go to a strip club.
Nope.

99
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,537
So what do you say?

100
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,239
Let's declare
our independence

101
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:53,843
with an on-da-peen dance.

102
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,297
On-the-peen dance.

103
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,798
No, we got it.
We got it.

104
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,082
Let's go to a strip club!

105
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:01,134
Well...

106
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,418
I'm going to miss
them anywhere.

107
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,554
Might as well see some
cans while I'm at it.

108
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:05,755
I'll take it!

109
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:07,524
Robin, Kevin, you in?

110
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,393
<i>Kids, early in any</i>
<i>relationship,</i>

111
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:13,096
<i>there's a phase where you don't</i>
<i>say no to anything.</i>

112
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:15,832
<i>Because you want</i>
<i>to seem interesting...</i>

113
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,201
<i>adventurous...</i>

114
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,953
<i>and open-minded.</i>

115
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,071
<i>I call it</i>
<i>Early Relationship Chicken.</i>

116
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,290
Well, I'm open
to anything.

117
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,743
Oh, mos' def.

118
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,611
So...
So...

119
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,964
<i>I don't want to go</i>
<i>to a strip club.</i>

120
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,499
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to go to a strip club.</i>

121
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,717
<i>But I don't want him</i>
<i>to think I'm some prude.</i>

122
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,837
<i>Man, we've been saying "so"</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

123
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,839
Yeah!
Yeah!

124
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:42,342
Yes!

125
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,061
Tonight is going
to be legen--

126
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:47,347
Wait, are we sure it's a
good idea to go to a strip club?

127
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:51,234
Shut up, Lily!
I'm in charge now-- dary!

128
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,571
I've got no
cell reception.

129
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:56,189
I wanted to call Ted.

130
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,273
This feels weird.

131
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,975
The last time I lived
this far from him

132
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:00,026
was my semester abroad.

133
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:02,028
You never did a semester abroad.

134
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,479
That's what I called it
when we lived

135
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,348
on opposite sides of campus.

136
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,367
Wrong!

137
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:09,219
Please tell me you're not
plugging that in there.

138
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:12,205
Yes, Mickey,
that's exactly what I'm doing.

139
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,823
All right, fine.
I won't say anything.

140
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:16,342
It's... just that
this was my room

141
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:17,660
when I growing up,

142
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,879
so I know it a little
better than you.

143
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,665
Lot of great memories here.

144
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,385
Mostly just discovering my body.

145
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,604
That's it.

146
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:28,938
Mickey, since you got here,

147
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,224
you've been nothing
but judgmental and pushy

148
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:33,977
and strangely obsessed
with your adolescent sex life.

149
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,228
Tomorrow morning,

150
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,013
you're out of here.

151
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:39,181
Well, I-I've just been trying
to help you...

152
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:40,617
We don't need your help!

153
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:46,188
I...

154
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,874
Oh, it-it's okay, baby.

155
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:49,709
It had to be done.

156
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,667
Too bad the one person

157
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:59,535
who could stop you
from making mistakes like that

158
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,404
was told he has to move out
next month.

159
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:04,240
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!

160
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:07,376
Would either of you
like a dance?

161
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:11,514
I'm always ready to rock.

162
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:14,350
And I'm always ready to roll.

163
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,686
So...
So...

164
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,905
<i>I'm not ready to rock.</i>

165
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:21,074
<i>Rolling makes me dizzy.</i>

166
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,694
Hell, yeah!
Yeah!

167
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:27,747
I'm buying my man a lap dance,
'cause that's just how I do!

168
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:29,398
Party like a
rock star!

169
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,517
Party like a rock star...

170
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,119
Uh, hey, guys.

171
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:34,370
It's Ted.

172
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,072
Um... you're probably busy
with the move still.

173
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:37,340
Um...

174
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:40,293
Give me a call
if you want to gab.

175
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,629
Sorry about using
the word "gab."

176
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,964
Ted, stop pining
over Marshall and Lily.

177
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:46,883
Have some self-respect.

178
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:49,418
Now, put this fiver
in your mouth so...

179
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,420
that stripper with the lazy eye
can vacuum it up with...

180
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:52,639
Barney!
Wh-what?

181
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,023
I'm allowed to miss them, okay?

182
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,358
They're my two best friends.

183
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,859
I'm your two best friends!

184
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,028
And we're here tonight

185
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,597
to show you there's no need
to miss something

186
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,200
when you can replace it
with something better.

187
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:07,036
Gentlemen, say hello
to J-J-J-Jasmine!

188
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,249
Remember her?

189
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:23,252
<i>- So, a while back, we discovered
the most amazing thing </i>-

190
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:24,753
<i>Lily had a doppelganger</i>

191
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:28,290
<i>who was a Russian stripper.</i>

192
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,825
Look at her, Ted.

193
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,510
She's just like old,

194
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,594
less-good Lily,

195
00:07:32,596 --> 00:07:33,929
but instead of
bossing us around,

196
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,180
she shows us her boobs.

197
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:36,748
No touching.

198
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,051
Okay, a little
bossing us around.

199
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,053
I call her Better Lily.

200
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,440
Hey, Better Lily, please
dance for my friend.

201
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:46,775
Barney, I don't
need a lap dance.

202
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:49,228
I need to talk
to my friends.

203
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,596
Who says you
can't do both?

204
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:53,282
Talk to her.
She's got ears.

205
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:55,433
Yes, she does have ears.

206
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:57,486
You want to touch my
girlfriend's boobs?

207
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:58,954
50 bucks.

208
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:02,624
Wait-- Better Lily
is dating this behemoth?

209
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:04,743
Sound like anyone
you know?

210
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,444
That's New Marshall.

211
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,848
This is our gang now.

212
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:24,462
Hey, guys, Ted again.

213
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:26,798
Starting to think
you forgot about me.

214
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,901
Or replaced me
with some cool neighbor.

215
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:30,352
What's his name?!

216
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:32,137
I'm totally kidding.

217
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,689
Anyway, uh...

218
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:35,657
just trying to remember
what your faces look like.

219
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,576
Ted, when they serve alcohol
at a strip club,

220
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:39,278
you're not allowed
to show your vagina.

221
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,498
100 bucks, and you
will see the world, my friend.

222
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,783
They're already
ignoring my calls?

223
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,335
Look, I'm realistic.

224
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:49,087
I knew I'd have to get used
to going to the dentist alone,

225
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,956
but I didn't think
they'd cut me out completely.

226
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:51,957
If they don't

227
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,042
need us, we don't need them.

228
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,844
Yes! Finally!

229
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:58,714
By the way, did you see
how she opened that bottle?

230
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,568
Whoa.

231
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,487
Lights out in the suburbs
is... is really dark.

232
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,838
Where's the fuse box?

233
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,140
I don't know.

234
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,976
I know where it is.

235
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:14,646
Maybe I could fix it for you,
if I wasn't so busy packing.

236
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,014
You know what?

237
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:18,016
I bet the fuse box
is in the basement.

238
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:19,535
I'll just... I'll go
find it myself.

239
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:20,869
How hard can it be?

240
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,289
As hard as that desk
you just walked into?

241
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,494
Good burn, Mickey.

242
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:32,464
You deserve a little
nightstand fudge for that one.

243
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:33,865
<i>Where do I look?</i>

244
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:35,551
<i>I mean, I can't look</i>
<i>at her chest.</i>

245
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:36,919
<i>Damn it! I just did.</i>

246
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,720
<i>Maybe Robin didn't notice.</i>

247
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:41,539
<i>Man, he's really up</i>
<i>in those jugs.</i>

248
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:43,892
Shake it, baby!

249
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,710
A playa's gotta play!

250
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:47,179
<i>This is weird.</i>

251
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:49,481
<i>I'll just look her</i>
<i>in the eyes.</i>

252
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:53,235
<i>Is he falling in love</i>
<i>with this stripper?</i>

253
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:54,552
<i>Quick, do something cool.</i>

254
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,939
Make it rain, son!

255
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,240
Money ain't no thang!

256
00:09:58,242 --> 00:10:02,160
<i>Damn it,</i>
<i>there was a 20 in there.</i>

257
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,902
Hello, Mr. Eriksen.

258
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,504
From the sound
of the wind chimes,

259
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,756
I hear you've made it
to the first floor.

260
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,842
Okay... you know what, Mickey?

261
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:20,545
You can save the creepy
game master routine.

262
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:23,465
It's only kind of
terrifying me.

263
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,934
Oh, but the game has just begun.

264
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:28,753
I call it "Try Not to Bang into
All the Furniture and Stuff

265
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:33,258
on Your Way to the Fuse Box
in the Basement, Marshall."

266
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,527
That's just a working title.

267
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,029
Hey!

268
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:39,982
Got a little boob glitter
on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy.

269
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:41,933
Straight pimpin'.

270
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:44,036
Barney, you got
a little bit, too.

271
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:46,288
Where?

272
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:48,957
Did I get it?

273
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,108
Yeah, you got it.

274
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,710
Who needs Marshall
and Lily?

275
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:53,629
We got a new gang,

276
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:56,214
and we're all going to
hang out together forever.

277
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:57,666
My shift is done.

278
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:58,834
Good-bye.

279
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:00,452
Wait, stop!

280
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:02,954
Technically, this song's not
over, so we still own you.

281
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:05,057
Plus we're best friends!

282
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:06,842
Where to next?

283
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,343
We go to underground
poker game

284
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:10,679
in mostly-abandoned
insane asylum.

285
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,347
Yes!

286
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,433
This is gonna be awesome,

287
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:16,451
and when it is, I want
you all to remember

288
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:18,770
who led you there:
Barney Stinson,

289
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:20,656
new group leader.

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,417
Yay!

291
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:35,653
I'm winning all
your chippies!

292
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,674
Let's not drink
when we're...

293
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:39,675
I'm thirsty; it's good.

294
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:41,009
It's good.

295
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:43,879
Marshall, I just remembered

296
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:46,932
I saw a box of matches
in the drawer by the trash can.

297
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,134
Okay, thanks, baby.

298
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,276
Lily, I can't find them.

299
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:00,612
Looking for these?

300
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,366
Oh, right, you can't see me.

301
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:08,286
Um, well, I'm burning the
matches you so desperately need.

302
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,176
Aah, ooh, ow!

303
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:16,044
Ow.

304
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,079
Hah! Oh!

305
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:21,032
Mickey... guess who found
the basement stairs?

306
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,368
I'll be down
at that fuse box in no time,

307
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,703
and when I get there,

308
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,873
I'm sure that I'll figure out
how fuse boxes work,

309
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,208
so it'll be fine.

310
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,560
Hey, Marshall,

311
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,812
I know I've been
messing with you,

312
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:36,214
but seriously,
that second step, don't...

313
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:38,316
I don't want to hear it, Mickey.

314
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:44,322
Oh, my knee!

315
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,274
Ow!

316
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:49,494
And watch out for my drum set.

317
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:53,081
I win again!

318
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,332
I was bluffing.

319
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,218
I didn't even have enough cards.

320
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:00,905
Ted, please stop winning.

321
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:03,458
Hey, look, it's the
New York City skyline.

00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:23,171
I'd expect this

328
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,990
or Jagged Cheek Scar,

329

but not you.

331

Why don't I get nickname?

332
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:31,930
Because you have too

You get one thing!

334

See, that's why
you bring New Marshall.

335
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:51,149
We go to party in
slaughterhouse.

336
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:52,651
You come?

337
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:55,086

We got to hit that party!

346
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:16,775
Sweet.

347
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:19,644
Lily?

348
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:23,231
I think we made a mistake
moving out to the suburbs.

349
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:25,200
I miss our home.

350
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:28,153
I miss our booth
with our friends.

351
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:33,875
And I'm pretty sure I have
a drumstick...

352
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:36,528
somewhere bad.

353
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,863
Dad, why are you
acting like this?

354
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:41,032
Well, I was just
trying to be helpful,

355
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:43,418
but you guys want me out
by the Fourth of July.

356
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,469
Tomorrow.

357
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,305
You know what
a helpful father,

358
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,758
not to mention grandfather,
might do?

359
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,310
Get these lights back on.

360
00:14:57,717 --> 00:14:59,351
Okay, Marshall, listen up.

361
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:01,436
I'm gonna get you
to that fuse box.

362
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:04,439
Can't you just come down here
and do it for me, please?

363
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,491
I don't know anything
about this house.

364
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:07,692
No, Marshall...

365
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:10,945
you don't know anything
about <i>your</i> house.

366
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,402
All right, we got a lot
of work to do.

367
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:20,121
Wait here,
we get you

368
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:22,407
on VPI list for party.

369
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:25,927
You give us, uh,
$200 per person.

370
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,128
Cover charge.

371
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,547
That's pretty steep
for a cover charge.

372
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,716
Is very good party.

373
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:36,621
Is party for, uh, New York
"Yunkees" and Coca-Cola.

374
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:37,972
Oh, my God.

375
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:39,974
A Coca-Cola Yankees party?

376
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:42,193
That sounds like a real thing.

377
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:47,465
Okay, now, Marshall,
take three steps forward,

378
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,568
while ducking underneath
the broken ceiling fan.

379
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:52,804
Now look to your left

380
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:54,823
and spit.

381
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,459
That's the water heater.

382
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,910
Want to stay away from that.

383
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:03,164
That baby is hotter than the
Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.

384
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:07,302
Okay, now past the washer and
dryer is the hardest part.

385
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:10,638
You're gonna have to belly-crawl
underneath the ping-pong table

386
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,557
and don't so much as nudge it.

387
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,641
Why not?

388
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:16,478
Because there are
900 dominos set up

389
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,313
in the shape of Barbara Eden.

390
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:20,932
Big, big <i>I Dream Of Jeannie</i> fan.

391
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:25,937
I'm clear.

392
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,028
I don't know what
that sound is, Mickey.

393
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,147
That's the sound of Barbara
Eden never banging me.

394
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,198
That's what that is.

395
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,117
Dad, get it back.

396
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:42,253
Come on.

397
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:44,839
Okay, Marshall,

398
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,541
take three steps forward,

399
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:48,960
and you should be
at the fuse box.

400
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:51,129
Do you think he made it?

401
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:56,351
I did it!

402
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:57,802
No, Marshall...

403
00:16:57,804 --> 00:17:00,021
<i>you</i> did it.

Well, judging from
how many clients

411
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:23,361
that hooker has serviced,

412
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:24,963
I'd say we've been
here almost an hour.

413
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:27,081
Ted, we've been robbed.

414
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,201
Better Lily and New Marshall
would never rob us.

415
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:32,120
They're our best friends.

416
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,210
Damn it, Ted.

417
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:41,679
New Marshall is
an escaped zoo bear

418
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,983
and the only thing that Better
Lily is better at than our Lily

419
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,684
is over-the-pants hand stuff.

420
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:49,053
I'm assuming.

421
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,238
I'll admit it.

422
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,739
I can't lead this group.

423
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:53,525
We need Marshall and Lily.

424
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:55,393
But they're gone, aren't they?

425
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,862
I mean, it'll go from seeing
them a couple times a week,

426
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,664
to a couple times a month,

427
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,000
and then it'll just
be holiday parties.

428
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,869
Then the years pass,

429
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:06,538
and you find out
Marshall's dead,

430
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,090
and you're there for Lily
emotionally at first,

431
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:12,410
but then it becomes sexual,
and you feel guilty,

432
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,380
but maybe that guilt just makes
it dirtier and better...

433
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:16,747
No, I won't let that happen.

434
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,299
Especially that last part.

435
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:21,919
Look, I know I've been a little
drunk and naive tonight,

436
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:22,971
but here's what's gonna happen.

437
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:24,305
First, we're gonna leave a note

438
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:26,357
for Better Lily and Arvydas,
they're worriers.

439
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,809
Oh, buddy.
Then,

440
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:30,562
we're gonna go see Only Marshall
and One-Of-A-Kind Lily

441
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:31,929
because they're our best friends

442
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:33,264
and they're only
46 minutes away.

443
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,532
Are you with me?

444
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,818
Kind of resent the power grab,
but okay, let's go!

445
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,935
Hey,

446
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:39,787
do you want to come to
Long Island with us?

447
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:43,241
Uh, well, still a few more
hours before the sun comes up.

448
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:44,959
So...

449
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:46,544
No.
No?

450
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:47,445
Is that bad?

451
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:50,164
No, it's great.

452
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,633
Ooh, that felt so good.

453
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:53,951
I hate doing things
and going anywhere!

454
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:55,219
Oh, new experiences suck!

455
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:58,640
While we're at it,
I hate high-fiving you!

456
00:18:58,642 --> 00:18:59,807
I know.

457
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,175
We're adults who are
sleeping together,

458
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:03,011
not teens pledging a frat.

459
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:11,185
<i>Oh, man, I really</i>
<i>liked the high-five.</i>

460
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:15,473
<i>The next morning, Marshall</i>
<i>and Lily woke up to a surprise.</i>

461
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,565
Hey, what are... what
are you guys doing here?

462
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:28,953
Just wanted to make
sure this key worked.

463
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:31,322
We missed you.

464
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,424
Give mama a hug.

465
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,494
Oh...

466
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,262
Don't check your voicemail.

467
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,048
Y-You might have
a couple weird ones.

468
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,683
You hear this?!

469
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,785
This is the sound
of me moving on.

470
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:52,894
Yeah, I'm a stripper.

471
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:55,930
Okay, who wants pancakes?

472
00:19:57,233 --> 00:20:00,234
Which two of you want pancakes?

473
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:01,369
I'll make more.

474
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:02,403
Oh, good-good-good,
'cause I want pancakes.

475
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,488
There you go.

476
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,739
Thank you, okay.

477
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,174
Enjoy them.

478
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:07,942
Hey, honey, look,

479
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,410
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

480
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:11,796
Okay? I'll leave
right after breakfast.

481
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,464
I'll crash with some friends.

482
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:14,916
Dad, you know what?

483
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:16,200
You can stay.

484
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:17,051
Oh, thank God.

485
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:19,036
I got no friends.

486
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,888
I'll be here two weeks, tops.

487
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,925
<i>It wasn't two weeks.</i>

488
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:25,710
<i>Would the five</i>
<i>of us always live</i>

489
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:27,645
<i>within a few minutes</i>
<i>of that booth?</i>

490
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:31,638
<i>No, that's life, kids,</i>
<i>but here's what I discovered.</i>

491
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:35,133
<i>Our booth was wherever</i>
<i>the five of us were together.</i>

That's right, Widow Rodriguez.

494
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,989
Stretch it.

495
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:46,640
Work those gams.

496
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:48,509
Ooh, yeah.

497
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,194
Grab that left arm.

498
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:52,496
Clutch that chest.

499
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:55,042
Fall down really fast.

500
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:57,796
Oh, my God!
Somebody call 911!

1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,709
Kids, I'll never forget
the first time

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,379
I told your mother I loved her.

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,397
It was a rainy day in New York.

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:08,749
<i>We just had a horrible lunch.</i>

5
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:10,717
<i>The movie we wanted to see
was sold out,</i>

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,802
<i>and I just looked at her</i>

7
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,704
<i>and said, "I love you."</i>

8
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:16,123
<i>It was a big deal for me.</i>

9
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,725
<i>I hadn't said that
to a girl since...</i>

10
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,511
I love you, Robin.

11
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:23,063
I'm serious.

12
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:27,017
Do you remember why we
broke up in the first place?

13
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,318
We asked each other,
"Where do you want

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,470
<i>to be in five years?"</i>

15
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:32,689
<i>And our answers
were just too different.</i>

16
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:34,057
Well, it's
five years later,

17
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:37,244
and where are we?

18
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,079
Standing on the roof

19
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,898
<i>where I kissed you
for the first time.</i>

20
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,003
I know this is
a lot to process,

21
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,172
so no pressure here.

22
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:51,758
Just... what do you think?

23
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:54,244
You know what?
You're exhausted, it's late.

24
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:55,245
Let's just go to sleep.

25
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,413
Well, good night.

26
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:01,685
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

27
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,187
<i>Okay, I can fix this.</i>

28
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:07,407
<i>I- I was just temporarily insane
because of my Lyme disease,</i>

29
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,412
<i>which I got on a camping trip
that I didn't tell her about</i>

30
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:17,451
<i>because... I go camping
in secret.</i>

31
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,286
<i>Perfect.</i>

32
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,371
<i>Or I could say, "I'm sorry,
we're great as friends.</i>

33
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,990
<i>Let's just forget
I ever said anything."</i>

34
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:23,991
<i>Yeah, that's probably better.</i>

35
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:26,076
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

36
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:31,948
I go camping in secret.

Wow, Ted, I...
wow, okay.

40
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:55,690
You got to give
me a minute here.

41
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:57,557
Yeah, of course.

42
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:00,610
Okay, um, we need to
t- talk about this.

43
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:03,980
This time yesterday,
I was in Vermont

44
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:05,449
engaged to another man.

45
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:09,453
I mean, it's been 24 hours
of emotional mayhem,

46
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,488
and, and the day
is still not over.

47
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,989
I mean, I swear
to God,

48
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,708
if there's any more surprises,
I'm gonna hit someone!

49
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:18,361
... comrade.

50
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,497
That means,

51
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,382
"Hello, coworker."

52
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:24,367
You ready for our trip
to Mother Russia?

53
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:27,270
<i>Oh, yeah, Aunt Robin
was thrilled World Wide News</i>

54
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,222
<i>asked her to go to Moscow
to cover Maslenitsa.</i>

55
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,757
<i>She was less thrilled
to discover</i>

56
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,643
<i>Maslenitsa is the city's
annual butter festival.</i>

57
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:36,146
<i>Even worse, she'd spend
an entire week with all those</i>

58
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,800
<i>buttery Russians
and her archenemy Patrice.</i>

59
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:44,254
Uh, our flight leaves
at 9:00 p.m., not a.m.

60
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:46,940
God... Patrice!

61
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:49,058
But, Robin,
the schedule says 9:00 a.m.

62
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,777
and my ticket says 9:00 a.m.

63
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,913
and all the e-mail reminders
said 9:00 a.m.

64
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:54,781
and our boss in the car
downstairs said...

65
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,082
Okay, Patrice, I get it!

66
00:02:56,084 --> 00:02:57,250
Oh, no!

67
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:58,869
Pair of pants
coming in hot!

68
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,086
Noise-canceling
headphones.

69
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:01,538
Oh, I don't need 'em.

70
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,623
It's a ten-hour flight and
your sitting next to Patrice.

71
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,075
Oh, God,
where's my cough syrup?

72
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,194
You're gonna make it.

73
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:08,411
I'll bring
your bag down.

74
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:10,096
Where are my shoes?
Where are my shoes?!

75
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:11,681
Don't worry. It's fine.

76
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:12,883
And look, about all this...
Just go.

77
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:14,250
Good-bye.
Bye.

78
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,189
Why didn't I kiss her?

79
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,060
We'll continue this
when I get back.

80
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:34,788
Hello.

81
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,072
I know it's early,

82
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:37,991
but can you meet me
at the bar right now, alone?

83
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:39,442
I'm on my way.

84
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:40,961
I got to meet Ted
at the bar.

85
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,495
It's 7:00 a.m.

86
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:46,499
Man, Ted really needs to work
on his boundaries.

87
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,618
Shh, guys, seriously.

88
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:51,888
Why are you in our bed?

89
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,141
I took the drunk train
and got stuck out here.

90
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:57,627
Oh, God, I am so hung-over.

91
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,430
Oh, God,
Lily's not wearing a bra!

92
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:01,848
Shh!

93
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,934
Bye, baby.

94
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,237
Do you think...?

95
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,989
Okay, I already know
I don't want to hear this.

96
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,824
Do you think
that if we did it...

97
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,642
Yeah, I was right.
I don't want to hear this.

98
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,661
...and I did
a really good job...

99
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:15,912
Please leave.

100
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:19,816
...that I could turn that
into my baby?

101
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:22,151
I think I'm gonna throw up.

102
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,871
Morning sickness?
No.

103
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:28,475
It's crazy, right?

104
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,626
Are you shocked?

105
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:31,878
No, I'm not shocked.
You're in love with Robin.

106
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,179
Do you remember back

107
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,331
at Christmas when she was upset,
you didn't even know why,

108
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,801
<i>and you spent eight hours
setting up Christmas lights</i>

109
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,669
<i>in the apartment
just to cheer her up.</i>

110
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,838
That was a platonic friend thing.
A platonic friend thing?

111
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,557
Really? Ted,
let me ask you a question.

112
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,309
Would you have done that for me?

113
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:49,145
You probably would have.
You're such a good friend, Ted.

114
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:51,147
You, too, buddy.

115
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:52,365
I'm going into the city.

116
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,201
Just, while I'm gone,

117
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:56,653
don't go snooping around
in our stuff.

118
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:59,623
I know you think we have
a sex tape hidden somewhere,

119
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,093
so I'll save you the trouble.
We don't. Good-bye.

120
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,863
<i>Here's that moment
from Barney's perspective.</i>

121
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,967
We have a sex tape hidden
somewhere.

122
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:18,291
Challenge accepted.

123
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:20,510
Robin again?

124
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:22,812
Why does everyone
keep going after Robin?

125
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:25,348
How come no one
ever takes a run at me?

126
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,716
Barney hits on you every day.

127
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:28,652
Yeah, but he just wants
to bang me.

128
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:29,886
I want something real.

129
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,855
I know, babe.

130
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:33,823
Double A Cleaning.

131
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:34,891
Consuela, it's Barney.

132
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,226
I need you and the girls
for the afternoon.

133
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:38,828
Of course, right away,
Mr. Barney.

134
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,946
Are you at home now?

135
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,581
No, I'm at a house
on Long Island.

136
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,782
I'll text you the details.

137
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:45,335
It's a big job.
The place has been ransacked.

138
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,203
We'll get right on it.

139
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:48,705
Thanks, Consuela,
you're the best.

140
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,794
Ted, I know
you're ready to go

141
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:56,579
with this whole
you-and-Robin thing,

142
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,014
but is she ready
to go?

143
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:01,101
Is she ready to go? Um...

144
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:07,557
Mmm, we'll continue this...

145
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,609
when I get back.

146
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:14,030
So...

147
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:15,932
Are you sure
that it wasn't...?

148
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:22,072
We'll continue this
when I get back.

149
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,707
Okay.

150
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,661
What?! No!

151
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:31,414
Damn it, Lily,
why are you rooting against me?

152
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,749
I'm not rooting
against you.

153
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,500
Yes, you are.

154
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:34,617
No, I'm not.

155
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:35,902
<i>Yes, she was.</i>

156
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,954
You see, at that very moment...

157
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,012
"Long-term bets"?

158
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,856
Hmm.

159
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:15,208
My God! They're placing bets
on our lives.

160
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,428
And I'm sorry,
Ted cannot pull off bald.

161
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,213
You know Ted.
I'm right about this.

162
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:26,719
Ted, I'm your best friend.
Why would I root against you?

163
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:30,890
Lily bets Marshall that Ted
and Robin won't end up together.

164
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,409
<i>That's why.</i>

165
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,518
<i>So, Lily was betting against
me and Robin.</i>

166
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:39,811
<i>I just didn't know it.</i>

167
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:42,097
Okay, you want to make
it work with Robin?

168
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,232
You need to stay
on her radar.

169
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,184
Call her right now.

170
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,652
She's on the plane.
Her phone's off.

171
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:49,404
Oh, my God!

172
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:52,324
How adorable would it be
if when the plane lands,

173
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:53,441
she turns on her phone

174
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:56,361
and her mailbox is full
of messages from you?!

175
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,425
Ted, don't leave
her any voice mails.

176
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,000
Why not?

177
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,484
Because...
Because you need to go to Russia.

178
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:04,869
With love!

179
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:06,121
Surprise her.

180
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:08,123
Make the-
in no way creepy-

181
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:12,994
grand romantic gesture
that we all know Robin loves.

182
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,963
Oh!

183
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,432
So I just walk up to her
in Red Square

184
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:18,667
with a dozen roses?

185
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,302
Or float down to her

186
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:23,054
in my hot air balloon

187
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:25,357
with ten dozen roses!

188
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:28,509
Yes, that's perfect!

189
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,728
Not like this, Lily.

190
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,345
Not like this.

191
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:34,682
If you'll excuse me,
I've got some sonnets to write.

192
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:37,185
Stay put, Ted.
You're gonna want to hear this.

193
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:40,789
Guys, what's this?

194
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,857
<i>And Marshall and Lily
explained.</i>

195
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,843
<i>It all started ten years
earlier.</i>

196
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:46,678
<i>They had been looking
for a new hobby</i>

197
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,413
<i>they could do as a couple.</i>

198
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:51,032
I already missed
the beginner's lesson.

199
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,634
Maybe I shouldn't even go.

200
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,053
Ah, screw it.

201
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:57,472
I've seen the Olympics.
I know what I'm doing.

202
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:59,674
I'm going skiing, bitches!

203
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,855
He's gonna break
his leg.

204
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,323
He's not gonna
break his leg.

205
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,908
20 bucks says he does.

206
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,547
"Lily bets Marshall

207
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:26,451
that Ted
will break his leg skiing."

208
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:33,024
You would be amazed.

209
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:36,027
People fall off ski lifts
all the time.

210
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,746
Well, I gotta hit the head.

211
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:48,022
Well, he didn't
break his leg.

212
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,258
Yeah, I gotta say that, um,

213
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,645
making money off this bet
just makes me feel...

214
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,246
More alive than
you've felt in years?

215
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:57,265
Yes!
New hobby!

216
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:01,786
We need a cash box,
some glitter and some glue!

217
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:04,322
You've been
betting on us?

218
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:06,241
Like we're a
couple of hobos

219
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,792
fighting over
a sandwich

220
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:10,278
in some psycho preppy
kid's backyard?

221
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,664
No, this is just
what happens in marriage.

222
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,631
You get bored.

223
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,333
You run out
of things to do.

224
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:16,784
We were making models.

225
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:18,503
You single people
are out there

226
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:20,922
with the drinking
and the sleeping around...

227
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,257
Model airplanes.

228
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,458
The grinding
and the bumping

229
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,294
and the hot sweaty bodies.

230
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,629
...with little propellers
that spin.

231
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,565
Oh, this one looks
interesting.

232
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,633
Lily, I thought you said
you wanted to.

233
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:33,852
It was your idea.

234
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:37,238
I starved myself for a week
to get camera-ready.

235
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
You had a bear claw
for breakfast.

236
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,242
<i>Yeah, a bear claw.</i>

237
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,477
I- I changed my mind.

238
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:47,481
I- I just don't want Barney
to see us doing it.

239
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:49,284
Barney is never gonna see this.

240
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,485
Oh, come on. It's Barney.

241
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:54,339
Eventually,
somehow he's gonna see it.

242
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,523
Want to bet?

243
00:10:55,525 --> 00:11:00,378
So there really is a sex tape.

244
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:10,438
Anyhoozles,
just... long-term bets,

245
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,273
just a silly thing we do.

246
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,507
What about you, Ted?

247
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,676
Your hair's looking good.

248
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:18,229
"Lily bets Marshall
that Ted and Robin

249
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:19,781
won't end up together."

250
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:22,951
Wow.

251
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:25,570
So now it's
becoming clear why...

252
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:28,122
you've been trying to sabotage
my future happiness.

253
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:29,541
To win a bet.

254
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:30,708
Come on, Ted.

255
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,827
We made that bet
so long ago.

256
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,748
And boy, it's been
a real nail-biter.

257
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,217
Ted and Stella
got engaged.

258
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,385
Pay up.

259
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,870
Not yet.

260
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,871
We are driving
to the wedding.

261
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,206
Pay up.

262
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,208
Not yet.

263
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:51,012
We are at the wedding.

264
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,046
Pay up.

265
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:53,714
Not yet.

266
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:58,836
Damn it.

267
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,688
I can't believe you guys!

268
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,940
I got left at the altar,

269
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,775
and all you cared about
was some stupid bet?

270
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,527
I never stopped rooting
for you, but I...

271
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,529
Ted, I'm not rooting
against you.

272
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,865
I just don't think Robin's
the girl you marry.

273
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,534
That's why I made
the stupid bet to begin with.

274
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,670
I mean, yes,
it's five years later,

275
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:17,538
and you haven't settled down
with anyone else,

276
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,525
but you haven't settled down
with Robin, either.

277
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,877
There must be
a reason for that.

278
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,762
What's standing
in the way?

279
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,438
God...

280
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,524
if you help me find
this sex tape,

281
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,860
I am going to make
some changes in my life.

282
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:41,362
I am going to stop
sleeping around,

283
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:44,148
quit drinking so much,
no more shenanigans.

284
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,818
I am going to devote
my entire life

285
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,538
to doing good deeds,
and praising your name.

286
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,773
Is this what you're
looking for, Mr. Barney?

287
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,127
Never mind, bro. Found it.

288
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,881
I found it!

289
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:03,084
Sweet glory hallelujah,
I found it, Ted.

290
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,453
You're the only idiot I know
who still owns a VCR,

291
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,121
so you are
the lucky winner of the

292
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:09,623
"Who gets to sit next to me
and watch our best friends

293
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,726
go bananas all over each other"
sweepstakes.

294
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:14,812
To the outdated
viewing device!

295
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:16,764
<i>And then I realized
why Robin and I</i>

296
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,233
<i>hadn't gotten back together
in the last five years.</i>

297
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,486
Oh, my God.

298
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:23,338
Robin's in love with you.

299
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:31,810
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

300
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,510
Robin is in love with you.

301
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,946
No, she's not.
Trust me.

302
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,414
Yes, she is.

303
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,599
Something happened
between you guys.

304
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,251
That's why
you broke up with Nora.

305
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,104
That night,
I saw you in her room,

306
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,723
there were rose petals,
candles...

307
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,525
You saw that?

308
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,644
Well, then, maybe you also saw

309
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,647
those rose petals and candles
going into a garbage bag.

310
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,866
<i>And then Barney
told me everything.</i>

311
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,485
<i>How he and Robin hooked up.</i>

312
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:01,571
<i>How he broke up with Nora
to be with her.</i>

313
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,658
<i>How he thought she would do
the same for him.</i>

314
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,411
<i>How she broke his heart.</i>

315
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,966
She chose Kevin.

316
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,469
It hurt, but...

317
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,087
I guess they're in love.

318
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,522
They broke up last night.

319
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,674
Bummer.

320
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,977
Anyway, let's make our own bets
about this sex tape.

321
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,430
I've got Marshall
with a surprise piercing

322
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,898
at five-to-one odds,

323
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,567
Lily with a landing strip,
ten-to-one,

324
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,436
Marshall with a landing strip,
even money.

325
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,938
I don't believe this.

326
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,440
You were in love with Robin,

327
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,658
you find out she's single,
and your reaction is "Bummer"?

328
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,776
What do you want me to say, Ted?

329
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,446
Whatever I
thought was there,

330
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,232
she thought differently.

331
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:48,118
So... no, I don't care
that Robin is single again.

332
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,005
So if Robin started dating
someone else, you wouldn't mind?

333
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,090
Nope.

334
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,759
Even if that somebody else
was me?

335
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:59,846
Even if that somebody else
was you.

336
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,698
Really?
Really.

337
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,867
Hey, bros before hos, right?

338
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,503
No matter how mad she made me,

339
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,122
Robin's still my bro.

340
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,041
And if, uh, you make her happy,

341
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,676
then that makes me happy.

342
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:17,230
Barney, you've really grown up,
you know that?

343
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,698
Thanks.

344
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,284
Now let's watch our two best
friends have sex on tape.

345
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:22,869
I'll make the popcorn.

346
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,205
Don't watch that tape!

347
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,124
Watch that tape!

348
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,691
Well, sorry, I just really
want to win the bet.

349
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:30,360
And here we go.

350
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,796
O- okay. Okay, fine, Barney.

351
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,965
Watch our dirty little home
movie, but be forewarned,

352
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,300
at about the one minute mark,

353
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,169
you're going to see me
make this face.

354
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,140
Oh, God,
that's the face you made

355
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,474
the day we rode motorcycles.
Yeah.

356
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,926
Yeah. You really
want to see that?

357
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:48,645
A- and do you want
to hear me go, uh...

358
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,218
It can't sound like that.
It can't.

359
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,987
I know that noise, I've heard it
through the walls.

360
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,572
I thought the neighbors
had a sick cat.

361
00:15:58,574 --> 00:15:59,739
Okay, but, Barney,
just remember,

362
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,691
you'll also be seeing
a lot of this:

363
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,027
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

364
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,745
It's this, but
I'm not pregnant.

365
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:09,082
My skin is loose,
like an elephant.

366
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,368
My boobs are
perky and plump.

367
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,453
I slobber
like a confused old dog.

368
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,789
I slap my own ass.
I slap my own ass!

369
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,745
Barney...

370
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:24,014
<i>that was my VCR.</i>

371
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,132
Ted...

372
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,351
it was a VCR.

373
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,024
<i>A week later, I picked Robin up
at the airport.</i>

374
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,277
♪

375
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:43,316
♪

376
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,236
<i>And took her out to dinner
at her favorite restaurant.</i>

377
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:51,274
<i>And by the end of the night,
one thing had become clear:</i>

378
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,627
It's not going to happen, is it?

379
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:56,379
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,467
It's because of Barney.

381
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,935
What?

382
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,470
No.

383
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:04,921
Barney and I... we...

384
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:08,058
No. No. It's just...

385
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,411
You know, things have
just been so crazy lately.

386
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:15,966
Everything in my life
is... unstable.

387
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,152
I mean, you're one of the few
things that I can count on.

388
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,806
And... I really don't
want to mess that up.

389
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:28,028
We-we... we still have our deal,
right?

390
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,648
If we're both still...
single when we're 40?

391
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,816
Yeah. Yeah.

392
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,622
No. Look... I'm sorry.

393
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,624
I- I can't do that anymore.

394
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,343
As long as the door
is even a little bit open,

395
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,629
I have this feeling
that I'll just be...

396
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,266
waiting around to see if I win
the lottery when you turn 40.

397
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,053
I think you know
how you feel about me now,

398
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,957
and... I don't think time's
going to change that.

399
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,843
Just tell me.

400
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,612
Do you love me?

401
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,637
No.

402
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:19,963
I'm sorry.

403
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,831
We're great as friends.

404
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,999
Let's just...

405
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,701
Let's just forget
I ever said anything.

406
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,643
Bar. Alone. Now.

407
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,095
It's just a bump
in the road.

408
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,730
You guys are meant
to be together.

409
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:38,098
You can't give up.

410
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,382
You... i-it can still happen.

411
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,483
No. Marshall...

412
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,102
What about
the hot air balloon thing,

413
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:43,853
with the ten dozen roses?

414
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,655
And how's the sonnet coming, buddy?
Dude.

415
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,074
You bet on the wrong horse.
Let it go.

416
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:50,560
Believe it or not,

417
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,278
I'm happy about this. I'm...

418
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,331
I can finally move on.

419
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,833
This is a good thing.

420
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,002
Really.

421
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:05,408
Hey, Robin.

422
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,876
Oh, hey.
Hey.

423
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:09,078
Hey. Uh, look, before I forget,
here's Lily's hairdryer.

424
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,598
I borrowed it, like,
a million years ago.

425
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,099
Yeah, you can keep that.

426
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:14,434
Um... Hey, listen,

427
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,085
Ted told me what happened
with you guys,

428
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,854
and he says that
he's at peace with it.

429
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,589
Oh, really?

430
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,141
That's good.

431
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,926
He's lying, Robin.

432
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:27,313
He's trying to be strong,
but it's killing him,

433
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:30,233
and so, as his best friend,

434
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,202
I have to say something that...

435
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,537
he loves you
just way too much to say.

436
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:38,224
You gotta move out.

437

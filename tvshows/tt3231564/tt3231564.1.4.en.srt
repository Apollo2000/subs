00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,403
What's the point in keeping my group alive
if you're just gonna starve us to death?

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,642
Ten micrograms, that's all I'm asking.
It's nothing.

ALEK: <i>That belongs to Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,081
We're building Akley's bomb.

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,404
If Frank could prove that implosion
was more than a fairy tale,

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,763
even at the most rudimentary level,
I'll give him all the plutonium he wants.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,251
Fine, I'll prove it.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,130
The plutonium will remain
with Dr. Akley's group.

You probably spent your whole life
surrounded by people

who weren't smart enough
to recognize how smart you are.

But I do.
You are a once-in-a-generation mind.

No, you can't go to school in New York.

So I'm just supposed to
stay here in this prison camp?

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,889
Why are we even here?

No! No!

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,805
Here, sir.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,123
Remind me, Fathead, how many years
of college you got under your belt?

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,480
Two.

Those bona fides have qualified you
for your very first intelligence mission.

Tonight, you'll crawl out of this hole
into no-man's-land

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,204

And keep your head down, Fathead.

Hey, what's your real name, anyway,
in case you don't make it back?

- No.
-Any headaches?

Only bureaucratic.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,441
Headaches aren't the problem. Sleeping is.

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,683
Insomnia isn't a diagnosis. It's a symptom.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,365
Do you often feel distant from the world
even when you're among friends?

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,487
No.

41

Do you ever feel hopeless
about the present or future?

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,884
Is this a psychiatric evaluation?

I'm required to give it to all patients
who are seeking psychoactive medication.

- I saw...

50

- The inside of half the bars in France.
- Hmm.

51

I was ambulance service
around the same time.

- Is this your screening or mine?

have raised questions, Dr. Winter,

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,526
regarding your erratic behavior.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,527

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,001
God doesn't work
for Robert Oppenheimer either.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,321
Do you think he's here
to replace Oppenheimer?

161
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,006
I was told he'd arrived.

162
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,924
Well, his car came through the main gate
10 minutes ago.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,729
The man reinvented physics

164
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,009
and nearly died in a rowboat
escaping the Gestapo.

165
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,527
Shall we allow him the benefit
of a toilet stop?

166
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,001
Bohr will probably reorganize the tech area,
soup to nuts.

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,208
Are we the soup or the nuts?

168
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,487
That's the problem around here.
They don't tell you what you are.

169
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,130
They barely tell you what you're working on.

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,611
They didn't even tell us
that Bohr was coming.

171
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,006
Here we go.

172
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,211
He insisted on walking.

173
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,841
So I pass out somewhere
over occupied Norway

174
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,482
and awoke in Great Britain
with the worst hangover of my life.

Mmm-mmm.

177

It's bad luck to allow another man
to light your pipe.

178

Oh, sorry. Charlie Isaacs, sir.

179
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,005
- You're a hard man to find.
- Isaacs, yeah.

180
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,242
You are the valet Bobby spoke of.

181

No, I'll be showing you around campus.

184

I worked with Everett at Harvard.

185
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,163
For my thesis on cosmology, I actually
used your calculations of atomic nuclei...

186
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,129
A kestrel.

187
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,929
With a hood on.

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,525

Good that you came, Niels.

201
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,403
Better that you made it out of Europe.

202
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,563
I was just citing your axial chemistry study.

203
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,481
So this is the famous Skinny Man?

204
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,206
No, this is, uh...

This is another model.

You'll know Thin Man when you see it.

207

Believe me, a parade float, marching band,
Akley and Oppie high in the saddle.

Dr. Bohr, you and I have important business
at the Thin Man office.

212
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,450
Yeah, just a moment, Christopher.

I was told there was an emergency.

218
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,521
I get a Private First Class instead of
a full bird for a breach at the gate?

219
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,126
The Colonel's indisposed.
I'm the advance guard.

You're the guy. (CHUCKLES)

222
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,927

223
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,490
I heard you shot your way
into a plum assignment.

224
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,324
This way.

225
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,727
She tried to escape in a truck full of Indians.

Must have slipped them some wampum.

Are you sure you brought enough guys?

236
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,641
Frank, we cannot detonate
without an ordnance expert.

237
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,846
We don't even have a fire extinguisher.

238
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,160
Just worry about the camera.

239
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,810
Are those detonators?

240
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,680
We do not have clearance to transport
or discharge explosives.

241

You need the division chief's
direct approval.

242

I'll take full responsibility.

243
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,050
You can't take responsibility.
It doesn't work that way.

244
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,521
Your Jeep is in the blast zone.

245

I'd back it up a bit.

246
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,451

gonna sneak past the gate?

Well, my family was killed in an Apache raid.

253
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,482
The San Ildefonso found me and raised me
as their own.

around it?

Don't pretend you know anything about me

266
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,364
just because you put a bullet
through my dad's mathematician.

All right, the camera.

268
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,766
You didn't turn it on?

269
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,008
It doesn't go on until we're hot.

270

And now we're hot.

After my dance with the Nazis,

319
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,962
I don't relish the exuberance of crowds.

320
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,204
(ENGINE WHIRRING)

321
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,841
Not getting fuel to the carburetor.

322
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,729
There's probably sand in the filter.

323
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,410
So we're stuck here until they send help?

324
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,721
I won't be missed until bed check.

325
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,282
There's no one waiting for me.
How long till Mrs. Winter raises a fuss?

326
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,725
I don't know, two, three days.

327
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,282
We're about 30 miles from home.

328
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,442
If we start now,
we'll make it back before dawn.

329
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,170
You want to walk back?

330
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,720
If we sit here, the camera will overheat,
ruin the film.

331
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,565
Orders are to remain
with a non-operating vehicle

332
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,369
until otherwise instructed.

333
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,171
With no more primers,
it'll be weeks before we can run another test.

334
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,608
I'm not losing the film.
So you get the camera.

335
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,445
We'll hit cooler temperatures
as we climb the hill.

336
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,407
No.

337
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,568
MILITARY POLICEMAN:
No one's going anywhere.

338
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,647
You get the camera.

339
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,961
Now.

340
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,284
I'm transferring to Thin Man.

341
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,690
I'm joining Akley's group.

342
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,442
You know, when we get home,
you can transfer to the Axis for all I care.

343
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,602
But I brought you onto this project,

344
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,684
and for the next 30 miles,
I can kick your ass off of it.

345
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,811
So you pick up that damn camera.

346
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,606
MILITARY POLICEMAN:
No. No one is leaving this test site.

347
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,211
I'm in charge.

348
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,202
Oh, Jesus.
I don't feel like getting shot in the back.

349
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,443
So if you're planning on using that,
go ahead.

350
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,690
Don't look at me to talk you out of it.

351

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,207

Louis XIV.

354
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,281
He had that stamped on his cannon.

355
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,328
It is a cannon.

356
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,925
Firing in on itself.

357
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,844
Won't spontaneous neutrons
predetonate your fuel?

358
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,050
Not so long as you fire the slugs
at 3,170 feet per second.

359
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,001
Who deduced that?

360
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,606
Charlie did, actually.

Dr. Bohr is waiting.

373
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,685
What has gotten into you?

374
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,921
They were hanging on every word.

375
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,651
The ladies' auxiliary. Tell me about Bohr.

376

The details. Where he's living,
what he's gonna be working on.

- Electron motion.
- Involving Planck's constant.

Planck's constant.

384
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,929
And the Thomas rotation.

389

CROSLEY: Beneath your station, is it?

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,565

I'll be shipping off to the Pacific.

That means I'm done

CROSLEY: Oh, brilliant.

00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,290
You'll be graduating
from taxi driver to cannon fodder.

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,091
Yeah, well, at least
I'll be making a difference in this fight.

a whit of difference in a world war?

that gun you've been relieved of? Huh?

400
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,561
Or dynamite, radar, submarine, tanks?

401
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,170
If it weren't for guys like me, chaps like you

402
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,891
would still be poking each other to death
with sharpened sticks.

403

Both of you shut up.

407

Seems to be a common complaint
in your household.

408
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,368
It's a common complaint at high elevations.

409
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,126
Thin air lowers oxygen levels in the blood,
causing cerebral hypoxia.

410
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,283
The body typically adapts within a week.

411
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,442
Guess I'm a slow learner.

412
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,047
So the fact that your husband
tried to fill a prescription

413
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,647
for a sleep aid just yesterday,
that's a coincidence?

414
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,404
You tell me, doctor.

415
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,804
Is insomnia contagious?

416
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,643
Before I write you a script,
you're going to have to answer

417
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,882
some questions
from the Army's mental fitness survey.

418
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,048
Do you ever feel distant from the world
even when you're among friends?

419
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,122
My nearest friend is 1,200 miles away.

420
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,486
I'd call that distant.

421
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,040
Do you ever feel hopeless
about the present or the future?

422
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,641
There are 74 sovereign states in the world.

423
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,405
Sixty one of them are at war.
How do you feel?

424
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,323
And what about your present and future?

425
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,927
I feel hopeful that I will return to real life
when all this is over.

426
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,730
This isn't real life?

427
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,368
I walked away from a tenure-track
lectureship in the Ivy League.

428
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,207
My husband's research is of vital interest
to the government, mine is expendable.

429
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,608
The Army won't let me work here.

430
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,084
They haven't told me why.

431
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,723
My marriage is in limbo.

432
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,247
My daughter is trying to get herself killed.

433
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,890
She may just succeed.

434
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,810
I wake up in the morning
and I barely recognize the woman

435
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,486
I see looking back at me in the mirror.

436
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,605
I'm sorry.

437
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,444

with alcohol.

00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,361
The metallurgy and chemistry teams
want to show you some tampers.

441
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,489
Frank Winter's office
is in this direction, correct?

442
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,925
Implosion isn't really part of the tour.

443
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,004
It's more of a backup plan.
Dr. Bohr, we really...

444
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,485
It's just a backup plan.

445
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,688
Maybe we'll all be folded into
one group working under Dr. Bohr.

446
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,764
Holy moly. God's on his way to our office.

447
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,927
Where's Frank?

448
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,401
Well, someone's got to
walk him through our work.

449
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,403
Uh, how do I look? Glasses or no glasses?

450
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,926
I'm the only one with a Ph.D.
It should be me. I outrank you.

451
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,810
No, it should be Fritz. He knows him.

452
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,927
Dr. Nohr. Noctor Door. Niels.

453
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,763
I just wanted to say

454
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,571
I still think about
that time we spent together.

455
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,241
So many universes, aren't there?

456
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,890
Dr. Bohr would like me
to walk him through the implosion design.

457
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,048
- You?
- Sir.

CHARLIE: Jesus.

459
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,362
The geometry,
it's like a star swallowing itself.

460
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,010
It's impressive.

461
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,322
But do you think it is big enough?

462
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,166
Big enough?

463
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,007
Hate to cut the tour short, Niels,
but would you join me in my office?

464
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,525
Of course, Bobby.

465
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,082

the implosion group's work, sir.

467

- I tried to stop...
- Your services are no longer needed.

468
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,609
General George Patton whooped the ass
of 200,000 Italian soldiers.

469
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,724
Now, you really think a scientist
could have pulled that off?

470
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,002
He got to Europe in an airplane

471
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,324
based on principles designed
by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738.

472
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,561
If it weren't for scientists,

473
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,371
Patton couldn't even have paddled to Italy
in a canoe

474
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,762
because he wouldn't have understood
the laws of buoyancy.

475
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,571
So you think you need a Ph.D. to float?

476
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,761
How much water have you got left?

477
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,805
Half a canteen.

478
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,045
Don't put your limey lips all over the nozzle.

479
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,521
- Hold the camera.
- No sale, brother.

480
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,046
You're just trying to trick me
into carrying your load for you.

481
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,121
Just hold it a minute.

482
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,450
You bloody idiot!

483
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,847
- That is not my fault.
- Hey, don't look at me.

484
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,844
Damn it, you exposed the film.
You had one simple job.

I am an Oxford-educated physicist.
I'm not a bellboy.

486
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,524
The camera broke because you insisted
on performing an illegal test

487
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,365
when we could have easily waited a week.

488
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,329
I'm not walking anymore.

489
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,091
When they come and rescue us,
I'll see to it that they know the truth.

490
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,286
You're not fit for leadership.

491

You're fit for a straightjacket
and a padded cell.

492
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,644
No one's coming to save us.

493
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,924
It'll be dark soon.

494
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,049
If we get separated, just stick to the road.

495
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,400
You can at least leave me my gun.

496
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,891
If I give it back to you,

497
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,088
you'll be thrown in the brig
for violating orders.

498
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,363
If I keep it, you can just say I forced you
at gunpoint.

You need to get dressed.

502
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,528
We're not going to the Bohr dinner.

503
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,365
Stick to physics.
You have no future in comedy.

504
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,364
Yeah, well, we might not have one
on this hill, either.

505
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,525
What happened?

506
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,483
Dr. Oppenheimer...

507
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,689
He thinks I overstepped him.

508
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,730
Christ, Akley must be distancing himself
as we speak.

509
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,521
I'll probably end up in Frank Winter's group
with those other rejects.

510
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,847
You know, my father wanted me to marry
someone from East Egg, not East St. Louis.

511
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,969
And I told him,
"I don't care. Charlie's a genius."

512
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,971
The truth is, I don't think you are a genius.

513
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,646
I didn't know what you were
until we got here...

514
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,448
And I saw the way people everyone else
calls geniuses look at you.

515
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,123
Forget Oppenheimer.

516
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,126
Forget Akley. They're yesterday.

517
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,285
And we are going to that party

518
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,762
and we're gonna fix everything with the man
who'll be running this place tomorrow.

519
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,161
Mmm?

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,123
We're going.

to a grinding halt.

I mean, the progress
on stellar spectroscopy alone is...

to be going anywhere.

something gained.

Just look at the wonderful discoveries
you've been making in plutonium...

528
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,884
You must belong to the late Frank Winter.

Well, I suppose he is not on time.

Uh, Niels, tell us about the mood in London.

531
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,611
I'm going to investigate the mood at the bar.
Excuse me.

NIELS: And I will accompany you.

533
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,641
So, tell me,
what have you been working on?

Oh, I don't Work.

Who told you that?

539
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,242
I saw your husband
after the Swedes gave me my medal

540
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,449
and I told him that he would have
one of his own before long.

And he said, "The only way
I will be invited to the Nobel ceremony

"is as my wife's dinner companion."

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,722
too many great minds have been forced
to abandon their work.

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,130
<i>But his legacy is a fog of chlorine gas</i>

633
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,286
<i>that crept over Europe and Africa and Asia.</i>

634
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,401
(COUGHING)

635
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,488
NIELS: <i>When I asked,
"Is it big enough?"</i>

636
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:39,920
I meant is it big enough that no sane person
would ever dare to use it?

637
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,647
I don't know.

638
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,769
Good men invent bigger
and more efficient methods

639
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,241
for humankind to exterminate itself,

640
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,648
hoping the world will lose its hunger
for horror.

641
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,361
But our species seems to have
an insatiable appetite.

642
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,485
I've lost mine.

643
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,491
Enlisted or drafted?

644
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,281
Huh.

645
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,040
Enlisted.

646
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,805
This your first rotation?

647
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,446
Yes, sir.

648
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,566
Go ahead.

649
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,124
Keep your head down.

650
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,364
If we take my car,
we'll be back at the range by 10:00.

651
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,521
I know we blew our only set of primers.

652
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,969
Pinched them from Akley's lab.

653
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,005
I handle the camera.

654
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,081
It is okay.

655
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,046
Lie still.

656
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,801
They've just signed the armistice.

657
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,167
The war is over.

658
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,928
There will never be another.

659
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:18,800

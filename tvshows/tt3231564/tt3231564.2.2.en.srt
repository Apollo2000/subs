1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,728
Previously on "Manhattan"...

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:03,645
That's why we're here, right?

3
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:07,035
So our husbands can invent
the end of the world.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,554
You're not building a
radar system, are you?

5
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:14,316
Somewhere in Germany, Hitler's
got a town just like this one

6
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:16,401
full of scientists hungrier than you.

7
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:18,153
I need you to look at something.

8
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:21,156
You didn't hear this from
me. Command calls him Magpie.

9
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:24,069
- Herr Doktor Schlimmer?
- He has credible intelligence

10
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:26,160
that their atomic program
is two months ahead of ours.

11
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,985
They're more than two months ahead of us.

12
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,115
Magpie's dead...

13
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:33,321
and now we have no eyes on
Heisenberg because somebody talked.

14
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:36,171
My mother died yesterday.

15
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:38,373
Is your mother still alive, Frank?

16
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,592
I don't know.

17
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:42,247
Where's Frank Winter?

18
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,526
He's gone and he's never coming back.

19
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:48,133
Wonder how long before
Frank's daughter turns 18?

20
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:52,937
C-A-L-L-I-E.

21
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:55,146
I talked to Frank on the
phone a little while ago.

22
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,895
He gave me his blessing.

23
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:58,683
Did he talk to him?

24
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,363
We're gonna build a working gadget,

25
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,781
we're gonna drop it on Berlin

26
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:05,996
'cause on July 4th, 1945,

27
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:08,987
we're gonna put on the biggest
fireworks show since the Book of Genesis.

28
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:10,572
Who recruited him?

29
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:12,290
What?

30
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:14,876
Frank Winter recruited you.

31
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:16,714
Who recruited Frank Winter?

32
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,329
Jesus.

33
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:22,417
Ah! Ah!

34
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:31,226
_

35
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:33,560
_

36
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,198
I want to apologize...

37
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:59,003
while you're still of sound mind and body.

38
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,208
Am I under arrest?

39
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:10,348
Dr. Manfred Schlimmer,

40
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,268
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Code name Magpie.

41
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,354
Our source inside Heisenberg's lab,

42
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:20,820
the only reason we knew the
Nazis were on the brink of a bomb.

43
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:25,780
You really think I'm the
reason your German spy is dead?

44
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,734
I think you're 10 feet underground...

45
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,955
and I am the only living soul

46
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,324
who knows where you are.

47
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:39,627
I think that makes me
the hand that feeds you

48
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,496
and the hand that taketh away

49
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:46,084
until all you've got
left is time and space.

50
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:48,957
And then I take those.

51
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:52,483
And what's left is the truth.

52
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:57,929
Read up. Get to know the
man you sentenced to death.

53
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,982
What are you?

54
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:03,651
A bureaucrat with a gun.

55
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:05,820
You know absolutely nothing.

56
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,689
You've got the paperwork to back it up.

57
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:11,276
In 1936, you took a leave of absence
from the University of Chicago

58
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:14,195
to attend the Nobel ceremony
of your friend Carl Anderson.

59
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:17,532
Three days later you boarded
the Kronprinsessen Hilde

60
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:19,868
to Hamburg, Germany, used a fake name.

61
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,420
Then you traveled by rail to Leipzig,

62
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,539
paid cash at the Park Hotel.

63
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,999
Stayed two months.

64
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:32,597
Since then you've taken great
pains to conceal that trip...

65
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,934
falsifying your army background affidavit,

66
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:38,386
for example.

67
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,955
That is what I know.

68
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:45,370
Make it last.

69
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,071
I'll be back in a couple of days.

70
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,648
Maybe three.

71
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:53,419
So much paperwork.

72
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:20,511
Hello?

73
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,533
Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

74
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:25,921
Hello?

75
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:27,912
Hey.

76
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:30,550
I need some goddamn food.

77
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,075
Nice place.

78
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,364
Don't worry.

79
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:07,201
You could survive almost
a month with no food.

80
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:11,205
Long as you have water.

81
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:20,342
When I...

82
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:23,968
when I lied to you,

83
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,522
it was only to protect
you and protect Callie.

84
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:29,355
Just like your trip to Leipzig.

85
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,726
It's not important now.

86
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:34,479
The main point is...

87
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,614
you missed something.

88
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,952
- What did I miss?
-  The first lie.

89
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,457
What do you mean?

90
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:49,994
The one you tell yourself.

91
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,521
Heard the one about the turtles?

92
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,744
Yeah, from you.

93
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:26,914
Student stands up in a
cosmology lecture and says,

94
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,951
"Planets, stars, gravity...

95
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:31,129
they're all lies.

96
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,432
My mother says the world sits
on the back of a giant turtle."

97
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,541
"All right," says the professor.

98
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,292
"What's the turtle standing on?"

99
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,762
The student smiles and he says,

100
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,463
"Oh, but don't you see?

101
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:47,685
It's turtles all the way down."

102
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:54,275
I guess we all need a
turtle to stand on sometimes.

103
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:57,028
There are so few constants in science.

104
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,063
And life.

105
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:02,066
- It's mostly...
- Variables.

106
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:04,986
Now these...

107
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:08,345
these variables aren't intuitive.

108
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,825
In English or in German.

109
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:12,293
A word game.

110
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:16,380
You physicists love to hide names in math.

111
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:18,545
Like a crossword.

112
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:22,670
It's a narcissist's trick to convince
himself he loves other people.

113
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:24,672
I notice you've never used my name.

114
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:27,516
I hid, uh...

115
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,011
I hid Callie's.

116
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:32,730
Immortalize your daughter

117
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,163
- in the footnote of a bomb... 
- C-A-L-

118
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:39,821
- L-I-E.
- Yet somehow you never remember her birthday.

119
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

120
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:44,403
This...

121
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,896
This can't be right.

122
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:48,097
But it is...

123
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,958
These are my goddamned equations.

124
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:54,437
This... this is our daughter's name.

125
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,989
In Magpie's math.

126
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,825
That means...

127
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:02,245
You were wrong.

128
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:04,163
The Nazis are stealing our work.

129
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:07,783
They're building their bomb
on the back of my goddamn math.

130
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,785
The bureaucrat was right.

131
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:12,038
There's a fox in the henhouse.

132
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,805
There is a spy.

133
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:17,043
There is a spy back on the Hill.

134
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,381
Oh, my God.

135
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,773
Hey!

136
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,975
Hey, you want me to talk?

137
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,356
I'll talk!

138
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,993
Hello?

139
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,375
Hey.

140
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:44,419
Hey!

141
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:48,423
Hello? Is anyone here?

142
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:12,196
Hey!

143
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:22,924
1,478 agitators in my care

144
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:24,509
and you ain't one of 'em.

145
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,961
Smell like one of 'em.

146
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,142
Where am I?

147
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,119
Who are you, Houdini?

148
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,266
Must be the first guy
ever broke into prison.

149
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,066
No. No, no, I was brought here.

150
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,985
By whom?

151
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:53,104
I don't know. I don't know his name.

152
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,574
He was a X-4 government agent.

153
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:58,395
Listen to me.

154
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:03,548
Call Santa Fe 33200.

155
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,969
You tell them badge G-11 has
important information about Magpie.

156
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,921
And if they want it,

157
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:12,006
they gotta get me out of here.

158
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,091
It's a matter of national security.

159
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:15,760
Yeah.

160
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,645
I hear that a lot.

161
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:20,598
Anybody winds up here off the books,

162
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:24,163
that's someone Uncle
Sam wants to disappear.

163
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:27,188
Who am I to argue?

164
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:31,993
What say we throw him in
with Tojos? See what happens?

165
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,744
No, no.

166
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,497
No, wait... wait a minute.

167
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:39,367
I'm not... I'm not supposed to be in here.

168
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,673
Hey!

169
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,257
There's been some kind of misunderstanding!

170
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:23,628
I'm showing you this classified footage

171
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,463
at the request of the Army.

172
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:28,499
These are the conditions
our guys can expect

173
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:30,251
when we put boots down in Europe.

174
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:32,386
Can someone hit the lights?

175
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,171
We're invading Europe?

176
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,390
- When?
- Also classified.

177
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:39,977
But when we do, the Army's
gonna deploy a special team

178
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:42,430
to look for W.A.M.D.s.

179
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:43,764
W.A.M.D.s?

180
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:46,601
Weapons Adaptable to Mass Destruction.

181
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:49,103
They'll be looking for
our German sister city.

182
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:53,157
A place just like this building a W.A.M.D.

183
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,660
- just like ours.
- How far along are they?

184
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:58,696
There's nothing but wartime rumor.

185
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,367
It's up to us to tell
the Army what to look for,

186
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:06,954
not just oversized factories
and uranium stockpiles.

187
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:10,041
- Use your imaginations.
- What about our weapon?

188
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,908
I thought we were
planning a test detonation.

189
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,261
We'll be forming a new test group.

190
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,046
There will be an announcement soon.

191
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:18,015
For now if you're in this
room, you have your assignment.

192
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,884
All right.

193
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:27,191
- Not here, Helen.
- I left you six messages.

194
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:30,144
I'm running a technical staff of 600.

195
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:33,147
- I'm a little busy.
- Right. You talk to Frank again?

196
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,815
Uh, no. Sorry.

197
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,567
I have to brief the
S.E.D. staff on implosion.

198
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:39,320
- Frank is implosion.
- We all have to move on.

199
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:41,906
- Oh, I have.
- Come on, Helen.

200
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:44,220
Come on. Let's go.

201
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:13,955
Wait! Hey! Wait! No!

202
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,140
Hey! Hey!

203
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:18,209
- Hey! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Whoa! Hey!

204
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,744
- Stay back!
-  No!

205
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:22,029
-  Don't take another step!
- Wait!

206
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:24,165
Wait, no... no, no, you...

207
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,033
you got the wrong idea.

208
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:28,818
God, do you know... do you
know what this place is?

209
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:32,623
It's a... it's a relocation camp, right?

210
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,427
For the internment of
Japanese political dissidents?

211
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:38,095
- Hands!
- What?

212
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:40,097
- Hands. Show 'em to me!
- Okay.

213
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,433
All right.

214
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,218
Fresh off the boat?

215
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,022
Clean hands. No labor
vos liberabit for you.

216
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:51,308
"Work will set you free"?

217
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,061
It's not helping the guys out there.

218
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,197
College man, eh?

219
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,483
Yeah, that'll come in real handy in Tosa.

220
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:02,653
Tosa? What is that,
the name of this prison?

221
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:04,905
The name of the town we're in?

222
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:06,374
- What? Where are we?
- Back!

223
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:09,894
What the... Jesus. Never... never mind.

224
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:13,414
Hey, come back!

225
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,500
Come back! I need to make a phone call!

226
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:54,570
I figured it out.

227
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:58,962
You're Houdini, right?

228
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:00,821
The guy who appeared out of thin air.

229
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:02,292
We heard about you.

230
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:06,465
You really don't know why we're here.

231
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:08,611
I saw Houdini when I was 15.

232
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:11,137
I don't suppose that you can pick a lock...

233
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:12,672
You didn't tell me.

234
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:15,007
What is Tosa?

235
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:19,762
It's a province in Japan.

236
00:17:19,764 --> 00:17:21,931
They breed fighting dogs.

237
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,835
They're the finest in the world.

238
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,771
The guards in this prison
don't have any dogs.

239
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:32,274
But, uh, when you're bored
and you're a betting man,

240
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,210
you work with what you got.

241
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:35,828
And what you got here is a bunch of guys

242
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,027
who don't, strictly speaking, exist.

243
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,783
So why not throw 'em
into an empty cellblock,

244
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:43,536
see who survives?

245
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,354
That's insane.

246
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,041
They can't just expect us to...

247
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:50,793
Kill or be killed?

248
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:53,002
If the dogs won't fight,

249
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:55,873
heat up the cage. They,
uh... they have their ways.

250
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:57,444
You'll see.

251
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:03,125
Nobody can force us to murder each other.

252
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,700
Usually they throw a
white guy in with a Jap.

253
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:09,866
The house always wins.

254
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:19,342
Is that a radio?

255
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:21,560
Hmm?

256
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,126
Where?

257
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:27,496
Never mind.

258
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,188
Listen...

259
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:33,819
How long have we been here?

260
00:18:35,473 --> 00:18:37,329
- 12 hours.
- 12 hours,

261
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,274
you could've brained me anytime.

262
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:42,094
So the way I see it, we're
already beating the odds.

263
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:43,846
We just have to trust each other.

264
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,316
That's your plan, Houdini?

265
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:49,318
- Trust?
- No.

266
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,896
Game theory.

267
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:54,023
Trust is the strategy.

268
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:58,445
The plan is escape.

269
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,477
I was 13.

270
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,025
Excuse me?

271
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,718
The first time I saw Houdini.

272
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,955
He did the milk can escape.

273
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,929
Two summers later he came back

274
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:19,662
and that's when I
figured out how he did it.

275
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,935
Right before he went in,

276
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:26,522
his, um... his wife came
onstage, do you remember?

277
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:31,551
Well, she kissed the key into his mouth.

278
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:34,530
Right in front of everybody.

279
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,951
The wife.

280
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,307
Yeah.

281
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:45,324
You see, most solutions,
they hide in plain sight.

282
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,345
I don't plan on doing any killing today.

283
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,182
Or dying.

284
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,852
Do you?

285
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,626
Beuker. Joseph Beuker.

286
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,616
Charlie Isaacs.

287
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,755
Hey, kiddo.

288
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,006
Daddy!

289
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,925
How was your day?

290
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,761
You know those Chinese circus acts?

291
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,129
Guy juggling plates,

292
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:26,215
you think the whole dinner set's
gonna come crashing down on his head?

293
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,005
Sit.

294
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,888
I gotta be back in an hour.

295
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,752
Sorry.

296
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,858
What do you have to go back to?

297
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,612
Sign the pay slips.

298
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:42,398
Get my requisitions rejected by the Army.

299
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:44,734
Repeat.

300
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:50,031
Have you, uh, picked out a
color for the nursery yet?

301
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,495
You're building a weapon.

302
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:58,464
- I wanna know what kind.
- Abby.

303
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:02,218
- We said no more secrets.
- It's not my secret.

304
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,337
I took a vow.

305
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,137
You've broken other vows.

306
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,510
There are 20-year-old graduate students

307
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:11,727
who know why we're here.

308
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,466
Boys. Helen Prins knows.

309
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,272
You said this baby was a new leaf.

310
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,913
And I won't go back to
the way it was before.

311
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:32,448
Playing make-believe like
you're a teacher or salesman

312
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:34,700
and I'm Betty Crocker.

313
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,218
Do you remember...

314
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,104
when we had dinner at that, uh...

315
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,939
that Italian place in Central Square?

316
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,393
I was bouncing off the walls
'cause a guy named Otto Hahn

317
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,478
split the atom.

318
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:04,947
It's call...

319
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,324
It's called an atomic chain reaction.

320
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:25,434
So Liza actually says that
she's heard from Frank?

321
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:26,919
I mean, she can't stand the Army.

322
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,005
Why would she cover for 'em?

323
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:30,018
I don't know.

324
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,748
Maybe she's in cahoots with Charlie Isaacs.

325
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,977
Maybe, uh... maybe they bumped
off Frank for the life insurance.

326
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,336
Well, I don't like Isaacs any
better than the rest of you.

327
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,398
He makes Richard III look like Richard II.

328
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,852
But, you know, maybe Frank
really was transferred.

329
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:44,520
You wanna tell us what we're
doing here then, Duchess?

330
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:47,189
We're looking for Hitler's W.A.M.D.s.

331
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,658
Five miles from the Hill?

332
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,494
Actually, we're five miles above the Earth

333
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,029
in German air space.

334
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,697
Have you been eating Fritz's mushrooms?

335
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:57,416
It's the lowest altitude a
surveillance plane can fly.

336
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,919
We're recreating the
same conditions laterally.

337
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,255
Radioactive particles
ruin photographic film.

338
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,957
We're gonna mount those plates
on posts downwind of the Hill.

339
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,342
Well, if the film gets exposed...

340
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,960
So all you need to find a German reactor

341
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,079
is an airplane and a roll of Kodak.

342
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:11,914
- Quick and dirty.
- Just like Helen.

343
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,517
So we're following Issacs' orders?

344
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,102
We're not doing it for Charlie.

345
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,997
We're doing what Frank would want us to do.

346
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,053
Chasing wild geese in a
desert while another team

347
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:22,358
signs its name on a gadget we invented.

348
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,776
We're doing the work we're assigned

349
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:26,062
better than anyone else.

350
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:27,694
Beuker!

351
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,983
These are telephone wires out here.

352
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,570
I don't think they're gonna
give you your phone call,

353
00:23:34,572 --> 00:23:36,572
Charlie.

354
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:40,005
Pretty sure they already found
a substitute for your math class.

355
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,296
You were talking about game theory.

356
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,631
I assume you're not a plumber.

357
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,301
I teach calculus.

358
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,469
-  Oh.
- College.

359
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,972
Like recognizes like. I'm history.

360
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,840
Fisk University. Where did you educate

361
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:56,892
the future nonvoters of America?

362
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,428
I've been chased out of half
the schools in the Ivy League.

363
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,764
You know, there's gotta be some kind of...

364
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,934
emergency telephone box
somewhere in this building.

365
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:07,436
"Isaacs."

366
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:11,157
Known a lot of Jewish math
professors over the years.

367
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,825
Christian, actually.

368
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,578
I was born that way. I'll die an atheist.

369
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,447
Ah, we've got that in common, too.

370
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:21,534
A couple atheist teachers,

371
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:22,918
rational,

372
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,371
happy fellow travelers so far.

373
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,423
So what is it... what is it...

374
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:32,378
What? What is what?

375
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,183
They throw fellas in Tosa who
would want to kill each other.

376
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:39,635
They paired us up for a reason.

377
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:42,805
Charlie?

378
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:48,110
You really don't hear that?

379
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,285
Hear what?

380
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:56,152
It's the Mourning Cantata
for King Frederick.

381
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,627
Losing my mind.

382
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,211
Well, you've come to the right place.

383
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,803
How's an American citizen

384
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:10,484
end up in a hole like this?

385
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,421
Just look enough like Yamamoto
to piss off the Rotary Club.

386
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:18,090
Or just look like a plain old white fella

387
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:19,975
who went to the wrong meeting.

388
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,614
Well, did you?

389
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,263
Go to the wrong meeting?

390
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,816
I believed in free thought

391
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,018
and I made the mistake of practicing it

392
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,103
in a classroom.

393
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:32,938
How'd you really wind up here?

394
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,324
Hey.

395
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,692
Hey.

396
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:38,611
Hey!

397
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:39,745
Listen to me!

398
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,415
Call... call Santa Fe 332...

399
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,533
God damn it!

400
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:53,959
Hey, uh, how long since you ate?

401
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:56,178
Yesterday.

402
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,465
You? Uh-uh-uh!

403
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:01,717
I heard about this.

404
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:03,052
They drug the food.

405
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:06,555
Sometimes one tray, sometimes both.

406
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:09,730
Deal one of us an advantage, see?

407
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:13,242
- Imbalance.
- That's crazy.

408
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:18,414
It can't be that easy getting
two strangers to kill each other.

409
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:21,867
Well, you obviously don't teach history.

410
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:24,036
Okay.

411
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:26,170
So we both eat

412
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:28,424
from both trays at the same time.

413
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:30,125
That way if something happens,

414
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,114
it happens to both of us, okay?

415
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,145
Yeah.

416
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:07,129
Picked the wrong desert. I
bet it's warm in the Sahara.

417
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,301
It's freezing. How much longer?

418
00:27:12,303 --> 00:27:14,219
Six more plates. 90 minutes.

419
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:17,348
Who's got a spooky story?

420
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:21,643
I suppose I've got a spook story.

421
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,648
You know that G-2 guy with the glasses

422
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,899
always skulking around bushes

423
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,317
with a cola bottle in his hand?

424
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,236
I hate that guy.

425
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:33,326
He vanished

426
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:35,690
into the ether two weeks ago.

427
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:39,488
They found his badge
by the side of the road.

428
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:41,446
Much the worse for wear.

429
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,867
- Where did you hear that?
-  My secret informant.

430
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:48,503
Whichever WAC he's boffing now.

431
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:52,568
We're looking for the Nazi version

432
00:27:52,593 --> 00:27:54,092
of the Manhattan Project, right?

433
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:55,894
We're basically looking for our Nazi...

434
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:00,348
Nazi-Meeks, Nazi-Crosley...

435
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:02,373
What's the opposite of a
drunk English physicist?

436
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:04,865
A sober Irish priest!
And good luck finding one!

437
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,152
I gotta empty the tank.

438
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,341
Uh, if some guy comes back,

439
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:15,063
looks like me, handsome,
but with no mustache?

440
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:17,972
That's Nazi-Fritz. Don't trust him!

441
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:24,458
- Open it.
- Where?

442
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,179
You won't see me again.

443
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:41,373
When the time comes,
someone will contact you.

444
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:45,551
He'll have the other half of this.

445
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,253
Holy shit!

446
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,788
- What?
-  Come here!

447
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,157
Somebody shot it.

448
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,781
Probably target practice.

449
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:06,840
Can't be a good omen.

450
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,669
We should bury him.

451
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:12,912
Uh...

452
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:17,226
Pretty sure the bugs have
it under control, pal.

453
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:19,811
So we just leave him out here to rot?

454
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:22,295
That's what the Nazis would do.

455
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:26,348
We're... we're decent human beings.

456
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:27,938
You all right?

457
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,068
I don't know what we're doing here anymore.

458
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:35,694
'Cause the guy who's supposed
to tell us isn't here.

459
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,926
Hey, Beu... Beuker!

460
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,485
Beuker! Beuker, bring me the gun!

461
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:59,230
Thought we had a gentleman's agreement.

462
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,898
No gunplay.

463
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,150
Well, there's... there's
a telephone box in here.

464
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:08,239
What's this?

465
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,542
- Some kind of boiler room?
- We can shoot this lock off.

466
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:13,377
Right.

467
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,413
No, no. C...

468
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,165
Beu... Beuker, come here.

469
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,630
Beuker!

470
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:24,589
Even if there is a phone in there,
I doubt they've paid the bill.

471
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,280
If there's any kind of live
wire, I could rig something up.

472
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:30,306
I've got practical experience
with that sort of stuff.

473
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:33,943
Sounds a little Buck Rogers to me, Charlie.

474
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,478
Who's doing the shooting?

475
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,313
Whoever's the best shot.

476
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:39,699
I carried a service
revolver in the last war.

477
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:41,360
Oh.

478
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,486
So I guess I ought to give you the gun, eh?

479
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:46,837
Look, we have a shot.

480
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:50,363
Literally, one shot that we
can use to try and escape.

481
00:32:00,888 --> 00:32:02,555
You're hearing it again?

482
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:05,341
You can hear it.

483
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:07,810
No, your head's a mess,

484
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:10,596
but, uh, when you
mentioned the piece earlier,

485
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,231
I was surprised.

486
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,319
That's Johann Adolph Scheibe.

487
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:15,426
So?

488
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:17,403
How do you even know Scheibe?

489
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:18,988
- Do you play?
-  No.

490
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,274
No, somebody I used to know,

491
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:23,326
she played him a lot.

492
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:26,445
Okay, you want the gun, Charlie?

493
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:29,949
- I'll give it to you.
- All right. Fine, good, give it to me.

494
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:31,701
But I want something back.

495
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:33,252
The truth.

496
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:35,205
Who you really are.

497
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,387
I understand...

498
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:40,259
why you're not admitting it, mind you.

499
00:32:40,261 --> 00:32:42,044
Scheibe was, uh...

500
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:45,681
Bach's only real critic, you know?

501
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:48,851
He found Bach abstract.

502
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:52,431
Degenerate. Like the
Negroes and their jazz.

503
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:56,025
You must know where Scheibe's experiencing

504
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:57,560
a resurgence right now.

505
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,528
The same country, the
only country, mind you,

506
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:07,203
that guarantees protection
of the middle class

507
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:09,655
against unions and immigrants...

508
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,960
parasitic financial schemes.

509
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:19,832
- What, Germany?
- Yeah.

510
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:23,586
Not a lot of Scheibe fans in America.

511
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:26,005
Can't even find his recordings
here, can you, Charlie?

512
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,843
Just a plain old white fella

513
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,514
who went to the wrong meeting.

514
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,602
"Isaacs."

515
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:40,353
Christianized from "Heidrich," I'll bet?

516
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:45,567
You got High Prussian blood, don't you?

517
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,947
You're a Nazi.

518
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:57,578
You're an American Nazi.

519
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,465
Have I misjudged you?

520
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,466
So what...

521
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:04,941
what if I had been a Jew?

522
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:08,982
What, would you have bashed
my skull in that first night?

523
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:11,998
I part with Hitler there.

524
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,584
I have no complaints
with the Jewish people,

525
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,836
per se.

526
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,097
I ask only for some...

527
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:24,543
open debate about their
effect on their host cultures.

528
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,963
You've seen it in academia,

529
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:30,266
the conspiracy against good Aryans like us.

530
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,052
You twisted son of a bitch.

531
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,473
So who played Scheibe for you?

532
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:40,059
Some old flame?

533
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:43,980
Did you get your heart
broken by a German girl?

534
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,315
Is that where all this anger's coming from?

535
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:51,237
Where's my anger coming from?

536
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,040
Trust me, Joe. I know the
Nazis a lot better than you do.

537
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,375
You're a gang of killers

538
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:58,461
who brainwashed their own people.

539
00:34:58,892 --> 00:35:01,380
Why am I angry?

540
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:04,383
- Charlie.
- My name is not Charlie.

541
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,448
Hey.

542
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:23,853
Joey just went down.

543
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,855
He was beside himself.

544
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,074
He found a cow skull in the cupboard.

545
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:30,359
Did you know that Liza Winter
kept bones in the house?

546
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,411
Well, she's a biologist.

547
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:34,413
If you saw Darwin's cupboard,

548
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:36,844
you'd think he was a mass murderer.

549
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:53,382
What's the matter?

550
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,448
Is there a problem with the... gadget?

551
00:35:57,638 --> 00:36:00,045
Uh... no.

552
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,082
Well...

553
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:05,240
not ours.

554
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,480
Hitler's gadget, then?

555
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:16,872
The Army's gonna invade
Europe, and when they get there,

556
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:20,242
they need to know how to
find the German project.

557
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,546
We have intelligence from
inside the Nazi project.

558
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,831
Information about how Heisenberg

559
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,584
and Strassmann and Hahn are
actually building their gadget.

560
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,336
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

561
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:32,138
It would be...

562
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,526
if I was allowed to tell my guys about it.

563
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,726
They're working on the
problem with a brain hemisphere

564
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,178
tied behind their back.

565
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:42,681
I know what I would do

566
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:46,402
if I were the Nazis
looking for this project.

567
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,821
Yeah, what's that?

568
00:36:49,547 --> 00:36:51,857
I'd come after you.

569
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:56,829
Say you wanted to end a baseball season.

570
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:59,748
You could look for the stadiums,

571
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,333
try and shut them all down.

572
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,619
Or you could just...

573
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,139
- get rid of the New York Yankees.
- Abby.

574
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:10,259
What you're talking
about, it's complicated.

575
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,549
- The... the German physicists they're...
- Trying to get rid of us.

576
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:16,275
Friends. Or they were
friends of Oppenheimer's.

577
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,549
Of the senior staff.

578
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:19,541
These guys, they...

579
00:37:19,566 --> 00:37:21,850
They all came up together.

580
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:23,830
If...

581
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:27,560
If the Nazi gadget goes off...

582
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:31,530
will they spare our friends?

583
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:39,071
You must have photographs
of the German scientists.

584
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:44,577
Their home addresses. The names
of their wives and children.

585
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,048
Give those to the Army.

586
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,849
You can't even see the irony.

587
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,936
Sitting in an American concentration camp,

588
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:15,608
but you think the
Germans are monsters, huh?

589
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,693
Hitler's more merciful than you think.

590
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,411
Not the first word that comes to mind.

591
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,531
No? Any second, all this,

592
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:26,118
this prison, this country, this life

593
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,852
could just, poof! Go away.

594
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:31,790
- What, more Houdini?
-  The wonder weapon.

595
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,793
Hitler has a device that could
bring the world to its knees,

596
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:37,630
but he doesn't use it 'cause he's merciful.

597
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:40,933
It's called a sun gun.

598
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:43,102
It's a heliobeam

599
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:47,223
that can make an ocean boil
or a continent disappear.

600
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:50,142
Yeah. Last year it was the freeze ray.

601
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:52,027
The year before that the death ray.

602
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,063
Germany's a nation of liars.

603
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,399
Says the man who lies about his own name.

604
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,013
You don't look too good, Houdini. Huh?

605
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,538
Heatstroke?

606
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,658
Or are you hearing your
phantom music again?

607
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:09,074
You know, I've been to Germany.

608
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,214
Their wonder weapon is propaganda.

609
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,551
They could convince a parent
to eat their own child.

610
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,887
Oh, my God, what did she do to you?

611
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,223
- Who?
- This girlfriend?

612
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,758
Your Nazi love.

613
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,227
This mysterious Fräulein

614
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,896
who played Scheibe concertos for you.

615
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,932
She wasn't my goddamn girlfriend!

616
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,443
No.

617
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,893
She was your mother.

618
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:51,337
Son of a bitch.

619
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:54,373
Son of a bitch.

620
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:58,043
Is your mother German?

621
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:03,299
Hey!

622
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:06,885
Hey!

623
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:11,656
No! Hey, please!

624
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,192
Hello?!

625
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:16,645
It's locked.

626
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:24,236
Tosa.

627
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:38,815
We're both gonna die in here, aren't we?

628
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:45,072
What temperature does
a man's blood boil at?

629
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:50,831
Still Scheibe?

630
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,466
Where is she now?

631
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:58,846
Your mother.

632
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,299
I barely knew her.

633
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,771
My parents met through a service.

634
00:41:07,357 --> 00:41:10,809
Isolated bachelors on farms in the Midwest.

635
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:13,812
And she was from Germany.

636
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:15,530
Leipzig.

637
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:18,097
A musical prodigy.

638
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,154
From Leipzig to the Midwest

639
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:24,072
And then back again.

640
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:27,909
She was gone before I was seven years old.

641
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:30,314
All I remember is this woman.

642
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:34,071
No.

643
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:36,468
No, this young girl...

644
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,510
crying.

645
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,425
And the... the piano

646
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,344
every night after bedtime.

647
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:51,183
And then one night there was no piano.

648
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:55,640
She just disappeared.

649
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:59,157
You never saw her again.

650
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:02,194
No, I did.

651
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,663
I did, I saw her.

652
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:07,866
I saw her one last time.

653
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:09,451
1936.

654
00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:12,788
You found her?

655
00:42:13,873 --> 00:42:15,507
She was...

656
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:17,592
a musician. Finally.

657
00:42:17,594 --> 00:42:20,095
A concert pianist
underwritten by the government.

658
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:23,515
It took me 30 years, 3,000 miles,

659
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,101
a boat, a plane,

660
00:42:26,683 --> 00:42:28,261
and a leave of absence.

661
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,668
I went into her dressing room

662
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,359
to introduce myself.

663
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:41,860
She called the Gestapo on me.

664
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:44,903
Oh, God.

665
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,606
Beukner,

666
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:49,708
do you know why I am telling you this?

667
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:53,995
Because it's the truth.

668
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:57,883
What do you get for winning Tosa?

669
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,721
They say the winner goes free.

670
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:04,339
Right.

671
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:07,805
If you get out of here and I don't...

672
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:14,232
I want you to call Santa Fe 33200.

673
00:43:14,234 --> 00:43:16,852
I want you to tell them that Magpie

674
00:43:17,718 --> 00:43:19,654
is our work.

675
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:22,107
It's not theirs.

676
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:27,445
Tell them to look for the... the letters.

677
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,928
Not the number...

678
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:37,422
Houdini?

679
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,125
Charlie?

680
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:44,462
Oh, hey.

681
00:43:48,134 --> 00:43:49,601
Charlie.

682
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,772
Hey.

683
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:11,289
What?

684
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,124
It's a...

685
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:14,743
This is a fake.

686
00:44:14,745 --> 00:44:16,661
It's...

687
00:44:18,631 --> 00:44:20,409
It's a game.

688
00:44:22,502 --> 00:44:24,135
Uncle.

689
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:41,099
I believe you, Frank.

690
00:44:56,669 --> 00:44:58,703
Where is Avram Fisher?

691
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:05,343
What... what is this?

692
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:08,380
The man from Washington
who gave you this file.

693
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:10,298
Where is he?

694
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:14,635
Who... who the hell are you?

695
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:17,806
The United States of America.

696
00:45:19,892 --> 00:45:23,194
There... there's no Tosa.

697
00:45:24,313 --> 00:45:25,883
Is there?

698
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:28,081
All of it, um...

699
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:32,203
Beuker. W...

700
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:33,955
What was it, a test?

701
00:45:33,957 --> 00:45:36,157
Where is Mr. Fisher, Frank?

702
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,410
He brought you here from the Hill.

703
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:41,746
What, are you... are you from Los Alamos?

704
00:45:41,748 --> 00:45:43,381
We don't use that name.

705
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:48,586
What?

706
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:59,431
Well, I don't know what kind
of sick sons of bitches you are,

707
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:02,734
but you need to talk to Oppenheimer now.

708
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:04,235
You need to tell him

709
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:06,154
to... to look at Magpie again.

710
00:46:06,156 --> 00:46:08,606
- Magpie is dead, as you know.
- Oh, God damn it.

711
00:46:08,608 --> 00:46:10,608
It's not Heisenberg's math.

712
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,244
It's ours. It's... it's mine.

713
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,248
If you get me out of here,
I can prove that to you.

714
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:19,484
How?

715
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:22,120
You see, my daughter's name...

716
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:24,372
it's written in the equations

717
00:46:24,374 --> 00:46:26,624
the Nazis are using to build their bomb.

718
00:46:30,262 --> 00:46:32,547
You put your daughter's name...

719
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:34,171
- in the math?
- Yes.

720
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:36,044
Yes.

721
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,883
Yes, I did. That's what I'm saying.

722
00:46:39,523 --> 00:46:43,641
They got... they got a man on the
inside and he's stealing our work.

723
00:46:45,194 --> 00:46:48,563
Mr. Fisher thought you were a Nazi spy.

724
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:52,033
Is that what all of this was for?

725
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,559
But you're not.

726
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:56,154
You're simply...

727
00:46:56,156 --> 00:46:59,791
ashamed of who you are.

728
00:46:59,793 --> 00:47:01,626
What you came from.

729
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:03,629
That's good.

730
00:47:04,247 --> 00:47:05,997
We all come from sin.

731
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,084
It's up to us to rise.

732
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:15,223
So...

733
00:47:15,225 --> 00:47:17,058
what, is that it?

734
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,811
I'm just free to go home?

735
00:47:19,813 --> 00:47:21,429
No.

736
00:47:21,431 --> 00:47:22,847
No.

737
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:28,103
You recognized your own math.

738
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:33,108
It's all...

739
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:37,077
It's all a game.

740
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:39,914
I tell you that I can prove

741
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:42,500
the Nazis are using our science,

742
00:47:42,502 --> 00:47:44,035
you... you don't even blink.

743
00:47:45,538 --> 00:47:47,005
Either one of you.

744
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,711
The Germans... Germans didn't
write any of this, did they?

745
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:55,871
You did. It's propaganda.

746
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:58,433
You're using our math,

747
00:47:58,435 --> 00:48:01,386
my math, to convince us
the Nazis are winning.

748
00:48:03,522 --> 00:48:07,275
Was... was there even a
Magpie in the first place?

749
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:09,778
We had a man in Heisenberg's lab.

750
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,613
The Nazis sent us his head.

751
00:48:11,615 --> 00:48:13,945
Yeah, but he... he
didn't give you that file.

752
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:16,651
You got a lab full of longhairs,

753
00:48:16,653 --> 00:48:18,319
half-Reds, lefty Jews...

754
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,655
how do you get them to
build a wonder weapon?

755
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:26,661
You just tell them Germany's
gonna end the world tomorrow.

756
00:48:29,498 --> 00:48:31,416
Dogs won't fight.

757
00:48:35,304 --> 00:48:37,422
Heat up the cage.

758
00:48:41,427 --> 00:48:43,928
Adolf Hitler is after a bomb, Frank.

759
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,147
Yeah, but how far along is he?

760
00:48:46,149 --> 00:48:48,349
You don't even know, do you?!

761
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:51,436
How many other people are you
selling fake intelligence to?

762
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:54,189
The Secretary of War? The President?

763
00:48:54,579 --> 00:49:04,692

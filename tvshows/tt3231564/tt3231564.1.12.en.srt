1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,484
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,324
I gave you the velocity distribution problem

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,171
because I think you're the only man
here who's capable of solving it.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,806
You are a once-in-a-generation mind.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,845
There's a problem with Thin Man.
So what are we gonna do about it?

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,447
The plan is to prove implosion
works before the plutonium arrives.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,249
To put everybody around you in jeopardy?

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,526
Sorry to hear about Glen.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,807
Went to go do admin
work for Oppenheimer?

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,167
Helen, there's something I need to ask you.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,480
Oh, shit.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,005
Are you...

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,607
- This is just work.
- Of course it is.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,524
I need you to put some papers
into their house.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,762
To make it look like Lancefield hid them.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,444
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,970
<i>So you're framing them for something.</i>

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,887
Dr. Akley. I apologize.

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,167
It's about a problem we've been
working on in implosion.

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,766
Implosion is Frank Winter country
and the border is closed.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,609
I believe your border is wide open.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:10,800
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,801
Christ.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,770
You spooked me.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,284
I thought everyone
had cleared out for the night.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,727
"Boldly they rode and well,

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,968
"Into the jaws of Death,

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,403
"Into the mouth of Hell."

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,644
You know that one?

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,806
No, sir.

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Will you let me know
if you see anything out of the ordinary?

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,570
Nothing's amiss here.

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,605
Thank you, Edgar.

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,408
Reed.
What time is it?

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,571
It's late as far as the javelina are concerned.

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,602
You're in the doghouse, huh?

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,765
I warned you.

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,408
Secrets have a way of coming out.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,481
Get dressed.

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,809
We're going for a drive.

41
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,524
I wouldn't know a javelina
if it ran right past me.

42
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,325
It won't.
They can sniff you out from 100 yards.

43
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,882
So how are we supposed to shoot one?

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,367
We're not shooting wild pigs, Charlie.

45
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,364
They taste like shit and they look
too ugly to put on a wall.

46
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,731
Dr. Akley?

47
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,083
A combat historian I know
found out a fascinating detail

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,367
about our American G.I.s on the front line.

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,921
Is that right?

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,163
We're fighting an army
convinced it is a master race

51
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,528
destined to dominate all of mankind,

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,922
an army that puts your women
and children in concentration camps.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,525
But do you know

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,929
what four in five of our soldiers do

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,890
when given the chance to fire
at these wretched people?

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,483
They intentionally miss.

57
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,684
80% of our soldiers

58
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,489
can't bear the idea of shooting someone,
even their worst enemy.

59
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,804
I doubt I'd be able to.

60
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,521
And yet you shot me in the back.

61
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,121
Sir,

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,729
whatever you heard...

63
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,886
Charlie, you know how long
we've been working on the gun model?

64
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,287
Almost a year.

65
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,646
Seven hundred years.

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,644
The Chinese invented
firearms in the 13th century.

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,370
We've been refining them ever since.

68
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,841
Thin Man is just the next evolutionary stage,

69
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,446
so why are you trying to sabotage her?

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,086
Sir,

71
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,245
Thin Man was never gonna work.

72
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,724
With the plutonium that
they are making at Site X,

73
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,410
Thin Man will predetonate.

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,767
The spontaneous fission rate is too high.

75
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,400
- That might be true.
- No, sir, it is true.

76
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,890
But, Charlie, we're not
using the plutonium at Site X.

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,485
I was there. I saw the factory.

78
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,490
What you saw at Site X was a pilot plant
designed to work out the kinks.

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,090
I wasn't in Washington, D.C. this week.

80
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,965
I was in Washington State
touring the new reactor

81
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,242
that will make
the weapons-grade plutonium.

82
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,609
The Army calls it Site W.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,209
But why would we think that
their plutonium would be any cleaner?

84
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,886
Because Enrico Fermi
personally designed the reactor.

85
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,049
I have the fission rates on my desk.

86
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,004
It's as good as cyclotron plutonium.
It's as good as pure.

87
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,683
You've been manipulated

88
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,287
by a brilliant but misguided man.

89
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,925
Frank Winter is using you
to destroy Thin Man.

90
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,691
Did Frank know about Site W?

91
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,604
He has the same security clearance
as I do, at least for now.

92
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,731
But why wouldn't he have told me?

93
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,489
Charlie, I don't care if implosion
wins this war or Thin Man.

94
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,370
I don't care if Hitler swallows a shotgun!

95
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,210
Every man on this Hill
is fighting the same war

96
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,330
except Frank, who's too busy
fighting for his own place in history!

97
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,963
Tell me, whose idea was it
to hijack Thin Man in the first place?

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,282
Whose idea to try and dupe
the most powerful army in the world?

99
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,203
- Yours?
- No.

100
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,247
Was it Frank's brilliant idea
to send Helen Prins over

101
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,891
- to spy on Thin Man as well?
- She wasn't involved.

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,324
Frank's had you on her strings
since the minute you got here.

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,161
He used her to squeeze
the plutonium out of you.

104
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,006
He sent her to Site X in order to tempt you.

105
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,006
What about Tom Lancefield?
Is he mixed up in all this?

106
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,091
Lancefield found out.

107
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,689
Frank said we had to get rid of him.

108
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,045
Jesus, Charlie.

109
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,960
Sir, I am so sorry.

110
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,371
It's okay.

111
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,771
It's okay.

112
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,804
Right now, we have to figure out
a way to keep you safe.

113
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,521
Last night,
I pulled every requisition

114
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,648
that's come out of my office
in the last two months.

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,611
Every order co-opting our resources
for use on implosion.

116
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,445
Your signature is on all of them.
Plain as day.

117
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,726
Jesus.

118
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,491
The Army uses the same ammo
for decent, misguided men

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,891
as it does for spies.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,162
You're implicated in a conspiracy

121
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,802
to sabotage the most expensive and
the most secret project in military history.

122
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,050
And if it comes out, you're the only one
that it will trace back to.

123
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,965
And meanwhile,

124
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,602
the man who's truly responsible for all this
could get away soot-free.

125
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,044
How long does it take Dr. Oppenheimer
to walk 300 feet from his office?

126
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,167
Where is he?

127
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,649
Well, they have central AC
and no dust storms at the White House,

128
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,883
so you can hardly blame
the man for extending his stay.

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,331
Don't worry.

130
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,004
I'll take notes.

131
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,723
Gentlemen, we've just gotten word
that more than a gram of plutonium

132
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,128
will be shipping imminently
from the graphite reactor at Site X.

133
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,201
How imminently?

134
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,520
Within a week.

135
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,889
Well, don't forget the postal service
doesn't deliver on Sundays.

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,246
Solid plutonium buttons will be traveling
by train in a sealed titanium case.

137
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,651
Carried by whom?

138
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,527
That's need-to-know information.

139
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,769
The last time we shipped plutonium,

140
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,481
a sweaty-palmed junior professor
nearly got himself killed at a truck stop,

141
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,006
so forgive me if I'd like
a little background on the person

142
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,641
we're entrusting with 100 times as much
of the scarcest resource on the planet.

143
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,489
He's a heavily-armed lieutenant in
Tennessee's 5th Ranger Battalion,

144
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,241
the most combat-ready unit
in the United States Army.

145
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,045
That good enough for you?

146
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,968
The train from Knoxville to Santa Fe
takes 34 and a quarter hours.

147
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,721
Two-thirds of the 50 stops
appear on every world map.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,604
And do you know where
the highest concentrations

149
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,001
of German nationals in
this country happen to live?

150
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,048
The Santa Fe Railroad sold them

151
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,044
a few hundred thousand acres
of farmland at the turn of the century.

152
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,401
We need soldiers in
army trucks, aerial support.

153
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,610
We need a convoy that can protect itself
in case it falls under enemy attack.

154
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,365
That operation will delay
the shipment by weeks.

155
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,762
If we fumble this ball,
we won't be looking at delays.

156
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,723
The game will be over.

157
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,726
Glen?

158
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,404
It's a reasonable point.

159
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,161
This week, I found out
that a subordinate of mine

160
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,323
was stealing Thin Man secrets
from under my nose, a man that I trusted.

161
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,930
Now imagine if a traitor like Tom Lancefield
were to catch wind of our shipping plans.

162
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,929
Now I think that it's time
that we all faced reality.

163
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,882
There are spies on this Hill.

164
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,090
Helen, I'm busy.

165
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,441
With what?

166
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,768
- Not now.
- Okay, when?

167
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,086
Dr. Prins.

168
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,682
Just the physicist I wanted to see.

169
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,644
How was your trip, sir?

170
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,802
I wanna tell you something, Helen.

171
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,007
Whatever the reason that Charlie
recruited you into Thin Man,

172
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,969
I'm lucky to have you on my team.

173
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,481
Oh...

174
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,645
Thank you, sir. I'm so glad to be here.

175
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,763
You ever hear that old song,

176
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,406
<i>I'm Gonna Dance Wit De Guy Wot Brung Me?</i>

177
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,481
No.

178
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,851
I know that Frank brought you to this dance,

179
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,605
and I know you feel loyal to him.

180
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,961
For whatever reason,
he inspires that in people.

181
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,281
Oh, sir, I'm very grateful.

182
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,010
He inspired it in me.

183
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,403
Did you know that Frank gave me
my first job out of graduate school?

184
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,922
- Really?
- Even back then, he had a unique mind.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,082
He was brilliant. He was iconoclastic.

186
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,049
I looked up to him.

187
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,281
And then he picked a squabble
with the department chair,

188
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,727
and, uh, I leapt to his defense and

189
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,480
next thing I know, Frank's AWOL
and I'm left flapping in the Chicago wind.

190
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,530
It taught me a valuable
lesson about politics.

191
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,004
And about Frank.

192
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,085
Well, he's not the easiest guy to work with.

193
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,724
Great men are not always good men.

194
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,966
There's a storm coming.

195
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,771
Now, Charlie won't admit it,

196
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,808
but I think you're involved in this mess.

197
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,570
I'm gonna protect Charlie.

198
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,130
I'd like to protect you.

199
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,490
But I can't help you unless
I know that I can trust you.

200
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,242
Let me ask you something.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,571
Did you even know
what you were getting involved in?

202
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,521
Sir, I was coerced.

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,401
<i>Speeches will be limited to five minutes</i>

204
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,962
<i>so that we may hear from as
many candidates as possible.</i>

205
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,843
Well, she has got my vote.

206
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,809
- Who does?
- Mrs. Winter.

207
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,130
It's about time we had
a fresh face on the town council.

208
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,127
Colonel's gonna wish he were
back in the Solomon Islands.

209
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,531
Do you think you could
get me a meeting with her?

210
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,602
I have a few issues
I'd like to talk to her about.

211
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,331
The new George Zucco
picture came out in November,

212
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,448
and they still haven't
shown it in the theater here.

213
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,922
Oh, and Jeannie is very concerned
about the curfew in the women's dorm.

214
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,644
Whoa, whoa. Hey, Frank.

215
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,806
Where is everybody?

216
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,327
I'm starting to feel like the 10th little Indian.

217
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,961
No idea.

218
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,010
Well, if this were a movie,
one of us would be the killer.

219
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,290
Frank!

220
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,931
It doesn't make any sense.

221
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,642
Charlie has as much to lose as we do. More.

222
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,885
I don't know if he told Akley
or if somebody else did,

223
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,646
but Akley knows.

224
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,329
He's got Charlie in his corner,
he now thinks he has me.

225
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,325
He's lining you up
to take the fall for everything.

226
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,691
Let's get ahead of this.
We'll sound the alarm on Thin Man.

227
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,000
No, we need proof.

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,762
Well, we'll show them that
Baritol can vary the burn rates

229
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,126
and how to consolidate the shock waves.

230
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,971
It's just a theory.
We need a gram of plutonium from Site X

231
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,725
to prove Thin Man won't work
and implosion will.

232
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,881
I know some people at Site X.

233
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,769
I could probably get them
to rush the shipment.

234
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,444
You don't have the authority for that.

235
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,490
I'll just tell them I'm acting
on Akley's orders.

236
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,166
You lie to the Army,

237
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,005
it won't make a difference
what the testing shows.

238
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,845
You'll be damaged goods
for the rest of this war.

239
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,370
Gertrude.

240
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,131
Gertrude.

241
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,042
Is the Colonel here, yet?

242
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,010
<i>Shall I show you how to</i>

243
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,082
<i>use the intercom again, Mr. Babbit?</i>

244
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,041
I think Heinrich Himmler loves me
more than this intercom.

245
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,521
Gertrude.

246
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,726
Gertrude.

247
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,566
<i>Sir, you have a visitor.</i>

248
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,245
Send the Colonel in.

249
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,041
Never was one for fruit salad
on my dress shirts.

250
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,324
Or marching for that matter.

251
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,846
Sorry, I won't be but a minute.

252
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,161
Paul.

253
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,330
I heard they moved you in
with Oppenheimer's rock collection.

254
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,963
How do calcite and pyrite
fare as office mates?

255
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,481
They're quieter than the janitorial staff.

256
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,482
Glen, I need a transfer.

257
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,484
I can supervise production in Site X.
Or I can man one of the teams in Manhattan.

258
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,884
I thought you were committed to implosion.

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,082
Whoever we once worked for,

260
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,402
Frank has become someone else.

261
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,521
What happened?

262
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,171
I accepted his demands.
I put my complete faith in him.

263
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,364
And what do I get in return? I'm made a fool.

264
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,569
He trusted Helen.
He even trusted Charlie Isaacs.

265
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,406
But not me.

266
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,610
You're not the only one.

267
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,284
He didn't tell you, either?

268
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,723
You know, I thought
maybe that's why you left.

269
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,608
You brought him here in the first place.

270
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,043
And this is how he repays you.

271
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,882
I'll see what I can do about the transfer.

272
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,440
That bastard Akley won't have me, either.

273
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,207
No good deed on this Hill goes unpunished.

274
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,248
I even had the gall to say
that I can't be trusted.

275
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,885
Even after I...

276
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,486
Even after you what?

277
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,887
Even after I told him the truth

278
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,164
about Frank and Isaacs.

279
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,881
You told Akley?

280
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,802
What does Isaacs have that I don't?

281
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,162
- Switchboard.
- I need an outside line.

282
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,924
Washington, DC. The White House.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,684
I need to speak to Robert Oppenheimer.

284
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,207
<i>- Identification number?</i>
- G-11 .

285
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,646
<i>One moment.</i>

286
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,004
<i>The call could not be completed.</i>

287
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,165
Then put me through to
the Pentagon switchboard.

288
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,925
<i>Sir, you do not have
authorization to call off the Hill.</i>

289
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,800
That's ridiculous. G-11.
I've got tier one security clearance.

290
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,850
<i>I'm sorry, your clearance
has been downgraded.</i>

291
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,526
What? By whose order?

292
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,689
<i>I do not have authorization
to share that information.</i>

293
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,480
<i>To ensure a wider representation
among our rapidly expanding population,</i>

294
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,566
<i>the town council has seen fit
to expand our ranks for the coming term.</i>

295
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,883
<i>Today we'll be hearing
from several candidates.</i>

296
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,200
<i>Mr. Epstein.</i>

297
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,722
<i>Friends, neighbors,</i>

298
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,688
<i>our way of life on this
happy Hill is under attack.</i>

299
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,721
<i>And we all know who is to blame.</i>

300
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,371
<i>Dairy cows.</i>

301
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,365
<i>That's why all our milk
tastes like sagebrush.</i>

302
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,883
<i>Maybe if President Roosevelt
had a baby to feed, he'd realize...</i>

303
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,406
<i>I was bird-watching. I wasn't lurking.</i>

304
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,401
<i>And for my opponent to suggest
that I'm some kind of Peeping Tom</i>

305
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,211
<i>is, frankly, outrageous.</i>

306
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,242
Glen, how's it feel to finally be able
to move freely between buildings?

307
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,250
Can we review your concept
on the plan we discussed?

308
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,247
The, eh, plutonium transport.

309
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,409
I think we can strong-arm the Army

310
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,211
into releasing a convoy in the next few days.

311
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,887
Leave those with my girl. I'll get back to you.

312
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,970
Honestly, Glen, I don't think that
what we discussed is sufficient.

313
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,282
We have to consider
more extreme measures.

314
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,330
Even if it means pushing
the delivery back a few more weeks.

315
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,048
<i>And finally we have Mrs...</i>

316
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,283
<i>Excuse me, Dr. Liza Winter.</i>

317
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,246
<i>Hello.</i>

318
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,888
<i>Some of you may know me
from my work at the medical clinic.</i>

319
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,244
<i>Or as the wife of one of
the group heads in the tech area.</i>

320
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,370
<i>But I suspect I am best known for
throwing a tantrum in the military offices</i>

321
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,848
<i>and an unauthorized
bonfire in my own backyard.</i>

322
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,966
<i>You see,</i>

323
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,324
<i>I have a condition.</i>

324
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,686
<i>Don't worry, it's not contagious.</i>

325
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,370
<i>My doctor tells me that
I have a neurotic character.</i>

326
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,524
<i>Which, when properly medicated,
as it is now,</i>

327
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,683
<i>is no more neurotic
than any other in this room.</i>

328
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,886
<i>And now I can see that you are wondering
why I'm sharing this information with you.</i>

329
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,841
<i>I don't believe in keeping secrets anymore.</i>

330
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,885
<i>You see, I've lived on this Hill
for over a year, and I've been watching</i>

331
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,482
<i>how the Army deploys information control</i>

332
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,731
<i>to erode our community.</i>

333
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,246
<i>Colonel,</i>

334
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,245
<i>you have packed 4,000 civilians</i>

335
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,691
<i>into an army base zoned for 400.</i>

336
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,566
<i>You have asked us to live
without bathtubs and stoves,</i>

337
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,970
<i>reliable electricity, fresh produce,</i>

338
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,570
<i>and that's fine.</i>

339
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,005
<i>I think we all agree</i>

340
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,323
<i>we're happy to make those sacrifices
of modern conveniences</i>

341
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,243
<i>if it's gonna help us win this war.</i>

342
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,847
<i>But our boys overseas, they are fighting</i>

343
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,410
<i>and they are dying
to defend our constitutional rights.</i>

344
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,887
<i>Now is the time for someone to explain</i>

345
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,931
<i>precisely what rights we have
when we live within these fences</i>

346
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,290
<i>and what recourse we have if we feel
those rights have been abridged.</i>

347
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:07,086
<i>I believe that the war for American values
is being waged right here on this Hill.</i>

348
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,722
<i>I believe transparency</i>

349
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,603
<i>is the lifeblood of democracy.</i>

350
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,282
<i>I'm asking for your vote.</i>

351
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,846
You and your wife in the same day.

352
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,081
Lucky me.

353
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,369
Site X was supposed to be
shipping the plutonium this month.

354
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,087
I need you to tell me
when it's scheduled to arrive.

355
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,288
You don't have the clearance
for that information anymore.

356
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,408
Then get Secretary Stimson on the phone.

357
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,801
It was his office that
downgraded your clearance.

358
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,726
Apparently you pissed on the wrong
fire hydrant this time, Dr. Winter.

359
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,321
I know that plutonium is ready.
I talked to Tennessee weeks ago.

360
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,487
I can't help you.

361
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
Thin Man won't work.

362
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,041
What?

363
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,120
Twenty years from now,
every government on this planet

364
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,487
will know how to design a bomb,

365
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,001
but they won't be able to build it

366
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,845
because purifying plutonium to a base level

367
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,567
takes more manpower and resources
than building the pyramids.

368
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,728
Thin Man needs fuel that's 100 times
more pure than even we can make.

369
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,682
It is completely impossible.

370
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,288
That's a troubling theory.

371
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,888
Just as it was troubling to hear
your other 15 theories over the past year

372
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,843
for why your model is better than Akley's.

373
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,689
This isn't a theory.

374
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,004
When the plutonium arrives, it will be a fact.

375
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,929
Thin Man will predetonate.

376
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,329
You're talking about work
that isn't yours, Frank.

377
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,881
About a group that isn't yours.

378
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,611
How did you come to know
something like that?

379
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,570
I have it on good authority.

380
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,410
No one knows the penalties for violating
compartmentalization better than you.

381
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,291
G-2 has been in this office
almost every day asking me

382
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,569
whether you or your friends
are Commies or spies.

383
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,644
If you feel something needs to be reported,

384
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,401
I suggest we get them in here
before you say another word.

385
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,842
- Gertrude.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

386
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,883
Get me an outside line.

387
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,366
<i>A reminder. All residents are expected to</i>

388
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,522
<i>make their best effort to conserve water.</i>

389
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,285
<i>The military appreciates your cooperation.</i>

390
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,766
Hello.

391
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,447
Hello.

392
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,444
I'm sorry, but I think this is my house.

393
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,484
They told us we were taking over 128B.

394
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,045
I'm Evelyn.

395
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,480
My husband and I
just drove in from Berkeley.

396
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,691
We're so relieved to finally be here.

397
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,161
Looks like they left in kind of a hurry.

398
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,365
What's wrong with you?

399
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,361
Wake up.

400
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,490
Damn it.

401
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,082
He can split the atom,
but ask the man to tie a Half Windsor...

402
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,161
Mmm.

403
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,211
I can fix my own tie.

404
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,806
You know, Elsa picked out
Albert's clothes for him

405
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,723
until the day she died.

406
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,249
Men like you shouldn't
waste your brains on apparel.

407
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,561
Honey,

408
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,171
I'm not Albert Einstein.

409
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,287
No,

410
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,768
he didn't liberate Europe.

411
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,644
Can I ask you something?

412
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,440
Anything.

413
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,568
You know, General Eisenhower
might win this war without us.

414
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,609
We might not even need the gadget.

415
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,364
There's always the Japanese.

416
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,882
Anyway, I was just thinking, um,

417
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,762
maybe we should just go back to Chicago.

418
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,490
Honey.

419
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,801
You are sweet, but we both know

420
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,726
they're going to call you to Washington,
and you can't refuse the President.

421
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,247
Imagine all the dinner invitations.
I'm exhausted just thinking about it.

422
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,289
- I don't know about that.

423
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,366
I wish you weren't so modest,

424
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,641
at least with me.

425
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,125
Dr. Akley.

426
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,524
There's a call for you.

427
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,649
Director of Operations at Site X.

428
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,724
He says he needs to speak
with you immediately.

429
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,441
Mrs. Isaacs. ls he here?

430
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,849
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone will see you.

431
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,682
- Meet me at the armory in 30 minutes.
- Fine.

432
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,569
You gonna leave me sitting on
my ass like you did yesterday?

433
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,005
You need to leave.

434
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,126
It's true.

435
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,083
You've been listening to Akley.

436
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,003
I've been listening to reason.

437
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,605
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

438
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,250
Nothing he didn't already know.

439
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,361
Ch.

440
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,962
I never should have knocked on your door.

441
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,408
I guess Reed Akley's figured out
a way to rewrite the laws of physics.

442
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,687
Prevent Thin Man
from blowing up in his face.

443
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,525
Actually, he has.
It's a new reactor up in Washington.

444
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,530
- I think you've heard of it.
- What, Site W plutonium?

445
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,166
That's his magic bullet?

446
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,210
The only thing Site W has
on Site X is a river view.

447
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,125
A factory is a factory.

448
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,328
They'll never make plutonium
Thin Man can use.

449
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,722
- Akley told me you'd say that.
- Oh, Jesus. You can't trust him, Charlie.

450
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,001
Oh, but I can trust you?

451
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,804
Implosion works. We both know that.

452
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,002
Implosion works in theory.

453
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,769
You have no idea what we'll find out
when the plutonium arrives.

454
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,045
Listen to me.

455
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,762
Akley manipulated the Secretary
into suspending my security clearance.

456
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,362
But you, you can push operations
to get that plutonium here immediately.

457
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,606
Right.

458
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,247
- Because it's always up to me.
- Wha...

459
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,642
Every detonator, every requisition,
every inch of Primacord,

460
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,200
they all trace back to me. Why is that?

461
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,807
We're talking about winning a world war.
You're thinking about signatures on forms?

462
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,611
- You set me up.
- God, I should have known it.

463
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,441
I should have known you would fold
at the very first sign of resistance.

464
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,803
Get the hell out of my house.

465
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,005
Yeah, you're right.

466
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,769
I should give you time
to say goodbye to your wife.

467
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,320
'Cause when the Army
and G-2 find out about this,

468
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,721
they'll be knocking on your door.

469
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,809
But not for the first time, right, Charlie?

470
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,921
You lied about Babbit.

471
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,729
- You lied about Richard Lavro.
- You forced me to lie.

472
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,841
Do you...

473
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,968
Do you really think they'll care?

474
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,571
You know what I think?

475
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,608
You've compromised every
member of your group.

476
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,250
You alienated your mentor.

477
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,084
A year in this desert
has driven your wife insane.

478
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,285
So your name has to be on the bomb
or you did it all for nothing.

479
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:41,131
I am not gonna be the last casualty
of Frank Winter's ego.

480
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,926
Abby, I don't know what you heard, but...

481
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,570
I heard plenty.

482
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,690
I made a mistake.

483
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,648
I listened to the wrong man.

484
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,287
Dr. Akley gave me an opportunity

485
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,091
and I betrayed his trust.

486
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,327
But,

487
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,162
he's given me a second chance.

488
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,160
A clean slate.

489
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,081
There's no such thing as a clean slate.

490
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,681
For any of us.

491
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,320
There is.

492
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,810
I lost my bearings for a little while, that's all.

493
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,290
There's no difference.

494
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,367
What?

495
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,889
Between Frank Winter and Reed Akley.
That's not a choice.

496
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,646
One tried to destroy our marriage,

497
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,484
the other dragged us into
this trap in the first place.

498
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,528
- I'm not sure which is worse.
- Abby.

499
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,411
You are a pawn

500
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,289
in some kind of political game.

501
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,362
And you made me a pawn, too.

502
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,490
I framed a man and his wife, my friend.
And for what?

503
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,400
I told you, I listened to the
wrong person, but I'm fixing it.

504
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,848
But the man I married had his own mind.
What happened to him?

505
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,085
What happened to you?

506
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,122
When was the last time that
you told me that you loved me?

507
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,722
You barely touched me in months.

508
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,009
I'm going home, Charlie.

509
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,327
You can't. The Army won't allow it.

510
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,529
I looked into it.
There's one way that they will.

511
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,846
What Way?

512
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,970
If we're divorced.

513
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,887
The problem is that neither Clark Kent
nor Bruce Wayne has a sense of humor.

514
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,645
I know their parents died,
and that's really sad, but...

515
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,888
Honestly, even I get
tired of superhero orphans.

516
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,246
Exactly.

517
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,482
They should make a comic book about you.

518
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,364
You already have an origin story, right?

519
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,441
I do?

520
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,682
- Remember how the Flash got his powers?
- Yeah.

521
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,240
He inhaled heavy water vapors
in the laboratory.

522
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,761
Didn't you inhale something, too?

523
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,528
I do have an origin story.

524
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,363
- Dr. Babbit?
- Sorry to interrupt.

525
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,329
Oh, God, are you two...

526
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,362
No. I need your help.

527
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,967
There he is.
I've been looking over all your concerns.

528
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,968
Now, our muzzle velocity
is 910 meters per second.

529
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,569
Barrel pressure is sitting in the range
of 75,000 pounds per square inch.

530
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,766
- But we can do better.
- Sir...

531
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,481
If we extend the barrel, the plutonium
can reach a higher rate of speed,

532
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,131
but there are only
two airplanes on the planet

533
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,089
that can clear the ground
with an 8,000-pound bomb.

534
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,640
- Neither can accommodate a longer barrel...
- Dr. Akley.

535
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,005
- What is it?
- I can't continue on the project.

536
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,002
I've thought long and hard.

537
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,487
- Today is my last day.
- Charlie.

538
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,127
- It's not accepted.
- Sir, I appreciate your generosity...

539
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,044
My generosity is the only thing standing

540
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,010
between you and a firing squad.

541
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,164
Under the circumstances,

542
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,244
I don't think two weeks notice
is a hell of a lot to ask.

543
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,530
If you have to report me to Oppenheimer,
I understand, but I am done.

544
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,521
Just like that?

545
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,929
I wish I'd done it six months ago.

546
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,606
What about our boys in uniform?
70,000 of them headed for Europe.

547
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,441
- You don't care what happens to them?
- You'll have to finish without me.

548
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,401
I can't.

549
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,086
Charlie,

550
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,849
we are gonna beat
Werner Heisenberg, the two of us.

551
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,882
Why the hell do you think
I recruited you in the first place?

552
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,687
<i>A New Approach to Nuclear Cosmology.</i>

553
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,727
You changed the way
we think about the universe,

554
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,929
the way we think about
the creation of the elements.

555
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,402
You can fix Thin Man.

556
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,164
I thought Thin Man wasn't broken.

557
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,044
It's not. It just needs some modifications.

558
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,366
You knew.

559
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,040
What?

560
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,769
You knew Thin Man was going to fail.

561
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,803
Jesus, Charlie.

562
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,410
- There's no certainties in nuclear science.
- You knew.

563
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,767
You knew and you kept it a secret.

564
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,603
The plutonium from Site W,
it's no different from Site X plutonium, is it?

565
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,569
- Of course, it is.
- Prove it.

566
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,281
Charlie...

567
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,442
You said you had the fission rates
on your desk. Show them to me.

568
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,842
Even if you had the clearance,
you have to trust me.

569
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,365
I don't.

570
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,289
Admit that you're lying
or I walk out that door.

571
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,090
I can't fix this on my own.

572
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,447
- But the two of us together...
- My God.

573
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,847
Charlie, don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

574
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,161
Charlie, don't walk out that door!

575
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,447
You're clear. Go ahead.

576
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,081
Yeah. We're here to pick up
a delivery for Dr. Oppenheimer.

577
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,247
Dr. Sinclair.

578
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,362
Did you have any trouble
finding our little Hill?

579
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,003
I had trouble finding a taxi in
Santa Fe that would pick up a negro.

580
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,841
Is that all you brought?

581
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,841
1.12 grams of plutonium.

582
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,490
Plus every stitch of clothing I own.

583
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,842
I left Tennessee as soon as you called.

584
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,368
Where is Dr. Oppenheimer?

585
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,690
Don't worry.
He'll catch wind of this soon enough.

586
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,410
You said you were calling on his authority

587
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,443
and that he would find me
a permanent position here.

588
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,205
Dr. Sinclair, you have
a bright future on the Hill.

589
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,004
And that makes one of us.

590
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,369
Wait, what about me?

591
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,330
Dr. Winter.

592
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,524
- I hear they're making a movie.
- I'm sorry?

593
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,645
A nervous-looking fellow was here.
He asked me to return that to you.

594
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,450
Oh, thank you.

595
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,129
- Hey.
- Hey.

596
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,370
What you doing here?

597
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,121
Um...

598
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,448
I had nowhere else to go.

599
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,206
I'm the one who told Frank
about you and Akley.

600
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,441
I know.

601
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,804
But you didn't tell Akley about me.

602
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,604
I forced you into this in the first place.

603
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,449
I made my own choices.

604
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,764
What happens next?

605
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,210
There is no next.

606
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,283
In 24 hours, I'll be off this Hill
one way or the other.

607
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,887
Do you have a place to sleep?

608
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,800
Charlie.

609
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,801
Frank.

610
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,325
Did Isaacs send you?

611
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,127
No.

612
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,124
What do you want?

613
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,291
The only thing that any of us wants.

614
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,842
What do you want from me?

615
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,651
Your help.

616
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,211
With Thin Man.

617
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,250
Thin Man is dead.

618
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,721
Then we'll bring it back to life.

619
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,169
You'll imagine a way.

620
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,287
You did the best you could, Reed.

621
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,768
But your bomb won't run on imagination.

622
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,569
You don't have to do this.

623
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,685
Just talk to Oppenheimer.
Tell him why the gun model won't work.

624
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,686
By the time the plutonium gets here,
you will look like a goddamn hero.

625
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,611
It's already here.

626
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,090
<i>It's in the metallurgy lab.</i>

627
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,521
<i>Oppenheimer's office arranged
an accelerated delivery.</i>

628
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,524
<i>It appears you still have a friend on this Hill.</i>

629
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,402
We both have blood on our hands.

630
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,605
If the Army finds out what happened here,

631
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,846
you and I are gonna end up
in the brig together.

632
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,089
But not if we make a unified front.

633
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,965
This project won't survive without us.

634
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,807
So we talk to Robert tonight,

635
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,206
together.

636
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,811
We let him know that implosion
is the only way forward.

637
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,684
You'd work with me?

638
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,849
If it gets us there before the Germans,
I will work for you.

639
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,926
Reed, in a few months,
this won't be about burn rates

640
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,287
and shock waves and supercompression.

641
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,608
It'll be about advising
the Army and the White House

642
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,685
on how to use the most powerful weapon
in the history of mankind.

643
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,208
And I think you and I both know
I don't belong in a room with the President.

644
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,201
Come on.

645
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,850
Let's go to the metallurgy lab.

646
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,687
Frank.

647
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,128
What would you have done

648
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,486
if you thought that
implosion might not work?

649
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,731
Let it go.

650
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,963
Six months from now,
all anyone's gonna remember

651
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,045
is that we built it.

652
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,281
Reed!

653
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,001
Reed!

654
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:22,900

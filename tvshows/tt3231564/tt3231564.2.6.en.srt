There is no Nazi bomb.
The army manipulated us.

00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,417
There is a war
on three continents

3
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,208
and a madman
rounding up Jews.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:15,583

the Site X liaison.

<i> and one miscarriage.</i>

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,583
There isn't always
a medical explanation
in these cases.

16
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:48,667
So it was an act of God?

17
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,667
The longer
that it takes anyone
to deliver a weapon,

18

our most dangerous work
yet-- criticality.

to the brink

56
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,500

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500

one mere catastrophe.

<i> This is what happens</i>

We are the ones
who are bringing this thing

61
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,709
down off the blackboard

62
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,375

63
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,250
All:
Yeah! Yeah!

64
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,583
- We need strict
exposure limits.
- Yes!

65
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,250
- And hazard pay!
- And we're going
to demand it.

66
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,917
But first
I want to tell you

67
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,834
about something
that's happening right now

68
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,375
in Washington, DC.

69
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,917
While we are
risking our necks,

70
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,959
President Roosevelt
is assembling a committee.

71
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,458
It's going to decide
how the gadget's used,

72
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,250
if and when it's dropped,

73
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,834
and who it's going
to be dropped on.

74
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:15,792
And this committee includes
no scientists or engineers.

75
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,834
- Wait, is this
a safety board?
- No.

76
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,417
- Are they setting
new health standards?
- No, no, no.

77
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,875
It's called
the Target Committee,

78
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,291
and as it stands, no one
who helped build the bomb

79
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,625
will have any say in how
or where it's deployed.

80
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,875
But-- but if we'd
all write a letter
to our supervisor--

81
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,875
Let them deploy it
up Eva Braun's ass.

82
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,542
We have bigger problems
here on the Hill.

83
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,458
You didn't even read
them my sample letter.

84
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,500
These guys don't care
about sample letters.

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,917
They care about getting
their balls fried off in
a criticality experiment.

86
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,709
You're supposed
to make them care,
Helen.

87
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,041
You're supposed
to make them see

88
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,709
it's all part
of the same question.

89
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,375

what Mussolini says,

90
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,291
"If you want
something done right,
do it yourself."

91
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,750
Well, I can't
do that right now.

92
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,000
Not while I'm wearing
this uniform.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,375
They already look at me
like I'm a secretary.

94
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,959
And you want me

lecture them about politics?

95
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,542

on the inside.

97

- Jesus.
- It's good for morale,

114
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,041
What happens Thursday?

115
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,667
Just, um, make sure
it doesn't look like
a rodeo out there.

116
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,750
Aye, aye.

117
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,709
Um, I was thinking--

118
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,417
after our
not-so-secret
meeting,

119
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,583
we should be studying

120
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,792
the radiological effects
of the test.

121
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,542
On what?

122
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:17,625
The planet.
People.

123
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,834
I swallowed 24 micrograms
of plutonium in 1943.

124
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,542
Now it's 1945.
I still make the Geiger
counter sing.

125
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,625
Find me a PhD-level
subject matter expert

126
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,458

on the Hill.

127
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,792

You meet Charlie's
qualifications--
that's the good news.

132
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,166
I asked for
the bad news first.

133
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,583

- The colonel.
- Correct.

137
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,750
He's got to listen
to reason, right?

138
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,083
Fritzy, this is a man
who sent a boy to his death

139
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,834

speaking to my husband.

140
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,625

a security badge.

Look, we need you.

143
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,083

00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,500
<i> They're for the family</i>
<i> that's liberated</i>
<i> from Buchenwald.</i>

173
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,500
My lucky tie?

174
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,208
Do you think they'll be
attending a lot of
cocktail parties?

175
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,583
Can I please do my part
without being mocked?

176
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,291
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,709
You said to find a way
to move on.

178
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,959
Abby, I thought we
could do that together.

179
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,125
You know, maybe we
give it another shot.

180
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,125
I don't think
we're supposed to.

181
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,125
Doc said a couple
of months was plenty.

182
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,792
Maybe we lost the baby
for a reason.

183
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,166
- What?
- Don't know.

184
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,875
Do you think that God
still punishes people?

185
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,709
Like the plagues
in Egypt?

186
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,333
What have you
ever done wrong?

187
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,959
Did you know
that there aren't just
10 Commandments?

188
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,917
There's 613.

189
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,166
- Really?
- Mm.

190
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,959
- Abby?
- Yes?

191
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,959
This is, uh--
this is a fairytale.

192
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,041
It's a bedtime story.

193
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,917
Things don't
happen for a reason.
They just happen.

194
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:54,125
Or maybe God was
punishing the families
in those camps.

195
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,875
First you don't want
to help them,

196
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,083
and now you're
blaming them.

197
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,333
I don't want
to help them?

198
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,792
Why do you think
I'm still here, Abby?

199
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,291
What do you think
I do all day?

200
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,792
I don't know, Charlie.
Play with numbers?

201
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,166
You know what,
I'm gonna go, um,

202
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,333
play with numbers
somewhere else.

203
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,625
-<i> ( music playing ) </i>
- ( indistinct chatter )

204
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,166
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't order this.

205
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,750
You dropped something.

206
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,667
Oh, Jesus, Helen!

207
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,001
You owe me a lot more
than a whiskey sour.

208
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,291
Uh, that drink
was actually from me.

209
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,709
But I hope
you enjoyed it.

210
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:13,041
- Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.

211
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,125
With Hogarth on one side
and Theodore on the other,

212
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,208
it's like being
stuck between

213
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,917
Saturday night
and Sunday morning.

214
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,667
The problem
with Little Boy

215
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,000
is all the little boys.

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,709
You shouldn't be part
of anyone's backup plan.

217
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,041
Yeah, well, that's why
I like working in here.

218
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,083
It's a professional
environment.

219
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,875
Oh, yeah,
very professional.

220
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,333
I said I was sorry.

221
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,333
I guess we all
have things to atone
for, right?

222
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,166
Something you want
to say to me, Charlie?

223
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,333
I would like to...

224
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,875
address an injustice.

225
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,125
( screams )
No!

226
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,709
You bastard.

227
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,166
You were right.

228
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,333
I kept you
off the test group
for personal reasons.

229
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,291
It had nothing to do
with your talent.

230
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,333
What personal reasons?

231
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,000
Come to G group.

232
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,083
Don't screw around
with me, Charlie.

233
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,750
We need you.

234
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,208
I need you.

235
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,834
Why now?

236
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,291
The test is
three months off,

237
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,375
we're shorthanded
and underbrained,

238
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,250
and this Thursday--

239
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,792
Jesus, as if we
didn't have enough
to worry about.

240
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,333
What? What happens
Thursday?

241
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,375
- Someone's coming.
- Who?

242
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,208
Vannevar Bush.

243
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,333
F.D.R.'s science advisor
is coming to the Hill?

244
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,500
Sits at the right tire
of God the Father.

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,792
Here to review
the test preparations.

246
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,166
You can't tell anyone.

247
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,417
The job doesn't come
with a raise.

248
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,041
Okay, boss.

249
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,001
( Helen chuckles )

250
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,000
I heard they
liberated another camp.

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,792
That must put a spring
in your step.

252
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,208
Yes.

253
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,542
And to think we're on
the other side of the
world doing our bit.

254
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,834
( board buzzes)

255
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,001
Operator.

256
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:46,041
Paul:
<i> I want to make you wetter</i>
<i> than Dartmoor in November.</i>

257
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,458
Yes, sir.
I'll put you
right through.

258
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,834
Put me right through?
Patience, Constance.

259
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,083
Roll your skirt up first.
Give us a forecast.

260
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,208
<i> ( line ringing )</i>

261
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,083
<i> Bingham here.</i>
<i> Clear?</i>

262
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,083
Clear as a bell, Site X.
Stand by one chorus?

263
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,166
<i> "Roast Beef</i>
<i> of Old England."</i>

264
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,458
( machine humming )

265
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,458
So it's an assistant
directorship

266
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,125
out at the test site.

267
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,166
I'm going to be
refining lens design.

268
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,417
There's still
some asymmetries
to work out.

269
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,917
Isaacs just
threw you a bone.

270
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,001
What happened?

271
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,041
Nothing happened.

272
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,250
He just realized
he made a mistake.

273
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,041
Well,
that's great, Helen.
You deserve it.

274
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,083
Enjoy your last day
under the British Empire.

275
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:06,542
Hey, Frank?

276
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,583
F.D.R.'s science advisor
is touring the test site
this week.

277
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,333
Vannevar Bush
is coming west?

278
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,250
Yes.

279
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,917
No one can find out
I told you.

280
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,291
Hey, you have to--
well, you have to
get him alone.

281
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,291
He's Roosevelt's
brain.

282
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,500
He can get us a seat
on the Target Committee.

283
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,083
I can't do that, Frank.
I mean--

284
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,041
I need some time
to settle it.

285
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,709
The test is in 90 days.

286
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:40,083
You need time to, what,
climb the ladder?

287
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,500
I can't petition
the White House on
my first day of the job.

288
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,166
I'll wind up straight back
where I started.

289
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,250
Yeah. You're right.

290
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,001
Don't make me
regret telling you.

291
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,041
Liza:
<i> I have followed your</i>
<i> orders to the letter.</i>

292
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,625
I haven't spoken
to my husband in months,
as you know.

293
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,417
Please send him my best
next time you do.

294
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,125
But you're still a known
agitator, Mrs. Winter.

295
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,458
I prefer
"rogue botanist."

296
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,417
And you want me
to grant you access

297
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,792
to the most secure site
in the Western Hemisphere

298
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,083
- so that you can...
- Determine the health effects

299
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,583
of atomic radiation
and debris.

300
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,500
I think the Axis
is gonna find that
out soon enough.

301
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,125
Colonel,
it's not the Axis
I'm worried about.

302
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,542
What am I looking at?

303
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:08,208
Well, this is
your office here,

304
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,250
and right here,

305
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,583
only 20 yards away,
is Building E.

306
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,542
Now, do you
know what happens
in Building E?

307
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,792
Something above
your clearance.

308
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:20,250
Well, that wouldn't
stop it from killing me
if it went fast critical

309
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:24,125
and I was
sitting in your chair.

310
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,208
I heard you had
an event last week--

311
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,166
a couple
of graduate students

312
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,125
set off a fast-neutron
chain reaction.

313
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,792
I believe they
call it "tickling
the dragon's tail."

314
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,208
I know what it's called.

315
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,709
The dragons I know
don't like to be tickled.

316
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:42,667
Four seconds longer,
and it would have become
self-sustaining.

317
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,417
So now let's assume

318
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,458
fast criticality sustained
for two to three minutes.

319
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:53,250
Radiant intensity is
the inverse square of distance.

320
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,542
Factoring in the lack
of concrete walls

321
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:59,333
that mitigate exposure...

322
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,083
you and your staff
would most likely be...

323
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,375
well, dead.

324
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,166
I say "most likely"
because, Colonel,

325
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,667
we don't actually know,
but we could.

The Samurai gird
for battle.

344
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,500
Not with swords,
but with pens.

345
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,875
There's a petition
going around.

346
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,333
F.D.R. is forming
a committee

347
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,500
to decide how
the gadget gets used.

348
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,375
We want a seat
at the table.

349
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,375
We?

350
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,583
You didn't sign it,
did you?

351
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,208
This is a good thing.

352
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,917
No. No, for you,
it's not.

353
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:27,417
You don't sign anything.
You don't stand for anything.

354
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,583
You need to earn
Charlie Isaacs' trust.

355
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,917
That is your role.

356
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,709
Stick to the script.

357
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,834
You didn't
congratulate me,
by the way.

358
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:43,500
For what?
Getting the lead
in a racialist play?

359
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,792
"The Mikado" isn't
really about Japan.

360
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,959
It's a satire
of British social mores.

361
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,709
You need to lay off
that pitch pipe.

362
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:54,709
You're cutting off
the oxygen to your brain.

363
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,375
<i> ( knocking on door )</i>

364
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,750
-<i> ( knocking ) </i>
- Yeah?

365
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,792
There's something
you ought to know.

366
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,250
He's circulating
some kind of protest screed.

367
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,333
Is that right?

368
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,792
It's a petition,
Colonel, advancing
the revolutionary idea

369
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,500
that the people
who built the gadget

370
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,709
might have some say
in how it's used.

371
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:26,875
You're a physicist,

372
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,792
not an expert
in geopolitics.

373
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,709
You think
the guys why designed
the B-29 bomber

374
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,458
got to pick their targets?

375
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,834
He doesn't just want
a seat at the table.

376
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,250
He wants to shut down
the project.

377
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,291
Let Dr. Winter
run his BVDs up
the flagpole.

378
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,667
<i> We'll see who salutes.</i>

379
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,875
Now, if we're done
second-guessing democracy,

380
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,667
you're both dismissed.

381
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,542
You can't dismiss me.
I'm not a soldier.

382
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,583
Why don't you go focus
on your criticality
experiments?

383
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,291
It sounds like you
have your hands full

384
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,250
not blowing us
to kingdom come.

385
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,625
( slams door )

386
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,750
Get me an outside line.

387
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,458
Justice Department.

388
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,001
Colonel Emmett Darrow
for Director Hoover.

389
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,750
I told you
to be discreet!

390
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,375
Now you're unionizing
the tech area?

391
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,083
I didn't involve you.

392
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,500
What, you think Charlie
won't figure out

393
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,750
who told you
that Bush was coming?

394
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,917
A couple of
my bunk mates

395
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,417
are acting as
his military escort.

396
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,625
Maybe I heard it
from them.

397
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,750
Helen, we won't
get another chance.

398
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,667
Neither will I.

399
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,500
The colonel's running
some kind of game on me.

400
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,959
Isaacs won't let
me anywhere near
Vannevar Bush.

401
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,417
So, here, you have
to give it to him.

402
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,417
Or burn it
on Isaacs' altar.

403
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,583
Keep your chair
in G group.

404
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,875
I know you'll do
the right thing.

405
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,500
<i> ( man speaking over P.A. )</i>

406
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,792
Hang back there,
Private.

407
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,875
Look, if the colonel
sent you, I already kissed
the ring, all right?

408
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,709
No, not the colonel,
soldier.

409
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,750
You're on the head
of the tech area's dime.

410
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,834
Pack your
bivouac gear, Winter.

411
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,875
<i> You'll be spending</i>
<i> a couple nights</i>
<i> in the desert.</i>

412
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,583
Let me guess...

413
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,125
I'm not returning
until the weekend

414
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,875
after our distinguished
visitor is gone.

415
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:05,083
What are we
gonna do out there,
water some cactus?

416
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,001
You're gonna tickle
the dragon's tail.

417
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,125
Engineer:
<i> That's the spook's car.</i>

418
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,125
You know I heard they found
him floating in the back

419
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,709
just like a canned sardine?

420
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,709
( clicking )

421
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,917
So, you beat Tosa.

422
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,750
Got out of Texas.

423
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,542
Congratulations.

424
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,667
Although
if I'm here,

425
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,166
that means
you're not
all there.

426
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:09,166
So, maybe Tosa
beat you after all.

427
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,625
Let's go.

428
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,917
Some lady biologist got
in the colonel's craw.

429
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,500
He banned
criticality work
inside the gates.

430
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,667
- You say
lady biologist?
- Yeah.

431
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,542
Now you got to
irradiate yourself

432
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:27,041
30 miles from
the nearest doctor.

433
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,583
How close did we get
to fast critical

434
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,667
before the incident?

435
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,291
Uh, 88%.

436
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,959
The goal today
is to get to 90

437
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,917
without waking the dragon
and killing yourself.

438
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:37,291
Well, let's hope
that happens.

439
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,125
- You're not coming?
-<i> Doctor's orders.</i>

440
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,166
Last week--
five roentgens,
three seconds.

441
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:49,000
Whole team
maxed out exposure
for the month.

442
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,667
That's why
you're here.

443
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,291
"Tickling
the dragon's tail."

444
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,166
Nice phrase,
very evocative.

445
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,583
Your wife's boyfriend
would love it.

446
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:08,875
This is how
you double-check
a critical mass?

447
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,667
Play chicken
with an unshielded
atomic pile?

448
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,583
Me, I'd go AWOL

449
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:17,583
before I hit 60%
of fast critical on
the neutron counter.

450
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,834
I preferred
the trunk of my car.

451
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,792
( buzzes )

452
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,750
Operator.

Sounds like
Paul Crosley.

460
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,834
Oh, uh, it's not--
I'm a married woman.

461
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:35,750
Dr. Crosley has
a scheduled call.

462
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,333
I'd best put him
through.

463
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:46,001

I have Site X for you.

464
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:48,750
Yes, sir.

00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,166
Yes, please.

473
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,083
Yes, I remember.

474
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,041
Long day
crossing wires?

475
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:47,208
It's better than
sitting at home.

476
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,500
Tom Lancefield's
wife used to work

477
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,250
at the switchboard,
didn't she?

478
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,208
Attractive girl.
French, of course,

479
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,417
but that's a venial
sin nowadays.

480
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,875
You two were friendly,
weren't you?

481
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,959
Yes, well, we were
very sad to see her go.

482
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,125
But then Constance Faraday
joined our ranks,

483
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:04,875
and she's just wonderful.
Do you know Constance?

484
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,875
I just assumed
that all you Brits
know each other.

485
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,959
Well, the empire
has dwindled,
to be sure,

486
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:12,166
but it's not
a Shropshire village
just yet.

487
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,750
- Yes.
- Fancy a ride,
Mrs. Isaacs?

488
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,333
Hey, I didn't see
your name on the petition.

489
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,792
- What gives?
- Oh, uh...

490
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:29,792
maybe I don't
agree with Frank.

491
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,208
- Really?
- What did I miss?

492

Oh, just guy stuff.

00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,959
Oh, well, speaking

00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:41,250
another toast

496
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,959
Yeah.

Thank you.

498
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,500
Do you guys, uh--
do you guys think

499
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,375
that Gilbert
and Sullivan were
racialists?

500
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,291
No, just
different times.

00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,291
Are there
any good geishas

502

Wait till they hear
that plummy baritone
of yours, huh?

Jimmy, I've never
heard you sing.

504

00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,542

We'll see you

Glass of water?

520
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,625
Glass of anything.
I'm at your mercy.

521
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:01,583
This used to be
the Winters'
palace, no?

522
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,250
- Mm.
- Yeah.

523
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,417
You've certainly
warmed the place up.

524
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,291
- Cheers.
- Mm.

Line 135.

528
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,458
I haven't the foggiest
idea what you mean.

529
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,333
Sorry.

530
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:41,250
Wait,
your scheduled calls.

531
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,417
Clicks and clacks.

532
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:46,041
Mrs. Isaacs,
the clicks and clacks
are technical.

533
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:49,542
They're rather
tedious, I'm afraid.
It's part of the work.

534
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:52,166
The telephone isn't
just for gossip and grocery
lists, you know?

535
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,500
- I'm not sure what
Constance has told you.
- So, you do know Constance?

536
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,583
- Well, of course, uh...
- Of course you know her.

537
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,333
She connects
your calls every day.

538
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,333
And what are
the chances of that,
I wonder.

539
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,001
- She's not
assigned to that line.
- I misspoke.

540
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:04,917
When you were
writing sonnets
with your tongue.

541
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:09,625
There's no record
of those calls
in the logbooks.

542
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,959
Even Dr. Oppenheimer's
calls are logged.

543
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,333
Mrs. Isaacs--
Abby-- sorry, if I may,

544
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,333
if you think I've
done something wrong,
why lure me here?

545
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,625
Am I to, what,
confess?

546
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:24,291
Is Inspector Lestrade
going to jump out,
pistol drawn?

547
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,500
I don't mean
to sound flip.

548
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,125

549
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,709
Truth is you've caught me.

550
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,125
I'm on a mission...

551
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,458
of vengeance.

552
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,375
Not that she seems
to have noticed,
of course.

553
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,125
Constance?

554
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,125
Helen Prins.

555
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,166
And I won't pretend
that you don't know

556
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,417
what she did
to both of us.

557
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,083
Switchboard girl
knows everything.

558
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,583
Where your husband was
last evening, for example.

559
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:10,166
Ah...

560
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,291

561
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:18,125
Well, seems that
he and Helen

562
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,500
have fallen back into
one another's orbit.

563
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,250
I'm so sorry.

564
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,792
Marriage is a bit
of business in this
part of the world.

565
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:33,792
I mean,
ask Constance's husband.

566
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,792
I'm not proud.

567
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,583
But I'm baffled,
frankly, by your husband.

568
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:43,625
How he manages to keep
straying so far afield
with you at home?

569
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,208
These great minds--

570
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:53,041
and I'm not one,
I don't flatter myself--

571
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:57,750
they're quite mad,
you know?

572
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,083
Always chasing
after the invisible.

573
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,583
And they're missing
what's right in front
of them.

My office.

637
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,750
I'm sorry to interrupt
you, sir, but I have
something to report.

638
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,458
I work
the switchboard,

639
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,333
Well, of course
you know,

640
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:07,458
and, um, sometimes
we hear things.

641
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,458
Paul Crosley--
Dr. Crosley.

642
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:14,083
Well, I had to employ

643
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,667
some fairly
unorthodox tactics

644
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,375

645
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,875
But he and Constance Faraday,
our new British transfer,

646
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:25,001
are involved in something

647

line 135, every day
like clockwork

648
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:30,750

on the other line.

649
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,834
Thank you, Mrs. Isaacs.

650
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:36,750

Thank you, sir.

00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:53,041
- I was so glad to see
you at the Seder.
- Yes.

654
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:56,583
This Hill suffers

you may have noticed.

- So do I.

We have such
great need of faith

Yes.

658
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,667
Yes. It's...

659
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:15,959
been a very hard
year with the war
and the camps.

660

- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to upset you.

666

no reason for it.

667
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:43,125
Of course
there's a reason.

Don't fight it.

670
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:49,125
Pain is His voice,

671
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,583

that you're alive

672
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,917

673
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:55,500
In difficult times
most of all,

674
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,083
His voice
is everywhere.

675
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,542
My wife was thrown

is constant

678

for a reason.

679
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,959
We can know
His reason

680
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,208
if we have
the strength
to listen.

681
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,792
Will you?

682
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:24,166

We're all here
for a reason.

688
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,125
We're all here
for a reason.

689
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:36,333
<i> We all know</i>
<i> what that reason is.</i>

690
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:39,709
<i> To drop an atomic weapon</i>
<i> on a Japanese city,</i>

691
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:42,542
<i> killing 30</i>
<i> to 50 thousand people.</i>

692
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:45,959
Mostly civilians,
women and children.

693
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,667
If that's not why
you're here,

694
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,083
you're in
the wrong room.

695
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,792
If you thought
you were racing the Nazis
to a super weapon,

696
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:02,208
your ignorance
has been engineered.

697
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,959
You've been sold
a comic book.

698
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,792
Charlie:<i> Frank?</i>

699
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,917
There is no German bomb.

700
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,792
The Army has known
that for a long time

701
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:13,625
and so has Dr. Isaacs.

702
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,083
Is there a German bomb,
Dr. Isaacs?

703
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:27,750
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

704
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:30,959
- And how long
have you not known?
-<i> It doesn't matter.</i>

705
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,250
The gadget
is gonna end
this war.

706
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,625
It's gonna
save lives.

707
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,083
Hitler is finished.

708
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,333
Every industrial center
in Germany is an ash heap.

709
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,625
The Russians
are rolling in.

710
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,834
Yet I haven't noticed
a second sun over Moscow

711
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:46,959
or Stalingrad
or London, have you?

712
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,375
What does that tell you
as a scientist?

713
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:57,667
Ignorance is forgivable.

714
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,709
It's what comes next
that is not.

715
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,208
Less than a quarter
of you signed this petition.

716
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,125
I don't blame anybody
who didn't.

717
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:10,792
For one thing,
I've been a son of a bitch.

718
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:14,125
I've disrespected
half the people
in this room.

719
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,001
A lot of you
have good reasons

720
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:22,417
not to put your names
on something I wrote.

721
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:25,834
For another thing...

722
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:29,667
this petition--

723
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,792
this petition
is a blacklist.

724
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,875
Anybody know
the half-life
of an FBI file?

725
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:41,333
It's longer than any
of our natural lives.

726
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:47,125
They've been using me
to divide us.

727
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:49,166
But instead--

728
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:52,959
instead we're going
to surprise them.

729
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:55,792
All of us
or none.

730
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:59,125
F.D.R.'s scientific
advisor is here
on the Hill.

731
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:02,709
This is our
last chance to send
the president a message.

732
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:06,291
They can build this bomb
without-- without statesmen,
without generals,

733
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,917
but they can't build it
without us.

734
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,417
So I'm--

735
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm gonna walk out
the door right now.

736
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,834
I'm probably gonna
wind up in the brig.

737
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:20,083
But I'm asking you
to follow me.

738
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,166
If you believe we have
a moral responsibility

739
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:25,917
for the future
of what we are building
here, follow me.

740
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:28,792
If you believe
Japan deserves whatever
it gets, follow me.

741
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,333
Follow me no matter
what you believe so long
as you believe

742
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,500
the scientists
who designed this gadget

743
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,417
should have some say
in how it is used!

744
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:46,250
All of us or none.

745
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:50,959
But any ignorance
from here on out
is willful.

746
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,125
And won't be forgiven.

747
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:58,001
Not by any God
worth inventing.

748
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:01,041
Not by any democracy
worth fighting for.

749
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,959
( murmuring )

750
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:22,166
( whispers )
Sir, the president
is dead.

751
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:16,083
Man on radio:
<i> We interrupt this program</i>
<i> with a "World News" update.</i>

752
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,542
<i> President Roosevelt</i>
<i> has died.</i>

753
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:22,542
<i> Reports have emerged</i>
<i> suggesting he suffered</i>
<i> a cerebral hemorrhage.</i>

754
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:24,417
<i> The president</i>
<i> was sitting for a portrait</i>

755
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:27,667
<i> when he complained of</i>
<i> a "terrific headache."</i>

756
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:31,041
<i> Vice President</i>
<i> Harry S. Truman</i>

757
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,083
<i> received the news</i>
<i> at the Capitol,</i>

758
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:35,458
<i> whereupon the Secret Service</i>
<i> rushed him to the White House</i>

759
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,500
<i> and he was sworn in</i>
<i> by Chief Justice Harlan Stone.</i>

760
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:44,417
Man #2:<i> He has been one of</i>
<i> the greatest leaders</i>
<i> of this country.</i>

761
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:47,417
<i> He has been one</i>
<i> of the greatest leaders</i>
<i> of humanity.</i>

762
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:51,041
<i> And his name</i>
<i> will be left to us</i>
<i> as a lover of men,</i>

763
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,166
<i> as a servant</i>
<i> of their freedom,</i>

764
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,500
<i> and as a wise</i>
<i> and patient leader</i>

765
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,083
<i> in the greatest war</i>
<i> ever fought for freedom.</i>

766
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,000
Man:
<i> What we know at this hour</i>

767
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,250
<i> is that the president</i>
<i> died at his home</i>

768
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,291
<i> in Warm Springs, Georgia.</i>

769
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,083
Man #2:
<i> Mr. Roosevelt has piloted</i>
<i> the nation,</i>

770
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:12,000
<i> if not through victory,</i>
<i> to within sight of victory.</i>

771
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,375
<i> Lincoln's death</i>
<i> removed him from leadership</i>

772
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:16,625
<i> in the time</i>
<i> of Reconstruction.</i>

773
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:19,041
<i> President Roosevelt's death</i>
<i> has removed him</i>

774
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:22,375
<i> from the greatest task</i>
<i> ever faced by men</i>

775
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:25,166
<i> of making peace</i>
<i> and building a secure</i>

776
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:27,208
<i> and neighborly world.</i>

1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,171
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,481
We're about to have
our very own plutonium factory.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,721
If our colleagues don't wipe

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,406
the Confederate States
off the face of the Earth.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,005
You leave for Tennessee tomorrow morning.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,084
I just saw Charlie
this morning at the gate.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,202
With Helen Prins and a mountain of luggage.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,562
Who is Helen Prins?

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,965
<i>Hope you're not too lonely,</i>

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,651
all by yourself on that business trip.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,529
<i>I should have brought a book.</i>

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,284
You've got a busy day, Mr. Ellis.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,931
If it would be helpful,
I can walk our guests through the plants.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,604
Compartmentalization, Theodore.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,523
I don't think Washington would like that.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,762
But I could use some coffee.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,320
It's Private Dunlavey, right?

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,767
Don't pretend you know anything about me

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,128
just because you put a bullet
through my dad's mathematician.

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,890
You know, I've seen you before.
I think we're neighbors.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,247
Ah. What a small town.

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,402
- Music.
- That's right, music.

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,366
The reactor will be
fully operational within a day.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,047
We gave you a list of 22 major hazards
to resolve before we go critical.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,768
And the Army intends to give your list
the consideration it deserves.

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,087
- When?
- Just as soon as we're critical.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,569
I'm surprised they bothered to call.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,608
You look terrible, by the way.

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,409
'Cause you kept me up all night.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,485
- You know you talk in your sleep?
- That's ridiculous. What did I say?

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,245
I have no idea.
You were speaking Flemish or whatever.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,481
Dutch?

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,326
I banged on the wall.
Apparently, you can sleep through anything.

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,200
Why send us 2,000 miles if they're just
gonna ignore everything we tell them?

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,089
The US Army is a fickle mistress.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,124
Excuse me. Excuse me.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,328
Mr. and Mrs. Donaldson.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,402
The reactor's just shy of criticality.

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,403
Twelve hundred
and forty seven channels loaded.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,289
One more, and the curtain comes up.

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,930
I wouldn't take a bow just yet.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,162
You'll be the one taking a bow.

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,403
For whatever reason,
you're still Uncle Sam's favorite nephew.

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,528
Honor of initiating criticality is yours.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,891
- We're not interested.
- Suit yourself.

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,327
No, wait.

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,048
Gentlemen, after nearly a year at sea
braving perilous waters,

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,207
we pioneers, we fearless navigators
have arrived at the New World.

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,730
Mrs. Donaldson.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,126
What?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,004
Somebody's got to sail
into the history books.

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,845
It might as well be a woman for once.

53
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,571
Better hope the natives are friendly.

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:15,680
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

55
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,648
If I die of embarrassment today,

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,803
do you promise
not to bury me in this uniform?

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,801
You look fine.

58
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,565
If you're gonna force me to go,
the least you can do is be honest.

59
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,808
You look like a leprechaun.

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,326
But you're our leprechaun.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,927
It's all wrinkled.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,685
- Why didn't Paloma iron it?
- 'Cause Paloma doesn't work for you.

63
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,569
And even if she did,
she hasn't shown up for two days.

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,325
Well, so much for my hygiene badge.

65
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,841
She's never even been late before.

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,482
I'm gonna go check on her.

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
What did you say?

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,771
I already have a day pass to Santa Fe.

69
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,890
I'll pop by
and make sure that Paloma is all right.

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,322
You can't even communicate
with those people.

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,481
Not that you would have noticed,

72
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,771
but I've actually picked up quite a lot
of <i>Español</i> in the past six months.

73
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,807
You know, there are some days

74
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,646
when Paloma's just about
the only person I have to talk to.

75
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,324
- I'll drive you.
- What?

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,525
You shouldn't go by yourself.
You could blow a tire out there.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,968
- Shouldn't you be at work?
- Ah, just take an hour.

78
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,247
Glen can hold down the fort.

79
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,048
Writing in your diary?

80
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,203
Just taking notes for my report to Dr. Akley.

81
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,049
You know what your problem is, Charlie?

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,691
I'm stuck in Tennessee with the wrong wife?

83
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,001
You've got no sense of adventure.

84
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,321
You need to enjoy life's unpredictability.

85
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,609
I'll take predictable over reckless every time.

86
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,401
You and Mrs. Isaacs must have
a lot of fun in the bedroom.

87
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,365
Do you know
where they built the first nuclear pile?

88
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,805
Of course. Chicago.

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,405
Under the bleachers of the football stadium.

90
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,767
They were afraid
they'd take out half of Illinois.

91
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,649
Do you know what happened?

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,361
They changed the world
and toasted with martinis.

93
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,490
Gentlemen, we have reached the shore,
criticality!

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,525
Are you gonna stand around
licking your wounds,

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,120
or should we get a celebratory drink?

96
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,090
-It's 9:00 a.m.
Predictable.

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,251
Anyway, it's a dry town.

98
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,085
Why do you think
my suitcase was so heavy?

99
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,200
You packed a bottle of booze?

100
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,641
Four.

101
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,122
In case we have to bribe somebody.

102
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,601
That's not good.

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,008
Tell me again how it happened in Chicago.

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,323
<i>- This is a level-one alert.</i>
- Shit.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,482
<i>Proceed to your designated safety areas.</i>

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,650
You're in early.

107
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,244
Past lunchtime in London.

108
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,120
And probably raining,
but I see you're not wearing a slicker.

109
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,128
I've been first in
every day this week actually.

110
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,247
Not that it does me any good.

111
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,244
Trying to make myself indispensable,
and who does Frank send to Site X?

112
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,243
- The girl with the pearl earring.
-Did you ever stop and think

113
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,324
he didn't send you because
you've made yourself indispensable?

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,961
Did Frank say that?

115
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,364
Glen, well, is it true?

116
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,809
The opposite of a fact is a falsehood,

117
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,570
but the opposite of one profound truth
may well be another profound truth.

118
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,088
What does that mean?

119
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,004
I don't know. I haven't had my coffee yet.

120
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,566
Hello.

121
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,961
I'm sorry. I knocked. Nobody answered.

122
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,521
I'll buy it, whatever you're selling.

123
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,326
I work at the switchboard.

124
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,322
That's a criminal waste of beauty.

125
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,323
Face like that,
you belong on the prow of a ship.

126
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,481
Um...

127
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,487
Is this building 12?
I have a telephone message for Helen Prins.

128
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,324
She's not here by any chance, is she?

129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,880
No, no, afraid the canary
has flown the coop.

130
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,248
- Chesterfield?
- I don't smoke.

131
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,291
Do you know when Mrs. Prins might be in?

132
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,089
- Or is it Miss Prins?
- Doctor, actually.

133
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,242
You Americans hand out advanced degrees
like mash notes.

134
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,129
No, I wouldn't wait around
for Helen too long.

135
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,407
She's parlayed her looks
into a subsidized vacation

136
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,086
while the rest of us here toil in the dust.

137
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,685
So she's pretty, then?

138
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,923
Yeah, I suppose so,
in an irritating sort of way.

139
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,486
I hope it's not urgent.

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,362
- What?
- Your message.

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,805
Ch.

142
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,771
I could pass it on for you if you like
if you recite it very slowly.

143
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,170
This evening perhaps over a stiff drink?

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,887
Hey, what do we know
about the gamma emissions from...

145
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,531
Glen Babbit, may I introduce to you
the lovely and talented...

146
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,443
Mrs. Isaacs.

147
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,450
You shouldn't be in here.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,331
Excuse me.

149
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,571
We removed the control rods
to reinitiate the reaction.

150
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,165
But you still don't know
what triggered the shutdown?

151
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,169
We'll sort it out when we get all the data.

152
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,884
- When will that be?
- Soon enough.

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,566
Anyway, we'll be up and running
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

154
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,245
What's that?

155
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,169
Sir, the temperature is rising in the core.

156
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,322
- How fast?
- Five degrees a second.

157
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,925
Turn on the spigots.
Let's give it a cold shower.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,162
Fuel slugs liquefy at 1,132 centigrade.

159
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,163
We could melt down
in less than five minutes.

160
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,164
Fail-safe countermeasures
prevent any core melt accident.

161
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,846
We told you there were risks.
Nothing about a nuclear reactor is fail-safe.

162
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,126
This is just a minor hiccup.

163
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,089
You've got to get
all these people out of here.

164
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,084
Son, I understand you got a PhD and
a healthy sense of your own importance,

165
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,562
but this isn't a college lecture hall.
This is a factory.

166
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,884
So why don't you step off the floor
and let the experts do their job?

167
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,205
You coming?

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,080
Hello?

169
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,443
- Hello, Paloma?
- She's not here. Let's go.

170
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,846
Hello?

171
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,047
Liza, what are you doing?

172
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,730
Isn't it Odd?

173
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,369
Paloma spends every day inside our home.

174
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,969
I've never even seen hers.

175
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,561
We shouldn't be here.

176
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,843
Actually, you know
what this place reminds me of?

177
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,970
Do you remember that little cabin
you used to take me to?

178
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,451
Before Callie.

179
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,082
Near Mt. Shasta.

180
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,844
You know, this is your kind of place.

181
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,686
Wood fires, starry skies,

182
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,570
outhouse.

183
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,480
I'll be in the car.

184
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,249
Paloma...

185
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,840
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

186
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,847
There's been a death.

187
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,771
- What's your evacuation plan?
- We got a population of 50,000.

188
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,491
I'm not gonna cause pandemonium
over a technical glitch.

189
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,928
You know, we've been here a year managing
this reactor just fine without you people.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,240
It wasn't critical yet.

191
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,810
Something must have built up in the reactor.

192
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,882
What are the byproducts
of the fission reaction?

193
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,167
- That's not my domain.
- Is it yours?

194
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,844
Byproducts are someone else's job.

195
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,285
- Fine, whose?
- Whose?

196
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,921
Sinclair.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,923
- Who is Sinclair?
- His assistant.

198
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,971
- Theodore's last name is Sinclair?
- So?

199
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,046
Dr. Theodore Sinclair?

200
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,282
You've got a nuclear physicist
carrying your water?

201
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,723
Dr. Sinclair, we had no idea
you were a physicist.

202
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,961
You're in good company.

203
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,042
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- What? Where are you going?

204
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,009
Chicago, Anchorage, far away from here.

205
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,562
- We need your help.
- You geniuses came to save us, right?

206
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,449
You don't need a secretary
to tell you your business.

207
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,171
A secretary who was nominated
for the Forbes prize.

208
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,364
If I recall, I lost to you.

209
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,926
You can't leave. The core temperature
is nearly at 1,000 degrees.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,731
Why do you think I'm leaving?

211
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,121
So that's it? You're jumping ship?

212
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,205
The last time I tried to help you,
Ellis barred me from the reactor room.

213
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,442
If they're determined to sink,
they can do it without me.

214
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,123
I have no idea why you stayed here
working for that hayseed,

215
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,686
but my guess is
you're proud of that reactor.

216
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,809
You're probably the only reason
it's running.

217
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,121
- It's not.
- Well, it could if you'd help.

218
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,885
You're gonna let
a year of your life melt down?

219
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,767
Let me guess.

220
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,521
Something's recapturing neutrons
faster than we can supply them.

221
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,001
And poisoning the reaction.

222
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,287
I warned them about this.

223
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,165
You're looking for an isotope
with a large neutron capture cross section.

224
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,050
At least 2.2 times 10 to the 6th barns.

225
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,965
There's iodine-135.

226
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,486
- Six percent of fission byproduct.
- And highly unstable.

227
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,971
It could be breaking down
into something else.

228
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,405
Xenon?

229
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,442
135 would have an enormous
neutron absorption cross section.

230
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,046
I've studied the xenon isotopes.
135 doesn't exist.

231
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,243
Neither did a continuous nuclear reactor
until today.

232
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,606
Sometimes the most crucial elements
in a reaction are pretty much invisible.

233
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,760
Sometimes they're barely allowed
in the building.

234
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,561
Oh, Paloma.

235
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,451
I'm very sorry for your loss.

236
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,564
Did you know her brother
was in the Pacific?

237
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,483
Did you know she had a brother?

238
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,650
She said that
they can't even give him a proper burial

239
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,882
because the military
didn't send the body back.

240
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,485
They never do.

241
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,851
But it means something different to them.

242
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,209
Their whole religion is based in this land
where their people are buried.

243
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,648
She has a crucifix on her wall.
I think she's a Catholic.

244
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,362
Yes, so are we technically.
Frank, all I'm trying to say is

245
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,087
this whole godforsaken place
is important to them.

246
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,244
Is everything all right?

247
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,645
I'll ask him.

248
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,327
She wants to know
if you have your security pass.

249
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,605
It means nothing,
the fact that he didn't tell you.

250
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,205
I'm sure it slipped his brain.

251
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,284
I asked Charlie explicitly.
He said he was alone.

252
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,840
Well, maybe the Blackshirts
wouldn't permit him to tell you.

253
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,410
Is this everything you brought?

254
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,767
There's no way
I'm going to Rose Akley's potluck.

255
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,161
I can't face those vultures.

256
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,241
Oh.

257
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,647
Self-pity is bad for your complexion.

258
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,291
They live for gossip.
They probably knew already

259
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,121
that Charlie was off gallivanting
with Hester Prins before I did.

260
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,808
She's a physicist.
She probably doesn't even own a mirror.

261
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,486
Supposedly, she's very fetching.

262
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,005
And you.

263
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,723
You are <i>ravissante</i>.

264
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,726
If your husband prefers hamburger to filet,

265
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,082
he deserves an empty stomach.

266
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,086
We're gonna enjoy a night
to ourselves. Hmm?

267
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,766
And my husband won't even notice I'm out.

268
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,520
Really? I've never heard a couple
more satisfied with one another.

269
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,250
Am I playing to the back of your house?

270
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,726
Ah.

271
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,282
Well, at least
my <i>comédie de vaudeville</i> is convincing.

272
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,407
You're acting?

273
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,527
Hmm.

274
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,331
Only get to the top of that hill
climbing alone.

275
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,601
Oh.

276
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,722
Maybe you can help me.

277
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,401
I don't...

278
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,045
The button.

279
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,045
Ugh.

280
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,210
Nope.

281
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,209
- No.
- I told you it wouldn't fit.

282
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,808
It's fit for no one but a grandmother.
Toss it in the bin.

283
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,571
You'll borrow something of mine.

284
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,883
Rose Akley won't stand
for anything too risqué.

285
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,371
Oh, we're not going to the potluck.

286
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,364
The pussy is away,

287
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,451
let us play.

288
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,402
And leave your wedding ring.

289
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,689
Mmm-hmm.

290
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,443
You still haven't told me what you need
with a truck full of day laborers.

291
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,922
I'm afraid that's above
your security clearance, Private.

292
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,040
You have an hour on the clock.

293
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,691
Sixty minutes,
and then I'm rounding them up.

294
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,528
<i>Attention, please.
All vehicles entering the motor pool</i>

295
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,241
<i>must hold updated vehicle passes
for security purposes.</i>

296
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,483
You want me to add more fuel
to a reactor that's already hot?

297
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,961
Taking fuel out is
what caused the temperature to rise.

298
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,284
So you believe that
this'll get rid of the neutron problem?

299
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,968
Your secretary believes it,
and I believe your secretary.

300
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,929
- How long will it take?
- A hundred slugs?

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,651
My guys will be loading till morning.

302
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,768
Enjoy the honeymoon suite.

303
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,843
I think their sacred land
is just over that hill.

304
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,608
Excuse me. So the shrine is over there?

305
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,045
But you'll have to wait here.

306
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,810
We won't be long.

307
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,725
They wanted me to stay with you.

308
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,325
You don't have the authority
to witness the releasing rite.

309
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,730
Thank you for your help.

310
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,043
Every soldier deserves a proper funeral.

311
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,088
Do you know Robert Frost, Professor?

312
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,450
My wife reads it.

313
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,928
<i>"Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out</i>

314
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,203
<i>"And to whom I was like to give offense"</i>

315
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,204
They say good fences
make good neighbors.

316
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,845
Maybe I just never met the right fence.

317
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,688
They don't listen to negro music
at the Brooklyn Country Club?

318
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,804
Brookline. I don't think we belong here.

319
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,488
You're not a possession.
You don't belong one place or another. Hmm?

320
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,291
Pardon me.

321
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,530
Isn't it fun?

322
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,686
Oh.

323
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,084
Couple beers for you ladies?

324
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,164
Oh, have you got anything harder?

325
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,447
- Still's cooking a little 80 proof.
- Ooh.

326
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,967
Probably scare you some up
if you save me a dance.

327
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,963
Sorry, it's very loud in here.

328
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,646
She's Anne. I'm Diane.

329
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,691
We're WACs. Just transferred to the Hill.

330
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,244
This could be my last drink.

331
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,002
Relax. Theodore was right
about the xenon-135.

332
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,401
The temperature is coming down.

333
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,611
All these people, two neutrons away
from kingdom come,

334
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,160
-and they don't even know it.
-You're being melodramatic, you know that?

335
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,481
The workers will cool down the pile,
and we'll try again.

336
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,562
We could go AWOL. Go home.

337
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,325
We can't fly back to the Hill
until the reactor is online.

338
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,924
I wasn't talking about the Hill.

339
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,643
So, I know you're not from Missouri.

340
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,127
Your family Still in Holland?

341
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,089
My mother, she's buried there.

342
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,520
My father fled to London. Hates the food.
End of story.

343
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,726
Yours?

344
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,049
Mom's in St. Louis.

345
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,321
Dad's in Jefferson City.

346
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,890
Inmate 7297 at the state penitentiary
last time I checked.

347
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,648
Why am I telling you that?

348
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,328
My wife doesn't even know.

349
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,887
What are the odds that we charbroil
the state of Tennessee tonight?

350
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,571
We're just cogs in a machine.

351
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,844
But say you're Oppenheimer.

352
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,687
You have power to redraw
the map of civilization forever

353
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,529
or put a match to it.

354
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,040
I found out I was pregnant last year.

355
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,289
Classics professor at Princeton.
Wanted to marry me.

356
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,489
Two weeks later,
Frank asks if I wanna become

357
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,087
the only female physicist at Los Alamos.

358
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,811
Classics wouldn't come,

359
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,521
so I laid down on a metal table
in a duplex in Teaneck.

360
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,851
That must have been a complicated choice.

361
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,967
When the war is over,
you'll get tenure wherever you want.

362
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,646
Even Theodore. He'll be fine.

363
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,361
Academia chooses a black man
over a woman every time.

364
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,763
I'll fight to get an adjunct job
at Podunk Junior College.

365
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,729
But I don't give a shit.

366
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,925
Because for however long the war lasts,

367
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,928
I get to do what I love.

368
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,924
If I were Oppie,

369
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,647
I'd wait for a year from now,
become the world's most famous scientist.

370
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,008
I'd pose for <i>Life</i> magazine,

371
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,448
and then I'd run for office.

372
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,807
To President Prins.

373
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,926
It's unlucky to toast with water.

374
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,841
We'll have to go to my room.

375
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,169
Oh, getting a little close.

376
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,681
Here you go.

377
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,525
Cooked up special just for you. 90 proof.

378
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,604
Ah, that's about 80 proof too much for me.

379
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,648
Oh, thought you were an Army girl.

380
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,290
Stop.

381
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,646
So, I say...

382
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,123
I tell Frank it'll never work
with a hollow sphere, never.

383
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,967
He says to me, "Well, if the Wrong brothers
can fly a plane..."

384
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,371
The Wright brothers.

385
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,727
- What?
- The Wright brothers.

386
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,921
You said the Wrong brothers.

387
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,802
I was wrong about the Wright?

388
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,807
Never in a million years
would I have thought

389
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,841
that something with a density of 19.5 grams
a cubic centimeter would compress.

390
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,408
I mean, you can't blow in a can of beer
without spattering some beer, right?

391
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,328
Speaking of which,

392
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,085
what's a girl got to do
to get a drink around here?

393
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,966
Oops.

394
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,002
Late night selling cookies?

395
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,401
We had rehearsal
for this stupid campout tomorrow.

396
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,089
We have to serenade the soldiers.

397
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,084
Well, you have a very nice singing voice.

398
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,841
I look like Shirley Temple.

399
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,243
I'm not a child.

400
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,805
Please don't make me do this anymore.

401
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,401
I'm afraid your mother's calling the plays
on this one.

402
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,007
It's your fault we're here in the first place.

403
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,161
Hey.

404
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,563
What are we looking at?

405
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,291
- I don't know.
- Oh. Yes, you do.

406
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,680
Taurus.

407
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,002
You remember how Taurus looked
from New Jersey?

408
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,684
You could barely even see Electra.

409
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,650
Look. Look how bright that is.

410
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,041
This isn't our home, Callie.

411
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,442
This whole neighborhood,

412
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,682
it's just cheap plaster and wood.

413
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,764
In a couple years,
we will be back in Princeton.

414
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,051
And this, this'll all be Indian land.

415
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,441
Like it never happened.

416
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,681
We just gotta get through it.

417
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,722
Any way we can.

418
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,406
We should use this yard more.

419
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,244
What?

420
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,007
I got you. I got you.

421
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,561
Oh.

422
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,526
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

423
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,125
- It's all right.
- No.

424
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,201
Abby.

425
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,044
- We're just fine here. We're fine.
- Abby, come on.

426
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,849
- Don't worry about it.
- We're going home.

427
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,450
- No, I want to dance.
- Hey.

428
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,567
What did you give her?

429
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,970
I'm having...

430
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,802
Hate to interrupt you and the missus.

431
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,968
We filled every channel,
overpowered the xenon.

432
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,048
Temperature's constant now. Army says go.

433
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,686
You're still not gonna make any changes
to safety before you light her up?

434
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,161
Are you drunk?

435
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,128
Not nearly enough for this.

436
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,651
Go ahead.

437
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,804
I'm having fun.

438
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,929
Too much... Too much fun for one night.

439
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,571
I just want to dance, El.
Why won't you dance with me?

440
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,802
- Dance?
- Mmm-hmm.

441
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,691
Okay.

442
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,481
<i>Primary cooling system
team leader reports status green.</i>

443
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,922
<i>Air valves 10 to 24 report all green.</i>

444
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,684
<i>Status normal.</i>

445
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,560
<i>All primary pumps report green.
Standing by.</i>

446
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,689
I thought you weren't supposed
to be in here.

447
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,685
They told me I could come back

448
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,890
if I stick to my own business
and respect my superiors.

449
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,405
I assume you're responsible?

450
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,284
The least we could do.

451
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,289
Your friend asked why I stay here.

452
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,646
This is as close as I can get

453
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,122
to wherever you people are building
what we both know you're building.

454
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,682
I wish I could talk about it.

455
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,206
I can't get this past the censors.

456
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,248
But you can deliver it to Frank Winter.

457
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,321
I know his neutron reaction work.
He should see mine.

458
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,603
If he found a way to get a woman there,
he can find a way to get me.

459
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,330
No offense.

460
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,966
A rising tide lifts all boats.

461
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,084
<i>Attention, all plant personnel
are required to pass through the safety zone</i>

462
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,482
<i>prior to entering or leaving the facility.</i>

463
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,203
Mrs. Abby?

464
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,926
I'm gonna make a sandwich for Joey.
Are you hungry?

465
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,651
- What time is it?
- It's 12:00.

466
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,963
- Uh, I'm feeling a bit under the weather.
- Okay.

467
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,561
Oh.

468
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,448
Are you intentionally hitting every bump?

469
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,970
What's that noise?

470
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,530
What the hell?

471
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,769
- What are you doing?
- It's not me.

472
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,127
Something's wrong with the car.

473
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,525
Damn it.

474
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,329
Brand-new car.
Hasn't even needed an oil change.

475
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,209
Christ, fuel line is full of water.

476
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,125
Son of a bitch at the station
must have diluted the gas.

477
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,841
Oh, even a Cadillac won't run
if the fuel's no good.

478
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,729
Reactor fuel.

479
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,848
Nuclear cars? Wouldn't file a patent just yet.

480
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,604
We've been designing a bomb

481
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,321
based on plutonium
two geniuses cranked out with a cyclotron.

482
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,323
- So?
- So a reactor is different.

483
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,122
Iodine, xenon, who knows what else.
Chemical by-products. Water in the gas.

484
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,888
What if reactor plutonium isn't pure?

485
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,403
Frank always assumes the worst.
Implosion model could run on crude oil.

486
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,240
<i>He's got my brothers
And my sisters</i>

487
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,007
<i>In his hands he's got my brothers
And my sisters</i>

488
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,767
<i>In his hands he's got my brothers
And my sisters</i>

489
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,970
<i>In his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands</i>

490
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,966
<i>He's got the sun and the rain</i>

491
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,487
<i>In his hands
He's got the moon and the stars</i>

492
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,008
<i>In his hands
He's got the wind and the clouds</i>

493
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,522
<i>In his hands
He's got the oceans and the seas</i>

494
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,127
<i>In his hands
He's got you and he's got me</i>

495
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,961
<i>In his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands</i>

496
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,724
I saw you hanging around our house.

497
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,644
I'm on night patrol. We're supposed
to keep the neighborhood safe.

498
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,963
Is there a lot of suspicious activity
around my bedroom window?

499
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,920
Are you a peeping tom or something?

500
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,529
You flashed me.

501
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,248
Well, now it's your turn.

502
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,450
What?

503
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,807
Show me what's under your shirt,

504
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,090
or I'll scream.

505
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,290
Paloma, I...

506
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,088
Everything okay?

507
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,969
Well, she quit.

508
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,366
She said that after yesterday,

509
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,603
she wasn't comfortable
working for us anymore.

510
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,642
What did you say?

511
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,451
I told her <i>vaya con Dios</i>
and gave her 20 bucks.

512
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,608
What was I supposed to say?

513
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,290
Well, I'm sure we can get a replacement.

514
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,886
We never needed a maid in Princeton.

515
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,121
He wanted to kidnap the princess.

516
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,683
So Zeus disguised himself
as a giant white bull, Taurus,

517
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,049
and he carried her on his back
across the ocean to Crete

518
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,361
where he raped her basically,

519
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,370
and she never saw her family again.

520
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,522
How do you know so much?

521
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,965
We had a telescope in Princeton.

522
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,845
Where is that?

523
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,209
It's where I'm from,

524
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,247
where I'm going back to.

525
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,167
Not too soon, I hope.

526
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,050
- Thanks for the ride.
- Sure.

527
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,523
So, what happens now?

528
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,210
We go back to being sworn enemies?

529
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,490
Hair of the dog?

530
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,170
I got two bottles of whiskey
burning a hole in my suitcase.

531
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,243
No. Thank you.

532
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,002
- See you around.
- Yeah.

533
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,289
Well, well, well.

534
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,644
I would give you a hero's welcome,

535
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,884
but as you can see, I have my hands full
with this pile of work you left behind.

536
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,530
Is Frank here?

537
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,324
Hardly. No. No, it's just me.

538
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,643
Well, as long as we're both
stranded here in the desert,

539
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,161
how about a drop to drink?

540
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,322
Or we could skip the drink.

541
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,360
Hi.

542
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,482
How was wherever you were?

543
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,485
Not home.

544
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,681
I love you, Abby.

545
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,005
Oh, wow.

546
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,927
I have to go back to the office.

547
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,005
Now?

548
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,890
What's wrong?

549
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,889
I don't know yet.

550
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:41,080

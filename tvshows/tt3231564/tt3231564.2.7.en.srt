Previously on "Manhattan"...

2
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:03,809
You didn't congratulate me.

3
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:06,285
For what, getting the
lead in a racialist play?

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,910
You need to lay off that pitch pipe.

5
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,768
It's cutting off the oxygen to your brain.

6
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:12,471
We should be studying the
radiological effects of the test.

7
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:15,474
I swallowed 24 micrograms
of plutonium in 1943.

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,409
I still make the geiger counter sing.

9
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:19,411
Liza: I have followed
your orders to the letter.

10
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:21,613
I haven't spoken to my
husband in months, as you know.

11
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,248
You want me to grand you access

12
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:25,673
to the most secure site
in the Western hemisphere

13
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:26,706
so that you can...

14
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,198
Determine the health effects
of atomic radiation and debris.

15
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,264
Oh, Jesus, Helen.

16
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:33,232
You owe me a lot more than a whiskey sour.

17
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:34,934
Uh, that drink was actually for me.

18
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,237
Come to G group. We need you. I need you.

19
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:40,139
If you believe we have
a moral responsibility

20
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,276
for the future of what we
are building here, follow me.

21
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:46,612
Meeks: If we are the only ones who have it,

22
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:48,848
we'll probably blow up the world.

23
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,017
But if Stalin has a
bomb in his pocket, too,

24
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,952
it's a stalemate. Nobody dies.

- Over by the pueblo.
- Oh.

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,340
We get frisked at the gate,

41
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,699

come and go as they please.

Uh-huh.

44
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,969
A dead security agent
and a spy on the hill?

45
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:04,464

your girl doing to the hoover?

49
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:13,075
She probably thinks it's a God.

50

(Laughing)

51
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,815
My son saw something.

52
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:23,619
What do you mean, something?

53
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,356
Someone.

54
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:09,364
Pablo, if we put the man
you saw in front of you,

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,633
would you be able to recognize him?

56
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:21,410
Do you think we could bury the tomahawk?

57
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,980
Well, you may have bollixed
your precious career,

58
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:27,382
but at least you can say you
stood on the right side of history.

59
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:29,184
I'm really not in the mood, Paul.

60
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,011
No, I mean it. I wouldn't
have had the stones.

61
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,655
Seriously.

62
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:47,018
Darrow: Dr. Sinclair.

63
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:51,540
Would you come with me, please?

64
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:06,666
(Door closes)

65
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:10,058
Well, I suppose we all saw that coming.

69
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,703
Mrs. Isaacs isn't there, I hope.

70
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:06,006
Good.

Agatha Christie novel, isn't she?

72
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:10,177
Go on, then. Put me through.

Morning, Dr. Sinclair.

75
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,701
I thought maybe we'd seen the last of you.

76
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,503
Sorry to disappoint.

77
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,940
Colonel's got you packing
his lunchbox, has he?

78
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,942
We're all somebody's houseboy, I guess.

79
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,885
You're Dr. Hogarth's, right?

80
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,347
That why you're here so
early? Fetching his coffee?

81
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,919
We brits prefer tea, actually.

82
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:01,795
(Door closes)

83
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,065
- Clubfoots?
- Yeah, my great uncle had it.

84
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,668
The doctor says it runs in families.

85
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,503
I mean, it can't run very fast.

86
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,040
Fritzie! I don't care
if our kids have no feet

87
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,975
as long as they're ours.

88
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,977
Okay, but if you get pregnant,

89
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,745
they'll kick you out of the army.

90
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,547
You keep telling me the war
will be over by fall anyway.

91
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,282
Well, you know, I'm prone to hyperbole.

92
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,720
Don't you want children?

93
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,355
I mean, is this because
of my old night job?

94
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,357
No! No, no, no, no.

95
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:33,760
Having kids with you is the number
one thing that I want out of life.

96
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:37,030
I just wonder if maybe
we should, you know, wait.

97
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,266
See what my prospects
are like after the war.

98
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:42,065
Why do I feel like there's
something you're not telling me?

99
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:48,675
Okay, um, the doc,

100
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:51,511
he did give me some other bad news.

101
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,647
He said...

102
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:58,652
That I need to lose a few pounds.

103
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:01,888
Oh.

104
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:03,523
I don't want you to lose a single ounce.

105
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,225
Mm-hmm.

106
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,760
- Well.
- Well, except the mustache.

107
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,395
- It's a little... 
- What?

108
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,596
Scratchy.

109
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:11,898
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,239
No, I'm off to the desert.

114
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,141
But I'll be back in time
to see you on the boards.

115
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,876
That's theater lingo, right?

116
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:25,245
Well, at this rate, I might
not make it to opening night.

117
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,414
Well, hey, if you get stage
fright, just picture everyone naked.

I got to go, boys.

120
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,252
- Bye-bye.
- See you Friday.

Hey.

The doctor says I still
got three or four micrograms

swimming around in my gut.

125

How do you tell your wife that you
could have a kid with three heads?

126
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,437
Well, just be honest.

00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,588
(Opera playing)

164
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:51,792
(Door closes)

165
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,097
The man you're looking
for, he works with polonium.

166
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,101
The man I'm looking for?

167
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,970
An intelligence officer was killed.

168
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:07,207
I assumed you wouldn't have
asked me to assay this box

169
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:08,308
unless it were evidence.

170
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:09,643
(Opera continues)

171
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:11,244
You found polonium?

172
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,580
Refined from bismuth and
manufactured in Dayton, Ohio.

173
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:16,416
The only men on this
hill with any use for it

174
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:18,172
work on the initiator.

175
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:21,454
23, by my count.

176
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,796
Colonel, why come to me?

177
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,131
I read your file.

178
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,014
You're a man who doesn't cut corners.

179
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:35,735
But how do you know I'm not the traitor?

180
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:37,237
Most people on this
hill take one look at me

181
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:38,939
and assume I'm some kind of criminal.

182
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:42,242
Which would diminish your
utility as a spy, I'd imagine.

183
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,643
You so much as jaywalked,

184
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,247
I'd have a dozen well-meaning
bigots in here calling for your head.

185
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:50,250
In my experience, bigots
don't often mean well.

186
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,818
Hmm.

187
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:55,188
Your dedication will be
rewarded, Dr. Sinclair.

188
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,767
Linda: That lake where they
found the murdered body?

189
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,269
It's a reservoir.

190
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:11,037
People drink that water.

191
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,840
Of course, the fish picked him
clean like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

192
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,076
Hey. Little pitchers...

193
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:22,736
Hey, she's not scaring you, is she?

194
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,892
Me neither. You want to know why?

195
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,141
Well...

196
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,493
You see this lady? This is Athena.

197
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,061
She's a famous warrior

198
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:37,297
and she watches over
the women's army corps.

199
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:40,700
As long as I wear this, no one can hurt me.

200
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:43,045
You want to try it? Okay.

201
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,468
Now you don't have to worry.

202
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:49,874
If you see the man, you
know you're protected.

203
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:56,016
Thank you.

204
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:02,022
Okay, I'm sorry.

205
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,891
Colonel's revoked all
passage for tech area staff.

206
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:06,593
Since when?

207
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:08,862
There's no travel off the
hill till further notice.

208
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,530
(Whistles)

209
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,365
Yeah. Back up.

210
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,835
Nora: They stopped him at the gate,

211
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:30,752
but he can't hide out in his room forever.

212
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:33,822
He's got work and he's
the lead in the play.

213
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,624
You sure the boy saw him?

214
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:38,084
- They seem sure.
- (Scoffs)

215
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:40,095
But he's not as green as you think.

216
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,219
He might be able to talk his way out of it.

217
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,034
There's a cathedral in Santa Fe.

218
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,848
Basilica of St. Francis. Do you know it?

219
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,474
I've not had a lot of time for sightseeing.

220
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,842
It's the third church

221
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:56,478
to be built on the same plot of land.

222
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,146
The first one, the pueblo tore down

223
00:12:58,182 --> 00:12:59,481
when they threw out the Spanish...

224
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:02,239
And God.

225
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:05,854
The Spanish come back a few years later,

226
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,155
build a bigger church.

227
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:09,558
Then tear that one down themselves,

228
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:11,718
build an even bigger one.

229
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,296
Now God can really put his feet up.

230
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:15,864
What is the punch line?

231
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,833
Sometimes you have to
burn what you've built

232
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,523
if you want to grow.

233
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,147
We need him.

234
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,073
"Brooklyn." No ideology.

235
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:28,076
No beliefs beyond himself.
Thinks he's in a spy picture.

236
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:31,013
- He's done well.
- Then what are we doing here?

237
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:33,882
In the kremlin, there's a list of names.

238
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,318
Mine's there. Yours, too.

239
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,362
Our whole family. If we fail...

240
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:39,686
I know!

241
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,821
Of course.

242
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,727
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,827
You can't burn what you haven't yet built.

244
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:52,957
The test is in two months.

245
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,203
Let me stop it.

246
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,406
Let us.

247
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:59,370
I need him.

248
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,945
And you're wrong. He
does believe in something.

249
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,718
- What?
- Me.

250
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:10,118
My little girl.

251
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:15,591
I already have one.

252
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,160
They're not for you.

253
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:47,052
(Indistinct chatter)

254
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:49,157
Fritz: You've got to lift with your hams.

255
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:52,160
Trust me, you do not want to slip a disc.

256
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:55,263
Anyway, it was an official announcement.

257
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,766
All tech area staff now
qualify for hazard pay.

258
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,401
20 cents an hour.

259
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,603
So you didn't blow off
your career for nothing.

260
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,972
We walked out for a seat
on the target committee,

261
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,775
- not for pocket change.
- I know, but still.

262
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,777
It was bad timing, plain and simple.

263
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:11,234
Everyone's all broken up about FDR

264
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,909
and Truman is not going to listen
to a bunch of pinko scientists.

265
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,578
That man is a strike breaker.

266
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:19,212
So nobody cares if there is no Nazi bomb?

267
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:21,237
Well, we don't know that
there's no Nazi bomb.

268
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,728
We just don't know that there is one.

269
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:25,091
Which is a good thing, right?

270
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,866
I mean, look on the bright side.

271
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:28,590
The colonel didn't court-martial you.

272
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,848
Which, by the way, why didn't he?

273
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,387
I should probably skedaddle.

274
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,022
She must be here by now.

275
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:38,391
All right, well, send her my regards.

276
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:40,026
Will do.

277
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:42,228
Lift with your hams!

278
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,854
Liza: Look at this place!

279
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,856
Must be 100,000 acres.

280
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,958
Fritz: 270,000, give or take.

281
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,060
We've got 20 miles of roads,

282
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:16,062
200 miles of telephone wires,

283
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:18,264
a polo league, three barracks...

284
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,066
Great. Plenty of manpower.

285
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,068
I'm going to need some research assistants.

286
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:25,238
Oh, well, it's not quite that easy.

287
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:26,606
All resources need to be approved

288
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:28,875
by the experiment review board.

289
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,044
And who's the head of the
experiment review board?

290
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,594
Um...

291
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:40,806
Dr. Winter.

292
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:43,256
Good to have you on the payroll.

293
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,325
I really appreciate the opportunity.

294
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,662
I understand that you and my
husband had your differences.

295
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:51,168
Is he still your husband?

296
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,900
Fritz may have explained to you

297
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,335
that I'm looking to establish a baseline...

298
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,803
Two GIs,

299
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:59,739
as long as they're not assigned
to a higher priority project.

300
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,908
And they're all higher priority.

301
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:05,482
- No offense.
- None taken.

302
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:08,948
Welcome to Trinity.

303
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:13,286
They called in 23 guys
for a mandatory blood test,

304
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:15,188
everyone who had access to polonium.

305
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:17,918
They're saying that it's
an excess of caution.

306
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:19,692
It could be nothing.

307
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:22,495
It's a lineup. They found
traces of it on the box.

308
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,212
Must have been on your hands.

309
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:28,146
We have a day.

310
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:30,426
For what?

311
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:33,173
Is this...

312
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:35,708
First you tell me to run

313
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,277
and now I'm supposed to kill myself?

314
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:39,946
- Jesus.
- Calm down.

315
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,522
It's a last resort.

316
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:44,150
But an intelligence officer is dead,

317
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:46,152
and you gift wrapped American's
best kept secret for the Soviets.

318
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,021
So if they catch you,
you're going to want it.

319
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:50,523
- I have one, too.
- Oh, great.

320
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,392
They can bury us side by
side like Romeo and Juliet,

321
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:54,160
or didn't you read that one?

322
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,795
They can't bury you if
they can't identify you.

323
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,532
I'm taking care of it.

324
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:09,576
Meeks: Poison?

325
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:11,255
Absolutely not.

326
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:13,746
He's just a boy.

327
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:15,348
I'll turn myself in

328
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,350
before I let you take
care of a 10-year-old boy.

329
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:19,319
How many 10-year-olds do
you think are in Tokyo?

330
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:21,354
- Oh, God.
- Or Yokohama?

331
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:23,189
You're the only person
that can stop Harry Truman

332
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:24,991
from taking care of them.

333
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,560
You're a scientist. That's simple math.

334
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:29,195
Oh, you can't make an omelet

335
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:30,763
without poisoning an
Indian kid, is that it?

336
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,265
I'm not asking your permission.

337
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,000
That's exactly what you're doing.

338
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:36,002
Why else would you even
be here telling me this?

339
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:39,005
Just give me 12 hours. 12 hours.

340
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,373
- All right?
- Why?

341
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,242
What are you going to do?

342
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:03,396
It's an ecological survey.

343
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:05,798
We're measuring the presence
of certain substances

344
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,800
in the native plants and animals

345
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:10,621
to assess the implications of the, um...

346
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,273
Of the device.

347
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:16,643
Implications?

348
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:18,411
On a bunch of coyotes and tumbleweeds?

349
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:21,814
At the moment, we call
this a scientific control

350
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,816
- so that after the test... 
- Look, lady.

351
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,885
It's Uncle Sam's nickel.
What do you want us to do?

352
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,255
You're each responsible for
a particular set of specimens.

353
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,058
I want you to collect them,
I want you to bag them,

354
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,627
and I want you to catalog
exactly where you found them.

355
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:36,329
Frank: Like a scavenger hunt.

356
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,098
Beats digging latrines.

357
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:43,102
Yes, it's like a scavenger hunt...

358
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,016
For science.

359
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:47,173
Can you give us a moment?

360
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:51,277
What are you doing here?

361
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:53,140
Just wanted to see you.

362
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:55,315
Well, now you have.

363
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:57,987
You testing for calcium?

364
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,654
And iodine and rhodium.

365
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,189
What about strontium?

366
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:04,857
It's just a hunch,

367
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:07,327
but it could be nuclear by-product.

368
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:13,550
So you still seeing Joe Pulitzer?

369
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:16,102
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:18,871
- What are you doing here?
- I'm volunteering.

371
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,341
I understand this work better
than anyone else out there.

372
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:23,309
I believe in it. I can help you.

373
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:25,178
And do you imagine just because

374
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,612
we're in a different part of the desert

375
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,448
that colonel Darrow won't find out?

376
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,316
Who cares if he does?

377
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,384
Let him ship me off to Borneo.

378
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,288
You really don't get it, do you?

379
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:37,918
This is my work that
you're putting at risk.

380
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:41,894
I'm finally doing something that matters

381
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,038
and you are handing colonel
Darrow an excuse to shut me down.

382
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:50,207
Frank, I saw your hospital admission slip.

383
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:53,339
Criticality experiments?

384
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,708
- Radiation exposure?
- Liza...

385
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,510
If you have a death wish, that's fine.

386
00:20:57,545 --> 00:20:59,746
That's your business.

387
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,549
But keep it away from mine.

388
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:09,722
Hurt me again.

389
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:11,391
It's "hit me again."

390
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,438
Give me a drink.

391
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,730
Sweetheart, I'm a little busy.

392
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,766
Don't sweetheart me.

393
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:30,610
I did this at serious risk to my pants.

394
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:33,695
Your pants are safe.

395
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,626
I want nothing to do with
any pants except my own.

396
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,018
So thank you, but, no, thank you.

397
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,420
But thanks.

398
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,396
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,764
English is my second language.

400
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,567
What I meant was scram.

401
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:57,550
Stan Javits. And you're Helen?

402
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,973
Your reputation precedes you.

403
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,209
Really? What reputation is that?

404
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:05,211
The woman who got
herself fired from G group

405
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,213
in less than 24 hours?

406
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,815
Dr. Helen Prins,

407
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,451
the first author on that
thorium paper in '38.

408
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:14,787
That was very precise work.

409
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,255
That was nicely done.

410
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:22,495
What are you, a metallurgist?

411
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,996
A chemist?

412
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:26,632
A lawyer. Patents.

413
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,003
What? You thought you
guys would come up here

414
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,659
and invent all this great
stuff and not attract lawyers?

415
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,943
You can't have a picnic without ants.

416
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:41,848
You read my thorium paper?

417
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,318
You guys unlock the secrets of the universe

418
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:49,455
and the government hires me
to lock them back up again.

419
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:51,286
Right.

420
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:54,121
Anyway...

421
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,498
Consider me a fan.

422
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:15,023
Excuse me, is he in?

423
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:16,448
Thank you.

424
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:22,555
Mrs. Isaacs, come in.

425
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:28,861
Colonel, I'm sorry to bother you,

426
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:31,664
but I didn't know who else to ask.

427
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:33,571
I need an address.

428
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:35,334
For whom?

429
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,670
For a woman who died last year.

430
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:39,805
I'm trying to contact her next of kin.

431
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:42,875
This woman, she was a friend of yours?

432
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:44,677
Not of mine.

433
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:48,314
Of Dr. Oppenheimer, actually.

434
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:50,349
Her name is Jean Tatlock.

435
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:55,688
I was wondering if maybe you had a file

436
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:57,323
or some kind of record.

437
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:59,392
And why would you want that?

438
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:00,726
Because...

439
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:09,602
Because I'm responsible for her death, sir.

440
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:13,024
I, um...

441
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:16,709
I spoke with Miss Tatlock on the telephone

442
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:20,346
shortly before she took her life,

443
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:24,684
and I said some cruel things.

444
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:28,287
And I believe, given her mental state,

445
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:31,925
that I left her no choice.

446
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,729
Have you discussed this with your husband?

447
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,604
No, sir.

448
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:42,935
But what I did, it was pesha,

449
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:46,284
a deliberate sin against another person,

450
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:50,009
and it's the most unforgivable kind.

451
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,243
And... it...

452
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:59,418
That's why God took my child.

453
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,157
And that's why you want to
contact Miss Tatlock's family?

454
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:06,492
To repent?

455
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,266
I have money.

456
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:14,400
(Voice breaks) I have more
money than I'll ever need,

457
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:16,702
and I would like them to have it.

458
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:21,397
Buying penance.

459
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:24,647
The catholics tried that
for a while. Didn't work out.

460
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,688
Well...

461
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:29,649
Do you know where this war began?

462
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,619
Poland?

463
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:36,188
It began on another hill, in another desert

464
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,090
3,000 years ago.

465
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,627
All our sacrifices, yours, mine,

466
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:45,197
Dr. Oppenheimer's, they
happen for a reason.

467
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:48,567
We were put here to
finish what Moses started.

468
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:52,772
I'm not sure I take your meaning.

469
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:57,728
God doesn't accept the
US dollar, Mrs. Isaacs,

470
00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:00,846
but there are other paths to redemption.

471
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:09,488
(Dog barks)

472
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:14,393
Is this the Harper residence?

473
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:16,529
Mr. and Mrs. are out.

474
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:18,464
It's about your son.

475
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:19,832
I've been assigned to his case.

476
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,603
His case?

477
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:31,043
Pablo is a witness to a very serious crime.

478
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,480
If he can, in fact, identify a suspect,

479
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:37,249
it won't be safe for him to return home...

480
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,517
Ever.

481
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:42,054
The colonel didn't tell us this.

482
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,491
Well, the army has never
been a friend to your people,

483
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:47,693
has it, Mrs. Ortiz?

484
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:50,262
But that's where I come in.

485
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:52,264
In appreciation for Pablo's help...

486
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,567
Again assuming that he does help...

487
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:57,103
The bureau of Indian affairs
has secured a place for him

488
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:59,138
at one of our boarding academies.

489
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,633
Do you know where
Pennsylvania is, Mrs. Ortiz?

490
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,710
Near New York.

491
00:27:04,746 --> 00:27:07,513
So you know that it's very far away

492
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:11,283
and you may not see your son
again for a very long time.

493
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:13,889
But I can assure you

494
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,590
he will have a better life.

495
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,893
A new American name, new clothes.

496
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:25,685
By the time he graduates,
you won't even recognize him.

497
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:30,936
That is, if he identifies a suspect.

498
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:38,444
But if my son can't remember
the man that he saw...

499
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:41,313
Well, in that case,

500
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:42,915
I'm afraid that we'd have no reason

501
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,551
to send him to the academy.

502
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:48,789
He'd stay here with you.

503
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,558
I've never seen a BIA
man on the hill before.

504
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:58,564
Yes. It's new protocol
under president Truman.

505
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,400
I think I'd like to see your credentials.

506
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:03,235
Excuse me?

507
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:06,739
Or we could go discuss this with the army.

508
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:10,142
Okay. Easy.

509
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:12,178
Easy.

510
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:23,589
I'm trying to help you.

511
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:25,758
If you say another word
to anyone, you're dead.

512
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:27,626
Your kid, too.

513
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:57,829
You don't like hamburgers?

514
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
You know, Hitler's a vegetarian.

515
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:04,403
Fine.

516
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,001
Do you like grilled cheese?

517
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,326
Okay, I'll get you some.

518
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:18,617
Linda taking good care of you?

519
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,080
It's too sweet for me.

520
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,426
I don't have the teeth for it,

521
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,593
but go ahead and have it.

522
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:30,279
Man: Giddy-up, Palomino.

523
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,107
Probably no sodie pop in the teepees.

524
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,550
(Knocking on door)

525
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:55,958
Jim Meeks?

526
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,794
Supposed to take you to the medical clinic.

527
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:04,129
Now we need an MP escort
to a doctor's appointment?

528
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:21,847
(Babies crying)

529
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:38,497
(Door opens)

530
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:53,560
Woman: Thank you very much, Mr. Shaw.

531
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:56,815
Antrim?

532
00:30:58,685 --> 00:31:00,652
Right this way.

533
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:11,596
Man: So what's the plot?

534
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:14,466
- Huh?
- The Gilbert and Sullivan?

535
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,802
Don't tell me you're getting
opening night jitters.

536
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:18,336
No, mm-mm.

537
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:23,075
Turn to your left, please.

538
00:31:25,546 --> 00:31:27,546
Now your right.

539
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:30,549
Darrow: Face forward.

540
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:35,554
Pablo?

541
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:38,557
Thank you, Dr. Antrim.

542
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:52,604
Woman: Cafferty?

543
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:57,409
Do you know how many GIs have died

544
00:31:57,444 --> 00:31:59,578
while we've been camped
out in that waiting room?

545
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:03,515
Oh. Colonel Darrow.

546
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,384
Hi, I'm Jim Meeks. It's nice to...

547
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:11,356
Jeez. I'm sorry.

548
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,454
I'm all thumbs.

549
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:29,908
Darrow: Pablo?

550
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:34,045
Thank you, Mr. Meeks.

551
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,267
So you couldn't find sagebrush...

552
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:41,786
In the desert?

553
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:43,299
Nope.

554
00:32:43,324 --> 00:32:45,878
And I have a conscientious
objection to killing rabbits.

555
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,438
I mean, what's the...

556
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:50,629
So who did this?

557
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,751
(Sighs)

558
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,706
Abby?

559
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,824
Is the power out?

560
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,259
The rest of the block's lit.

561
00:33:21,295 --> 00:33:22,627
It's shabbat.

562
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:26,631
I forgot to turn the
lights on before sundown.

563
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,146
Sorry.

564
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:31,263
So now we're spending our
weekends in the stone age?

565
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,508
We're going to be late for the play.

566
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:39,781
What if we didn't go back to Brookline

567
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,937
when the war's over?

568
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:45,269
You want to stay on the
hill? It'll be a ghost town.

569
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:48,051
What if we went abroad?

570
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:51,152
To Palestine?

571
00:33:53,894 --> 00:33:56,094
- What? Abby... 
- Colonel Darrow says

572
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:58,129
that we'll never be truly safe

573
00:33:58,165 --> 00:34:00,886
until all the world's Jews
are gathered in Jerusalem.

574
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:03,612
Since when do you talk to colonel Darrow?

575
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:06,805
- I went to see him.
- About the promised land?

576
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:09,802
About Jean Tatlock.

577
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:14,346
The day she died, I
called her on the telephone

578
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:17,505
and I said some terrible things.

579
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:20,725
Unforgivable things.

580
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:26,400
I thought that if she broke things
off with Oppenheimer, then...

581
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,859
- But then she... 
- Abby.

582
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:32,664
Whatever you said to her, it's...

583
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,233
It's the reason we lost the baby.

584
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,771
No.

585
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:41,406
No, that was no one's fault.

586
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:46,911
You spend your entire life

587
00:34:46,947 --> 00:34:48,880
pondering the mysteries of the universe.

588
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:50,740
And then our child dies...

589
00:34:52,552 --> 00:34:54,319
And you don't even ask why?

590
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:57,355
Why some guy in the clouds punishes you

591
00:34:57,391 --> 00:35:00,091
- for something you didn't do.
- For something I did do.

592
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,559
I killed a woman.

593
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:04,396
No, Abby. No, you didn't.

594
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:09,567
Listen to me. Hey.

595
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:19,077
I wish I knew how to explain this.

596
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:24,661
She was a sick woman.

597
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:29,220
She drowned herself. End of story.

598
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:35,560
Stay away from colonel Darrow.

599
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:37,329
He's not your friend.

600
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,233
I told him you wouldn't understand.

601
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:52,352
Is that the man you remember?

602
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:56,014
You did very well today, Pablo. Gracias.

603
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:00,018
Take him back to his mother.

604
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,074
Our hero.

605
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:05,551
You ready to go?

606
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:10,628
(Vocalizing)

607
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:25,410
Uh, have you seen my pitch pipe?

608
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:26,810
No, sorry.

609
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:33,251
Jeannie: He was a trooper.

610
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:36,254
You got a good kid, Mrs. Ortiz.

611
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,290
If the colonel needs him again,
we'll send a jeep to the pueblo.

612
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,093
Is something wrong?

613
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,748
We're not coming back to this place.

614
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:47,031
Mrs. Ortiz, I'm so sorry. I don't...

615
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:48,666
He didn't see anything.

616
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:51,469
We don't want any trouble
from the army, from anyone.

617
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:52,837
They're gonna hurt him.

618
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:54,709
Who?

619
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,275
Did someone threaten you?

620
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,552
(Playing pitch pipe)

621
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:08,520
Hey.

622
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,056
Where did you get this?

623
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,531
Mrs. Ortiz.

624
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:27,739
(Chattering)

625
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:32,076
Oh, it's just we haven't
seen each other in two days.

626
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:34,145
That's like a month in newlywed time.

627
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:37,382
Oh, look. If it isn't my new neighbor.

628
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,818
- Helen: Huh?
- Crosley: Did you not hear?

629
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:42,353
The army moved Dr. Sinclair
out of his tar paper shack

630
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,222
into the room next to mine.

631
00:37:44,257 --> 00:37:47,806
Seems he's connected to some
very well-placed friends now.

632
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:49,727
Well, you got to take your friends

633
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:51,696
where you can get them around here.

634
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,167
Hi.

635
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:58,192
Oh! There she is.

636
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:01,028
Me!

637
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:03,374
Jeannie!

638
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:06,911
- Hi!
- Hi.

639
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:09,581
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

640
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:12,917
(Piano playing)

641
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:14,953

I can't wait for act two.

671
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:04,192
You all right?

672
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,929
I'm just feeling a little off.

673
00:40:07,964 --> 00:40:09,764
Well, I'll walk you home.

674
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:11,599
No, no, no. Stay. Stay.

675
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:13,334
No, Meeks won't mind.

676
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,169
It's just a little headache.

677
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,628
Okay.

678
00:40:16,653 --> 00:40:18,212
I'll see you later.

679
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:21,044
All right.

680
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:23,235
Bye.

681
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:26,481
(Vocalizing)

00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:29,973
(Knocks)

683
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:31,408
Jeannie!

684
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:32,976
I need to ask you something.

685
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:34,778
Uh, sure.

686
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:37,014
Maybe after the show?

687
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:40,284
God. Thank you.

688
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,219
Where did you find this?

689
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:44,026
Outside a house in row F.

690
00:40:44,852 --> 00:40:46,118
Huh.

691
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,937
I found it when I dropped that Indian boy

692
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,461
off with his mother.

693
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,796
Indian boy?

694
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:54,828
- Oh, you mean... 
- She was scared.

695
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:56,934
Somebody scared her.

696
00:40:56,969 --> 00:41:00,003
(Mutters)

697
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:05,609
I guess somebody must have, uh, stolen it.

698
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,080
What were you doing there, Jim?

699
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:12,330
What was I...

700
00:41:12,852 --> 00:41:15,586
- You have lost me, Jeannie.
- Man: Five minutes.

701
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:19,256
- Five minutes to curtain.
- That's act two.

702
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,858
Look, I got to...

703
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:23,026
Listen, maybe after the show...

704
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:25,295
Hey. Jeannie.

705
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:27,030
Jeannie.

706
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:28,599
Jeannie, wait, wait, wait.

707
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:30,267
Jeannie! Wait, wait!

708
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:31,779
Don't.

709
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:35,029
Are you a spy, Jim?

710
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,441
Are you the one the
colonel's been looking for?

711
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:40,277
Jesus.

712
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:41,845
You killed that man,

713
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:43,347
the one that they say...

714
00:41:43,382 --> 00:41:44,681
No, no. No, no, no.

715
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:46,784
I didn't... I didn't kill anybody.

716
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:48,952
But you are a spy.

717
00:41:49,835 --> 00:41:51,889
Uh...

718
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:54,293
Fritz!

719
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:58,529
Fritz got me into it.

720
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,182
What?

721
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,867
Before he met you,

722
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,503
Fritz was a different person,

723
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:11,308
and he... well, we were just
trying to do the right thing.

724
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:13,177
No, he would have told me.

725
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:14,812
He couldn't.

726
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:16,113
You'd be an accessory.

727
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:19,516
I mean, don't you get

728
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:21,151
how much he loves you?

729
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:25,088
It kills him to lie to you.

730
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:26,890
That... I don't believe you.

731
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:29,092
Well, then why did you come to me first?

732
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:31,361
Why not just tell Fritz?

733
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:38,035
Is this why he doesn't want to have kids?

734
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:42,226
Can you blame him?

735
00:42:42,575 --> 00:42:44,256
The spot that he's in?

736
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,488
It's okay. It's okay.

737
00:42:52,384 --> 00:42:53,917
When the war's over,

738
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:56,119
this all goes away.

739
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:58,922
You two can go off, have a family,

740
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:04,194
but for now, you can't
tell Fritz what you know.

741
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,396
You have to trust me.

742
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:09,377
Okay?

743
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:15,205
Fritz was never a different person.

744
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:18,575
You're the different person, Jim.

745
00:43:18,611 --> 00:43:20,983
- Jeannie.
- And you're a liar.

746
00:43:21,324 --> 00:43:22,923
Your best friend...

747
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:25,270
You would say those things
about your best friend,

748
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:26,750
to his wife?

749
00:43:26,785 --> 00:43:28,252
I think that you're confused.

750
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:30,053
No. Stay... stay away from me.

751
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:32,068
Jeannie. Jeannie.

752
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:33,216
(Sobbing)

753
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:35,108
- Jeannie, wait!
- Jim.

754
00:43:37,196 --> 00:43:39,782
- (Cheers and applause )
- They're starting.

755
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,589
I'll handle this.

756
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,267
What are you going to do?

757
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:46,436
(People chattering)

758

1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,647
Previously on "Manhattan"...

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,384
Information is the future,
and Britain needs a future.

3
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:07,586
You want me to steal for you?

4
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:09,130
For king and country.

5
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:12,357
Lucy got him back, my grandson.

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,211
So help me, Paul, you'll
go home to your little boy.

7
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:25,338
Paul Crosley, he and Constance
Faraday are involved in something.

8
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:31,628
Mom's in St. Louis, Dad's in Jefferson City

9
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:34,130
at the state penitentiary.

10
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:36,682
Why am I tell you that?
My wife doesn't even know.

11
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:38,717
Enlistment papers?

12
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:40,469
You'll stay right here

13
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,472
as a private in the Army under my command.

14
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:45,023
Why keep me on the Hill?

15
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,742
They can build this bomb
without... without statesmen,

16
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:50,829
without generals, but they
can't build it without us.

17
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,915
Any ignorance from here on out

18
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:57,369
is willful and won't be forgiven.

19
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:02,040
- See you Friday.
- Bye.

20
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:05,877
The doctor says I still got three or
four micrograms swimming around in my gut.

21
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,097
How do you tell your wife that you
could have a kid with three heads?

22
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:12,717
You guys love each other.
You'll figure it out.

23
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:14,886
Are you a spy, Jim?

24
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:16,588
Are you the one the
colonel's been looking for?

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,306
Stay... stay away from me.

26
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:20,091
Jeannie... Jeannie.

27
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,445
They're starting.

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,165
I'll handle this.

29
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,019

Well, maybe you can.

52
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,351
"P.O. Box 1663."

53
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,519
Just shooting at stars here...

54
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,789
Maybe it's a post office box?

55
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,941
But let's keep that between friends.

56
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,551
Listen,

57
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,852
I know they got a whole army in there.

58
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,271
A whole army in a post office box?

59
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,640
A bunch of scientists working on something.

60
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,809
I know it and you know it.

61
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:48,646
Maybe you should fold
yourself into a letter,

62
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,448
see where the trail leads you.

63
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,817
- I'll lick the stamp.
- Ah, okay.

64
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,452
So you are the cavalry.

65
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:55,787
I am in the right place.

66
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,455
Listen, pal, I'm...

67
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,324
I'm just a guy looking
for someone I care about.

68
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:02,827
Okay, now it's my turn at bat.

69
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,463
You. Who are you?

70
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,499
Isaacs.

71
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,384
Ring a bell?

72
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,220
Triple-checked the circuits?

73
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,055
Twice.

74
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:16,674
Subcircuits?

75
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:19,844
Zero minus one minute.

76
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,515
Hey, they make a final sweep?

77
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,316
All areas clear, sir.

78
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:27,235
Everyone's outside the final perimeter.

79
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,156
Just a little more.

80
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:32,824
About 15 degrees over to the right.

81
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,859
Pull those wires back a bit.

82
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:37,362
Zero minus 45 seconds.

83
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,870
It's happening, Louis.

84
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,074
Uh, if it's all the same,

85
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,777
I... I think I'm just gonna skip the show.

86
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,430
Zero minus 30 seconds.

87
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:07,559
Zero minus 20 seconds.

88
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:11,613
All personnel prepare for detonation.

89
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,699
Do we really need Army brass at a pretest?

90
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,284
Well, eight weeks from now,

91
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,902
you'll have half the President's Cabinet

92
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,737
and the Joint Chiefs
breathing down your neck.

93
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:20,905
Might as well get used to it.

94
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:22,957
nine,

95
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,793
eight,

96
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,377
seven,

97
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,379
six,

98
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:29,914
- five...
- You gotta keep it rolling.

99
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,082
Four,

100
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,467
three,

101
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:34,219
two,

102
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,137
one.

103
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:38,006
Fire!

104
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:41,926
Oh, what the... ?

105
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,153
What just happened?

106
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,675
Did you see that?

107
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,453
Jesus.

108
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:01,339
Uh, no.

109
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:04,726
No, Private? Count the stripes.

110
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,228
Yeah, your stripes can march
me into a machine-gun nest

111
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:08,730
or off a cliff.

112
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,148
But they can't make me fix

113
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,016
Charlie Isaacs' broken bomb.

114
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,852
You think I'm bluffing?

115
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:17,238
It's this moment right here,

116
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:20,191
this is why you kept me on the Hill.

117
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,527
I'm your what, your
manufacturer's warranty?

118
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,195
I can send you off the Hill right now.

119
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:26,030
Next boat across the Pacific.

120
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:28,032
You got a confused boy

121
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,500
staring into the guts of a monster

122
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,920
he will never fully understand.

123
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:33,871
Maybe...

124
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:36,591
Maybe God will hand him some
kind of miracle, a eureka.

125
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,176
Put your faith in that,

126
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,761
put me on any boat you like.

127
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,963
Whatever floats yours.

128
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,882
So what do you want?

129
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:49,554
My old wardrobe.

130
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:52,056
An honorable discharge,

131
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:53,524
which means you can't threaten
to ship me off to Japan

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,610
every time you get the yen.

133
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,279
And get to see my wife whenever I like.

134
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:00,148
You think she wants to see you?

135
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:04,702
That's my concern, not yours.

136
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,371
Fine.

137
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:09,240
If you can clean up Isaacs' mess,

138
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:12,377
- I'll sign the papers.
- Oh, and one more thing.

139
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:15,129
I want a seat on the Target Committee.

140
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,748
Scientists, we built this bomb.

141
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,082
We want some say in how

142
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,250
and where it is used.

143
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:21,252
That I can't give you.

144
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,254
Today's detonation was
supposed to be the dry run.

145
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,922
My guess is every day

146
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:27,058
Isaacs can't figure out what went wrong,

147
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:30,395
you lose a week or more
on your test schedule.

148
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,313
Probably already blew July Fourth.

149
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,316
Pretty soon you'll be looking into August.

150
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:37,318
Or I could catch that cruise you offered,

151
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:39,937
maybe there will be no test at all.

152
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:43,274
Dr. Winter?

153
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,996
I can get the scientists a
seat on the Target Committee.

154
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:50,448
But it won't be you.

155
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,587
Thanks, Jim.

156
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,956
You shouldn't have.

157
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:06,514
So it, um...

158
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:09,967
just went up in smoke, huh?

159
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:11,636
Yeah.

160
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:14,639
Yeah, it was like a marshmallow on a stick.

161
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,307
Charlie's sending a bunch
of us back to the Hill

162
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,809
to recheck our work.

163
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,529
Right. Um...

164
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,488
I've been...

165
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,490
trying to write this letter

166
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:33,875
to her sister.

167
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:36,994
Only...

168
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,213
what do you say to someone you never met?

169
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,070
"Sorry you couldn't come to her wedding"?

170
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:52,060
"Sorry she wandered off into
a construction site and"...

171
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:54,345
Fritz.

172
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,936
I'm sure everybody just
thinks it's my fault.

173
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,224
It was an accident.

174
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,660
I should have walked her home, Jim.

175
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:10,895
She said she was feeling off

176
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,530
and I just let her go and...

177
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,033
You know, no one in her family

178
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,902
even knew what state she was in.

179
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:19,504
The Army is probably just gonna tell them

180
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,706
that she died a hero.

181
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,741
She did.

182
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,382
Jeannie was the best.

183
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:40,975
You know, people always
say that kind of bull.

184
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,899
But she really was, wasn't she?

185
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:09,804
Heard you're having some trouble.

186
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,390
You don't wanna be here.

187
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,225
And I told the colonel
I didn't need your help.

188
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,726
I think he must be hard of hearing

189
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,094
'cause I'm following a direct order

190
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,230
from my commanding officer.

191
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,482
So you still have no idea

192
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:22,984
which part was faulty,

193
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,769
which division can fix it.

194
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,438
Never mind how long the redesign will take.

195
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,657
Hell, you probably lost
another day on the schedule

196
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:30,942
since we started talking.

197
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:34,612
So maybe you should quit talking.

198
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:36,447
Yes, sir.

199
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,848
German radio has just announced

200
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,684
that Adolf Hitler is dead.

201
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:59,971
- What's going on?
- Hitler just blew his goddamn brains out.

202
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,056
It's all over!

203
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:19,898
Sir.

204
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:42,705
- He there?
- Hold, please.

205
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:45,340
Charlie, hello.

206
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:46,875
You're in Santa Fe County?

207
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,595
Well, you gotta see the
place I slept last night.

208
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,848
Made me nostalgic for the lockup.

209
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:54,683
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

210
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:57,052
Hey, come on. Is that any
way to greet your father

211
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:59,021
after all these years?

212
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:01,056
You shouldn't have come here.
It's reckless and stupid.

213
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:03,058
Probably a parole violation, too.

214
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,610
I'm a changed man, Charlie.

215
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:07,029
You were a sad old man before,

216
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,448
you'll be a sad old man
till the day you die.

217
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,784
Okay, look, don't say that, please.

218
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,069
That's not the way, okay?

219
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:16,739
What's he called, Charlie, hmm?

220
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,874
My grandson,

221
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,959
what's his name?

222
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:26,165
Go to hell.

223
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:29,134
Charlie?

224
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,900
- Abby.
- Hmm?

225
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:47,269
I was on a call.

226
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:50,489
Is there somewhere we can talk?

227
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:52,658
We are interrupting this program

228
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:54,109
to bring you a news flash.

229
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:55,994
German radio...

230
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,614
Well, they've already
invented a novelty cocktail.

231
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,500
"Hitler's Brain"...
Schnapps and red grenadine.

232
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:03,502
What's all this?

233
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:06,705
Shut the door.

234
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,094
We're leaving.

235
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,130
Thankfully for us, Europe's
down to a dull simmer

236
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,632
and sea-lanes should be opening up.

237
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:19,134
We're leaving when?

238
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:21,804
Tomorrow. Arranged it with the colonel.

239
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:24,022
Our war is over.

240
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:27,693
- We have no quarrel with the Japs.
- What about our side project?

241
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:30,946
Our contacts in Site X
and Site Z have gone quiet.

242
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,481
Could be nothing,

243
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:34,366
or it could be a rope
tightening round our necks.

244
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:36,318
We shan't wait around to find out.

245
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,821
What, so we poached a king's
ransom worth in nuclear secrets

246
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:40,956
to leave it all behind in the dust?

247
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,660
Nothing's being left behind in the dust.

248
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:46,128
We're carrying the papers with us.

249
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:48,497
In our luggage? Are you mad?

250
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,382
We're the Allies, don't forget.

251
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,001
They're not likely to go
fingering our knickers.

252
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,641
Yeah, well, it's, um...

253
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:02,144
Well, this is very sudden news.

254
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,012
Pack your things, Paul.

255
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:06,181
And don't get sentimental.

256
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,067
This place was always a safari,

257
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:10,903
not a home.

258
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:27,035
So your old man called, huh?

259
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,040
Not much older than you.

260
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:35,043
Yeah, I don't have much
use for mine either.

261
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:38,931
They all think the war's over.

262
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,716
Can you blame them?

263
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:43,268
We've been selling them the
German version since day one.

264
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,221
Guy puts a bullet in his head,

265
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:48,357
everyone acts like it's Christmas morning.

266
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:49,892
More like Hanukkah.

267
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,696
- I don't need your help, Frank.
- I never said you did.

268
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:56,565
I'm gonna fix it.

269
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,567
Well, half my experimental problems

270
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,619
boiled down to the detonators.

271
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:02,571
You did use 32 of them, right?

272
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:04,706
Yeah, the detonators were the
first thing I checked, Frank.

273
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:06,959
Yellow, red. I'm not color-blind.

274
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:19,004
Hey.

275
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:46,865
All right...

276
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:52,120
say you're me.

277
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:54,623
Fun game. Got a beautiful young wife.

278
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,291
Got my whole life ahead of me.

279
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:59,628
You've built the most complex
machine in human history

280
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,431
and it might have an Achilles'
heel. How do you find it?

281
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:03,966
Gee, I don't know.

282
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:06,802
Maybe ask the guy who
came up with the design.

283
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,309
I've been through
everything. It all checks out.

284
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,944
Apparently not.

285
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,696
What if it can't be fixed?

286
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,117
All right, get up.

287
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:25,620
Come on. All this shit's
just muddling your brain.

288
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:27,372
You're not gonna find your answers

289
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:28,857
sifting through the trash.

290
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:30,993
Where are you going?

291
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:33,078
I'm going back to square one.

292
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:40,218
Someone starts bellowing
about a secret project

293
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,971
10 miles from here, I take it seriously.

294
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,390
I understand, but all I'm
asking for is a day pass

295
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,175
and an hour with my father-in-law.

296
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:49,478
My men have informed Mr. Isaacs

297
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:51,263
that he has 24 hours to leave the county.

298
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,685
Country, faith, family.

299
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:59,771
Aren't those the things that
matter the most, Colonel?

300
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,741
It's my understanding that Charlie

301
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:04,359
wants nothing to do with this man.

302
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,330
- Yes, that's true.
- You do know what the Bible says

303
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,615
about honoring thy husband?

304
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,670
It also says that people are basically good

305
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:18,006
and that we all have
something to atone for.

306
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:20,375
Yes, well, you can give
him a chance to atone

307
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:22,144
after the war.

308
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,781
I have family in Eastern Europe.

309
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:29,184
Cousins that I never met
and some that I never will,

310
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:31,586
and my son has never met his grandfather,

311
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:33,522
who is sitting at a pay telephone

312
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,190
10 miles from this office.

313
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:39,094
The Jewish people don't
just need Palestine, Colonel.

314
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,296
We need each other.

315
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:00,165
What about this?

316
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:06,088
What if solenoid 132B
was out of alignment...

317
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,890
Um, an electrical arc

318
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:11,259
occurs at, uh, section P22.

319
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:13,762
Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.

320
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,197
But they did.

321
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,853
Condensers?

322
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,656
Totally normal.

323
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,585
Cork lining.

324
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,454
Maybe absorbed some of
the moisture in the air,

325
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:41,456
came into contact with an exposed wire.

326
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:43,792
Not a lot of moisture in the desert.

327
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:45,927
Hope one of those doughboys out there

328
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:47,963
knows how to brew a pot of coffee.

329
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:04,312
What are you doing? You shouldn't...

330
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:05,697
You shouldn't be here.

331
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:11,870
They were gonna have kids.

332
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,658
They were talking about it.

333
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,661
The girl is gone.

334
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:20,996
She has a name.

335
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,167
It didn't happen.

336
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,503
And you'll believe that eventually.

337
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:33,341
You need to believe that.

338
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:35,143
Why?

339
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,680
- Because the ends justify the means?
- Yes.

340
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:41,349
So long as the ends are not dead ends,

341
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:43,852
you're gonna save thousands of people.

342
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:47,189
Maybe even hundreds of thousands.

343
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:52,694
You are the linchpin.

344
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:08,710
What about a rogue lightning strike?

345
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:10,545
A what?

346
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,931
A bolt from the blue...

347
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:14,849
Happens all the time.

348
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:17,435
A storm can be 50 miles away.

349
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:19,888
Current travels laterally

350
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,557
from the leading edge of the
thundercloud through clear air...

351
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:24,226
I think we need a break.

352
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:32,234
My father used to say lightning
always strikes eventually

353
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:34,202
if you sit at a card table long enough.

354
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:37,572
Only losers get up before
the weather changes.

355
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:40,475
You're 29 years old.

356
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,245
Shepherding the most
important scientific project

357
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
since Louis Pasteur.

358
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,582
What... what has your father done?

359
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:48,883
I know a thing or two about

360
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,752
trying to improve your origins,

361
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,921
believe me, Charlie.

362
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,559
Okay, say I'm you.

363
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:02,397
Say I'm you and the war is done

364
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:03,932
and the bomb didn't work.

365
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,767
What's the worst that happens?

366
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:07,602
A bomb didn't work, a
lot of innocent people

367
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:09,154
didn't lose their lives.

368
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:12,107
No. We have no idea how it's gonna be used.

369
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:13,775
Say I'm you.

370
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:17,279
I got a beautiful wife and a son.

371
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:21,783
And I've got my whole life ahead of me.

372
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:24,919
What is it I want on my conscience?

373
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:27,789
What are they gonna say at my funeral?

374
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:42,971
You're not me, Frank.

375
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,645
What are you doing? Give that to me!

376
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,614
- Give... give that...
- "Perseus...

377
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:38,483
Perseus is immature,
distrustful of authority,

378
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:40,452
politically unformed"...

379
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,487
It's not what it looks like.

380
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,205
A crib sheet?

381
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:46,207
So you can keep me
wrapped around your finger?

382
00:23:46,243 --> 00:23:48,159
No.

383
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:51,046
"He... he believes that he is
more intelligent than he is,

384
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,164
which makes him susceptible to flattery."

385
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:55,634
- Jim...
- This is what you really think of me?

386
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,669
- No, it's not.
- You think that...

387
00:23:57,721 --> 00:24:00,839
you think I'm condescending?

388
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,340
Those notes are not about you.

389
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:04,142
Oh, well, I guess that there's

390
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,510
another Soviet spy on the Hill.

391
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,517
No.

392
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,186
That's not possible.

393
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,855
No.

394
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:18,823
I came to you.

395
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,242
I gave you everything.

396
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:22,744
You said I was the linchpin.

397
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,196
Who is it?

398
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:28,366
I would tell you if I could.

399
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:30,368
Compartmentalization.

400
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,370
Oh, Jesus Christ.

401
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:37,008
I let you murder my best friend's wife,

402
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:40,595
then I looked him in the
eye and I lied to him.

403
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,930
You didn't have a choice.

404
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:44,933
Yeah, well, I have one now.

405
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:47,218
What, you're gonna call Fritz,

406
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,386
tell him the truth?

407
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,855
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will.

408
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:53,775
So he loses his wife and his...

409
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,062
And his best friend. That
somehow balances the equation?

410
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,447
If you stop now, then you're a killer,

411
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:01,616
- but if you see it through...
- What?

412
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:03,568
I'm a hero?

413
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,453
I'm not the one that's
susceptible to flattery.

414
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:07,739
No, you're the one that wanted to know

415
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,408
that your friend Sid's
death was worth something.

416
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:15,914
The wind must have changed direction

417
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:17,749
in the middle of an experiment...

418
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,968
At least one... and dispersed the barium

419
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:22,087
all the way here

420
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,389
from Bayo Canyon.

421
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:26,091
Let me ask you a question.

422
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:27,592
Who cares?

423
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:37,936
The work helps, Fritz.

424
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,406
You're out here snipping shrubs

425
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:44,242
and dissecting seedpods for what?

426
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,578
Barium doesn't matter.

427
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:50,115
Matter doesn't matter.

428
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:52,784
The only thing that matters is people.

429
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,953
Who loves you and who you love.

430
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,539
And Jeannie...

431
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,793
Boy, did she understand that.

432
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:07,882
Okay, you see this prickly pear?

433
00:26:09,686 --> 00:26:12,604
This is just about the only sweet
thing that grows around here,

434
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,140
so the Pueblo Indians make it into candy.

435
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,860
Do... do you have any idea

436
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:22,814
what barium does to a child's intestines?

437
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,816
Me neither. Not yet.

438
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,985
Jeannie was right.

439
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:28,987
People matter and... and there...

440
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:31,623
And there are 20,000
of them living 50 miles

441
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,992
from where we are about to detonate

442
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,994
an atomic weapon.

443
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,333
You know,

444
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:46,221
we could, um, clip cactus
out here all day long,

445
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:49,007
but we'd still be two
steps down the food chain.

446
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,892
I know.

447
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:54,429
I had to start somewhere and...

448
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,349
I'm not ready to spread barium on my toast

449
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:01,069
- and wait to see what happens.
- Right, but I am.

450
00:27:01,104 --> 00:27:03,738
Let me be your subject.

451
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:05,373
I mean, I've already got a few micrograms

452
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:07,025
of plutonium in my body, right?

453
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:10,662
So give me a few more
and measure the results.

454
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:11,996
Fritz.

455
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:14,749
I've got nothing left to lose.

456
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:17,919
It's perfect.

457
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,542
Order up!

458
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,099
You got 20 minutes, pal.

459
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:33,384
A free state.

460
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,687
All 48 are free, actually.

461
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:38,056
I told you I'm not getting...

462
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:40,608
Mr. Isaacs?

463
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:44,395
Hello.

464
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:48,950
I'm Abby

465
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:52,120
and this is your grandson Joey.

466
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:56,457
Oh, boy, that is a lady-slayer

467
00:27:56,493 --> 00:27:57,876
in training right there.

468
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:00,211
Dead ringer for his Uncle Mort.

469
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:01,746
Just like him.

470
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,915
You watch this one, Mom.

471
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:07,252
Charlie always did have good taste.

472
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:09,754
Is he in the car or something?

473
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:12,590
He's actually very busy.

474
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,809
I wanted a chance to
finally meet you myself

475
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:16,811
and Joey, too, right?

476
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:18,596
Hey, Joey.

477
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,266
See that?

478
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:23,735
Spud Davis knocked that
out of Sportsman's Park

479
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,104
in '35. I want you to keep it.

480
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:30,275
- What do you say? Yeah.
- Thank you.

481
00:28:30,327 --> 00:28:33,328
Mommy, could I go outside?

482
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,246
Of course you can, kid.

483
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,831
Why not, right?

484
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:40,919
All right. You go on and play.

485
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:42,337
Go on.

486
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,672
But, Joey, stay away from the cars.

487
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:48,009
I know a good egg when I see one.

488
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:51,462
We're family, the four of us.

489
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,798
It shouldn't have taken this long, huh?

490
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,968
- Mr. Isaacs, I...
- Oh, please, Eli.

491
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,938
Hell, Dad, right?

492
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:01,639
Thank you.

493
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:04,275
I know that you and Charlie
had a bit of a falling out,

494
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:06,778
but with everything that's been
happening with our people in Europe...

495
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:09,280
We all need to come together

496
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:11,149
and repair old wounds,

497
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:12,483
don't we?

498
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,153
"Our people."

499
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:16,871
Exactly.

500
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:19,290
You know, we got the
papers a week late inside.

501
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:22,160
But I always tried to read what I could.

502
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:25,163
- Inside?
- Oh, Charlie never told you.

503
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:28,499
Well, I'm not ashamed of it anymore.

504
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,719
I ran numbers. Didn't run fast enough.

505
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:36,057
You've paid your debt.

506
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:39,477
When I was in prison,

507
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:42,230
hearing the news coming out of Europe,

508
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:46,401
it made me realize that
I hadn't been a good Jew.

509
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:49,404
While so many were being slaughtered,

510
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:53,524
I took my ancestry for granted.

511
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:55,410
You understand?

512
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,248
Why don't we give Charlie a call?

513
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:02,667
I know that you and he

514
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,085
had some words on the telephone,

515
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,870
- but I really think...
- Oh, I don't know.

516
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,423
He has plenty of fair grievances with me.

517
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,792
Well, it's time for him to move past them.

518
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:19,684
She said you could reach her on this number

519
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,718
for the next few minutes.

520
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,387
She said it was important.

521
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:32,063
She has no idea what that word means.

522
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:33,614
Dismissed.

523
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:47,128
He wanted to come.

524
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:50,248
It's just, well,

525
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,751
Charlie's not around very much these days.

526
00:30:53,753 --> 00:30:55,753
I see.

527
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:58,423
- Well, don't beat yourself up.
- No.

528
00:30:58,475 --> 00:31:00,475
I'm just glad I got to see you two.

529
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,127
So, what kind of work
is he doing these days?

530
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:05,897
Oh, I, um... I barely understand it.

531
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:09,517
It's um, physics, I guess.

532
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:14,238
Pillow talk ain't something
that youngsters do anymore?

533
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:16,607
Abby, look,

534
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:19,660
I know he's working for the Army.

535
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:22,280
- Oh.
- And I got a great idea.

536
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:23,948
Something where

537
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,950
we can all be together in the end.

538
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,952
You're here now and it's a start.

539
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:31,339
Exactly. Now, the war
is winding down, okay?

540
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:33,758
And you and I both know
the problem with the Jews.

541
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,510
We've never defended ourselves.

542
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,845
We need weapons.

543
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:40,681
Now, I know it's a harsh truth, Abby,

544
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:43,601
and I don't know beans about
Charlie's hush-hush project.

545
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:45,470
But I'm a betting man.

546
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:47,972
And I bet that it's a weapon.

547
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:49,807
A big one.

548
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:52,026
Now hear me out. If he'll
do something like that

549
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:55,613
for a government who turned
away the Jews by the boatload,

550
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,698
then maybe he could do
it for his own people.

551
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,784
And we can do it together.

552
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,487
Isaacs and Son.

553
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:08,993
You want to build weapons?

554
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:12,663
With Charlie's Army contacts
and my way around a deal?

555
00:32:12,715 --> 00:32:15,383
There will be a bonanza as
soon as this war is over,

556
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:18,336
and we can help our own people.

557
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:21,222
You want to make money

558
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:23,641
selling arms to the Jewish people?

559
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:26,561
Look, if Charlie doesn't like this idea,

560
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:28,062
believe me, I got a million more

561
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,231
bouncing around in this head, so...

562
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:34,852
You know, I... I really
have to get Joey home.

563
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:38,072
Do you wanna go and say goodbye to him?

564
00:32:38,107 --> 00:32:40,074
Of course.

565
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:44,195
- Isaac and Sons.
- Mm.

566
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:06,473
The big one.

567
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:09,977
Joey, please go wait in the car.

568
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:12,529
- Thank you.
- All righty.

569
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:14,531
Okay, you go right in.

570
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,867
Bye, kid. See you soon, huh?

571
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:25,209
Okay.

572
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:26,994
This is a very nice chunk.

573
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:29,163
We can parlay this kind of investment

574
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:30,330
into something good, Abby.

575
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:32,332
It's not an investment.

576
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,468
Well, a loan. It's okay. I'm good for it.

577
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:36,220
It's not a loan either.

578
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:37,838
And honestly, Mr. Isaacs, I
don't care what you do with it

579
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,890
as long as you stay away from us.

580
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:43,177
It's what you came for, isn't it?

581
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,229
Money.

582
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:49,516
I should've known.

583
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,685
Look at you.

584
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:53,987
Your fancy handbag.

585
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:56,023
Cute little hat.

586
00:33:56,025 --> 00:34:00,327
I bet your family's been paying
people off for generations.

587
00:34:00,362 --> 00:34:02,996
Charlie was right about you.

588
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:05,916
And, you know, I don't know how he
turned himself into the man he is today

589
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:08,368
with a role model like you.

590
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,704
You think you know the
man you're married to?

591
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,673
I know that you used him to place bets

592
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,508
and count cards when he was just a child.

593
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:16,093
Yeah? Was he a child nine years ago

594
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:17,678
when he lured me to his apartment

595
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:19,513
and he had the cops waiting for me?

596
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:21,849
What kind of man sends a father to prison

597
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,550
full of guys that wanna kill him?

598
00:34:23,602 --> 00:34:26,386
But you wanna know the worst part?

599
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:29,106
The way he could look me in the eye

600
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:30,858
and lie to my face.

601
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:33,060
15 years in the business,

602
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,562
best poker face I've ever seen.

603
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:37,865
So, Mrs. Isaacs, think about that

604
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,033
next time you're sitting
across from your husband

605
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,535
at the dinner table.

606
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,904
And think about it the
next time he tells you

607
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:45,572
where he was at night.

608
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:49,576
If I was you, I wouldn't
believe anything he says.

609
00:35:04,093 --> 00:35:06,426
No holding hands, I told you.

610
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:08,095
I need it for stability.

611
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,314
I've got an inner ear disorder.

612
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,599
It's just physical, you know that, right?

613
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,434
You realize that is exactly

614
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:16,820
what every man has been
waiting to hear his entire life.

615
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:18,989
Well, you're welcome.

616
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:21,108
And, um, thank you.

617
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,826
I never thought a patent lawyer

618
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:25,445
would be so avant-garde in bed.

619
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:26,613
Well, I could say the same thing

620
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:29,917
for a theoretical physicist.

621
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:31,835
Just don't go clipping at my heels, okay?

622
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,170
This isn't real life.

623
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:36,006
It's just some twisted holiday.

624
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,791
Well, it doesn't have to be.

625
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:40,928
I could be your at-home husband.

626
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:43,347
I could... I could cook you dinner.

627
00:35:43,382 --> 00:35:46,133
Oh, yeah? You wanna
live on a woman's salary?

628
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,303
The work you've been doing on
compressed neutron generators...

629
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,938
Do you know what that could do for you?

630
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:52,356
Yeah, zilch.

631
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:54,308
It's worthless as a bomb initiator.

632
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,525
Yeah, but it's worth millions

633
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:57,811
if you're looking for oil.

634
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,113
The president of Texaco, he doesn't
care what's between your legs.

635
00:36:00,149 --> 00:36:02,950
It's what's in your noggin
that's gonna buy him a yacht.

636
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:05,986
Yeah, but what's in my
noggin belongs to Uncle Sam.

637
00:36:05,988 --> 00:36:07,821
That's why you're here, right?

638
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:10,707
It only belongs to Uncle
Sam if I tell him about it.

639
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,639
From the colonel himself.

640
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:27,841
You're officially a free man.

641
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,514
Is he expecting me?

642
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,350
Henry?

643
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:38,352
Is that what's eating you?

644
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,904
There's no trick to fatherhood, Paul.

645
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:43,857
He'll worship you no matter your faults.

646
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,442
It's what sons do.

647
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:50,364
If I've never said it before...

648
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,867
thank you.

649
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,207
- Turn off the engine and raise your hands.
- Shit. Stitch your trap, Paul.

650
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:36,910
- You know nothing. They can't prove anything.
- Come with us.

651
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:40,080
- Cheerio, mates.
- Ah!

652
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:51,558
So what's next, Frank?

653
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:54,761
We go back to the original designs.

654
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:57,431
Maybe I built a flaw in the
system without knowing it.

655
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,599
No, what's next for you?

656
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,485
After all this is over.

657
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,071
Where do you go after the Hill?

658
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:05,989
Wherever my wife goes.

659
00:38:07,776 --> 00:38:09,326
Thought you two were done.

660
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,995
Yeah, I'm the flaw in that system.

661
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,164
Call it human error.

662
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,450
I'm still working on fixing it.

663
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:22,622
I haven't been husband of the year.

664
00:38:22,624 --> 00:38:26,009
At least you didn't trap Abby here twice.

665
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:29,963
At least your kid is still with you.

666
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:35,602
The things I've done
since I got to the Hill...

667
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:38,472
My father went to prison for less,

668
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:41,641
yet somehow here I am.

669
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:48,398
I got a man killed.

670
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:54,321
Sid Liao.

671
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,542
Sid Liao? Sid Liao was a spy.

672
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:01,495
No, he wasn't a spy.

673
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:04,631
- He made a stupid mistake.
- He was trying to escape.

674
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,334
He came to me for help.

675
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:11,922
And instead of helping
him, I exploited him.

676
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,676
Implosion was on the ropes.

677
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:19,846
So it was Sid or my group.

678
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:22,482
I don't blame the kid who shot him.

679
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:23,900
I don't blame Sid.

680
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:26,186
There's only one person I can blame.

681
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:33,660
You come here believing that
you're here to save lives.

682
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:37,497
And you tell yourself you sacrifice the few

683
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:38,698
to save the many.

684
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,001
Pretty soon...

685
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:44,037
everything's negotiable
and you can't remember

686
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,007
what you came here for in the first place.

687
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:49,543
It's all turned around.

688
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,800
It...

689
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,303
Wait.

690
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,724
It was turned around.

691
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,198
Frank? You seein' something?

692
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,233
Tell me.

693
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,319
Frank!

694
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,406
Hey!

695
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:24,294
Say you're me, Charlie.

696
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:26,913
You want a voice in how the gadget's used.

697
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:28,882
You wanna minimize how
many more lives it takes.

698
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,251
- You wanna turn things back around.
- This isn't a game.

699
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,420
If you figured it out, tell me.

700
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,224
Darrow's gonna give a scientist
a seat on the Target Committee.

701
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:40,093
We have to use this as leverage.

702
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:49,019
Wait a minute, it's you.

703
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,906
They're giving that seat to you.

704
00:40:52,941 --> 00:40:54,441
I'm the head of the technical staff.

705
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,611
Say you're me

706
00:40:57,613 --> 00:40:59,779
and you're suddenly talking to the guy

707
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:02,449
who gets to help dictate
how the bomb is used.

708
00:41:04,169 --> 00:41:06,620
And that guy wants to know
what happened to his test.

709
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:08,955
- What would you do then?
- What is this?

710
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,541
Blackmail?

711
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:16,680
Let's call this a...

712
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:19,633
A negotiation.

713
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,469
Bloody Yanks.

714
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,341
If this is some sort of prank,

715
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,309
I see no humor in it.

716
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:54,229
I am a member of the Royal Society.

717
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:57,315
Lord Halifax is a personal friend.

718
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,850
I wonder what he'd have to say

719
00:41:58,902 --> 00:42:00,852
if he knew you imprisoned a Briton

720
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,687
in a beef locker.

721
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:04,072
How about a Briton

722
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,690
carrying a bag full

723
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:09,361
of atomic secrets off a military base?

724
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,364
Or...

725
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:16,868
are these just souvenirs
of your trip to America?

726
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,840
I packed five suits and a Dopp kit.

727
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,092
I've never seen those papers before.

728
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,095
You don't think that...

729
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,847
Paul Crosley...

730
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,522
could have been involved in some sort of...

731
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,217
Oh, my God.

732
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,053
Committing espionage
right out of my office.

733
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:37,389
He has seemed out of sorts.

734
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:50,318
I'm afraid this is the
curtain call, William.

735
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:53,905
Whatever he's told you, Colonel,

736
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,874
the man is an inveterate liar.

737
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,410
You recruited Paul, Dr. Hogarth.

738
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:00,478
Told him who to contact.

739
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:03,215
What information to collect.
Isn't that the truth?

740
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,050
It's also become apparent that the British

741
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:06,918
have been keeping atomic
secrets of their own

742
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:08,587
from the Americans.

743
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:10,422
And you from me.

744
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:11,823
So you're going to hand over

745
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:13,458
every morsel the king has been holding.

746
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:15,794
Are you taking the piss?

747
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,496
Your coconspirators at Site X

748
00:43:18,532 --> 00:43:20,765
are sitting in rooms just like this one.

749
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,100
And they're cooperating with us,

750
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:25,270
so I'll let you consider your options.

751
00:43:35,832 --> 00:43:39,501
You'd betray the
grandfather of your only son?

752
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:42,837
You're going to

753
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:45,340
retract your statement.

754
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,094
Claim full responsibility like a man.

755
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,679
If you ever want to hold your boy...

756
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:53,131
Oh, I did want to hold my boy, actually.

757
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,766
I did.

758
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,469
Holding his photograph
seemed the next best thing.

759
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,855
So I took the snapshot out
of the frame on your desk

760
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:03,058
and I turned it around.

761
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,646
September 1932.

762
00:44:07,698 --> 00:44:11,449
So that would make him, what, 17?

763
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:12,951
Who is he?

764
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,869
You know, I even convinced myself

765
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:17,155
that he looked like me.

766
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:21,326
But then Lucy never got Henry back,

767
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:22,877
did she?

768
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:29,668
How long have you known?

769
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,053
Five months, give or take.

770
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:35,924
And all this time...

771
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:39,811
you and your new friend

772
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:42,897
have been waiting like
two snakes in the grass?

773
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,983
It's all been logged, William.

774
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:48,320
Every conversation, every scrap
of intelligence we've stolen.

775
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,738
Be smart.

776
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,856
Tell the truth about what the British know

777
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:53,858
and maybe you'll avoid that noose

778
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,944
that you've been worried about.

779
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:02,033
I pity you.

780
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,370
No friends.

781
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,539
No family.

782
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:09,541
No loyalty,

783
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:10,875
dignity,

784
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:12,711
honor.

785
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:16,381
You are a man without a country.

786
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,267
And without iron round his wrists.

787
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:21,269
Shall we begin?

788
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,107
We have power, Charlie.

789
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,226
Are we really gonna keep
using it to hurt people?

790
00:45:28,278 --> 00:45:30,445
You're really gonna
hold the project hostage?

791
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,897
Germany's about to sign a peace treaty.

792
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:34,566
All eyes are turning east

793
00:45:34,618 --> 00:45:36,234
toward an enemy that doesn't look like us

794
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,736
and doesn't talk like us.

795
00:45:37,788 --> 00:45:40,789
That makes it pretty easy
to cast them as barbarians

796
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,374
and justify a massacre.

797
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,075
What do you want, Frank?

798
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:48,079
We've both stumbled.

799
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,248
Now we can stand up straight together.

800
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,967
We can do the right thing.

801
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:55,637
You're a leader.

802
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:58,173
People look to you for
guidance, so guide them.

803
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,592
Convince the Target Committee

804
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:03,228
to demonstrate the bomb
on an uninhabited island.

805
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,814
Show the world our power and our restraint.

806
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:07,599
How do you know that's the right decision?

807
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:08,767
How do you know it's enough to end the war?

808
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:09,934
It doesn't matter what I know.

809
00:46:09,936 --> 00:46:11,436
You know that this is right.

810
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,773
I have to believe that's true.

811
00:46:14,825 --> 00:46:18,443
'Cause the truth is I can't
force you to do anything.

812
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:19,844
The reason we're both standing here

813
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,780
is you can see the path forward to the bomb

814
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:23,081
as clearly as I can

815
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,666
and you always could.

816
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,003
You were gonna see this, too,

817
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,172
eventually.

818
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,124
The detonators?

819
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:35,960
It was the first thing I checked.

820
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:38,430
Red to positive, yellow to negative, right?

821
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,465
That's what the specs say.

822
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:49,968
What if things got turned around?

823
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:55,313
The polarity?

824
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,649
All of these wires, theywere all...

825
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:00,201
they were all color-coded by hand, right?

826
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:03,121
Well, what if someone accidentally

827
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:06,157
dipped the brush in the wrong can of paint?

828
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:15,049
Jesus.

829
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:18,002
What if the charges got turned around?

830
00:47:39,576 --> 00:47:42,026
You did the right thing, Frank.

831
00:47:44,414 --> 00:47:46,948
And I know you will, too.

832
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:53,037
"I hereby declare on oath

833
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:54,706
that I absolutely and entirely

834
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,042
renounce and abjure all
allegiance and fidelity

835
00:47:58,044 --> 00:47:59,594
to any foreign prince,

836
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,679
potentate, state, or sovereignty"...

837
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:03,214
That's good enough, Paul.

838
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:04,849
I hereby declare you

839
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,565
a citizen of the United States of America.

840
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:09,771
Welcome home, son.

841
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:23,344
How long did it take him to figure it out?

842
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,630
He didn't.

843
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,348
I had to feed him the answer.

844
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:30,935
I told you not to bet on that boy.

845
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,353
Yeah, well...

846
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,556
we're all betting on him now.

847
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,965

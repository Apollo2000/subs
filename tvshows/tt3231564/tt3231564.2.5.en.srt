What happened to you,
Frank? Where have you been?

45
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,043
None of that matters. All that matters

46
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,912
is that we have been chasing our own tail.

47

us designs of a working gadget.

50

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,270
What, are you allergic
to newspaper reporters?

323
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:02,562
He's not Edward R. Murrow.

324
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:04,814
He's writing the official
history of the project.

325
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:06,232
They'll probably make a movie about it.

326
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,902
You wanna get left on
the cutting room floor?

327
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:12,605
So you two whiz kids were members
of the original implosion team.

328
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:15,659
The only two Charlie Isaacs
anointed for his test group.

329
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,327
Well, Charlie's a great boss.

330
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:19,245
I mean, sure, he works us hard,

331
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,204
but if there's ever any
criticism, it's only constructive.

332
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,584
He's got great hair, too. (chuckles)

333
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:26,586
I wanna hear your thoughts
about another boss.

334
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,838
Oppenheimer. That man
has been on a real roll

335
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:30,173
since he had that second bambino.

336
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:31,958
No, I wanna talk about Frank Winter.

337
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:34,594
From my understanding,

338
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:37,380
he torched every bridge from here to D.C.

339
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:39,599
Even found time to dust off an old grudge.

340
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,551
You mean the thing with Charlie?

341
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:44,437
Yeah. Uh, November 17th?

342
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,984
Can this be off the record?

343
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,394
- Lorentzen: <i>My three favorite words.</i>
-<i> (Music playing on radio)</i>

344
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:53,029
Charlie: It's historic!

345
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:56,097
We could be looking at a
Browns-Cardinals showdown.

346
00:18:56,867 --> 00:19:00,153
It hasn't happened since 1922.

347
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:02,789
Thank you, sir.

348
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:08,294
Watch out.

349
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:11,464
God, he almost ran me over.

350
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:14,106
I'm telling you, Browns are gonna take it.

351
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:15,528
- Smart money.
- Here's the thing.

352
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,303
My father's a Browns fan,

353
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:20,974
so I'd sooner root for
the Hitler Youth All Stars.

354
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:23,676
Oh, but come on, two
teams from St. Louis...

355
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:24,844
- Whoa!
- Hey!

356
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,896
Jesus!

357
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,055
Hello?

358
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:32,628
You didn't believe me, huh? (laughs)

359
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:36,239
Lazar! Uh, howdy!

360
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:39,025
Uh, Fritz. Fedowitz.

361
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:41,327
Your reputation precedes you, sir.

362
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:44,280
- In a good way. It's an honor to...
- Tomorrow.

363
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:46,833
- What?
- I'm sorry?

364
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,452
You're late. We're gonna be
driving back on dirt roads

365
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,121
in the middle of the night.

366
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:53,423
Gonna get ourselves killed.
You come back tomorrow.

367
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,291
Charlie: <i>Frank?</i>

368
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,627
Meeks: <i>Hey, you're
working in Ordnance now?</i>

369
00:19:57,678 --> 00:19:59,045
Fritz: <i>How are you, Commandante?</i>

370
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,632
Oh, you know, explosives, whiskey.

371
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:05,685
- Just like old times.
- Yeah. I told them to go home.

372
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:09,355
Construction starts tomorrow. We need to
confirm the spot for the derrick tonight.

373
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,107
Come now or I tell General Groves

374
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,026
that you refused the chance to weigh in.

375
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,728
Well, the general doesn't
want me to weigh in.

376
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,397
He wants me to decide.

377
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:19,532
Then decide today.

378
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,371
Well, it's your funeral.

379
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:27,957
It's gonna be a tight fit.

380
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,046
I was, uh... I was only
counting the four of us.

381
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,215
Lazar: <i>Well, you counted wrong.</i>

382
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,891
Lazar: <i>This is where
you're gonna put</i>

383
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:47,510
the hundred-foot tower for your gadget?

384
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:51,815
It's smack in the middle of the most
exposed part of the entire valley.

385
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,766
Charlie: It's discreet, it's accessible,

386
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:56,736
and it conforms best to our
specific technical needs.

387
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,105
Oh, that's very, very good.

388
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:01,024
Dear America,

389
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:04,694
we're very, very sorry, but your
bomb blew away with the wind.

390
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:09,115
But don't you worry, it conforms
best to our specific technical needs.

391
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,001
- All right, why don't you just calm down?
- (Gunshot echoes)

392
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,455
(horse neighs)

393
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:21,261
(horse neighs)

394
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:24,848
- You boys look like you're lost.
- The McDonoaugh brothers.

395
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:27,634
You... you guys know each other?

396
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:32,939
Trespassing on my family's property.

397
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,692
This land's the property of
the United States government.

398
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,478
You've ignored five requests
to appear before a judge.

399
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,730
$2,400 is a fair price.

400
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,117
This desert's a spooky place.

401
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:46,202
<i>Indian country.</i>

402
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:49,289
Your government men disappear
around here all the time.

403
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:51,157
If I were you, I wouldn't issue threats.

404
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,410
If I was you, I'd adios
myself back where I came from.

405
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:57,380
- And if I don't?
- (Rifle cocks)

406
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,502
Frank: <i>Gonna need a lot
more ammunition than that.</i>

407
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:05,471
<i>You kill us, they'll
just send 10 more guys.</i>

408
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:07,674
<i>Kill them, they'll send a hundred.</i>

409
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:11,836
Army doesn't give two shits about
your family's property rights.

410
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:15,181
You fellas are up against the Constitution.

411
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:17,183
You fight it, you'll just
waste a few days in court,

412
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:21,404
end up with the same $2,000
plus a stack of legal bills.

413
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,384
But maybe

414
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:30,294
your land here is worth
more than two grand.

415
00:22:30,698 --> 00:22:33,032
Hell, it may be worth a lot more.

416
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:36,836
This canyon's part of the San Juan Basin,

417
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,505
which is a proven oil reserve. Silver, too.

418
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,091
<i>You ever done a geologic survey?</i>

419
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:45,011
The feds don't have time to spend
in court debating mineral rights.

420
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:47,213
What they have is money.

421
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:48,881
A tap that never runs dry.

422
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,767
You start saying oil and silver,

423
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,385
you ask for five times the price.

424
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:55,305
- You'll get double.
- Come on.

425
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:57,307
He's right, Clem.

426
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:02,111
- If you're wrong about this...
- I'm not wrong.

427
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:04,030
That's the best you'll do.

428
00:23:13,374 --> 00:23:16,209
(Horse neighs)

429
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:21,581
- Is that true?
- Hell, I got no idea.

430
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:24,717
(All laughing)

431
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:27,971
- Lazar:<i> Ha! He's good.</i>
- Hey, I didn't ask for your help.

432
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:29,672
You came back to the Hill

433
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:31,891
ranting about pumping
the brakes on the project,

434
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:34,010
but here you are hitting
the gas. Why's that?

435
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:36,512
Well, we're still at
war on three continents.

436
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:39,432
- I heard that somewhere.
- No. The real reason you came back

437
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,485
is you can't stand the idea that the
gadget could be built without you.

438
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,188
You can't stand having
anyone else's name on it.

439
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:47,774
You are so good at delivering
speeches, aren't you, Charlie?

440
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:51,077
Heard you gave quite a eulogy
when I got my off-site promotion.

441
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:54,914
And it only took you, what, two
weeks to become the Army's puppet.

442
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,119
- Hey.
- (Grunts)

443
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:02,455
(growling, grunting)

444
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:10,430
Lazar: Come on. Enough fun, enough fun!

445
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:12,548
I don't care what deal
you made with the colonel.

446
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,127
You are never stepping
foot in the tech area again!

447
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,272
What did Charlie mean when he
said a deal with the colonel?

448
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:21,774
Does that have to do with
Frank's enlistment at all?

449
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:23,192
I mean, sort of a quid pro quo?

450
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:25,395
I mean, if you figure
that out, let us know.

451
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:28,197
Frank's not exactly in the business
of explaining himself to us.

452
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:30,733
Lorentzen: <i>Or to anyone, apparently.</i>

453
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:33,653
<i>But Isaacs was wrong
about one thing.</i>

454
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:37,707
<i>Frank got himself back into the
tech area after all, didn't he?</i>

455
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,646
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- Can I have another?

456
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:46,493
Understanding the
coordination of these assets

457
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:50,471
is crucial to the fluid
progress of our mandate.

458
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,805
Sincerely yours, Paul Crosley.

459
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,774
You have it?

460
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:55,643
Any mistakes, you're back on the jitney

461
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,612
to whatever junior
college you crawled out of.

462
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,030
All right.

463
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,233
Hello. Oh.

464
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:04,818
A mandatory sit-down with
our resident ink-slinger.

465
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,954
Just before the clock strikes.

466
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:08,572
You look like you need a drink.

467
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:10,207
No, I'm back on land again.

468
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,826
- What can I get you?
- Seltzer and lime, please.

469
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,328
Really?

470
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,997
- How long?
- Long enough to hurt.

471
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,584
So, Mr. Lorentzen, you
have me for 15 minutes.

472
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,753
- Let's make it good.
- All right.

473
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:25,256
Well, the gun division's
humming along nicely.

474
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:29,893
You're the backup plan the general
and Oppenheimer always dreamed of.

475
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:33,097
- Yet until November...
- We were in the pig trough.

476
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:34,332
Mm.

477
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:37,225
The uranium enrichment problem
had us stalled in our tracks.

478
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:41,238
That's quite a turnaround. What's
the opening sentence to that chapter?

479
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:45,000
Well, we were at a low point.

480
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:47,838
I was at a low point.

481
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:49,877
Woman: <i>Paul.</i>

482
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:53,450
<i>Paul!</i>

483
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,314
_

484
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,547
(sighs) I can't feel my arms.

485
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,945
- <i> (Can thuds)</i>
- <i> (Retches)</i>

486
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:25,332
(coughs)

487
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:30,204
Let me guess, up all night
working on the enrichment problem?

488
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:35,743
Inevitable.

489
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,128
Do you know, maybe I'll
get a job after the war.

490
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,915
<i>Or maybe I'll settle down,
have kids, regret my decisions.</i>

491
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:44,668
<i>But there's one thing
I know for sure... </i>

492
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,137
<i>you have no future.</i>

493
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:51,642
You know, I understand.

494
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,896
- <i> What?</i>
- The Site X liaison job.

495
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,515
Getting passed over. I understand.

496
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:01,268
I sympathize.

497
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,821
Hallelujah.

498
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,107
It's a beautiful day out.

499
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,410
I'm gonna go find a tree.

500
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,161
Maybe I'll solve the uranium problem

501
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,447
and you'll find a way to
take that from me, too.

502
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:37,020
Hello, Crosley.

503
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:43,703
We brought detonators.

504
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:48,414
Try not to blow yourself
up until we're gone.

505
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:53,203
- Okay?
- Well, Hogarth's in his office. He has the paperwork.

506
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,705
Yeah.

507
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,085
Crosley: <i>There it is.</i>

508
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:11,221
- Go ahead.
- Excuse me?

509
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,557
Go on, Frank. Give a boy an education.

510
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:16,760
Go on.

511
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:19,012
Yeah.

512
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:21,348
Gaseous diffusion, thermal diffusion,

513
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,567
electromagnetic separation.

514
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,269
Three methods for enriching uranium,

515
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,771
only nobody knows which one is best

516
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:30,691
or if any of them even works.

517
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,827
And if we can't speed up
enrichment at an exponential pace?

518
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,612
<i>Gun model dies on the vine.</i>

519
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,614
Or, who knows, upside could be

520
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:40,200
Hogarth shoots himself in the head.

521
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,418
<i>So go on, Frank.</i>

522
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,589
Dazzle us

523
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,125
with that patented smugness

524
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:51,845
that says you're the only one who
understands the gravity of our great war.

525
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,931
The kingdom, the power,

526
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,551
the glory right here for your taking.

527
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:01,522
I'm just trying to do my job, Paul.

528
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,109
Dr. Winter, sir?

529
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,446
- I have to ask you to come with me.
- Why?

530
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,532
No, he's fine. He's with me.

531
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,329
He's been cleared at the gate.

532
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:14,902
Man: <i>Supposed to call
the MPs if you're not</i>

533
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,954
<i>out of the tech area
in five minutes,</i>

534
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,872
<i>per Dr. Isaacs.</i>

535
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,457
(laughs) Who?

536
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,376
Dr. Isaacs?

537
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,078
- Never heard of him.
- It's okay.

538
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,798
It's okay. We were just leaving.

539
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,554
Good luck, Paul.

540
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,722
Crosley: <i>So even the
great Frank Winter</i>

541
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,558
<i>couldn't solve the uranium problem.</i>

542
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:41,011
And was that your first interaction
with Frank since he got back?

543
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,230
I had seen him around digging latrines,

544
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:45,349
other vital work.

545
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,934
Surprised to see him back on the Hill?

546
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,685
In a private's uniform? Yeah.

547
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:50,885
And I think it's safe to
say most of us had questions.

548
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,739
Get any answers?

549
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,275
The colonel needed another
soldier for his holy crusade.

550
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,612
Why all the curiosity about Frank?

551
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,497
Just filling in the blanks.

552
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,950
You devil. (laughs)

553
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,919
First, you try to reignite your
old flame with the man's wife.

554
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,205
Then you tar and feather
Frank in the official history.

555
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:11,458
- Bravo.
- I'm sorry, gentlemen.

556
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,018
We need to clear the tables
for tonight's festivities.

557
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:17,464
Well, enough already. I have a year's
work to do before the clock strikes.

558
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,633
Uh, how'd you fix it?

559
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:24,021
The problem with the uranium that
was slowing down the gun model.

560
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,722
Oppenheimer had a eureka.

561
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:28,475
- On November 29th.
- Yeah, round about.

562
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,194
One day, Oppenheimer marches
into the office unannounced

563
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,197
and out of nowhere just
delivers a solution.

564
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,817
Turns out the man's a genius after all.

565
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,371
And what was the solution?

566
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:42,623
Well, we had been thinking of
the processes as competitors

567
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:45,826
and Oppie realized they were more
efficient when linked in tandem.

568
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,995
Collaborators.

569
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:51,048
Yeah, I suppose you could say that.

570
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,396
Well, time and tide.

571
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,919
Oh, this reborn gun division,

572
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,522
is the nickname still Thin Man?

573
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:00,424
We're calling it Little Boy.

574
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:03,260
- Bet there's a story there.
- (Chuckles)

575
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm afraid it will probably
put your readers to sleep.

576
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,100
(Sighs)

577
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,822
<i>(chatter over P.A.)</i>

578
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,833
<i>(engine starts)</i>

579
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:34,708
Hair of the bloodhound?

580
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,262
You should give my job to Helen.

581
00:31:39,777 --> 00:31:41,598
She's more experienced than I am,

582
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,733
she's been to Site X,

583
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,740
and she cares.

584
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,354
She won't shag you

585
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,124
if that's what you're thinking.

586
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:52,225
Enjoy watching Frank Winter

587
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:54,194
get escorted from the building?

588
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:57,872
(Chuckles) Americans are a funny lot.

589
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,400
They poke fun at cricket,

590
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,654
you let them play, they
have a few lucky bowls

591
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:07,040
and they act as if they
invented the damn sport.

592
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:08,801
Yeah, they are unique.

593
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:12,829
They'd be nowhere without us.

594
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,665
I have a healthy self-regard,

595
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:16,633
but neither one of us is getting
written into the history books.

596
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,884
Don't be daft.

597
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,503
Us.

598
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:21,638
The home team.

599
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,224
War is no longer a question

600
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,176
of artillery or trenches

601
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,229
or how many tank divisions you can marshal

602
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:31,658
to outflank your rival.

603
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:34,601
Information is the new gunpowder.

604
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,770
Information is the future.

605
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,775
And Britain needs a future.

606
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:46,496
You need a future.

607
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,287
So is this why you gave me the promotion?

608
00:32:57,258 --> 00:33:00,794
The Yankees are niggardly allies.

609
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,015
They dine out on our science

610
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,967
and what do they give us in return?

611
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,552
<i>Table crumbs.</i>

612
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:10,771
So when the war's over

613
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,806
and the nuclear power boom begins,

614
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,858
they'll own the future.

615
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:18,278
We must take what we can as fast as we can.

616
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:20,697
- You want me to steal for you?
-<i> No.</i>

617
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,983
For king and country.

618
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,619
You know, I knew a man
who was shot for less.

619
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:28,159
<i>Think about your country, Paul.</i>

620
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,800
Everything will be different after the war.

621
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,044
We'll go home.

622
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,464
Together.

623
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,637
You have regrets about Lucy.

624
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,058
I know there are things that
you wish you could take back

625
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,177
that you said and did.

626
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,095
And so what if I do?

627
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:56,266
My daughter's a forgiving soul.

628
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:59,069
Too forgiving.

629
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,905
But she knows that we're here together

630
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,858
and she wants to mend fences.

631
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,782
She wants a life with you.

632
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,937
I never had a son, Paul.

633
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:23,603
But you do.

634
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,098
And he's a gem.

635
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,351
Lucy got him back.

636
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,414
My grandson.

637
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:36,723
You can leave something
behind in this world.

638
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,034
A legacy for Henry.

639
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:43,083
<i>So help me, Paul.</i>

640
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,624
<i>You won't just go home a man.</i>

641
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,673
<i>You'll go home a father.</i>

642
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,905
<i>You'll go home to your little boy.</i>

643

Darrow: <i>This is what
we're paying you for,</i>

644
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:02,030
<i>rumors about Frank Winter?</i>

645
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:03,865
I haven't seen a check in six months.

646
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,233
My own paper cut me off.

647
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:06,868
It's your privilege

648
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:10,122
to document the scientific
history of this project,

649
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:12,564
not editorialize about my soldiers.

650
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,876
It's the holiday.

651
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:18,997
This was a side project
to keep my pencil sharp.

652
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,968
You know, I could never get a bead

653
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,554
<i>on why you let Frank
back onto the Hill.</i>

654
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:27,839
<i>I thought it was to shut him up</i>

655
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,174
<i>or torture him.</i>

656
00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:32,811
Then suddenly, it hit me.

657
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:37,992
Oppenheimer, he's got
his head in the clouds

658
00:35:38,017 --> 00:35:41,637
and his sidekick is this
28-year-old hotshot

659
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:44,363
who you don't fully believe in.

660
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,359
Isaacs couldn't handle the ranchers alone.

661
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,470
He couldn't solve the uranium problem.

662
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:51,863
And you knew that sooner or later,

663
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:53,415
this kid's gonna roll another seven.

664
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,667
What's your point?

665
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:58,837
You don't just keep your enemies closer.

666
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:01,923
Frank Winter invented the gadget.

667
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,792
You let him back on the Hill

668
00:36:03,843 --> 00:36:08,130
because whatever he did
or whoever he pissed off,

669
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:10,046
you need an insurance policy.

670
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:13,617
And the way I see it,
you're not the only one.

671
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,384
<i>The uranium problem... </i>

672
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:19,357
<i>that was Frank, wasn't it?</i>

673
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:25,986
<i>Oppenheimer couldn't have everyone
thinking an Army private he exiled</i>

674
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:29,680
<i>solved the problem that was keeping
Little Boy on the sidelines.</i>

675
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:31,873
<i>Now, when he saw what Frank did... </i>

676
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,539
<i>what nobody else could do... </i>

677
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:37,826
<i>Oppie realized the same
thing you did six months ago.</i>

678
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:43,215
<i>The day will come when he's
gonna need Frank again.</i>

679
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:47,969

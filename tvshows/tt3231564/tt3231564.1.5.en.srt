00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,003
LANCEFIELD: He's talking about Thin Man.

158
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,321
Two thousand years of ballistic science

159
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,768
only apply if your cannon
needs to fire more than once.

160
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,286
THATCHER: We want our cannon
to bust apart.

161
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,003
It only has to fire once.

162
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,243
LANCEFIELD: So it can be thinner and lighter.
(EXCLAIMS)

163
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,604
That old jalopy's
still got some fuel in his tank.

164
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,808
He could teach you
how to give the goods to your old lady.

165
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,486
Yeah, like I need sex tips from a Commie.

166
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,928
What did you say?

167
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,641
- Just trying to help.
- Like you helped Richard Lavro?

168
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,283
Good night, gentlemen.

169
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,686
THATCHER: Babbit's a Communist?

170
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,286
- How do you know?
- CHARLIE: He's friends with Richard Lavro.

171
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,643
Glen Babbit has been part of this project
since there was a project.

172
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,530
He slept in a tent for two weeks
when we had no place else to put him,

173
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,045
and he never complained.

174
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,207
Besides, he's a Jew.

175
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,681
This is not a man
who's passing secrets to the Germans.

176
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,010
You're focused on today's problem.

177
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,730
I'm talking about tomorrow's.

178
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,609
You can't swing a dead animal up on this hill

179
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,331
without hitting some genius
who attended a Communist rally.

180
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,482
Including Robert Oppenheimer.

181
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,769
Yes, but Oppenheimer
never knew Richard Lavro.

182
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,289
The physicist's physicist.

183
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,681
Made some of the key discoveries
in quantum theory.

184
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,448
Tenured at Harvard until October, 1939
when he disappeared.

185
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,046
Sounds like you've been
reading too many ghost stories.

186
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,203
Richard Lavro is not a ghost. He's a defector.

187
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,009
In '39, he sailed from New York to London,
then London to Moscow.

188
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,731
Now he directs a group
in laboratory number two

189
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,724
in the Academy of Sciences,
the Soviet Manhattan Project.

190
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,802
What does any of this have to do
with Glen Babbit?

191
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,601
The USSR is a frozen cow pasture.
They barely have indoor plumbing.

192
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,763
Yet somehow, this country that
has to import its elevators from Yonkers

193
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,611
has a nuclear program
that's riding up your ass.

194
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,081
And you think Babbit gave
Lavro our nuclear research?

195
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,970
Gave, is giving, will continue to give.

196
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,121
Last time you had a theory,

197
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,761
I ended up with a dead mathematician
and a 10-page bill for fencing.

198
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,961
And you want to disrupt
the crucial work that's happening here

199
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,170
because you're waging a war
against a country that's technically our ally?

200
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,930
Technically.

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,729
I expect your full cooperation.

202
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,166
And I expect the full cooperation
of your staff.

203
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,211
Nobody thought to ask Babbit about
any of this during his intake interview?

204
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,521
He claimed he never spoke to Lavro.

205
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,051
(SIGHS)

206
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,962
GLEN: I lied. I met him
at the Solvay Conference in '33.

207
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,328
We ran into each other at a couple
of symposiums over the next few years,

208
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,640
but that's all.

209
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,166
- He was a good physicist.
-And an active Communist.

210
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,720
Well, 10 years ago,
so were half the scientists in America.

211
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,370
It wasn't an issue.

212
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,926
Well, it becomes an issue
when you lie during your security interview.

213
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,281
Well, I got jittery.
Any connection to Lavro looks bad.

214
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,647
I didn't think
anybody was gonna call me on it.

215
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,848
Maybe Isaacs was
at one of those conferences.

216
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,526
Saw you two talking to each other.

217
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,807
A drunken kid says
something stupid in a bar...

218
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,121
Yeah, and I hear about it
from the security office.

219
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,683
Did you ever talk to Lavro about fission?

220
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,285
Of course not.

221
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,523
Anybody comes to you with questions,
you stonewall them. Stick to your story.

222
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,602
- Jesus, Frank.
- You never met him.

223
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,529
I'm not as good a poker player as you.

224
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,881
Well, you lied to get in here.

225
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,242
You can certainly do it again.

226
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,725
I'll find out what the kid knows.

227
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,961
Leave it alone, Frank.

228
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,727
We got the plutonium. We got real work to do.

229
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,962
- It'll all blow over.
- Just like Sid Liao?

230
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,881
There's no breeze here, Glen.
Things don't blow over.

231
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,651
(BUZZING)

232
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,086
Liza.

233
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,763
So these are your pets
everyone's buzzing about?

234
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,801
Well, they won't bring you your paper,
but they won't bite the postman either.

235
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,846
Here. This was mixed in with ours.

236
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,930
I didn't peek.

237
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,370
So, you can see why the journal sent it back.

238
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,330
I mean,
I know the censors have to be vigilant,

239
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,323
but if you took even a cursory glance,

240
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,121
you'd see that nothing and by subject matter
is classified.

241
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,564
I study plants.

242
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,044
In this case, the pollination preferences
of the <i>Apis mellifera.</i>

243
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,963
The European honey bee.

244
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,847
Interesting critters.

245
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,526
I always thought
they were only good for ruining picnics.

246
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,649
- Mrs. Winter...
- Dr. Winter.

247
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,964
Scientists are prohibited from publishing
during their tenure in the Manhattan District.

248
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,287
I don't have a tenure here,
and I'm not employed on the Project.

249
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,203
But you are a scientist.

250
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,168
Captain, I sacrificed my job

251
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,483
to come here with my husband
because his work is crucial to the war effort.

252
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,961
Mine is not, but it is crucial to me.

253
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,446
Says here you studied in France.

254
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,491
During college, yes.

255
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,682
Well, I was in France, too.

256
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,331
Not the Sorbonne, but the Argonne.

257
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,448
You know what I remember most? The food.

258
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,729
Because that's what you do in a war,
make the best of it.

259
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,604
Before you go, Dr. Winter, your bees...

260
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,121
There have been some complaints.

261
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,324
Strategic bombing.

262
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,325
Six thousand civilians on detonation.

263
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,323
Ours will be 50 times more powerful.

264
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,125
So suddenly you care
about collateral damage?

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,090
You didn't seem to at the PX last night.

266
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,647
I had a lot to drink. Tell Dr. Babbit I'm sorry.

267
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,405
Don't say another word to anyone.

268
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,720
Don't even think his name.

269
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,643
Jesus, relax. I apologize.

270
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,881
You think I give a shit?

271
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,884
G-2 shakes your tree,
you make sure nothing falls.

272
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,329
You want me to lie to military intelligence?

273
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,165
You saw two men
who can think circles around you

274
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,050
just talking shop at a conference.

275
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,124
There's no conspiracy.
Just a figment of your imagination.

276
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,924
I worked as the staff assistant
at the Physics Department at Harvard.

277
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,650
Answered phones, ran the mimeo.

278
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,247
I'm sure your parents were very proud.
You just keep your mouth shut.

279
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,967
And I delivered mail.

280
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,283
One day, an envelope shows up for Dr. Lavro.

281
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,089
It wasn't sealed.

282
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,969
Yeah? Sounds like you're the one
G-2 should be interested in.

283
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,730
It was a ticket to London on the Cunard Line.

284
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,201
So what? He defected from London.

285
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,803
It wasn't for Lavro.

286
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,002
His had already arrived,
same sort of envelope.

287
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,680
The ticket was in Babbit's name.

288
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,885
Fritz, let me borrow that French letter
you keep in your drawer.

289
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,883
You can't borrow a condom.

290
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,486
- Anyway, I already used it.
- Rubbish.

291
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,370
I've seen you gaze wistfully at it
every day since the Army handed it out.

292
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,408
Meeks got one too. Take his.

293
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,450
Meeks is in Albuquerque
with a chorus girl from The Wizard of Oz.

294
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,888
Tin Man's probably getting
his joints oiled as we speak.

295
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,086
Meeks has a girlfriend?

296
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,128
Only a true miser
hides a resource he'll never need.

297
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,765
See you later.

298
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,209
Is everybody getting laid but me?

299
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,806
It's just sex, Fritz.

300
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,451
Is it because I'm husky?

301
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,171
Orson Welles is overweight.
The papers say he married Rita Hayworth.

302
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,009
How long's it been?

303
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,089
- A little While.
- Fritz.

304
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,491
Twenty nine years, 11 months, 19 days.

305
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,601
Then let's call this an early birthday present.

306
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,162
Should we put on the radio or something?

307
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,207
What? Oh, no.

308
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,044
- You're not gonna do it in my room.
-(MUSIC PLAYING)

309
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,645
- Get over here.
- (MUSIC STOPS)

310
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,564
Um... Her, her, not her.

311
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,927
The one with the bob,
she charges by the minute.

312
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,004
That's a good deal if you're a quick draw
and you like short hair.

313
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,686
Wait. You want me to sleep with a...

314
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,244
They're all whores?

315
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,444
They're capitalists. It's basic economics.
Supply and demand.

316
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,603
I took econ at Cornell.
This definitely wasn't on the syllabus.

317
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,160
These girls make five dollars a week
at the lunch counter,

318
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,562
but they're walking around
with gold mines under their skirts.

319
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,371
I always thought
it would be with someone special.

320
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,170
Jeannie's special. She plays the bassoon.

321
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,561
Huh.

322
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,800
At least she cleans her sheets.

323
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,848
FRANK: Why don't you tell me again?

324
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,641
You met Richard Lavro in 1933.
You ran into him at a conference or two.

325
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,644
Maybe three. Physics is a small pond.

326
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,245
But you didn't really know him?

327
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,045
That's why you lied
during your security interview,

328
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,088
because the fact that you met him
wasn't really relevant.

329
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,606
To our work here, it wasn't.

330
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,650
I met Charles Lindbergh once.
Doesn't make me a fascist

331
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,448
or an airplane pilot.

332
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,931
You know how G-2 operates.

333
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,523
If they sniff blood in the water,
if there's any whiff of impropriety...

334
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,762
But you lied to me, too.

335
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,846
You're lying right now.

336
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,840
What did Isaacs tell you?

337
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,644
A ticket to London.

338
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,723
That's what he saw.

339
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,690
I'm not a Communist, Frank.

340
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,606
The ticket was in your name.
It was delivered to Lavro.

341
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,251
Jesus. I've never even been to London.

342
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,164
So some travel agent
made a clerical mistake?

343
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,485
Isaacs has imagined this whole thing?

344
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,166
They're gonna come after you.
You better get your story straight.

345
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,605
I didn't get on any boat.

346
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,808
But you were going to.

347
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,804
Did you help him defect?
Are you passing him information now?

348
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,967
No.

349
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,169
Then why was your name on that ticket?

350
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,924
- Frank.
- Why?

351
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,925
You know why.

352
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,007
You know.

353
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,244
He asked me to leave with him.

354
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,120
He thought the ticket would convince me.

355
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,127
He wanted to start a new life.

356
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,163
He was naive.

357
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,804
We both were.

358
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,005
But I have never betrayed my country.

359
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,410
You were married when I met you.

360
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,929
That was a long time ago.

361
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,361
LIZA: From three major publications a year
to zero.

362
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,604
It's like Agatha Christie.
One day, she vanished.

363
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,327
Don't you think those sons of bitches
are gonna give my career

364
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,767
a funeral with full honors?

365
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,171
I'm sorry.

366
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,242
Well, I'm gonna keep on typing,

367
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,689
and they can keep on redacting,
and eventually, they'll run out of ink.

368
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,687
Can you tell me what's wrong?

369
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,287
I had a disagreement with Glen.

370
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,285
The sort that would ruin
a perfectly good weekend in Cape May?

371
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,046
No, this is different.

372
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,930
Glen lent us his car for our honeymoon.

373
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,800
And he sat in the waiting room
at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital

374
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,406
for 10 hours when I was in labor.

375
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,962
Whatever it is, apologize and be done with it.

376
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,964
I don't even know who I'd be apologizing to.

377
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,646
The man's not who you think he is.

378
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,802
He's been lying to me
since the day I met him,

379
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,564
since the day we met his wife.

380
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,484
Glen's never lied to me.

381
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,409
And everyone deserves a little privacy, Frank.

382
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,765
He told you?

383
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,604
He didn't have to.

384
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,123
You know, in all these years,

385
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,489
there's only ever really been one bone
of contention between Glen and me.

386
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,409
You know what it is?

387
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,243
No matter what you do,

388
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,248
he refuses to judge you.

CHARLIE: <i>Under each arm,
the sandman has an umbrella.</i>

390
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,083
<i>One of them is covered in colorful pictures,</i>

391
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,324
<i>of all the wondrous things in the world.</i>

392
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,886
And this umbrella, he puts
on the headboards of the good children,

393
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,964
so they will dream
wonderful stories all the night through.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

395
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,169
The other umbrella has no pictures.

396
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,047
<i>It's black and frayed, and wires poke out.</i>

397
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,801
<i>The children who get this umbrella
toss and turn all night long,</i>

398
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,530
<i>for they are very bad.</i>

399

<i>And when they wake in the morning,</i>

400
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,290
they haven't dreamed anything.

401
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,848
They haven't dreamed anything at all.

(DEVICE HUMS)

403
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,685
Shall we begin?

404
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,921
Some gentlemen from Washington
paid Glen Babbit a visit last night.

405
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,890
- It wasn't a social call.
- What did Babbit tell them?

406
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,961
That's not my business.

407
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,361
What matters now
is that you tell them the truth.

408
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,761
They pulled your security file this morning.
Due diligence.

409
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,205
They're gonna put you on record.

410
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,966
Whatever you know about Babbit,
you have to protect yourself.

411
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,691
And what if Babbit is not a Communist?

412
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,771
You know, when I was a boy,

413
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,003
my old man, first snow,

414
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,131
he'd stick a Winchester in my hand.

415
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,568
He'd drag me out to the woods
to shoot a whitetail.

416
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,884
We'd sit there all day freezing our stones off.

417
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,731
You see, my old man refused to go home
without a kill.

418
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,924
I read Babbit's work in college.
He is an underappreciated scientist.

419
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,810
- He's one of the best around.
- And you want me to shoot him?

420
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,123
Charlie, you're not the hunter here.

421
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,006
These men will not go back to Washington
without a trophy.

422
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,880
And if they can't bag a deer,
they will settle for a grouse.

423
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,002
You got a brilliant career ahead of you.

424
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,010
Don't throw it away
by lying to protect the wrong man.

425
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,445
I need a word.

426
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,086
I'm submitting my resignation.
I'll talk to Oppenheimer.

427
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,451
They came by my house.

428
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,282
What did you tell them?

429
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,204
The last four months, the Army's been trying
to take us behind the woodshed.

430
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,442
I am not giving them any more ammunition.

431
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,521
What did you say?

432
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,364
I stuck with my story, just like you told me to.

433
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,441
But it doesn't matter,

434
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,443
because sooner or later,
they're gonna talk to the kid.

435
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,126
It's better to resign now
for the good of the group.

436
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,850
You are the group.

437
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,769
Frank, at some point,
we all need to pay for the sins of the past.

438
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,730
- I am out of ration stamps.
-Not accepted.

439
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,962
It won't be up to you when Isaacs talks.

440
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,321
You let me worry about Isaacs.

441
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,971
The kid already said he's gonna sing.

442
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,689
Well, I'll try a new approach.

- Our Helen?

And lo, Prometheus gave man
the gift of fire. (LAUGHS)

Yep, it was hot.

So which one of them was it? Lucy? Peg?

450
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,691
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Please.

451
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,367
Shall I just check the infirmary
for young ladies with crush wounds?

452
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,363
I'd look for the girl
with the biggest smile on her face.

453
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,046
Whoever she is,
her moans kept me up half the night.

No, that's not true.

You knocked over her lamp on the way out.
I heard the bulb break.

Look, Helen, the truth is...

463

I don't want to hear it, Fritz.
You just pay her the $2.25.

464
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,928
But I didn't have sex with her!

465
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,202
And we agreed on $2 flat.

1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,609
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,161
Whatever we're doing here,

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,605
please tell me it's worth it.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,925
<i>I have cousins in Europe.</i>

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,801
I can't do anything
about what's happening over there,

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,450
but you can.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,128
The man inside Heisenberg's project...

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,680
They executed him.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,807
Magpie?

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,362
You didn't tell anyone
else about him, did you?

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,205
Frank's been sending money?

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,328
Tell him he has nothing to feel guilty about.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,926
Why would Frank feel guilty?

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,288
It's true.
You've been listening to Akley.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,161
I am not gonna be the last casualty
of Frank Winter's ego.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm going home, Charlie.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,521
- The Army won't allow it.
- They will if we're divorced.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,881
Thin Man is dead.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,444
This project won't survive without us.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,646
You'd work with me?

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,245
<i>You did the best you could, Reed.</i>

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,125
Reed!

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,046
They told us one day.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,566
That was five days ago.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,846
See that red stamp?

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,682
That means there are contingencies.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,684
Some men from the government
have taken an interest in your case.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,728
What men? I don't understand.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,724
I'm afraid it's out of my hands.
You'll just have to wait.

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,690
I filled out the forms.
I paid the entry fee.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,322
You tell me we need to pay
$50 to enter the country.

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:02:25,400
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,806
Ma'am.

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,684
I understand that these nice people
have an American sponsor.

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,649
Yes, this is the one.

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,200
She says his name is Charles Isaacs.

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,649
He is a very important man.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,922
Tell me about Mr. Isaacs.

39
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,926
I guess it's always a mystery.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,721
Suicide. But Reed Akley?

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,043
How did he seem when you saw him last?

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,088
I don't know.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,889
The same.

44
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,962
I guess I never realized.

45
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,287
Hard as it is having secrets kept from you...

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,407
...keeping them must be harder.

47
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,085
Callie!

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,682
Is anyone planning on getting that?

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,001
All right, already. Hold your fire.

50
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,167
Um...

51
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,760
Dad?

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,686
Dad!

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,287
How's his wife holding up?

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,124
Does it matter?

55
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,362
At least he didn't have children.

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,162
Success has many fathers,
failure is an orphan.

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,446
Reed Akley was the father of the most
expensive failure in the history of war.

58
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,090
I was his father.

59
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,010
There's a...
There's a problem with Thin Man?

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,724
Reed Akley is dead.

61
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,007
So is Thin Man, as you well know.

62
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,971
That doesn't mean the project is dead.

63
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,285
- The implosion bomb works.
- Babbit told me.

64
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,931
- I'll need a written briefing by day's end.
- I can do that.

65
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,202
It's for the War Department.
Use small words.

66
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,648
We have to reassure them
there's continuity of leadership.

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,801
I need to know that you're ready.

68
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,769
Ready? Ready for...

69
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,810
Twenty-four hours, you'll be sitting
in a room with the Secretary of War.

70
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,684
If I could choose anyone else, I would,

71
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,570
but you're the only man who knows
implosion well enough to run the program.

72
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,483
Whatever messes you've made,
clean them up.

73
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,281
Can't have you tracking mud
onto the carpet of the Oval Office.

74
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,842
- I'll need Glen back as my number two.
- Dr. Babbit will be retiring from the project.

75
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,684
- Robert...
- He abused the power of my office.

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,491
Betrayed my trust. That was his choice.

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,609
Friends of Frank Winter don't have
a long shelf life on this hill, do they?

78
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,850
It's not the way I wanted it.

79
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,567
That makes two of us.

80
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,609
And, Frank, buy a comb.

81
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,403
Nice of you to drop in.

82
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,926
Should I wake your son or are you
just here to change your clothes?

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,331
Abby, please.

84
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,971
You can’t just hibernate in your office

85
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,163
or wherever you've spent
the last two nights.

86
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,767
- Akley's gone.
- Where?

87
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,889
He

88
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,163
put a gun in his mouth and...

89
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,281
Uh...

90
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,965
Reed Akley? My God.

91
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,330
It's my fault, Abby.

92
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,046
- What?
- I let him paint himself into a corner.

93
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,521
I should have walked into his office
two months ago.

94
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,570
Ma'am, we're gonna
have to borrow your husband.

95
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,090
Charlie. Excuse me. No.

96
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,611
Charlie. Charlie!

97
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,206
- It's gonna be fine, Abby.
- I need to speak to my husband, sir.

98
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,124
It's just a misunderstanding, Abby.

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,281
Joey!

100
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,850
You stay out of there.

101
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,530
Do not go in there!

102
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,690
I'll have to get a new suit.

103
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,489
We're really taking over?

104
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,281
Helen, you will run
the model and design group.

105
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,607
Meeks, the electric division.
Fritz, metallurgy.

106
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,889
I have a jacket, but I lost the pants
and it doesn't match my other trousers.

107
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,808
The end of the war

108
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,690
could be decided
by the five people in this group.

109
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,083
I know what my decision is.

110
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,804
Helen, where the hell is Crosley?

111
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,765
I don't know.

112
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,410
What about Charlie Isaacs?

113
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,924
There have been violations
of compartmentalization over at Thin Man.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,844
The Army is wiping
its leadership slate clean.

115
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,571
Dr. Isaacs.

116
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,286
Have a seat.

117
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,966
I've been sitting for the last eight months.

118
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,522
Quite a rookie season you've had.

119
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,887
Two months ago you were a towel boy.

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,440
Now you're Reed Akley's secret weapon.

121
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,409
Well, you and the rifle.

122
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,010
I'm sorry to hear the news.

123
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,567
So was I.

124
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,530
- Why did he do it?
- I have no clue.

125
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
Don't you?

126
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,764
I understand there was
a technical problem with Thin Man.

127
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,162
What kind of problem?

128
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,288
The kind that loses a war.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,161
Akley knew?

130
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,766
We're auditing Thin Man's files to find out.

131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,649
There are some irregularities.

132
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,006
- In Akley's files?
- In yours, actually.

133
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,807
The calculations
you've been assigning your staff,

134
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,851
it's almost as if they have
no bearing on Thin Man whatsoever.

135
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,204
They may look irregular to an untrained eye.

136
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,211
But your former colleague, Dr. Lancefield,
he's trained, isn't he?

137
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,965
- Tom Lancefield?
- He told me a fascinating story.

138
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,487
Said you'd hotwired the project
and were driving it over a cliff.

139
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
They found stolen files
under his floorboards.

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,726
He's probably fingered
Dwight Eisenhower by now.

141
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,121
The timing is curious, though, isn't it?

142
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,282
Reed Akley knights you.

143
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,684
Two months later, he's lying
on an autopsy table and so is his bomb,

144
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,808
and no one can make heads or tails

145
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,804
out of the paper trail
coming out of your office.

146
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,521
I was exploring alternate theories
out of an excess of caution.

147
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,242
Funny how to an untrained eye
caution looks like sabotage.

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,401
I was trying to save the project.

149
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,165
So you were aware
of a problem in Thin Man.

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,451
Let's talk about <i>Herr</i> Doctor Schlimmer.

151
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,128
Magpie, our man
inside Werner Heisenberg's lab.

152
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,771
Till somebody talked and he lost his head.

153
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,688
I'm sorry, what agency do you represent?

154
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,767
Justice, Treasury, War, Immigration.

155
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,284
When did you become aware
of the existence

156
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,641
of an allied spy in the Nazi's bomb project?

157
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,646
Hello?

158
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,805
Rose?

159
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,121
Rose?

160
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,800
Liza.

161
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,570
I thought you were the driver.

162
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,011
I couldn't spend another night here alone.

163
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,007
I'm taking Reed back to Chicago.

164
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,804
Rose, I'm so sorry.

165
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,361
Is there anything I can do?

166
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,125
You won. The town council.

167
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,002
It was a landslide.

168
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,924
None of that really matters.

169
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,727
They're wrong, you know?

170
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,450
Reed didn't...

171
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,971
Must have been an accident.

172
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,362
He had the world on a string.

173
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,689
He was almost ready to deliver the peace.

174
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,883
Liza...

175
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,486
Did Frank say anything to you

176
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,245
about Reed?

177
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,527
He said that Reed was the most

178
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,528
brilliant man he'd ever met.

179
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,602
Ma'am, the car's out front.

180
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,046
Take care of Frank.

181
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,803
He's on the throne now.

182
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,805
That's what really killed Reed, you know?

183
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,966
The Gadget.

184
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,328
I don't know how many
different ways I can say this.

185
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,042
Even if I had known

186
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,249
about an inside man
in Werner Heisenberg's staff...

187
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,084
- Which you didn't.
- Which I didn't.

188
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,164
I wouldn't have told a soul,
least of all the Nazis.

189
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,084
- I have family in Europe.
- In Minsk.

190
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,051
Not a particularly hospitable
corner of the map for Jews.

191
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,486
The thing about secrets,

192
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,605
once the genie's loose,
you can never put it back in the bottle.

193
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,081
First two people know,
then four, then eight, then 16.

194
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,084
It's a chain reaction.
You tell some Russian apparatchik,

195
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,801
somewhere in Berlin a physicist winds up
in a coffin with extra headroom.

196
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,281
But why would I talk to the Russians?

197
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,203
'Cause family is everything.

198
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,204
And you had family in Minsk.

199
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,921
Yuri, the husband,
he's still there and probably dead.

200
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,369
But Malka and the little girl,

201
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,441
they're in New York City.

202
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,285
And they're very eager to meet you,
their American benefactor.

203
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,846
They made it out?

204
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,287
The Soviets are a funny bunch.

205
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,805
They'll put a bullet through your head

206
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,281
and send your wife the bill
for the ammunition.

207
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,122
And yet they tend to keep their promises
tit for tat.

208
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,329
They got an inside line
to the Manhattan Project, and you,

209
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,529
you got your wife's family out of Europe.

210
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,090
Reed Akley got them out.

211
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,568
I...

212
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,129
I asked him if there was
anything he could do.

213
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,125
Well, let's bring him down here
so he can confirm your story.

214
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,006
I would never disclose military secrets.

215
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,206
Prove it.

216
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,206
No.

217
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,764
No, I can't. I can't prove it.

218
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,846
I can't prove
that I'm not the Tooth Fairy either.

219
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,490
You can't prove a negative.

220
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,490
You scientists do it all the time.

221
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,040
What do you call it? A null hypothesis?

222
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,807
If you can't prove your theory is valid,

223
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,724
you examine the opposite theory
and try to refute it.

224
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,928
Let's look at all the data, you and I.

225
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,721
Charles Isaacs is not a spy.
That's our null hypothesis.

226
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,486
If it were true, we'd expect him
to be loyal to his country.

227
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,766
That's why I'm here.

228
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,686
And yet, since the day you arrived,
you've questioned the ethics of a project

229
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,889
undertaken to protect
your country from annihilation.

230
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,566
- If Charles Isaacs were not a spy...
- Listen to me...

231
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,803
I would expect him to associate
with law-abiding citizens.

232
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,405
Your father is Oscar Isaacs,

233
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,244
former member
of the Socialist Party of America,

234
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,721
current resident
of the Missouri State Penitentiary.

235
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,564
My father and I haven't spoken in years.

236
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,849
You also are acquainted
with a Professor Richard Lavro

237
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,482
who traded his office at Harvard
for one in Stalin's atomic research division,

238
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,848
an association you misrepresented
the last time we met.

239
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,048
If Charles Isaacs is not a spy,

240
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,090
we'd expect him to be
forthcoming and cooperative,

241
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,846
and yet you have lied since the moment
you set foot into this room.

242
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,526
So I'm your unified theory.
Is that right, genius?

243
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,770
That every scientific failure,
every intelligence slip up,

244
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,286
I'm singlehandedly responsible?

245
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,601
I'm not so sure it was singlehanded.

246
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,126
The Perlmans are your wife's cousins?

247
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,850
What role did Abby play in all of this?

248
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,610
Paul.

249
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,842
Didn't think you had
the first idea where I lived.

250
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,287
I didn't. Helen told me.

251
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,160
So you told Akley we were
siphoning resources from Thin Man?

252
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,321
No, I didn't.

253
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,289
He just pieced it together on his own?

254
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,850
We weren't siphoning anything, Frank.

255
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,968
You and Isaacs were. And Helen.

256
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,567
I just gave Akley what you declined
to give me, the benefit of the truth.

257
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,803
It wasn't too much of a benefit, was it?

258
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,963
Don't you dare lay his death at my feet.

259
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,929
It doesn't matter now.

260
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,289
As of today, all the eyes within these fences
will be trained on our group.

261
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,169
You're afraid I'll talk, Frank.

262
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,685
That's what you're even doing here.

263
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,570
To make sure I don't tell
any inconvenient tales in the schoolyard.

264
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,529
We need to stand together.

265
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
My father was a blacksmith, Frank.

266
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,090
He spent his whole life hammering iron.

267
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,685
That was supposed to be my life, too.

268
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,445
And then one day,
I read about Lord Rutherford

269
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,528
changing nitrogen into oxygen.

270
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,003
And I thought, "There's a life for me.
I can turn my stock into a nobler metal."

271
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,845
But all those years at Oxford
surrounded by boy kings,

272
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,524
I never belonged.

273
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,045
Of course I didn't.

274
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,689
But in your group, Frank,

275
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,242
with the lads, with Helen...

276
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,886
You belong in the implosion group, Paul.

277
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,360
With us.

278
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,324
No.

279
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,641
I thought I did.

280
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,250
I was mistaken.

281
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,483
You get my silence.

282
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,644
But not me.

283
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,965
Abby.

284
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,245
What the hell are you...
You shouldn't be here.

285
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,163
They said you needed to see me.

286
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,682
They wouldn't even let me clean myself up.
What is going on?

287
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,681
He brought you in here to spook me.

288
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,565
He thinks I'll crack under the pressure.

289
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,886
Who?

290
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,247
Are you in over your head?
Should I call my father, because...

291
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,881
Abby, trust me, this is outside
of the Hat King's jurisdiction.

292
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,724
Yes, well, my father may be
in Massachusetts,

293
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,121
but he's on a first-name basis
with half of Washington, Charlie.

294
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,009
- Senator Weeks was at our wedding.
- You need to go home.

295
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,448
MPs are tearing the place apart.
It's a miracle the walls are still standing.

296
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,841
No. I mean home. Massachusetts.

297
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,369
Is this about the Lancefields?

298
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,523
Your family is safe.

299
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,327
What?

300
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,208
Your cousins in Europe.

301
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,566
The Perlmans.

302
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,644
They're dead, Charlie.

303
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,848
No, no.

304
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,723
They're in New York.

305
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,202
Probably bunked up in some fleabag hotel,

306
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,924
but they're fine.

307
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,529
Safer than we are.

308
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,210
Now, some men from the government
are asking questions.

309
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,521
- They...
- They think that you're a spy.

310
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,968
Well, that I traded military secrets.

311
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,644
But you didn't.

312
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,202
No, I didn't. Of course not.

313
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,161
Whatever they think you did,
Frank Winter made you do it.

314
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,881
- You tell them that.
- Abby, you'd be implicated, too.

315
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,091
Frank knows.

316
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,286
He knows that you helped me make
an unmonitored call to Site X.

317
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,445
He knows that you put the papers
in Lancefields apartment. He knows.

318
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,048
You can have the divorce.

319
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,563
I won't fight it.

320
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,961
You and Joey need to get
as far away from this place...

321
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,883
- Charlie, I...
- ...as you can.

322
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,443
Abby...

323
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,726
Mmm.

324
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,928
I am so sorry.

325
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,128
You know, maybe if we never came here...

326
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,362
Maybe if we stayed in Brookline,
things would be different.

327
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,284
- Hey. Abby. Abby. Come on...
- Charlie. Charlie.

328
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,404
Please don't take him. Please don't hurt him!

329
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,767
- It's gonna be fine.
- No.

330
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,888
Please don't hurt him.

331
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,926
Glen.

332
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,526
Figured you'd be trying to teach
basic calculus

333
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,728
to the group formerly known as Thin Man.

334
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,763
God knows how I'll do that without you.

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,285
Oh, you'll manage.

336
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,008
I doubt I'm gonna make it up to the house
before I go.

337
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,491
They want me off the Hill.

338
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,769
But, uh, tell my goddaughter

339
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,810
she'll have the rest of her life
for drinking and smoking cigarettes.

340
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,209
I imagine the lions will be happy
to have their chairman back.

341
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,770
Emeritus.

342
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,888
Of practically everything these days.

343
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,765
Anyway, while we've been
playing in the sandbox,

344
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,447
Columbia has fallen in love
with experimental physics.

345
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,807
Then where? Chicago? Yale?

346
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,291
Moscow?

347
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,810
I don't know.

348
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,884
I hear a lot of old bachelors
are heading west.

349
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,048
You deserve to be happy.

350
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,886
Yeah.

351
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,890
Glen, if there's anything I could do...

352
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,247
Twenty years ago,
I thought I was a pretty good physicist,

353
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,641
then you walked into my office.

354
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,800
Goddamn college sophomore.

355
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,531
I didn't know what was missing
from my work until I saw it in yours.

356
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,167
This project needs you
a lot more than it needs me.

357
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,571
I need you.

358
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,330
Honestly, I'm relieved.

359
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,730
I suppose somebody has to build it,

360
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,088
but I'm glad it's not gonna be
on my tombstone.

361
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,570
- I'll call you as soon as it's over.
- Don't

362
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,444
Glen, I wish there was
something that I could do...

363
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,046
Stop trying to have it both ways, Frank.

364
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,282
It doesn't matter if you're a good man.

365
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,929
Maybe a good man
couldn't have made implosion work.

366
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,090
All that matters is that
you are the man to end this war.

367
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,886
Let God do the accounting when it's over.

368
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,526
Yeah.

369
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,487
Oh...

370
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,201
Huh.

371
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,166
Yesterday, nobody on this hill
even knew who we were.

372
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,720
Anyway, I do support Jeannie's work,

373
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,247
I just don't think it's right for the new head
of the plutonium division to be unmarried.

374
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,288
We're all gonna get tiny, little pay bumps

375
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,488
and I'm sure I'll have enough
for a ring in a month or so.

376
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,881
- Hey, mazel tov.
- Watch out.

377
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,440
The ladies are gonna be beating
a path to your door in no time.

378
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,760
Mr. Meeks?

379
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,802
You mean Division Head Meeks?

380
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,168
This guy's rising faster than rail road stock,
darling.

381
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,130
There was a call at the switchboard.
I'm sorry.

382
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,681
Wow.

383
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,410
This is a step up.

384
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,884
You know, I've learned not to grow
too attached to offices one way or the other.

385
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,165
Well, I'm just looking forward
to having a door.

386
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,641
Wait till people start knocking on it.

387
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,210
My mother died yesterday.

388
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,200
Well, it was after midnight,
so maybe it was today.

389
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,487
The nurses at Bangor General
didn't know which.

390
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,608
Jesus, Jim. I'm sorry.

391
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,125
Was it unexpected?

392
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,042
Well, she made it into her 50s with polio,
so that's something, right?

393
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,241
Well, your new office will be
waiting for you when you get back.

394
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,004
Well, I can't leave now.

395
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,481
Not with everything that's going on.

396
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,485
Anyway, the Army would never
grant me a pass on such short notice.

397
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,403
You'll have one by sunset.

398
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,006
Turns out this office comes
with a few privileges.

399
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,969
Thanks, Frank.

400
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,242
I won't be gone long. I swear.

401
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,921
Is your mother still alive, Frank?

402
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,325
I don't know.

403
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,568
- She told me everything.
- Where's Abby?

404
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,291
Women are always quick
to protect their children.

405
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
Husbands tend not to get
the same treatment.

406
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,729
Your wife is sitting in the next room.

407
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,929
She told me
everything you've done and why.

408
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,286
That's bullshit.

409
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,168
No one can blame a man

410
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,005
for trying to save his wife's family
from the Nazis

411
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,128
and his marriage all in one fell swoop.

412
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,645
Abby would not have told you anything.

413
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,886
Betrayal gets easier and easier and easier.

414
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,284
After all, she has been betraying you
for months with your neighbor.

415
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,731
Making love in Lancefields bed.

416
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,484
In your bed.

417
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,923
Well, now I know you're lying.

418
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,287
She hated Lancefield.
She wouldn't go anywhere near him.

419
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,567
Yes, well, of course you're right.

420
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,201
But you see, that foreign wife of his,

421
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,442
she had an interesting story, too.

422
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,849
One about romancing your wife
while you were at work.

423
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,927
Your wife is a complicated woman,
Dr. Isaacs.

424
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,527
But as soon as she realized
that she might very well lose her son,

425
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
getting her to admit
what you've done was simple.

426
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,008
I don't believe you.

427
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,565
But you do.

428
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,367
You're thinking back to every bridge game,

429
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,526
every martini.

430
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,564
Every time your wife...

431
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,804
Every time your wife told you
she was going over there

432
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,645
to borrow another cup of flour
from that woman.

433
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,124
So you might as well start admitting
what I already know fact by fact!

434
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,890
We're done here, asshole.

435
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,044
You know, our businesses
are not so different.

436
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,681
A secret trapped inside a man
is just like the energy trapped in an atom.

437
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,841
It wants to be released.

438
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,526
Of course, I don't nearly
have the resources you do.

439
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,447
Myself, I've only had
a few dedicated patriots, but they...

440
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,686
They have developed
some very advanced techniques

441
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,762
to convince a man to talk.

442
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,122
What, you're gonna torture me?

443
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,002
The Geneva Convention of 1929...

444
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,290
Where you're going, people don't
concern themselves with convention.

445
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,209
<i>It is feared that the other
members of the crew have been drowned.</i>

446
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,604
<i>With the view of the established presence
of German submarines in this vicinity,</i>

447
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,806
<i>there can be no reasonable doubt
as to the identity of the flag...</i>

448
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,325
- Hi. You must be Abby.
- Yes.

449
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,326
Is your husband here?

450
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,770
- I'm Helen Prins. I work with him.
- I know who you are.

451
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,161
Did Dr. Isaacs stay home today?

452
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,130
- We've been looking for him in the tech area.
- We?

453
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,690
It's urgent.

454
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,524
Business or pleasure?

455
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,403
I'm sorry, sweetie,
all the doors are locked. I'm coming.

456
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,724
Hello, my life! Come here.

457
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,648
How high did you
get on the swings this time?

458
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,250
- I get...
- So high.

459
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,164
- Could you excuse us just for a minute?
- I get super high.

460
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,891
So high! You run on in there.
I cleaned your room up.

461
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,123
I get super high on the swings.

462
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,131
I think you should leave.

463
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,964
I really need to see him.

464
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,485
Well, you're a little late.

465
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,289
MPs came for Charlie this morning.

466
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,206
Why?

467
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,207
Because they think
that a Jew from East St. Louis

468
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,806
is passing military secrets
to people who want to exterminate us.

469
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,530
And you are not the only person on this hill

470
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,570
who's trying to take
my husband away from his family.

471
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,684
Which book did you pick?

472
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,763
That looks like a good one.

473
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,285
Frank!

474
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,763
You know, Akley derived a new space-time
geometry when he was still in college?

475
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,046
It's Charlie.

476
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,763
You heard me earlier.

477
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,809
There is no place for him here.

478
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,848
They're shipping him off the Hill.

479
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,282
He knew the risks.

480
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,523
He came to me with eyes wide open.
What do you want, Helen?

481
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,206
Do you want all three of us to go down
for breaking compartmentalization?

482
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,363
You don't understand.
They think he's a traitor.

483
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,611
Never thought I'd say it,
but I'm gonna miss this shithole.

484
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,727
You're gonna miss it, too. Just watch.

485
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,648
You'll have an army of Ph.D.'s
at your beck and call,

486
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,564
a desk the size of a Studebaker.

487
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,802
You'll wish you were
back in this closet with six guys

488
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,884
and a theory written on
the back of an envelope.

489
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,042
You don't owe me anything, Frank.

490
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,370
You didn't force me to take those papers.

491
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,569
If you hadn't turned me over,
the project would be dead in the water.

492
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,808
Chances are the Army
would have caught up with me anyway

493
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,247
and I'd be sitting in the same place.

494
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,402
You don't owe Isaacs anything either.

495
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,767
You know how many American soldiers
were killed in action this month?

496
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,768
Four thousand three hundred
and forty three.

497
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,684
Nearly four times as many
as the same month last year.

498
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,011
Add another 503 who died later
from injuries sustained on the battlefield,

499
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,004
plus 61 missing and reported dead.

500
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,606
Friendly fire, accidents, disease...

501
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,530
That's another 1,817.

502
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,288
Altogether, that's what? 6,724 lives.

503
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,203
Add the Brits, the number doubles.

504
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,931
Throw in the Soviets, they're overachievers.

505
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,203
190,254.

506
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,806
Germans, 41,200.

507
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,288
Japan, Australia, Poland, France.

508
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,526
Conservatively, let's say
10 million deaths in a year.

509
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,728
833,000 a month.

510
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,724
27,700 a day.

511
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,485
11,057 an hour.

512
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,484
What do you want me to do?

513
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,643
Exactly.

514
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,324
What's one more?

515
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,366
I love you.

516
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,045
I love you, too.

517
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,046
What's wrong?

518
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,449
We're building an atomic bomb.

519
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,325
It'll set off a chain reaction
that will explode with the power

520
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,483
of 20,000 tons of TNT.

521
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,322
Twenty thousand tons?

522
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,004
Powerful enough to wipe cities off the map.

523
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,722
Cities full of people.

524
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,406
Children.

525
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,526
No, the Army will detonate it
someplace where it can't hurt anyone.

526
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,928
And when the Axis sees
what we're capable of,

527
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,207
they'll have no choice.

528
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,725
They will have to surrender.

529
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,009
And then there will never be another war.

530
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,728
That's what we're doing
behind those fences.

531
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,168
We're writing the prologue to a new era.

532
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,244
The history of peace.

533
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,405
You see that?

534
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,291
Bring it around.

535
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

536
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,923
- Hold it.
- We need ID from every passenger.

537
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,924
You need ID from Henry Stimson?

538
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,810
- Another egghead?
- The Secretary of War.

539
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,606
Okay, let's go.

540
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,801
Let them through. Let's go.

541
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,041
Clear!

542
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,842
Dr. Oppenheimer.

543
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,406
Mr. Fisher.

544
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,131
I'd say you spoiled my appetite,
but Reed Akley beat you to it.

545
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,204
There's a personnel issue
we need to discuss.

546
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,486
Right now.

547
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,091
Get up.

548
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,763
<i>When the Axis sees
what we're capable of,</i>

549
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,161
<i>they'll have no choice.</i>

550
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,730
<i>They will have to surrender.</i>

551
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,648
<i>And then there will never be another war.</i>

552
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,882
<i>That's what we're doing
behind those fences.</i>

553
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,361
<i>We're writing the prologue to a new era.</i>

554
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,402
<i>The history of peace.</i>

555
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,165
Mr. Secretary.

556
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,770
Dr. Oppenheimer.

557
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,566
The last time anybody
kept me waiting this long,

558
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,563
there was a coup d'état.

559
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,165
And not a bloodless one.

560
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,926
My apologies.

561
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,527
We had to dot a few T's and cross a few I's.

562
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,601
Hmm.

563
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,008
- How was your flight?
- It didn't crash.

564
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,845
Well, to small mercies.

565
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,524
I wish it had.

566
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,204
I wouldn't have to tell Roosevelt

567
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,080
that he mortgaged the White House
for a handful of magic beans.

568
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,810
I grant you this is a disappointment.

569
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,851
You sold the President of the United States

570
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,763
a Buck Rogers fantasy.

571
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,241
You shook his hand and told him

572
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,331
the design was entrusted to one
of the best minds in the country.

573
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,610
And now that mind is getting sponged off
the dashboard of a Chrysler.

574
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,842
Secretary Stimson, if I may...

575
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,488
There is a backup plan.

576
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,248
We kept a second design team alive

577
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,971
- for circumstances just like these!
- The implosion group?

578
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,610
That's your goddamn panacea?

579
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,444
You told me yourself it's science fiction.

580
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,010
Not anymore.

581
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,008
The director of the implosion group
is one of the brightest lights on this hill.

582
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,651
He solved the physics
almost singlehandedly.

583
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,009
I'll let him walk you
through the details himself.

584
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,405
This is Dr. Charles Isaacs.

585
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,528
What happened to Frank Winter?

586
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,488
<i>When the Axis sees
what we're capable of,</i>

587
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,244
<i>they'll have no choice.</i>

588
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,529
<i>They will have to surrender.</i>

589
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,683
<i>And then there will never be another war.</i>

590
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,931
<i>That's what we're doing
behind those fences.</i>

591
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,321
<i>We're writing the prologue to a new era.</i>

592
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,129
The history of peace.

593
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,930
I've made mistakes.

594
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,330
I've done things I'm not proud of,

595
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,643
but I swear I did all of it
with you and Callie in mind.

596
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,324
A few months ago,

597
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,768
a physicist from another design group
came to me

598
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,850
and he told me that his model
wasn't going to work.

599
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,443
I revealed information
that I'd been sworn to keep secret,

600
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,602
that we had a spy inside
the German atomic project

601
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,967
and that Werner Heisenberg
was months ahead of us.

602
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,084
<i>I knew the Army and the White House
would never right the ship on their own,</i>

603
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,482
so Reed Akley and I

604
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,483
engaged in a secret conspiracy

605
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,690
to co-op the resources
of his group for implosion.

606
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,645
<i>Akley promoted Charlie Isaacs
to cover our tracks.</i>

607
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,808
<i>Set him up in case we ever got caught.</i>

608
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,486
<i>The irony is, the only way we were
able to crack implosion</i>

609
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,604
<i>is by stealing the theory
from a paper he wrote.</i>

610
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,842
<i>Now that Akley's dead,
G-2s got that poor kid locked up.</i>

611
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,729
<i>They think he is a spy,</i>

612
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,881
<i>but he had no idea.</i>

613
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,529
There's nothing I can do but stay the course

614
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,763
for the good of the project,
for the sake of the future.

615
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,251
We sacrifice the few to save the many.

616
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,725
No, you gotta write down what he tells you.
He's the doctor.

617
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,848
Well, that's...

618
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,400
That's what happens
if you don't keep it elevated.

619
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,041
Yeah. Listen, listen. I gotta... I have to go,

620
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,169
but I will call you again soon, okay?

621
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,321
Yeah. I love you, too, Mom.

622
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,971
Excuse me.

623
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,002
And differences of opinion...
Differences of opinion...

624
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,761
As Charles Darwin so ably said...

625
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,842
Gone but not forgotten.

626
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,930
They said I wouldn't have to meet in person.

627
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,441
Only under extraordinary conditions.

628
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,123
- Things have changed.
- They're changing everywhere.

629
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,361
Implosion is taking center stage.

630
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:12,100

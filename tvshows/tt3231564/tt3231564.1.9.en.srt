Charlie, since the day
you arrived in this desert,

you've been rejecting my canteen.

25

Now I brought you to a

I've never taken it personally.

What else do I need to know?

39
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,669
We need to thoroughly rattle-test all
our work down to the last data point.

sloppy calculations come
across my desk recently.

45

If Thin Man were assembled
based on faulty numbers,

46

physics get in our way before.

51

We checked the Brit's math a hundred times.

52

It says that the only

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,041
Ladies, I'm gonna leave
you with Mrs. Winter.

163
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,343
A wonderful new addition to our team.

164
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:54,179
She'll distribute everything you need.

165
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:55,614
When in doubt, just remember,

166
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:58,485
mothers have been doing this for millennia.

167
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,156
If cavewomen could do it, you can, too.

168
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:08,634
So, um... compliments of the hospital.

169
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,137
Please, help yourselves.

- Hi.
- Hi.

175
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:53,114
Javier wanted to talk to you.

176
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,650
Javier, who is he?

177
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:57,686
Paloma's cousin.

178
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,993
He's been waiting an hour.

179

(Speaking Spanish)

180
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,178
He says, "It's been hard at the pueblo."

<i>(Javier speaking Spanish)</i>

182
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:27,285

<i>(Javier speaking Spanish)</i>

184

<i>- (Javier speaks Spanish)
-  "Talents."</i>

186

187

<i>(Javier speaking Spanish)</i>

188

<i>Paloma told him you're a generous man.</i>

189
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:55,434

(Speaks Spanish)

191
00:11:58,678 --> 00:11:59,791
"A truck."

<i>- A what?
-  He wants a pickup truck.</i>

193
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:08,898
A pickup truck?

194
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:11,111
(Speaks Spanish)

195
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:14,687
<i>Callie: I think he needs it by Friday.</i>

196

Well...

197
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:21,462
I'll see what we have lying around.

198
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:30,402
<i>-  Adios.

Man: Have you ever inflicted
physical harm on others?

00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,091
No. Jesus.

201
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:52,720
Have you ever inflicted
physical harm on yourself?

202
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,087
Well, I drink too much.

203
00:12:56,122 --> 00:13:00,024
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

204
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:02,930
Yes. Joe Stalin and I are pen pals.

205
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,365
No, I'm not a Communist.

206
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,977
Do you believe in God?

207
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,201
I met him. His name's Niels Bohr.

208
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:14,137
This is not a vaudeville routine.

209
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,038
I was asked these questions before

210
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:18,073
and my answers were the same as now.

211
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,710
If you'd like, I could have a smoke

212
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,178
and you could copy my old form.

213
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:23,445
Have you in the past or do you plan now

214
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:26,181
to pass intelligence to the
government of occupied Holland?

215
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:27,334
Nope.

216
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,292
Have you in the past or do you plan now

217
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:32,719
to pass intelligence between
divisions of this installation?

218
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,589
No.

219

<i>Announcer: Your attention, please.</i>

224
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:05,993
Extra security was supposed to
be internal for our purposes.

225
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,966
Oh, it's internal, all
right. Checking every orifice.

They wanna go to work for Helen?

231
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,726
Maybe we all have to consider options.

232
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,297
We have thrown everything we know
at it and a few things we don't.

233
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:35,022
Density maximization, activated charcoal.

234
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:37,920
None of it can overcome
the shock wave problem.

235
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:40,704
Oppenheimer wanted to shut
us down before the Brits.

236
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:42,741
Now it's just a matter of when.

237
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,011
If we have to join forces with Akley...

238
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:49,947
that's what we'll do.

We're doing just fine without a maid.

242
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,610
They cost too much anyway.

243
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,511
A pickup costs a lot more.

244
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:15,565
And yet you're considering that.

245
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,535
You know, this isn't
your problem, young lady.

246
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,137
It's not Mom's problem either?

247

You didn't see how upset she
got at that Indian funeral.

248

It was just too much like it used to be.

249

Let's let her enjoy the new job, okay?

250
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,763
Okay.

251
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,014
Why don't we lock our doors, by the way?

MPs are sweeping my office,
they're frisking everyone.

261
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:24,140
- We've created a monster.
- A useful monster.

262
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,978
You remember, you knocked on my door.

263
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,171
And now 50 of my guys are
working on your problem.

264
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,217
Our problem.

265
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:32,351
I'm in a henhouse full of
foxes who think they're hens.

266
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,420
Have you told them you had to
recheck all the Thin Man math?

267
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:35,533
- Yeah.
- Then

268
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,023
I don't understand, what's the issue?

269
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,856
These are some of the
smartest guys in the world.

270
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,557
How long do you think it'll take for them

271
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:42,159
to realize they're working on implosion?

272
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,160
The shock wave calculations
are broken up into tiny parts.

273
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,347
If the puzzle pieces are small enough,

274
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,639
there is no way one guy
can see the big picture.

275
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:51,665
Not one of your guys anyway.

276
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:55,209
I want you to requisition 12 sets
of detonators and 100 pounds of TNT.

277
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,916
No, I get you the math, you worry
about experiments. That's the deal.

278
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:59,145
Well, there's a new deal.

279
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,638
Akley gave you full authority
to sign for resources.

280
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,696
Thin Man is finished
with explosives testing.

281
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,754
I go asking for detonators and TNT,

282
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:08,114
the army will be on my
doorstep an hour later.

283
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,755
My source won't give us any.

284
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,906
This was your idea, figure it out.

285
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:13,929
I need you to leave now.

286
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:16,355
Don't you come back to this house again.

287

288
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:44,793
You were right, I lied.

289
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:47,296
If you know who I am, then you
know I've spent the last year

290
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,432
working on implosion.

291
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,335
I'm not ready to give up on it.

292
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:55,204
No matter what the army
or anyone else says.

293
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:58,473
I respect that.

294
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:00,774
I need detonators. I need TNT.

295
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,875
Explosives belongs to your army.

296
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,776
Yeah, but you're in
charge of doling them out.

297
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,460
Should I go to the colonel and tell
him you're going behind his back, huh?

298
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:12,473
You won't do that.

299
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:14,917
You don't know me.

300
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:17,486
I know you worked at the Navy
Ordnance Bureau last year.

301
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,626
- (Scoffs)
- I made some calls this morning.

302
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,627
- Asked an old friend there about you.
- Who?

303
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,028
Albert Einstein.

304
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,889
He told me you were a good scientist.

305
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,433
He also told me you could be trusted.

306
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:35,169
Listen, the only risk I would like to take

307
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:37,339
is to work with my explosives.

308
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:39,889
Understand?

309
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,165
Fair enough.

310
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,086
For your time.

311
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,918
I don't take bribes.

312
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,688
And Einstein was wrong.

313
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:57,144
I'm not a scientist, I'm an engineer.

314
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,018
All right, stay where
Mommy can see you, Joey.

315
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,888
To him, this is completely normal, hmm?

316
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:21,432
Then again, who am I to say what is normal?

317

You Americans.

00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:58,066
Always looking for explanations.

323
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,564
Or penance.

324
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:03,877
What do you think happened?

325
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,680
You fell asleep.

326
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,214
(Giggles)

327
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:09,764
Yes, but before I fell asleep.

328
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:14,395
You know, the first time I made
love was a day just like this.

329
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,164
Spring in winter.

330
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,365
His name was Philippe.

331
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,400
He had this belt...

332
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:26,302
leather, all beat up.

333
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,835
When he moved to London for university,

334
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:32,804
I made him give the belt to me.

335
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,807
Still have it.

336
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:38,510
Every now and then, I take it out.

337
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,378
Sometimes I even...

338
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,847
bite it and taste it.

339
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:50,259
Suddenly, I'm right back there.

340
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,763
What if your husband found it?

341
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:00,767
<i>Secrets are what keep us alive, chérie.</i>

342
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:06,745
Without them, we'd just be normal.

343

Well, come right in.

345
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:26,629
If I'm going to be your number
two, you better get used to it.

346
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:28,635
Are you ready to start working?

347
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:31,707
You mean keep working
on implosion for Frank?

348
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:38,199
Keep your voice down.

349
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:44,793
- He told you?
- He didn't have to. I'm a clever girl.

350

Thin Man has the
resources, but it's flawed.

351
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:49,131
Implosion's the right model,
but we have no manpower.

352
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:50,843
What you guys can do in
a day will take us 10.

353
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,035
I had to keep you in the dark.

354
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:53,903
- Or I wouldn't pass the polygraph.
- Right.

355
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,279
Right.

356
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,999
So now I'm complicit in your crime.

357
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,322
We're all sticking our necks
out here. We don't have a choice.

358
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:01,147
I always have a choice.

359
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:05,087
You can't tell anyone about this.

360
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,671
By the way, I'm screwing Paul Crosley.

361

about shock waves anyway.

365

We need to have some fun, boys.

366

Welcome to the wingding, gentlemen.

- Psychotropic mushrooms.

372

Got 'em at the WAC dorm.

373
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:58,019
One of Jeannie's clients paid with these.

379

You twiddle thumbs, you diddle yourself.

We were looking at absorption rates.

From here all the way up to the mountains.

564

But his oldest son, he
liked books, not cows.

565
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:31,303
So he took off for college,
and when the old man died,

566
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:33,176
the kid sells it.

567
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:35,743
You know how much he got?

568
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:40,928
$300 for all this. Yeah.

Cattle rancher stole it
from the Indians anyway.

00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,512
Well, if he hadn't,

572

the two of us would never have met.

You know what I mean.

591

about he sees what you're doing

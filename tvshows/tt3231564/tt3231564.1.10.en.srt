1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,165
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,721
What did I do?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,643
Two more for me and the spy killer.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,006
What do you want from me?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,650
<i>As we approach the finish line,</i>

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,768
I will be stepping back
from day-to-day operations.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,002
You will report to Charlie Isaacs.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,487
Are you ready to start working?

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,767
You mean keep working
on implosion with Frank?

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,126
<i>Tom... He touched me.</i>

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,043
- You have to do something.
- Men will be men.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,009
Was it normal?
What happened between us.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,161
You fell asleep.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>If you know who I am,
you know I've spent the last year</i>

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,487
<i>working on implosion.</i>

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,846
I need detonators.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,763
You don't know me.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,968
- We've created a monster.
- A useful monster.

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,530
You remember, you knocked on my door.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,648
And now, 50 of my guys
are working on your problem.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,960
Our problem.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:15,960
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,928
You want me to wait? Ah...

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,970
I think you ain't gonna be staying here long.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,089
- No, thank you.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,083
<i>All personnel
must stop at the main gate checkpoint</i>

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,446
<i>for identification and passes</i>

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,922
<i>whenever leaving from
or arriving to Los Alamos.</i>

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,087
- Can I help you?
- Is this PO Box 1663?

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,529
- You got a pass?
- No, but I got a letter from this postmark.

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,483
Ma'am, I recommend you get back in the cab.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,967
Else you're looking at 40 miles
of hard road back to town.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,486
My husband lived here. He died here, too.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,290
I'm sorry. No one gets in
without a preauthorized pass.

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,801
His name was Sidney Liao.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,246
I don't know anything about that.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,322
I'm not leaving until someone explains
how my husband died

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,289
in the middle of a desert
solving physics equations.

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,442
Ma'am, you have my condolences, but...

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,047
No, turn me away,
and I'm sure I can find a reporter who won't.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,163
Tell them I need to speak to Frank Winter.

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,764
Colonel Cox's office.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,085
Oh, right away.

44
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,289
You know what Thomas Edison
used to do when he hit a brick wall?

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,044
He'd take naps.

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,801
We didn't hit a brick wall.
We hit the Grand Coulee Dam.

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,563
Good morning.

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,049
Dr. Glen Babbit, Mr. James Meeks,

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,727
may I present to you Grover and Earl, is it?

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,811
- What the hell was that?
- Apparently, we're taking in refugees.

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,963
The maintenance staff has opened
a franchise in our back room.

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,247
We're working in the broom closet now?

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,561
Well, at least one department's adding staff.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,850
What happened to compartmentalization?

55
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,730
Yeah. No, we are meant
to speak in hushed tones

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,484
when the janitors are present.

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,006
Apparently, our particular secrets
no longer warrant safekeeping.

58
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,287
Frank's gonna tear them limb from limb.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,567
On the bright side,
we now have a mop on the premises.

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,244
Well, you think Hitler's
got Werner Heisenberg

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,129
bunking up with a janitor?

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,931
Say what you like about the Third Reich,
they do respect hierarchy.

63
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,881
- Frank.
- We've got houseguests.

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,247
- Oh. So I heard.
- And you're not upset?

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,931
Would it make any difference if I were?

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,889
Anyway, you watch.

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,928
I'm gonna straighten out
this shockwave problem,

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,922
and the custodians will move
into Akley's office, or we will.

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,441
You're leaving already?

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,365
- Ah...
- We hardly knew you.

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,647
I have a meeting across town.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,288
How long has it been
since your husband did that? Hmm?

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,285
What time is it?
If I'm late again, the girl's gonna quit.

74
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,841
You don't have to wear
so much makeup, you know?

75
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,530
You're <i>beaucoup plus belle</i> without it.

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,687
My mother always said,

77
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,684
"A woman should never leave the house
without lipstick unless it's in a coffin."

78
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,411
Come to dinner tonight.
I'm cooking, Coq au vin.

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,522
Will, um... Will Tom be there?

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,281
<i>Chérie</i>, love affairs are a reward
for putting up with our husbands.

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,363
All the more fun to do it
right in front of them.

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,488
We're not having an affair.

83
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,609
You don't have to feel guilty
for taking pleasure in life.

84
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,128
Well, it wasn't much of a pleasure
last time I had dinner at your house.

85
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,931
Your husband put his hands all over me.

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,209
What?

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,402
Practically assaulted me.

88
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,565
Why didn't you tell me?

89
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,085
I will kill him.

90
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,131
I will poison his dinner.

91
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,850
If I wanted to make a production out of it,
I would have told Charlie.

92
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,129
You don't want to know
what he would have done.

93
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,210
Right away, Doctor.

94
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,448
- In the utility room.
- Right behind you.

95
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,284
- What happened?
- There's been a contamination.

96
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,600
- A contamination?
- Can you lend a hand?

97
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,047
- Of course. What...
- Don't draw any blood.

98
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,766
Does this hurt?

99
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,730
Not a bit. It never does.

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,089
Has this happened before?

101
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,282
We need to get these clothes bagged
and out of here.

102
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,362
Yes, Doctor.

103
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,562
Put some gloves on first.

104
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,168
Morning. I brought the kid.

105
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,601
Come on.

106
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,523
My mother told me unwelcomed guests
should never show up empty-handed.

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,171
Thought you could use some help
with the contact dermatitis.

108
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,288
Yeah, number one hazard,

109
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,362
working with TNT.

110
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,565
Number one?

111
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,009
- So are we good for today?
- Not good.

112
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,607
But I'll accept your presents.

113
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,603
The war must be won.

114
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,128
We take 32 exploding bridgewire detonators.
We activate them simultaneously.

115
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,289
So you want to know
how to synchronize detonators.

116
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,408
Believe it or not, that's the easy part.

117
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,361
What we have to do is redirect
the shockwaves from those charges

118
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,445
into one perfectly symmetrical implosion.

119
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,522
Thirty British scientists
couldn't do it in a year.

120
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,204
They abandoned their implosion project.

121
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,001
The British are quitters.
Just look at your Revolutionary War.

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,565
Drop on three, two, one.

123
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,246
- See?
- What?

124
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,209
Our detonation waves are convex.

125
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,409
They need to be concave
to make implosion work.

126
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,042
You want all these tiny explosions
to turn themselves inside out?

127
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,360
- That's the goal?
- Yes.

128
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,090
Fish swim. Birds fly. Cows shit. All right?

129
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,686
They're each true to its nature.

130
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,321
An explosion goes, "Boom!"
The force of energy expands.

131
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,323
Right. So how do we reverse it?

132
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,084
- That's simple.
- Yeah?

133
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,401
Yeah. You can't.

134
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,490
Judge in his chambers?

135
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,847
- I have no idea where he is.
- Huh.

136
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,081
Well, I'm sure you'll be the first to know.

137
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,561
Could you pass that along, please?

138
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,371
- What is it?
- It's a parting gift from the little Dutch girl.

139
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,680
I just bumped into her in the yard.

140
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,001
You bumped into Helen, did you?

141
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,125
It's Frank's late-night toils.

142
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,487
Someone found them in the chem lab
and gave them to her.

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,131
Thought she was still with us.

144
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,726
Did you help Frank
with these calculations?

145
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,366
I had rehearsal. We open Friday night.

146
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,605
Has Fritz been doing
detonation specs for Frank?

147
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,327
Fritz has been waylaid
in metallurgy the last three days.

148
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,722
Remind me which classic
of the stage you're butchering this time.

149
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,771
Uh, Our Town.
I'm playing the William Holden role.

150
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,649
I thought you were just the understudy.

151
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,328
Everyone in the theater knows
the whole show rests on the understudy.

152
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,327
I apologize for the accommodations.

153
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,247
We're not really set up to entertain visitors.

154
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,201
You're not what I pictured.

155
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,321
Well...

156
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,607
He told me all about you.

157
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,365
- Who did?
- Sid.

158
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,201
He never mentioned a beard.

159
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,328
Anyway, I can't believe this is
what it took for us to meet, Dr. Winter.

160
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,844
What else did Sid tell you?

161
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,404
He talked about the others,
Jim, and Fritz, Glen, Helen.

162
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,280
Did he ever mention  what
he was doing in the state of New Mexico?

163
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,806
I didn't even know he was in New Mexico.

164
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,090
Did he ever give you any messages
to pass along to associates or to friends?

165
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,731
Just our daughter.

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,326
After your husband's death,

167
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,324
did you receive any unusual visitors
or packages in the mail?

168
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,442
You're not Frank Winter, are you?

169
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,847
There's no one here by that name.

170
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,010
Your parents are watching your little girl?

171
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,846
Yes.

172
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,007
Well, I imagine
Gracie misses her mother very much.

173
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,650
Mrs. Liao,
you traveled a great distance to be here.

174
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,123
Your train leaves tomorrow,
all expenses paid.

175
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,449
When you get home to Oakland,
you will forget all about the past,

176
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,763
and you will focus
on your daughter's future instead.

177
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,762
I'm not going anywhere
until I know what happened to my husband.

178
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,965
And if you were to learn
that he died in a tragic car accident?

179
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,451
Did he?

180
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,171
Or that he sacrificed his life
on behalf of his country?

181
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,371
I need to see his death certificate
and any formal report from the Army.

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,480
You're confused, Mrs. Liao.

183
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,927
You think you want the facts,
but that's not why you're here.

184
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,401
You want a bedtime story
to bring home to your little girl.

185
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,448
- You want a fairy tale.
- Excuse me?

186
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,729
I spent a lot of time in China.
You're a tenacious people.

187
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,521
I could give you the brush-off,
but you'd just keep coming back.

188
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,887
This is your husband's file.

189
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,644
It was sealed by order of the War Department.

190
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,890
Your husband was not a hero. He was a spy.

191
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,410
He was shot dead while in the process
of stealing government secrets.

192
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,449
That's not possible.

193
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,525
You have a long trip
ahead of you tomorrow, Mrs. Liao.

194
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,170
Get some rest.

195
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,608
I'm sorry for your loss.

196
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,405
What about
a change in temperature?

197
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,010
Could that redirect the blast?

198
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,890
- Wave refraction might...
- Only the direction, not the speed.

199
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,008
Well, maybe we use
an anisotropic media.

200
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,042
We have to invert the blast, not just bend it.

201
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,009
Please don't.

202
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,727
Powdermen, we work with explosives.
We chew.

203
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,450
You as well?

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,525
Sure.

205
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,887
Good. Come on, Frank.

206
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,046
So...

207
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,041
Oh!

208
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,571
Christ.

209
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,689
Is it supposed to burn like that? It hurts.

210
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,687
So the two of you are friends? How?

211
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,091
What do you mean?

212
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,562
Well, he's a man. You're more like a boy.

213
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,764
Thanks.

214
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,446
He's a dinosaur. I'm a plagiarist.

215
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,330
I'm not sure friendship
was ever written in our cards.

216
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,767
Uh-huh.

217
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,083
He lifted one idea, but his paper was solid.

218
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,885
You think this one is smart?

219
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,291
For a boy.

220
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,681
Uh-huh.

221
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,760
Well, I'm done for the day.
You've wasted enough of my time.

222
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,410
We don't need your time, Lazar.
We need your workspace.

223
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,448
Try back tomorrow.

224
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,528
What are you doing?

225
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,728
Your belt is pinching me.

226
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,087
Yeah, we should stop.

227
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,766
- Why?
- Because it's wrong.

228
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,571
"Put to death what is earthly in you,

229
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,404
"sexual immorality,

230
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,125
"impurity,

231
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,090
"passion,

232
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,289
"evil desire."

233
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,567
You think I don't pay attention
in Bible study?

234
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,564
To the words maybe, but not the meaning.

235
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,008
Well, I just don't happen to think
desire is evil.

236
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,686
- If there is a God...
- If?

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,240
- He gave us genitals for a reason.
- Uh...

238
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,810
This isn't it.

239
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,124
You know, I am trying to understand
your point of view.

240
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,884
The least you could do is meet me halfway.

241
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,571
Fornication isn't halfway, Callie.

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,606
Why are you even with me anyway?

243
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,091
I am beginning to wonder.

244
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,444
What I think is...

245
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,286
I think it's a pretty good way
to rebel against your parents.

246
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,601
Going steady with the guy
who shot their friend.

247
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,085
As a matter of fact,
that's the thing I like the least about you.

248
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,201
Sid was my friend, too, you know.

249
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,850
- Callie, I'm sorry. I'm just...
- No.

250
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,604
Get out of here
before my father comes home,

251
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,160
or he's gonna be the one shooting.

252
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,488
This is awfully public.

253
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,803
Yes, that's why I wanted to meet here,

254
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,009
so there was no misunderstanding
my intentions.

255
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,245
I see.

256
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,447
Elodie, you have been a wonderful friend
at a time when I really needed one.

257
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,443
But whatever you think
is happening between us,

258
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,284
it needs to end.

259
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,405
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,882
Is this about what Tom did?

261
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,001
No.

262
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,762
This is about you and me.

263
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,286
Elodie.

264
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,130
I thought this dump
felt more cosmopolitan than usual.

265
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,288
Ida.

266
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,964
Hank.

267
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,520
- This is Abby Isaacs.
- Hello.

268
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,762
We're colleagues at the switchboard.

269
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,287
Mmm-hmm.

270
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,441
Pleased to meet you.

271
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,524
Does your husband know
you're out on the town with this minx?

272
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,241
I have half a mind to ditch my husband
and join them.

273
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,369
- Oh. Hey, I finally finished it.
- Hmm? Ah!

274
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,368
Only took me, what, 100 years?

275
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,761
- Well?
- I don't know.

276
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,241
I thought it would be racier.

277
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,368
He certainly set Europe on fire.

278
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,249
I thought that was Hitler.

279
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,526
What's the book about?

280
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,845
There's this guy named Meursault.
He's kind of a pill. His mother dies.

281
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,446
He shoots an Arab,
and he winds up in prison.

282
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,931
On.

283
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,324
It's about the fact that our lives are absurd.

284
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,649
There's no God. There's no morality.

285
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,485
And society invents rules
to keep us from happiness.

286
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,009
But every minute of every day,
you're free to decide who to be

287
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,684
and how to live.

288
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,248
So it's a comedy.

289
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,843
Sounds to me like the author never lived
in a town where you can't leave.

290
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,048
He lives in occupied Paris.

291
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,486
Anyway, you're free to walk away
from this hill any time you like.

292
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,201
I think the colonel might disagree.

293
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,729
Just because there may be a consequence
doesn't mean you have no choice.

294
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,244
Yeah, well, my choice
is to go to bed. Ida?

295
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,922
Would you like to join us?

296
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,850
I'm sorry?

297
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,968
Another time.

298
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,209
- Great to see you.
- Bye.

299
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,364
What was that about?

300
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,164
Well, they're <i>bons vivants.</i>

301
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,960
Usually, they trade partners
with the couple next door,

302
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,366
like an American square dance.

303
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,604
You're joking.

304
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,762
Abby, you've been in the switchboard
long enough to know

305
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,731
that everybody inside these fences
has a secret life.

306
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,007
You're no exception.

307
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,204
The difference is you're keeping the secret
even from yourself.

308
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,205
- Elodie...
- No.

309
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,126
Why shouldn't we enjoy ourselves
while we can?

310
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,602
Life is short,
and it's getting shorter all the time.

311
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,162
What does that mean?

312
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,566
That's why we're here, right?

313
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,409
So our husbands can invent
the end of the world.

314
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,969
You woke up early.

315
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,286
You got home late.

316
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,328
What's for breakfast?

317
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,925
Nothing.

318
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,525
Nothing?

319
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,768
I'm not hungry. Why would I eat?

320
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,241
Because that's what people do
in the morning.

321
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,011
<i>"L'Etranger."</i>

322
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,491
<i>- L'Etranger.</i>
- Oh.

323
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,289
I took four years of high school French.

324
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,285
What?

325
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,651
Nothing. Just... No.

326
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,929
You buy gossip magazines
for the photo spreads.

327
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,611
Suddenly, you're reading Baudelaire?

328
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,009
You're not building a radar system, are you?

329
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,731
What?

330
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,371
That's what you told me
when we first got here.

331
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,965
Is it true?

332
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,330
Abby, it's complicated.

333
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,442
Lying to your wife?

334
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,729
I can't tell you any more. I'm not allowed.

335
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,407
Of course you can.

336
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,723
In every single moment, we have a choice.

337
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,404
I'm protecting you.

338
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,651
By building some machine that could
wipe us all off the face of the Earth?

339
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,848
I'll make my own breakfast.

340
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,041
Why didn't you tell me

341
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,489
you did all these additional calculations
on the detonation specs?

342
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,800
Slipped my mind.

343
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,364
You're working with Charlie Isaacs,
aren't you?

344
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,046
You got him and Helen
feeding you calculations,

345
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,044
stealing Akley's resources
out from under his nose.

346
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,689
Jesus, Frank.

347
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,248
Isaacs came to me.

348
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,961
The plutonium at Site X
will never be pure enough.

349
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,805
Thin Man will predetonate.
It is doomed to fail.

350
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,885
And then they will be forced to help us
overcome the shockwave problem.

351
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,851
No. No, the minute the Army discovers
that Thin Man is useless,

352
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,809
they'll shut us down

353
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,042
and throw all their manpower
into trying to fix it.

354
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,643
So the plan is to put everybody around you
in jeopardy?

355
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,805
The plan is to prove implosion works
before the plutonium arrives.

356
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,362
And when I do that,
no one's gonna give a shit how I got there.

357
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,483
We hit the wall. It's a mile high,

358
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,450
but you're not gonna scale it
by standing on the shoulders of Thin Man.

359
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,646
I have to try.

360
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,081
- And the collateral damage?
- We won't get caught.

361
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,050
This entire Hill was built on secrets, Frank.

362
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,083
They're traded around like ration stamps.

363
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,169
When this falls apart, you'll face jail time.

364
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,689
But G-2 is already convinced
that I'm a Commie.

365
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,525
- I'll face the firing squad.
- Glen.

366
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,403
You put our fate, my fate,
in the hands of Charlie Isaacs.

367
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,922
I've come to trust him.

368
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,924
You've come to trust the little shit
that put the bull's-eye on my back,

369
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,404
a plagiarist,
a rat who steals from other scientists.

370
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,523
I guess that's why they call it the fog of war.

371
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,368
Liza, I'm glad I caught you.

372
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,761
Oh.

373
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,848
Your help yesterday was appreciated.

374
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,567
Every reason to believe the men will be fine.

375
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,564
Just glad I could help.

376
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,086
I hope it didn't scare you.

377
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,811
Those men work with explosives all the time.

378
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,920
The scrubbing was just to be certain
all the residue was off.

379
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,047
I understand.

380
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,682
I just wanted to make sure that
you were aware of patient confidentiality.

381
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,606
You really shouldn't mention this
to anyone outside the clinic.

382
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,444
Of course not.

383
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,560
Punching out?

384
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,726
Yes, I am.

385
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,607
Good night.

386
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,844
Liza, it's been a long day for all of us.

387
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,481
Should you and I maybe
have a drink to wash it down?

388
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,442
Oh, that's so kind of you, Doctor. Um...

389
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,042
I really must get dinner on the table, but...

390
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,771
You know, a wife's work is never done.

391
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,489
- Another time.
- Another time.

392
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,608
G34, please step out of line.

393
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,566
Sorry. You'd think that's a number
I could commit to memory.

394
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,007
Is there some kind of problem?
My pass is up to date.

395
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,401
- You're coming with me.
- Why?

396
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,444
It's just you, Private Dunlavey?
No MPs to hold me down this time?

397
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,250
- Sit down.
- Is this how things go around here?

398
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,731
You get me arrested for no reason.

399
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
You put a couple of quiet bullets in me.
You get another promotion.

400
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,169
I just want to talk.

401
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,567
I have nothing to say to you.

402
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,922
You can't tell anyone I told you this,
and hardly anyone knows.

403
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,281
Sid Liao's wife is here on the Hill.

404
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,971
Annie's here?

405
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,527
Have you seen her?

406
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,491
Not myself, but I thought you might want to.

407
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,244
Where is she?

408
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,882
She's being questioned by the authorities,
but she'll be released and sent off soon.

409
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,601
I hear she'll be on the workers' bus out
this afternoon.

410
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,121
Why are you doing this?

411
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,121
"Let us lie down in our shame,
and let our disgrace cover us."

412
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,883
Do you have to do that right now?

413
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,961
Uh-huh.

414
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,131
What are you doing anyway?

415
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,491
Air pockets, drilling them out,
filling them back in.

416
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,562
You're drilling into TNT?

417
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,681
Uh-huh.

418
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,208
- Dispersion relations.
- What?

419
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,370
- You reference them in your paper.
- My paper?

420
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,726
All right, just think
about a wave deep in the ocean.

421
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,330
It's convex until it moves into shore.

422
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,563
Then it turns in on itself, and it forms a tube.

423
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,406
The shallow ground, it works just like a lens.

424
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,480
The shape of the wave
actually begins to invert.

425
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,325
So we need to slow down
the middle of the shockwave.

426
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,004
Yeah, then flatten and invert them.

427
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,323
We use a charge as our shallow ground.

428
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,289
- Is that possible?
- It's like the Munroe effect.

429
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,445
A Navy man at the turn of the century
invented incendiary warheads.

430
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,090
Bazooka rockets.

431
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,571
He called them shaped charges.

432
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,611
But a nuclear core is no rocket.
It's 1,000 times more sensitive.

433
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,605
We just have to find a way
to perfectly mold the shockwaves.

434
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,083
We could vary the burn rates.

435
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,126
Can you make that happen?

436
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,843
Baratol burns slower than TNT,
and I can blend to any speed you want.

437
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,762
Then we would
just flip the shockwaves inside out

438
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,166
and bend them
into a single symmetrical implosion wave.

439
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,123
Jesus, Frank.

440
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,845
Hey, Annie.

441
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,369
Are you okay?

442
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,765
I'm so sorry about Sid.

443
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,366
I wanted to call, but...

444
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,523
- They wouldn't allow you.
- Not even a letter.

445
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,371
Jim, what is this place?
What the hell was Sid doing here?

446
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,442
I can't talk about it.

447
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,884
That's what Sid always said.

448
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,487
You know what else he told me?
That he was coming home.

449
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,489
He died for his country.

450
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,609
They told me he was a spy, Jim.

451
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,808
He wasn't. He never would have done that.

452
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,248
We were married six years.
You think I don't know that?

453
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,482
I'm sorry, Annie.

454
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,406
Would you deliver a message
to Frank Winter for me?

455
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,720
Of course.

456
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,606
Tell him that...

457
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,640
Tell him it's very kind of him
to send the money,

458
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,611
but I don't want another dime
that comes out of this place.

459
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,648
Frank's been sending money?

460
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,371
Every month, ever since it happened.

461
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,967
Tell him he has nothing to feel guilty about.

462
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,691
Why would Frank feel guilty?

463
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,723
Because he brought Sid here
in the first place.

464
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,491
I'm glad you're here. Last time I talked to Sid,

465
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,361
he told me that he was being transferred
to some other secret location.

466
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,001
We all were. The Army changed its mind.

467
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,162
Next stop Santa Fe.

468
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,926
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too, Annie.

469
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,766
I'll get Crosley working
on manufacturing specs

470
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,649
for the aluminum pusher.

471
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,564
Fritz and Meeks can measure
the baratol burn rate.

472
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,604
Helen and I will get our guys
onto the modeling calculations.

473
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,682
This is good.

474
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,725
Yesterday, you said it wasn't possible.

475
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,609
Well, yesterday, it wasn't. Today, it is.

476
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,968
Don't be smart, boy. I was right both times.

477
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,126
Any idea what he said?

478
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,282
Something about friendship?

479
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,166
Good day.

480
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,960
Ma'am.

481
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,445
Hi.

482
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,726
Could you give this to PFC Dunlavey?

483
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,167
You another one of his adoring fans?

484
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,250
We're in Bible study together.

485
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,208
Hey. spy killer.

486
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,285
A pretty girl left this for you.
Said she thought you'd want it back.

487
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,481
Ah!

488
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,802
- Already finished?
- Mmm-hmm.

489
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,841
What is it?

490
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,564
Do you know why I learned French?

491
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,087
Because it was important to my mother.

492
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,323
Every August, Charlie and I spend
our vacation at the Chatham Inn,

493
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,849
the same place that I've been summering
since I was a little girl.

494
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,163
It never occurred to me to go someplace new.

495
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,483
Well, you deserve to see the world.

496
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,366
My whole life I have been exactly the person
everyone expected me to be.

497
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,125
I don't even know what I want.

498
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,251
What do you want right now?

499
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,931
Lenses.

500
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,244
Explosive lenses, shaped charges.
That's how we do it.

501
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,285
How do you control the speed?

502
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,850
By varying the burn rates.

503
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,847
With baratol. Oh, my God!

504
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,241
- Charlie's fine.
- You idiot!

505
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,440
Liza?

506
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,609
It's all poisoned.

507
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,207
What, our clothes?

508
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,887
Everything, our dinner plates, our silverware.

509
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,281
It's all radioactive.

510
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,561
I work with radium.

511
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,962
Trace elements have followed me home
from every lab I've ever worked in.

512
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,442
- There's nothing to worry about.
- It's in Callie's room.

513
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,804
It's on her shoes.

514
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,331
It's on her toothbrush.

515
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,810
Don't be absurd.

516
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,444
Liza, Liza, Liza, stop. Stop.

517
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,488
I think it's in the air, maybe the water.

518
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,211
This place is poisoning us
and everyone who's in it.

519
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,601
When Callie gets home,
we have to strip her down.

520
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,682
- Okay.
- We have to scrub her skin.

521
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,762
Just calm down.

522
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,320
Calm down and listen to yourself
for a second.

523
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,925
I'll show you.

524
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,604
If you're looking for the janitors
to clean up something,

525
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,848
they all left for the night.

526
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,490
Actually, I am trying to clean up a bit,
but I don't need a broom.

527
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,769
You're Meeks, correct?

528
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,165
Jim.

529
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,845
Pleasure.

530
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,724
You've been here, what, Jim, eight months?

531
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,010
Must be quite a change from Maine.

532
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,721
I imagine your mother misses
having you nearby.

533
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,007
She's been ill, hasn't she?

534
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,411
Do I know you?

535
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,483
I handle personnel issues
in the Manhattan District.

536
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,882
I end up reading a lot of files.

537
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,568
I can tell you the issue here.
We barely have any personnel left.

538
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,928
Yeah, it does look
a little bit lonely around here.

539
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,091
Is your boss in?
I have some questions for Dr. Winter.

540
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,328
Yeah, well,
I have some questions for him, too.

541
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,882
You know, I always like to hear
about things on the ground.

542
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,964
Maybe you'd like to share some thoughts
about Dr. Winter's management style.

543
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,808
It was going off everywhere here
just before you came back.

544
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,005
Come on.

545
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,084
You know, I should never have let it
out of my sight.

546
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,326
You know, the Army could have come
in here while I was outside, or G-2.

547
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,244
You know, they could have rewired it.

548
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,926
They could have rewired it, Frank,
to cover their tracks.

549
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,360
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
nobody has been in our house, okay?

550
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,202
It was working.

551
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,444
They're less than a year old.
They should be fine.

552
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:16,200

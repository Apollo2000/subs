1
00:00:00,696 --> 00:00:02,563
<i>Previously on "Manhattan"...</i>

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,952
<i>When the time comes,
someone will contact you.</i>

3
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:11,322
He'll have the other half
of this.

4
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:12,823
- Crosley.
- Hi.

5
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:14,825
This is really
not a good time.

6
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:17,128
Are you...

7
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:18,713
We'll be forming
a new test group.

8
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:20,715
<i>There will be
an announcement soon.</i>

9
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,833
How did you know that
Mrs. Winter was the girl for you?

10
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,386
<i>Was it like Einstein discovering
spatial relativity?</i>

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,004
That took Albert
a couple years.

12
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:29,140
- I'm Abby.
- Elodie.

13
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:31,392
<i>Enchanté.</i>

14
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:34,228
- Callie!
<i>-  Sorry, ma'am.</i>

15
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:36,263
<i>If you took her away,
I'd never see her again.</i>

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,017
<i>There was an
incident in Ithaca.</i>

17
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:41,519
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

18
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,071
You're all right now,
aren't you?

19
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:46,657
Jesus, Glen, I can't
do this without you.

20
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:50,361
You're gonna have to.
They want me off the Hill.

21
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:53,364
- Where is he?
-<i> Your husband is at another site</i>

22
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:55,366
proving his loyalty
to his country.

23
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,692
_

24
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:15,686
Brought you a newspaper.
Sunday "Times."

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,354
They took it from me
at the door.

26
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:19,390
They're afraid the news
will upset us.

27
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:22,059
I trust you'll tell me
if Hitler invades Nantucket,

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,395
starts a world war.

29
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:26,230
Speaking of Fascists,

30
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:28,065
I thought I'd bring
your sister next week.

31
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,901
I'd rather nobody
know I was here.

32
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,241
Where's your wedding ring?

33
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,410
We're not allowed
to wear them.

34
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:42,246
Why? So you'll forget
you've got a husband?

35
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:44,915
So we don't swallow them
and choke ourselves.

36
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:53,891
You lost count.
You took too many pills.

37
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,593
It does not
make you suicidal.

38
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:58,979
Let's look at
the silver lining.

39
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:00,898
I finally took up a hobby.

40
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:04,602
<i>- Nurse.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

41
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:06,770
Someone must have
shown her the newspaper.

42
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,408
<i>Come with me.</i>

43
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:12,610
I'm sorry.
Visiting hours are over.

44
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,028
Thank you.

45
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:23,087
I am going to bring you home.

46
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,540
Callie's going to
hate this scarf.

47
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:31,295
Come here.
Yeah.

48
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,439
I'll see you next week.

49
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:45,442
<i>What was
science fiction yesterday</i>

50
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:47,311
<i>is a reality today.</i>

51
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:49,813
<i>Hahn and Strassmann work
at the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti--</i>

52
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,449
- No, no.
Turn that back, please.

53
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,652
<i>...blocks of all matter.</i>

54
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,288
<i>German scientists have
managed to split the atom,</i>

55
00:02:57,322 --> 00:02:59,657
<i>releasing 200 million volts.</i>

56
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,492
<i>A major discovery in physics,</i>

57
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:04,044
<i>atomic energy could become
a promising source of fuel</i>

58
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,080
<i>in the decades to come.</i>

59
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,300
It's called a neutron.

60
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,385
It's a particle inside
the nucleus of an atom.

61
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,837
When you bombard
uranium with neutrons,

62
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,673
you can split it apart,

63
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:17,675
releasing all
of that, uh--

64
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:21,011
that energy, that power
that's locked inside.

65
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,483
Imagine the sun
rising in the west.

66
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,319
And you know how
to build this contraption?

67
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:30,154
I know it can be built.

68
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:32,072
Hitler is already
stockpiling uranium.

69
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:34,575
I have been to Germany.
I know their starting lineup.

70
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,529
They will succeed at this.

71
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,199
So you're telling me I need
a bomb that doesn't exist

72
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,668
to win a war that we won't be
involved in when it starts?

73
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,503
- We'll--
- If it starts.

74
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:48,778
We'll get in.
You know we will.

75
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,515
- We'll take it under consideration.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,353
Saw Elaine last week at the
university club with her new beau.

77
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:03,721
Someday you got to tell me

78
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,389
how to unload a wife
so smoothly.

79
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,725
It's all in the wrist.

80
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:10,945
Gentlemen.

81
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:16,533
All right, so who's next
in your little black book?

82
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:19,536
Maybe it's time
to close the book.

83
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,989
Some genies belong
in their lamps.

84
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,629
So are we going to
talk about it, kiddo?

85
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:30,714
What do you think
we're doing right now?

86
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:33,133
I mean whatever
is really going on

87
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:35,135
inside that egg head
of yours.

88
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,972
Obsessing over hypothetical
chain reactions

89
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:40,140
so you can ignore what?

90
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:42,092
The perils
of the tenure committee?

91
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:43,927
Cornell's fine.

92
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,930
And Liza? What does she
have to say about all this?

93
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:49,149
Liza's got enough
on her mind right now.

94
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:51,602
She still on
her research sabbatical?

95
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:55,155
We need to think bigger.

96
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,193
You must know someone
with a line to the president.

97
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:07,785
We can still drive back
to the city.

98
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,953
Leave the cap on this bottle.

99
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,955
Open a beer instead.

100
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,208
Without getting
my autograph book signed?

101
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:19,430
I don't want to be the guy
who lives to regret it.

102
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:20,898
Do you?

103
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,586

00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:18,539
<i>Right there. Thanks.</i>

106
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,332
Editor said the writer's on
assignment and unreachable.

107
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,468
I informed him that wartime secrecy
guidelines prohibit them--

108
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:33,671
Census record.

109
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,839
Get me this reporter's
individual census record,

110
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:39,476
his last income tax return,
and his current home address.

111
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:40,895
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,693
Colonel.

113
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,274
_

114
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,033
I trust you informed them
of their mistake.

115
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:04,335
I have.

116
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,703
Why not bring Frank back

117
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,871
and we can clear up
this confusion?

118
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:10,874
There's some confusion I'd
like to clear up right here

119
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,843
concerning the source
of this story.

120
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,513
I'm not permitted
to leave the Hill.

121
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:20,517
And all my correspondence
is monitored by you, yes?

122
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:23,520
You know, if Dr. Winter were in less
than comfortable circumstances--

123
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,522
Which he isn't.

124
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:29,610
I would worry they may not
improve after today's events.

125
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:36,450
Perhaps you'd like to
repeat that, Colonel,

126
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:39,570
to my colleagues here
on the town council.

127
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,294
May I have everyone's
attention, please?

128
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,081
Due to the new J-1
secrecy restrictions,

129
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,752
as of today, the town
council is disbanded.

130
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:57,755
<i>What? What did he say?</i>

131
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:13,937
Where's the rest?

132
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:15,572
<i>That's it for today.</i>

133
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:16,940
<i>Bad behavior.</i>

134
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,442
What did I do?

135
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:20,661
Not your bad behavior.

136
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:33,249
Right away,
Dr. Oppenheimer.

137
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,252
There must be another
secret city in California.

138
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,734
He calls over there
three times a week.

139
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:41,257
Do you ever, um--

140
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,992
Listen to
Oppenheimer's calls?

141
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,927
Pretty sure
that's a war crime.

142
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,346
Hmm.

143
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,600
But I think I heard
Roosevelt's voice once.

144
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:13,089
<i>Get my care package?</i>

145
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:14,457
<i>I thought gift-giving</i>

146
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:16,459
<i>was a bourgeois convention.</i>

147
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,294
<i>Although I don't have
any neckties</i>

148
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:20,129
<i>with Arabian slaves on them.</i>

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,932
<i>I had a dream.</i>

150
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,300
<i>You were a greyhound</i>

151
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,302
<i>and we were
climbing a mountain.</i>

152
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,471
<i>And when
we reached the summit,</i>

153
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:32,108
<i>you jumped up and licked
my thighs until I came.</i>

154
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:35,111
<i>I strangled you
with your leash.</i>

155
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,479
<i>The destruction of the one</i>

156
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,314
<i>is the production of another.</i>

157
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:41,701
<i>Isn't that what Jung says?</i>

158
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,037
<i>Bring the necktie
to San Francisco.</i>

159
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,539
<i>I'm going to make you
beg for air.</i>

160
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:01,137
Okay, well, let's just say
we had invented space travel

161
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,389
and you had the chance
to go to--

162
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,974
to Jupiter, for instance.

163
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:08,010
- Evening, Dr. Isaacs.
- Have a good night.

164
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:10,513
Oh, my God.
Suck-ups.

165
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:13,149
Anyway, Jupiter,
the most majestic

166
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:16,152
and mysterious of all the
planets in the solar system--

167
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:18,020
but there's a catch.

168
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,522
It's a one-way ticket.

169
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:22,992
You will never see
your friends or family again.

170
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,577
<i>Are there girls
on this spaceship?</i>

171
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:27,163
It's a journey
of 365 million miles.

172
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:30,366
You'll get to see the Galilean
moons, the Great Red Spot,

173
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:34,003
but you have to
give up everything.

174
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:36,923
You're standing on the
threshold of the capsule

175
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:39,175
and you have to decide
do you go?

176
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:40,543
- Shit, no. Do you?
- Ah!

177
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,178
I don't know.
I mean, on the one hand,

178
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:43,772
you're the first
interplanetary tourist,

179
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:46,182
like Vasco da Gama,
but then on the other hand,

180
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:48,184
you start thinking
about your family and--

181
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:49,769
Oh, shit.

182
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,771
What's the matter?

183
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,443
Jesus Christ.

184
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,064
Hi. Excuse me.

185
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:08,070
Hi. Just looking
for someone, sir.

186
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:11,207
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.

187
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,042
- I need to talk to you.
- Fritz?

188
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,211
In the lab, we were running
the plasma generator,

189
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,213
and he was splicing a cable.

190
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:18,798
- Who was?
- Thatcher.

191
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:20,133
- Okay.
- And just--

192
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,218
after Sid,
and then after Akley,

193
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:24,053
and this whole stupid war--

194
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,805
Fritz, slow down.
Calm down.

195
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,223
It could have been me
hooking up that wire.

196
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:29,225
We couldn't wake him up.

197
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,227
We couldn't wake him up.
He was choking on his tongue.

198
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:33,229
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

199
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,765
I don't know. It's just
everything is so fragile.

200
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,600
Just life, I mean. I--

201
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,602
I can't go to Jupiter!

202
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:41,070
Who am I kidding?
I can't even--

203
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:42,822
What are you saying, Fritz?

204
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:45,074
What I'm saying is just--

205
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:47,443
Is that a decoder ring?

206
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:50,446
I know that I'm no war hero

207
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:53,449
or even brave,

208
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:58,171
and I have
sciatica, and--

209
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,456
I do!

210
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,841
- I mean--
- What do you mean?

211
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,093
I mean, um--

212
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:05,845
- I will.
- You will?

213
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,296
Yeah.

214
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,315
Robert Oppenheimer's
having an affair.

215
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:29,619
What?

216
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:32,121
Three days a week he calls
a woman in San Francisco.

217
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:34,657
A doctor. He's going to
visit her this weekend.

218
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,909
He's going to
Washington, D.C.

219
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:44,133
- Jesus, Abby.
- What?

220
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,136
You told me no one's supposed
to listen to his calls.

221
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,330
Imagine you're me, sitting at
a switchboard day after day

222
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,621
knowing what none
of the other girls know.

223
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,345
Abby, remember
what killed the cat?

224
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,516
Stay out of other
people's marriages.

225
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,525
Do you remember the first
thing you ever said to me

226
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,360
at the registrar's office
in Chicago?

227
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:13,529
I remember you had
food in your teeth.

228
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,123
- And you told me.
- Yeah.

229
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:16,732
All my life, I felt like
I was walking around

230
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,901
with food in my teeth, and
no one would ever tell me.

231
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:21,537
But you have been
my majordomo ever since.

232
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:23,372
- A majordomo is a butler.
- I--

233
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:25,374
Are you getting all
misty-eyed on me?

234
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:28,144
Is this about
Thatcher's accident?

235
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:30,129
It's about me and Jeannie.

236
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:32,748
Holy shit.
You did it!

237
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,550
What did she say?

238
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,552
You want to be the best man?

239
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,754
Ah!

240
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,923
Guys. Guys!

241
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:43,392
They just posted
the roster for G group.

242
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,761
None of us made the list
except for you, Fritz.

243
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:46,929
Wait, wait. Me?

244
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,764
- Yeah.
- Ah, so what?

245
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,766
You want to answer directly
to Charlie Isaacs?

246
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,935
I'd rather report to a guy
who reports to a guy

247
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,770
who only has to see his
pretty-boy face once a month.

248
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:57,156
I mean, we practically
invented implosion.

249
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,607
G group's going to test it.

250
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,576
The culmination
of 300 years of physics

251
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,944
and we're going to
be sitting here

252
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,779
polishing our slide rules.

253
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:06,582
I'm not joining any group
without you guys.

254
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,167
There's more to life.

255
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:09,668
Like what?

256
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:12,171
Go tell her.

257
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,789
- Oh, you're right.
- Just go.

258
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,292
Helen! Wait up!
Wait up! Wait up!

259
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:39,114
Sir?
I'm sorry to interrupt.

260
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,784
What is that on your face?

261
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:43,478
I know it's against protocol,

262
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:44,987
but I have a rash.

263
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:47,156
I will shave right away, sir.

264
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:50,159
You look like Paul
on the road to Damascus.

265
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,271
Keep it.

266
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,001
Yes, sir.

267
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:01,503
But, sir, um,
we found the reporter.

268
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:03,839
Or he found us.

269
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:14,567
Ah, W.D. Lorentzen.

270
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,236
I see my reputation
precedes me.

271
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,654
Listen, I don't suppose
you could spare

272
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,856
a soft drink
from one of those tents?

273
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,658
I had to walk the last mile.

274
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:24,410
The taxi driver wouldn't
bring me any closer.

275
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:27,863
I was under the impression
you preferred hard drinks.

276
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,865
That you preferred them
to employment

277
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,333
at your last three
newspapers.

278
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:35,504
I see my reputation
does precede me.

279
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:38,257
Okay, then.
No refreshments.

280
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,842
Shall we talk Frank Winter?

281
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:43,045
Whoever referred you
here was misinformed.

282
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:46,382
Aw, shucks. This was the
last stop on the caboose.

283
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,601
It's the oddest thing.

284
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:52,888
It seems that half of America's
physicists have just disappeared.

285
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,358
Poof. Like the Rapture.

286
00:15:56,393 --> 00:16:01,196
I imagine you've read the code of wartime
practices for the American press.

287
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:04,700
I'm really more
of a First Amendment guy.

288
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,703
See, my theory, American's
missing geniuses

289
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,738
are camped right on the
other side of that fence.

290
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,790
And whatever they're up to,

291
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:14,877
you don't want the Krauts or my
readership knowing about it.

292
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:17,296
So before you call in
the cavalry,

293
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,081
you should know
that if my editor

294
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:21,083
doesn't hear from me
by press time,

295
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:23,969
there will be a special
feature in tomorrow's paper.

296
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:27,423
A treasure map leading
right to your doorstep.

297
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:29,308
So tell me,

298
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:34,129
does the name Frank Winter
ring a bell after all?

299
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,185
Why don't we go get you
that soft drink?

300
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:43,155
Yeah.

301
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,325
<i>Attention, please.</i>

302
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:48,577
<i>All vehicles entering
the motor pool</i>

303
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:51,780
<i>must show updated vehicle
passes before security parking.</i>

304
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,966
Liza.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,680
Did they tell you
anything about Frank?

306
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,669
I was just about
to come find you.

307
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:33,955
Are they bringing him back?

308
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:36,958
You see the irony
here, right?

309
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:40,211
I mean, you're asking
me to risk my hide

310
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:43,581
so that you can be reunited
with your husband?

311
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,051
Look, I don't think he's going to be
coming around the mountain any time soon.

312
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:49,570
I tried.

313
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,592
They bought you off.

314
00:17:57,012 --> 00:18:00,982
Let's say you're testing
a theory about hydrangeas

315
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:03,768
and the theory
doesn't pan out.

316
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,437
But in the course
of experimenting

317
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,773
you find, I don't know,

318
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:12,493
that plants are sentient
and crave human blood.

319
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:16,781
Now, are you going to go back

320
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:19,617
and start over
with the hydrangeas or--

321
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,286
They sold you the scoop
on the gadget.

322
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,024
Is that what
Frank's life is worth?

323
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:31,629
I've been hired to write
the official chronicle

324
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:34,015
of the Manhattan
Engineering District.

325
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,933
Unfettered access.

326
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:38,436
Did you tell him who gave you
the tip-off about Frank?

327
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,021
I would never
reveal a source,

328
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,806
even under penalty
of torture,

329
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,441
which, by the way,
I don't put past

330
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:45,726
that sadist
of a colonel out there.

331
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:51,866
They don't give out
Pulitzers for propaganda.

332
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:02,460
I didn't know
the Allmans had moved.

333
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:05,296
And in their place you found
a long-lost college chum.

334
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,797
Imagine my surprise.

335
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:08,466
Yet it wasn't just a campus

336
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,835
you shared with
Mr. Lorentzen was it?

337
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:12,303
I wonder how
your husband would feel

338
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:14,221
about your recent visit
with an old flame.

339
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,173
Let's call him and ask.

340
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:17,642
Then again,
I'm old-fashioned

341
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,316
when it comes to
the sanctity of marriage.

342
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:20,978
Your husband,
on the other hand,

343
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:22,847
holds a more
progressive view.

344
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,016
Where's Frank?

345
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:27,068
He lied to you,

346
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:29,487
medicated you
with barbiturates

347
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,489
after philandering
with a woman half his age

348
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,857
and half your intelligence,

349
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:36,827
and yet you persist
in agitating for his return.

350
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:39,497
You have a wife,
don't you, Colonel?

351
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,812
She didn't choose
to join you on the Hill?

352
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:46,337
My wife is not well, but
thank you for your concern.

353
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,255
<i>And if you should vanish
into the desert,</i>

354
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,208
I imagine she would do everything
in her power to find you,

355
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,927
despite your imperfections.

356
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,121
But you didn't do everything
in your power, Dr. Winter.

357
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,380
Your daughter did.

358
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,851
Mr. Lorentzen declined
to name his source,

359
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:03,387
but the telephone company was
glad to do its patriotic duty

360
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:05,139
in a time of war.

361
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,725
She's only a child.

362
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:14,031
The operator is holding
an open line

363
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:15,399
to your sister's apartment.

364
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,068
Your daughter
is on the other end.

365
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,737
If you want to help
your family,

366
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:22,323
you're going to tell her
to be a good girl.

367
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,382
The wedding china?

368
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,584
We never get
to use it anymore.

369
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,136
What do I call him?

370
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,338
Dr. Oppenheimer
or Robert?

371
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:40,424
I told you to stay out of it.

372
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:41,809
It didn't mean
invite him over.

373
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,811
Careers aren't made
between 9:00 and 5:00,

374
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:46,313
they're made between
soup and dessert.

375
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,151
- Honey.
- Mm?

376
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:52,436
This has nothing to do
with my career...

377
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,296
...and you know it.

378
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:05,583
Meeks had one task-- to find a
projector for the stag film.

379
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:08,002
I found "War Times Tiddlers,"

380
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:10,755
designed to stiffen the resolve
of our service members.

381
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:12,790
Well, I found
something way better.

382
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:15,292
Wollensak Fastax
eight millimeter.

383
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:18,629
Why just watch a film when
you can shoot your own?

384
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,132
- Right?
- Your own stag film?

385
00:21:21,183 --> 00:21:25,019
No. We were adapting
"Auro, Lord of Jupiter"

386
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:26,604
from Planet Comics.

387
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:28,639
It was--
it was gonna be legendary.

388
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,776
And Meeks very graciously
let me play Auro.

389
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,478
And I was Tara, Auro's trusty
saber-toothed tiger friend.

390
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,147
Okay.
Great character.

391
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:38,482
But alas, Jupiter fell
to the Brits.

392
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:40,818
This is Fritz's swan song
as a bachelor.

393
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,370
You wanted to spend it
in a burlap diaper.

394
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,956
- Whereas I felt it might be more appropriate--
- Oh!

395
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,325
- Here comes the bride.
- What?

396
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,997
Whoa, no, no, we're not supposed to
see each other before the wedding!

397
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:56,050
Help! Ah!

398
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:59,887
I heard it was you that
set up Jeannie and Fritz.

399
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,673
You got any more eligible
bachelors up your sleeve?

400
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:05,726
Oh, it's not your sleeve
they wanna get up, believe me.

401
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:08,042
I thought scientists
might be different.

402
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:10,514
You must be new around here.

403
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:20,357
Paul Crosley. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

404
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:23,911
What pleasure is that?

405
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:25,362
Well, why don't you name
a few of your favorites

406
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:27,581
and we could try them all?

407
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:41,045
Cheers.

408
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,633
So you're, uh--
you're new around here?

409
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,283
Did you kill that bed
sheet yourself or what?

410
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:06,954
It's all I ever want.

411
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:09,907
Meat, meat, meat.
Robert says it's the iron.

412
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:12,877
- Mm.
- What about you, Abby? Any cravings?

413
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:16,213
Oh, it's usually just whatever
they're out of at the commissary.

414
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:18,549
Oh, the commissary's
a disaster.

415
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,943
You should see the shopping list I
foist on Robert when he's traveling.

416
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:26,640
You do a lot of traveling,
don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?

417
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,644
If I spent any more time
riding the rails,

418
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:32,763
they'd make me
a Pullman porter.

419
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,267
I suppose it's just
Washington mostly

420
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,149
- when the president says jump.
<i>-  Abby.</i>

421
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:40,104
National security.

422
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:42,907
He's heading there first
thing in the morning again.

423
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,609
I haven't been off the Hill
in almost a year.

424
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,946
I suppose I'm just trying to live vicariously
through someone else's adventures.

425
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:50,915
If Washington is your idea
of an adventure,

426
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:53,117
I'm afraid cabin fever is
the least of your problems.

427
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:55,286
Ah.

428
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:01,959
How did the two of you meet?

429
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,844
You're so perfectly matched.

430
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:07,431
Well, I had just married
my third husband.

431
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:09,633
Of course, Robert isn't the
type to steal a man's wife,

432
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:11,969
so I reeled him in
the old-fashioned way--

433
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:13,604
I got pregnant.

434
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:15,272
This one is just
for good measure.

435
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:21,779
What a fascinating necktie.

436
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:24,031
Is that Aladdin?

437
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:27,618
My uncle saw his first wife
right before the wedding

438
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,536
and then she fell off
a lake steamer

439
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:31,372
on their way to Niagara Falls
for their honeymoon,

440
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:34,491
so I'm just saying
I don't wanna risk it.

441
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,659
Cros?

442
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,378
Hello?

443
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,797
Cros?
Crosley, are you there?

444
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:43,167
- Anyone? Hello?
- Hey, forget about me, Fritzy.

445
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:46,887
This is... Gloria.

446
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:49,006
I hear you're from Jupiter.

447
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:52,009
She's all paid up. And let's consider
this an early wedding present.

448
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,980
One more proper goring before the
old bull head's out to pasture.

449
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:57,898
Huh?

450
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,184
- Why don't you take the night off?
- Hey, wait.

451
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:03,270
- Thanks, Gloria.
- Prins. Hey. Hey!

452
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:08,025
Well, now you owe me
$2 and a half.

453
00:25:08,076 --> 00:25:10,160
What is wrong with you?
Why won't you be happy

454
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:12,529
till everybody else is as depraved
and miserable as you are?

455
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:15,032
Says the girl who's been
crying into her cups

456
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:17,201
because Isaacs left her
off his precious list.

457
00:25:17,252 --> 00:25:19,253
Suddenly you're the
protectoress of marriage?

458
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:21,755
You think I would've made
a good wife, Paul?

459
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:24,208
Huh?

460
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,093
I didn't love you.

461
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:30,431
- I'm sorry.
- Let's not delude ourselves, tulip.

462
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:32,383
Love didn't enter
the equation.

463
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:35,102
You traded up for the prince
of the project.

464
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:37,604
And look where it got you.

465
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,920
I mean, I've heard of birds
sleeping their way to the top,

466
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:43,477
but you're the first I know who
slept their way to the bottom.

467
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:57,624
<i> There's a tract in the Mojave
Desert that meets all the criteria--</i>

468
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,910
flat as a pancake,
remote enough

469
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:02,212
that no one's gonna wander
in with a picnic blanket.

470
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:03,831
No Indians.

471
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,634
Or if you don't like
California,

472
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,587
there's the Gulf Coast,
Padre Island.

473
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:13,640
We're testing a weapon of war,
not building a summer house.

474
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:18,429
We identified
a site in Colorado.

475
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:20,431
Two in New Mexico.

476
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:23,100
The Jornada
del Muerto Desert.

477
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:24,862
- It means--
- "Route of the dead man."

478
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:27,738
Pick one.

479
00:26:27,772 --> 00:26:30,691
You're the director
of G group. Direct.

480
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:36,246
I spent all day licking my wounds
wondering what was wrong with me,

481
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,949
-<i> why I didn't make your idiotic group.</i>
- Helen, calm down.

482
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,668
And then I realized
it's not me, it's you.

483
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:50,594
It is chilly in here,
isn't it?

484
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:52,796
And you left me on the bench because
you can't control your hard-on?

485
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:54,465
Go home, you're drunk.

486
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:56,633
- Thank your wife for dinner.
- And you!

487
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:59,019
Everybody knows you were the third
choice to run this project.

488
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:00,971
None of us would
even be here if Frank

489
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:03,140
hadn't convinced Albert Einstein
we needed a bomb.

490
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:05,943
- This entire project exists because of Frank.
- Helen. Hey.

491
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:09,146
- What are you doing?
- Where is he now?

492
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:12,983
I had to work 10 times harder
than any man to get here.

493
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,954
It was just sex, Charlie.

494
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:18,238
Get over it.

495
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,161
Hey, I picked the best
team for the job.

496
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,802
Remind me of her name.

497
00:27:37,842 --> 00:27:40,511
She's just a colleague
from the tech area.

498
00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:42,930
- They never stop working, do they?
- Mm.

499
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:53,991
Honestly, Charlie and I are
happier than we've ever been.

500
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:57,027
You know, with the baby
and everything.

501
00:28:00,198 --> 00:28:03,367
Men always think they want a woman
who really understands them,

502
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:05,536
but when they get one,
they learn

503
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:09,373
what a terrible burden
it is to be known.

504
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:23,220
Your husband's not going
to Washington tomorrow.

505
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:26,223
Oh, the Army is always changing
Robert's schedule at the last minute.

506
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:29,776
He's going to San Francisco.

507
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,901
You work the switchboard,
don't you?

508
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:42,739
Well, I bet you overhear
all kinds of secrets.

509
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:46,743
I hear things, too.

510
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:49,580
I hear you like
the taste of girls.

511
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:55,135
I do not need marital advice

512
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,837
from a deviant.

513
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:07,764
Oh, wow.

514
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:10,184
Wow. Oh.

515
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:27,251
Oh, God, uh, was I
not supposed to...?

516
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:30,287
- Um, sorry.
- You did great.

517
00:29:30,338 --> 00:29:32,756
You did great. Wow.

518
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,124
You're a pro.

519
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:35,926
Well, I mean--

520
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,095
I'm not saying
that, uh--

521
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:40,297
<i>I mean, you're not
obviously, uh--</i>

522
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,683
<i>you're not a pro
in that sense.</i>

523
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:46,803
But wait, you're-- you're
not a pro, are you?

524
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:50,190
I've, uh-- I've never been asked if I
was a hooker on a first date before.

525
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:52,476
Oh, God, no, well,

526
00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:54,444
I'm sorry, I--
I didn't mean--

527
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:56,313
it's just--
it's just, uh,

528
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:58,148
a lot of the nice girls here,

529
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,200
like Jeannie,
they sometimes--

530
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:03,620
um-- wait,
are we on a date?

531
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:05,322
Yeah, sort of.

532
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,991
'Cause we could go on one.

533
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:09,993
I mean, like a--
a regular one,

534
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,379
like to the theater.

535
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:15,132
Do you like the theater?

536
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:19,503
"Young Cassius has a lean
and hungry look.

537
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:21,805
He thinks too much.

538
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,808
Such men are dangerous."

539
00:30:24,842 --> 00:30:27,561
Wow, you can recite
Shakespeare?

540
00:30:28,713 --> 00:30:29,870
Next you're gonna tell me

541
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:33,267
you have a copy of Planet Comics
number one in your purse.

542
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,418
Jim.

543
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,873
Jim.

544
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,302
Just a-- I'll be out
in a second.

545
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,385
You gonna ask a girl in?

546
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,224
You should take up smoking.

547
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,693
Covers the smell
of burnt papers.

548
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,896
Did they teach you
that in spy school

549
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,732
along with the use of fellatio
as a tool of persuasion?

550
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:44,785
No. That I learned
in high school.

551
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:50,574
Did you want me to apologize

552
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,743
for the blowjob?

553
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:56,246
I want you to go back
to wherever they found you.

554
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:58,465
I found them, same as you.

555
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,716
Oh, no.

556
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,135
We are not the same.

557
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,255
The class struggle uses whatever
human material is available

558
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,758
- to fulfill its objectives.
- I'm not a Communist.

559
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,593
I only reached out
to your associates

560
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,095
because the Army
shot my friend.

561
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,932
<i>The Oriental.</i>

562
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,401
- I read your file.
- His name was Sid.

563
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,320
Do you think that they
would have killed Sid

564
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,105
if he'd looked like you?

565
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:24,658
If you're not a Communist,

566
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,444
why are you risking your own
neck to give them a bomb?

567
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,614
Not a bomb, the bomb.

568
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,916
It's-- it's the queen.

569
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,335
Do you--

570
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,622
do you ever play chess?

571
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,791
The queen is the most powerful
piece on the chessboard.

572
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,260
That's what we're
building here

573
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,297
for an army that shoots its own citizens.

574
00:32:47,948 --> 00:32:50,100
<i>If we are the only ones
who have it,</i>

575
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,519
we'll probably blow up
the world.

576
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,354
But if--

577
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,357
if Stalin has a bomb
in his pocket, too,

578
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,610
the game ends in a draw.

579
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,362
It's a stalemate.
Nobody dies.

580
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,818
I was trying to do
the right thing.

581
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,620
No, you were.

582
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,990
- You still are.
- Really?

583
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:17,044
Didn't feel that way when I was shoving
a body in the trunk of a Buick.

584
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,829
What?

585
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,164
Did they leave that detail
out of my file?

586
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:23,500
Hmm? Your comrade
killed a guy

587
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,052
two feet away from me.

588
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,888
<i>Now I can't sleep at night.</i>

589
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,731
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

590
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,850
It was military intelligence.
It doesn't matter.

591
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,352
I'm all through with
the class struggle.

592
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,359
They're expecting
weekly reports

593
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,528
and I'm supposed
to deliver them.

594
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:54,019
Yeah, well, I hope they
don't shoot the messenger.

595
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,035
You don't get it.

596
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,337
They killed
a government agent.

597
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,007
What do you think they're gonna
do to a dropout from Pittsburgh

598
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,878
or to a scientist
who's got cold feet?

599
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:18,221
Even if--

600
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:20,190
even if I wanted to help,

601
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,026
the project's been
reorganized,

602
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,562
I'm on the C team.
I don't have access anymore.

603
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:28,115
Not to the kind of
information they want.

604
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,569
Well, you're the genius.

605
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,371
Right?

606
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,790
What are we gonna do?

607
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,671
Hey.

608
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,428
You know, uh,

609
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,897
when Helen Prins showed
up here, that was, uh--

610
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,266
that was about
the test we're planning.

611
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,486
- I promise you have nothing to worry about.
- I know.

612
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,443
Aside from that,
"Mrs. Lincoln,"

613
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,113
it was a lovely evening.

614
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,620
You should have
Robert Oppenheimer's job.

615
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,301
Spy killer on guard duty.

616
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:42,472
The colonel must be
scared of this broad.

617
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:47,052
<i>Have fun with
Mrs. Winter.</i>

618
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:19,644
_

619
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,154
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, trust me.

620
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,692
I got 'em from one
of the Indian maids.

621
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:38,912
She makes them herself.
This is real silver.

622
00:36:40,414 --> 00:36:42,365
Yeah.

623
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,669
That'll work.

624
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:50,257
You got any last advice
before I walk the plank?

625
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,878
Uh, well, um,

626
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,547
yes, as a matter of fact.

627
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,382
Um...

628
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,023
You should take the
assignment with G group.

629
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:08,892
It doesn't matter what you
think of Charlie Isaacs.

630
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,611
This test--

631
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,448
this test is the start
of a whole new era.

632
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,869
This is like Auro's
interplanetary cruise ship

633
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,987
crash-landing
on Jupiter.

634
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,707
I don't know, I--

635
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,126
I just-- I don't need
the prestige.

636
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,995
- Maybe most guys do, but--
- You have food in your teeth.

637
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,550
I am telling you
the truth, buddy.

638
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,385
No one else is gonna.

639
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,805
You cannot let an opportunity
like this pass you up.

640
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,594
I ju-- it's just--

641
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,264
I like working with you.

642
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,482
I wouldn't know
what to do without you.

643
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,936
That's, um--

644
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:56,606
that's why you're gonna convince
Isaacs to put me on the team, too.

645
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,109
You know my work.
He'll listen to you.

646
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,996
Let's go to Jupiter together.

647
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,501
Bombs away.

648
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,671
Bombs away.

649
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,843
Well, here we go.

650
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,263
Crosley, wait up.

651
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,600
Whoo!

652
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,554
<i>Whoo!</i>

653
00:38:57,547 --> 00:39:01,166
Do you have any idea what kind
of a man you're working for?

654
00:39:03,002 --> 00:39:04,903
You say you love Callie?

655
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:08,620
This is quite a way
of showing it.

656
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,562
Callie drove to Canada
this morning with her aunt.

657
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:16,097
She's safe.

658
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:22,471
You spoke to her?

659
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:24,489
Colonel lets me use his
phone to talk to my folks

660
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:26,742
when he's out and no one
monitors the line.

661
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:32,748
What other perks do you
get for turning me in?

662
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:40,839
- Crystal City, Texas.
- What's that?

663
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:43,792
Your next plum assignment?

664
00:39:45,545 --> 00:39:47,763
It's where they're keeping
your husband.

665
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:54,386
And why should I take
your word for that?

666
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:57,556
You don't have to.

667
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:02,227
I can get you as far
as the Lamy train depot.

668
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,409
All right.
You're good to go.

669
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:19,571
- Have a good evening.
-<i> You have a good night.</i>

670
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,934
_

671
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,089
<i>It's called dance therapy.</i>

672
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:04,956
When we're focused
on our feet,

673
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:06,591
we're distracted
from our brains.

674
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:08,760
The body is spinning,
the mind is still.

675
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:11,179
My wife doesn't need
waltzing lessons.

676
00:41:11,214 --> 00:41:13,682
It's been three months.
I've yet to hear a diagnosis,

677
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,517
much less a prognosis.

678
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,853
It's fascinating, really.

679
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:21,223
- The science is so new.
- Psychiatry, is it a science?

680
00:41:22,975 --> 00:41:25,455
Dr. Winter, would you like
to discuss this privately?

681
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:28,647
- No, I wouldn't.
- The treatment takes time, Frank.

682
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:30,949
Yes, but do you feel better?

683
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:33,201
Every week
you're less yourself.

684
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:35,821
Self is a fluid concept.

685
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:38,790
- Often in the first year of treatment--
- The first year?

686
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:40,709
I can understand

687
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:43,161
why certainties would be appealing
to a man in your field.

688
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:46,498
Isn't there a superego somewhere that
requires your attention, Doctor?

689
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,335
Would you come with me
right now?

690
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:52,220
We've barely begun
the psychoanalysis.

691
00:41:52,255 --> 00:41:55,841
- We have a lot of work to do.
- Your work is out there.

692
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:59,010
- Dr. Winter, perhaps we might look at a--
- We can leave Ithaca.

693
00:41:59,012 --> 00:42:01,346
- We can make a fresh start.
- Have you been fired again?

694
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:03,648
Any sudden change at this
stage of her treatment--

695
00:42:03,683 --> 00:42:06,017
In the last month, I have
fielded recruiting calls

696
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:08,070
from three universities.

697
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:10,522
My vote is Princeton,
but it's your decision.

698
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:12,157
It's your career.

699
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:14,576
Liza, they're recruiting you.

700
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:20,198
- Liza.
- Princeton will give you a dedicated lab.

701
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,369
Dr. Winter, let's continue
this discussion in my office.

702
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:26,588
It's not you that's sick.

703
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:28,957
It's this place.

704
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:37,048
<i>And don't forget we
have the Friedmans at 6:00.</i>

705
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,217
<i>I know it's downtown,
but I don't wanna hear it.</i>

706
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:41,720
Not after you dragged me to Bensonhurst
for that supper last week.

707
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:47,359
You with a beard.

708
00:42:47,393 --> 00:42:49,561
Now that's something
I'll never cotton to.

709
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,565
Office hours are
Mondays at 4:00.

710
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:55,856
I'm afraid it can't wait.

711
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:04,075
Oh!

712
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:05,911
Good to see you, Glen.

713
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:08,880
I'd ask how on earth,

714
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:10,582
but I don't want to know.

715
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:14,252
Miriam, this is
Dr. Liza Winter.

716
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,423
We were on the same
scientific retreat last year.

717
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:19,975
In Quebec.

718
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:22,477
I hope you fared better
than Glen in all that snow.

719
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:25,263
Worse, actually.

720
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:27,065
Miriam, would you
give us a minute?

721
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:29,317
It was nice to meet you.

722
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,541
That's my companion.

723
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:40,078
- The provost's sister.
- Oh.

724
00:43:40,512 --> 00:43:43,398
Seems as though you
landed on your feet.

725
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,951
Don't be fooled.

726
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:47,836
The pyramids look grand, too,

727
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,788
but they're still tombs.

728
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,199
Every physicist worth a title is
back where we both came from.

729
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:55,161
Glen...

730
00:43:56,795 --> 00:43:58,180
Frank's in trouble.

731
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:02,300
Heavy is the head, eh?

732
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:05,437
What, he send you here
to crib my calculus notes?

733
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:07,806
Frank never took that job.

734
00:44:07,857 --> 00:44:11,276
He disappeared
same time you did.

735
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,945
I think he's in Texas.

736
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,614
What the hell's in Texas?

737
00:44:15,648 --> 00:44:18,817
A Department of Justice
internment camp.

738
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,157
Look, one thing
I know about Frank,

739
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,661
he always manages to find a
chair when the music stops.

740
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:32,380
This one might be
electrified.

741
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:38,503
Helping your husband is what
landed me back here in purgatory.

742
00:44:38,505 --> 00:44:41,006
There are things that
you don't know, Liza.

743
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:43,141
I know that Frank dragged
me across that desert

744
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:45,575
so that you two could
build an atomic bomb.

745
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:49,397
Is there anything else?

746
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:54,587
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:57,189
A long time ago,

748
00:44:58,524 --> 00:45:01,393
I was stuck in a place
that I didn't belong.

749
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:03,862
I almost forgot who I was

750
00:45:03,864 --> 00:45:05,747
and then Frank remembered.

751
00:45:05,781 --> 00:45:09,034
Whatever happened between
you two, whatever he did,

752
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:10,869
that is not him.

753
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,040
That place, that bomb turned
him into someone else.

754
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:22,931
I don't have any
strings left to pull.

755
00:45:26,218 --> 00:45:27,886
What would Frank do?

756
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:52,243
He's expecting you.

757
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:13,932
Dr. Einstein.

758
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,819
I believe you know
my husband.

759

1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,051
<i>Previously on Manhattan...</i>

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,485
You're building an atomic bomb.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,369
What I would like
is my share of the plutonium.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,410
If Frank could prove that implosion
was more than a fairy tale,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,881
-I'd give him all the plutonium he wants.
-Fine.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,246
I don't feel bad for you.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,041
I feel bad for those suckers in your group
that you're taking down with you.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,241
Get home safe.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,328
I don't know what's gotten into him
since we got here.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,562
<i>Half the time he's brooding
and the other half...</i>

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,484
<i>He can't keep his hands to himself.</i>

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,369
You got to help me, Frank.
Please, I'm not a spy.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,885
Sid Liao is not a traitor.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,531
Forty eight hours ago,
our group was on the chopping block.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,125
Now we're back in this office.

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,321
You said you would protect Sid.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,323
Your group is intact.
You got what you asked for.

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,607
Outside parties have taken an interest
in your man.

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,411
Technically, you're nowhere
talking to no one.

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,567
I'm not a spy.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,125
The plutonium will remain
with Dr. Akley's group.

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,841
He's got my sidearm.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,601
Show me your pass.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,691
What did I do?

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:55,320
b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,610
Private Dunlavey.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,441
Ready, sir.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,126
Get your trunks. Colonel's been waiting.

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,202
I-I didn't know I was supposed to pack.

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,930
Am I being discharged?

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,884
Swim out to the middle.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,730
I don't swim well. It's...

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,802
It's landlocked where I'm from.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,441
Well, then you'll be the first guy
in history to drown in a desert.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,248
Private, I need a full report
of what happened at the gate.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,201
What, here?

38
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,449
It was 1900 hours.

39
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,001
I saw that the driver had a weapon

40
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,400
and I didn't have time to think, sir.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,364
Maybe I could have disarmed him
or shot to wound?

42
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,523
You fired on a civilian, soldier.
I need answers, not questions.

43
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,723
Sir, I was afraid for the safety
of my fellow soldier.

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,001
Dunlavey,

45
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,401
you are hereby promoted to the rank of E3

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,289
for bravery against enemy attack.

47
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,081
Effective today, you'll work in my office,
reporting directly to me.

48
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,802
I... I don't understand, sir.

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,044
Walls in this base are so thin
they don't need ears.

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,210
When the rest of the Hill finds out
that you pulled the trigger,

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,408
people are gonna come
to you with questions.

52
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,211
- I expect you to tell the truth.
-Yes, sir. Of course.

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,607
You ensured the safety of this base.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,048
Sid Liao attempted to abscond
with highly classified materials

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,769
which you personally recovered
from under the floor mats.

56
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,401
Sir,

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,684
we searched Liao's car.

58
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,322
That's right, Private First Class.

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,526
You did.

60
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,091
<i>Attention. Your attention, please.</i>

61
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,607
<i>A secure community
is a productive community.</i>

62
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,967
<i>And we are a community at war.</i>

63
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,963
<i>After the events of this week,</i>

64
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,563
<i>the Army is instituting new directives
of compartmentalization</i>

65
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,808
<i>to ensure the continued security of our work
and of the citizens in our care.</i>

66
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,165
<i>From this day forward,</i>

67
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,005
<i>each worker will have access
to the information required</i>

68
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,004
<i>to carry out his duties and nothing more.</i>

69
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,962
<i>All residents and workers,
regardless of clearance level,</i>

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,850
<i>are now subject to random searches.</i>

71
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,130
<i>Socializing with persons outside
of this community is prohibited.</i>

72
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,606
<i>Concerned citizens should report any
suspicious activity to the security office.</i>

73
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,368
<i>These measures will reinforce
the sense of privacy</i>

74
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,445
<i>and peace of mind this community enjoys.</i>

75
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,481
<i>Any failure to adhere to these policies</i>

76
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,286
<i>will be deemed a violation
of the Federal Espionage Act.</i>

77
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,011
<i>Cooperation is appreciated.</i>

78
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,891
Doesn't look like much,

79
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,122
but I suppose bees aren't choosy.

80
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,810
- Ha.
- There's a

81
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,645
swarm over in the cottonwoods by the PX.

82
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,850
Can't you just spray them?

83
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,167
Oh, it's not a trap. It's an artificial hive.
I wanna study them.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,001
Oh.

85
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,321
I've been meaning to drop by
and apologize. I...

86
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,811
About the other night.

87
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,803
Frank's not very good at...

88
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,371
Socializing?

89
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,121
Um, I found this

90
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,005
after our dinner.

91
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,162
Does it belong to your daughter?

92
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,085
It was a present from her aunt.
Where on earth did you find it?

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,811
In my dresser drawer, stuck to a brassiere.

94
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,762
Well, Callie will be so grateful.

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,488
Wonder who they're gonna murder today.

96
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,648
The whole thing is horrible.

97
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,322
But they say the spy had a gun.

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,841
The "spy" was a 26-year-old boy
from Frank's group.

99
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,407
Sorry.

100
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,726
What are we supposed to do with it?

101
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,323
Someone should reach out to Annie.

102
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,245
The Army would approve a call
to Mussolini before Sid Liao's wife.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,560
Well, the Army can approve my dick.

104
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,401
Sorry.

105
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,249
Sid loaned me his toothbrush once.

106
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,241
Really?

107
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,685
That's repulsive.

108
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,524
Someone stole mine.

109
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,450
I'm just saying,
I lived two doors down from the guy.

110
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,364
- How did we not see this coming?
- Because he wasn't a spy.

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,326
What's the difference now?

112
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,482
The difference is now this entire
godforsaken group

113
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,806
is gonna have its bunks
tossed every night.

114
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,281
- No, not the guy who sold him out.
-And for the hundredth time, Meeks...

115
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,010
Someone reported him to the Army.

116
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,651
You'd sell yourself out if you thought
it would help your career.

117
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,929
You know what? If I had overturned a spook,
I wouldn't feel one ounce of guilt.

118
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,444
They found stolen files in his car.
The MP told me.

119
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,367
What do you think they did with the body?

120
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,647
Who's covering the spectrum analysis?

121
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,045
That was Sid's project.

122
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
Now it's yours.

123
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,166
Who's been in my office?

124
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,402
It was just a catnap
and it was two weeks ago.

125
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,720
The shockwave analysis, X-ray studies,
tamper design, they're all gone.

126
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,323
Those were all Sid's assignments.

127
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,249
Goddamn Army.

128
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,765
I heard he was a commie.

129
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,571
Spy or not, I don't love the idea
of some yahoo at the gate

130
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,364
playing jury and executioner.

131
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,646
From now on we're supposed
to call plutonium "product."

132
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,326
And the code for uranium is "tube alloy."

133
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,926
I gave Martha a little tube alloy last night.

134
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,204
Does the Army have a code for
"I can't hear myself think"?

135
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,166
What say I buy you a sandwich, Charles?

136
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,969
You've worked through lunch
every day this week.

137
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,963
Dr. Akley asked me to calculate

138
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,884
the exact velocity
of every neutron in Thin Man.

139
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,121
Diffusion alone could take a month.

140
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,770
You know, Reed Akley
was my graduate advisor at Chicago.

141
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,087
Start of the semester,
he handed me a problem to work on,

142
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,051
and after a week with no sleep, I realized
it was basically Fermat's last theorem.

143
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,610
Completely unsolvable.

144
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,364
Akley was hazing me.

145
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,569
I've known fellows like you.

146
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,490
You beat the Jew quotas.

147
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,767
You slip in the faculty club
with a blazer and a smile.

148
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,923
You spent your whole life fighting
your way to the top of the mountain.

149
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,405
Take a look around.

150
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,443
This group in this room,

151
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,246
it's Everest.

152
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,164
Quit acting like a Sherpa.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,209
Hey, Captain Marvel. Finally got
something to write home about, huh?

154
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,770
What went through your head
when you shot him?

155
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,640
- Who told you it was me?
- We know what went through the Jap's head.

156
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,721
He was Chinese.

157
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,690
Buddy who was at Attu Island told me
brains smell like circus peanuts.

158
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,841
Is that true?

159
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,365
I don't know.

160
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,771
I've never been to the circus.

161
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,285
God damn, Iowa.

162
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,763
Already popped a spy this week.
You gonna pop your cherry, too?

163
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,886
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

164
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,127
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

165
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,646
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

166
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,446
Corps of Engineers sent me
to the security offices.

167
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,525
Security sent me to G2.
G2 sent me back to the engineers.

168
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,250
Franz Kafka ought to sue
the US Army for plagiarism.

169
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,446
Where are the files?

170
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,524
The Army has taken a fine-toothed comb
to everything Sid Liao touched.

171
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,568
It could be two weeks
before we get 'em back.

172
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,564
- It could be two months.
-Goddamn test blew up in our face.

173
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,723
Without those files,
we'll never figure out why.

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,924
Well, all the king's horses
and all the king's men...

175
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,808
Listen, there's another way.

176
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,485
Akley's guys.

177
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,404
They ran their own shockwave studies.

178
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,363
Detonated everything
that wasn't nailed to the ground.

179
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,051
We can move forward using their math.

180
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,929
That's a bullshit waste of time.

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,082
Akley understands
the situation we're in, okay?

182
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,650
Just pay him a visit.

183
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,767
Kiss the ring if you have to.

184
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,649
Otherwise, that kid,

185
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,570
he died for nothing.

186
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,081
Here you go.

187
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,810
I'm here to see Reed Akley.

188
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,490
You've been guarding this post since April.

189
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,528
How many times have you
seen me walk through it?

190
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,244
That was before the incident at the gate.

191
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,607
You need a new pass
from the security office.

192
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,210
That could take a week.

193
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,521
Here.

194
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,527
Here's, um...
Here's 10 ration stamps.

195
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,726
Go get him.

196
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,245
They do this for free?

197
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,882
You don't even have to tip them?

198
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,050
You could invite one of them in
for a glass of lemonade.

199
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,564
I drive in circles on Pajarito Road
just to get the car dirty again.

200
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,286
They work so hard.

201
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,206
You know they've been pulling
double shifts at the gate?

202
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,009
All because of one bad apple.

203
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,766
More like one bad Japple.
This is why God invented internment camps.

204
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,848
Dot, the boy was Chinese.

205
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,764
I stamped his badge myself
in the credentials office.

206
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,763
Abby, did you get your work credential yet?

207
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,730
Oh, mother of a 3-year-old
is plenty of job for me.

208
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,401
We all work, dear.

209
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,289
Eleanor Roosevelt says
we mustn't stand in our husband's shadow.

210
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,808
If I looked like Eleanor Roosevelt,
I'd stand as far in the shadows as possible.

211
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,042
I don't know how to do anything.

212
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,201
Nonsense.

213
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,205
Gladys is expecting a visit from the stork.
You can take over her job.

214
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,521
You seem like a very good listener.

215
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,806
Would you mind looking under my hood?

216
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,530
Frank, what can I do for you?

217
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,881
You can go get your boss.
I need to talk to a grown-up.

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,604
Dr. Akley doesn't take walk-ins.

219
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,563
I'm the best you're gonna do.

220
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,647
The Army confiscated
half my files last night.

221
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,484
I'm sorry to hear that.

222
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,568
And I'm sorry to hear about
what happened to your guy.

223
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,122
I don't need your sympathy.
I need Akley's shockwave studies.

224
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,368
You insult me every time we talk.

225
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,848
- You throw a lousy dinner party.
- Jesus Christ.

226
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,561
But honestly, if it wasn't for
the new security rules, I'd help you, Frank.

227
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,961
Science depends on
the free exchange of ideas.

228
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,170
And as much as it galls me to say it,
implosion is an elegant solution.

229
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,890
Then go get me the shockwave study.

230
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,964
And lose my job?
Never mind the shit I took from my group

231
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,122
after you conned me
into giving you the plutonium.

232
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,249
Akley dismisses implosion because
he doesn't believe it'll win this war,

233
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,651
that's fine.

234
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,724
But someone who knows it'll work
but won't help because he's scared

235
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,246
of being teased by a bunch of sycophants?

236
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,805
You're worthless.

237
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,005
And you're a self-righteous old man
on his professional deathbed.

238
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,363
I've made sacrifices for this project
you couldn't possibly fathom.

239
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,170
Watch out for a man on his deathbed.
He's got nothing to lose.

240
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,050
Akley might not know what you really are,

241
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,520
but I do.

242
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,121
Effective yielding stress,
300,000 pounds per square inch.

243
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,807
Detonation velocity,
6,700 meters per second.

244
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,891
Heat of explosion, 650 calories per gram.

245
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,691
What was the...
What was the collapse ratio again?

246
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,886
Uh, I don't know, .546?

247
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,803
No, .564.

248
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,006
Damn it.

249
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,560
We need that shockwave study.

250
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,962
I cornered Akley at the gate.
The son of a bitch stonewalled me.

251
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,967
I don't know if he's scared
to break compartmentalization

252
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,520
or he just enjoys watching us
twist in the wind.

253
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,004
His math was flawless.

254
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,483
Immutable laws of physics.
It should have worked.

255
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,927
A lot of things should have worked, Frank.

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,924
But the law doesn't
take into account human error.

257
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,765
So here we are.

258
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,450
The kid's gone.

259
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,410
So are his files.

260
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,365
We're going over Akley's head.

261
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,481
I just never thought
we'd be a two-income family.

262
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,210
- Forty cents an hour?
- You all right?

263
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,931
More like one income
and some pocket change.

264
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,529
If Daddy found out I was getting a job,
he'd keel over.

265
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,523
Maybe we should call and tell him.

266
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,407
You're a modern woman.

267
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,130
- Ah! Charlie.
- I think it's sexy.

268
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,885
Anyways, they haven't hired me yet.
Apparently I have to pass an exam.

269
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,564
You know I don't test well.

270
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,641
It's not that kind of test.

271
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,246
You know, Liza Winter failed it
and she's a Ph.D.

272
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,970
I heard that's why she doesn't work.

273
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,881
I wish her husband failed it.

274
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,491
<i>Attention. Due to heightened security</i>

275
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,564
<i>all residents on the Hill may be
subject to random searches.</i>

276
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,042
If I didn't know any better, Mrs. Isaacs,
I'd think you actually want this job.

277
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,602
No, I don't want the job.
I want them to want me for the job.

278
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,448
Sit back and relax.
There are no wrong answers.

279
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,251
How many alcoholic beverages
do you consume per week?

280
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,922
Um... A little Manischewitz at Passover.

281
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,004
Hm. What is the total value
of your household assets?

282
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,329
Charlie and I have just over $900
in a savings account at Middlesex Bank.

283
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,325
And we own a car.

284
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,241
And...

285
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,281
There's a separate trust in my name.

286
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,008
The amount is around 200,000.

287
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,890
Did you know Sidney James Liao?

288
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,201
No.

289
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,163
Have you ever been charged with
or convicted of a crime?

290
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,241
Yes.

291
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,926
Have you ever been charged with
or convicted of a felony?

292
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,087
Yes.

293
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,411
I borrowed
my piano teacher's Studebaker.

294
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,960
It was a misunderstanding
and she dropped the charges.

295
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,045
Have you ever had relations
with a man outside your marriage?

296
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,967
No.

297
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,250
Have you ever been an officer
or a member of an organization

298
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,529
dedicated to the violent overthrow
of the United States Government?

299
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,481
Um...

300
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,441
No.

301
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,088
The Colonel's not in.

302
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,250
- Well, where is he? I will go to him.
- He doesn't wish to see you, Dr. Winter.

303
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,161
Tell him to wish in one hand
and shit in the other.

304
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,083
See which fills up first.

305
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,289
Make sure he's
not allowed back into this building.

306
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,765
Right this way, ma'am.

307
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,600
Badge.

308
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,440
Thank you, ma'am.

309
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,091
Straight down the hall.

310
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,004
You passed with flying colors.

311
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,721
Truth is, this job is just like Harvard.
Getting in is the hardest part.

312
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,926
Oh, good.

313
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,851
Okay, suspicious words and phrases.

314
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,127
Updated hourly since
the shootout at O.K. Corral.

315
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,282
- All right.
- You hear any of these words,

316
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,371
you're gonna press this button
and security will hop on the line.

317
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,849
You can't say "chop suey"?

318
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,205
- None of us speaks Chinese, so no.
- Oh.

319
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,201
Anyway, Dr. Oppenheimer is 146.
Maintenance is 138. Colonel is 99.

320
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,850
Where's the directory?

321
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,764
- Oh.
- Do not answer that.

322
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,882
What did they ask that was so bad?

323
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,809
Could be, "What time is it there?"
"What did you do at work today?"

324
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,641
Mmm-mmm. He wanted to know if she was
cooking sloppy joes for dinner.

325
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,571
What's wrong with that?

326
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,641
Nothing.

327
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,165
They were boring me.

328
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,881
- I'm Abby.
- Elodie.

329
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,885
<i>Enchantée.</i>

330
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,611
<i>Enchantée.</i>

331
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,761
Charlie, join us at the PX?

332
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,411
Or are you gonna keep pondering
the mysteries of your navel?

333
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,403
I brought leftovers, thanks.

334
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,727
Well, we can set up a scholarship fund

335
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,643
if your wife's not giving
you enough lunch money.

336
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,007
At least then you could say
that you achieved something today.

337
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,043
You haven't written
on that board in two days.

338
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,842
Physics is 90% thinking,
9% writing, and 1% talking.

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,287
I never met so many
one-percenters in my life.

340
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,283
For the last three months,
while you've been making your name

341
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,727
writing school papers
and eating Cracker Jacks at Fenway,

342
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,690
we've been stuck in this desert shithole
working six days a week.

343
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,251
Now I know another tortured genius who
pisses on everyone from his high horse.

344
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,330
He's got an office in
the old groundskeeper's shed out back.

345
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,801
If you're not gonna join this group,

346
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,281
maybe you should go share
your leftovers with Frank Winter, hmm?

347
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,202
You want me to join the group?

348
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,767
All right.

349
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,920
How long you been working on this for?
A week?

350
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,960
I've known fellows like you, too.

351
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,880
Vacuous. The empty space between stars.

352
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,086
Two weeks?

353
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,401
See, there is no group.

354
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,646
There's Reed Akley

355
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,165
and there's me.

356
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,129
And the biggest mystery

357
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,163
I've been pondering since I got here,

358
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,560
is what the hell the rest of you've been
doing for the last three months?

359
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,805
Oh! Oh, my lord!

360
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,762
- Oh!
- Do you need security?

361
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,969
No, no, no. It's nothing like that. It's a...

362
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,046
It's a personal matter.

363
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,525
<i>Oui</i>.

364
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,250
Tuesday, <i>Madame</i> Cook.

365
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,802
She's in Ohio and her amour
is on the payphone by the PX.

366
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,250
I've used that phone.

367
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,164
Oh, I hope the janitor wiped the mouthpiece.

368
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,447
Enjoy being a little fly on this wall
learning all your neighbors' dirty laundry.

369
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,600
And then you tell me all the good stuff
and we decide who to blackmail. Hmm?

370
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,642
You know, I've seen you before.
I think we're neighbors.

371
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,926
Ah. What a small town.

372
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,644
Well, I guess we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

373
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,611
Can I help you?

374
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,727
Oh, ma'am, I'm PFC Dunlavey.

375
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,526
Is your husband home?

376
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,727
Husband?

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,490
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.

378
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,483
Are you Mrs. Winter? We...

379
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,361
We have some questions for Dr. Winter.
I work with Colonel Cox.

380
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,765
Is Dr. Winter here?

381
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,611
- I need to speak to him about, uh, Sid Liao.
- Sid?

382
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,083
Brilliant mathematician.

383
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,571
Terrible punster.

384
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,203
I suppose the only bright side
is that Grace is only five years old,

385
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,886
so in a couple of years
she won't even remember him.

386
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,249
I didn't know that Sid had a family.

387
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,925
Did you ever even meet him?

388
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,400
Only very briefly.

389
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,287
And where was that?

390
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,481
Um...

391
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,809
In his final moments.

392
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,201
It became my responsibility
to ensure the safety of the base.

393
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,881
You were at the gate?

394
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,849
He drew a weapon, ma'am.
I...

395
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,286
I didn't have time to think.

396
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,082
They've got a chaplain on the Hill,
but he's a Baptist.

397
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,924
He doesn't take confession.

398
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,170
I said 20 Our Fathers,
but I'm not sure it's enough.

399
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,883
Please, take a seat.

400
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,607
So...

401
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,641
Mr. Dunlavey, where do you call home?

402
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,647
- Jones County, Iowa.
- Iowa?

403
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,001
We drove through Iowa on our way out here.
It's beautiful country.

404
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,561
- Your people are farmers?
- Corn mostly.

405
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,130
You got hit by the Dust Bowl?

406
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,165
Lost half our crop.

407
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,328
So then you decided to enlist?

408
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,686
Oh, no, ma'am, we make do all right.
I just...

409
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,927
I couldn't sit back
with what's happening over there.

410
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,601
Right.

411
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,161
So what is it you want to know about Sid?

412
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,200
Do you think...

413
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,209
- Was he really...
- A spy?

414
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,246
Honestly,

415
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,690
I don't know what label to put on Sid Liao.

416
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,488
Spy, scientist. I...

417
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,450
I do know

418
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,369
that I'm sorry he's gone.

419
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,645
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,884
Is it true you found
confidential documents in his car?

421
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,569
I, um...

422
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,882
I recovered them from under the floor mat.

423
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,448
Dr. Winter, sir,
I'm Private First Class Dunlavey.

424
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,160
Give us a minute.

425
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,409
First class since when?

426
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,364
They told me he was shot by a private.

427
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,323
I wanted to say how sorry I am for your loss.

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,809
You got nothing to apologize for.

429
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,002
You did what you had to do.

430
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,811
It'll take the four of us weeks
to reconstruct Sid's work.

431
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,843
Guy could get through
a differential equation

432
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,082
faster than I can get through a hamburger.

433
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,601
He had a shortcut.
He was gonna show me.

434
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,365
Maybe it was sorcery.
Oriental shamanism.

435
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,965
Don't talk about him.

436
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,561
Oh.

437
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,531
Pretty sure his wife was
the last person to wash these.

438
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,329
What is that?

439
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,921
Spurs.

440
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,450
He bought them in Santa Fe.

441
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,526
Said that he wanted to be
the first Chinese cowboy.

442
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,570
Remember that time he tried
to get the Indian maids

443
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,722
to reenact Custer's Last Stand?

444
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,450
Oh, my God.

445
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,690
Liao was Custer.

446
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,281
Put it back.

447
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,280
That boy,

448
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,321
he was just looking for someone to talk to.

449
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,169
Think he feels better now?

450
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,050
It'll be a long time before
any of us feels better.

451
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,050
You knew Sid Liao for five years, Frank.

452
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,566
Frank Winter.

453
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,881
What do you want?

454
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,090
We have reason to believe you're
in violation of US title code 18 chapter 37.

455
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,608
The Federal Espionage Act.

456
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,161
One of the guards tipped us off.
The file was in the lining of his bag.

457
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,891
He said he'd confess,
but he'd only talk to you, sir.

458
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,325
Hijacking classified papers.

459
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,728
Seems to be an epidemic around here.

460
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,771
- The chemical study of magnesium sulfate.
- Epsom salt.

461
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,046
If it falls into Hitler's hands,
he'll enjoy a warm bath.

462
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,285
You're a hard man to find.

463
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,205
I figured stealing a file
would get me an audience.

464
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,169
You paid off
one of my guards to turn you in?

465
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,970
Excuse me, Dr. Winter.
I have a prime rib that requires my attention.

466
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,170
I need Akley's shockwave studies.
He'll hand them over if you tell him to.

467
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,524
A man of your intelligence,

468
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,451
I'm sure you can understand
the concept of compartmentalization.

469
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,568
What's yours is yours, what's Akley's is his.

470
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,042
Everything in its own box.
Including my best mathematician.

471
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,605
Wars have casualties.

472
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,843
And the first casualty of war is truth.
Isn't that the saying?

473
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,684
The first casualty of this war

474
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,402
was a Polish hayseed with a Karabinek rifle
back in September, 1939.

475
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,883
Four years and a few million funerals ago.
Almost 40,000 of them Americans.

476
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,320
Your mathematician is a drop in the ocean.

477
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,241
You know, I've learned
a lot about Sid Liao this week.

478
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,527
He was a Japanese agent. He was a Stalinist.

479
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,570
No one seems to know
he was a private in the US Army.

480
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,609
Or that you signed his draft papers.

481
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,286
I'm assuming that's
a truth you'd like to bury.

482
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,921
Get up.

483
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,929
There are 147 different
extensions on the Hill.

484
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,526
I might not have your head for numbers,
but I already know half of them.

485
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,090
You can quiz me.

486
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,166
What did you do at work today?

487
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,321
Trick question.

488
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,129
If somebody asked that on the phone,
I'd have to cut in.

489
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,001
Hmm.

490
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,881
Hello.

491
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,927
Sorry.

492
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,006
Are you all right?

493
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,161
It's the dinner hour.

494
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,288
Can you tell the ladies
of the "Welcome Wagon"

495
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,129
that they're not welcome?

496
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,286
- Dr. Akley.
- Oh, please, call me Reed.

497
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,288
- It looks like home in here already.
- Oh.

498
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,409
May I borrow your husband
for a moment, please?

499
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,886
Yes, of course.

500
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,561
I understand we had
a little detonation in the lab today.

501
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,087
Those boys have a lot of bluster,
but you certainly did a number on them.

502
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,970
Nothing irreparable.
I imagine you'll apologize.

503
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,764
You have a long road ahead, Charlie.
You've only just arrived.

504
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,321
Is that why you gave me
an unsolvable problem?

505
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,361
Some kind of freshman hazing ritual?

506
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,329
I gave you the velocity distribution problem

507
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,529
because I think you're the only man
here who's capable of solving it.

508
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,171
You probably spent your whole life
surrounded by people

509
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,289
who weren't smart enough
to recognize how smart you are.

510
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,761
But I do. It's the reason
why I brought you here.

511
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,406
You are a once-in-a-generation mind.

512
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,647
Thank you, sir.

513
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,127
But I know someone even smarter than you.

514
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,486
When I met him, he was 25 years old

515
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,771
and he was already reimagining
quantum mechanics.

516
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,324
And at 30, he was a leading light in our field.

517
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,165
And now at 40, he could end
this war once and for all.

518
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,766
- Oppenheimer?
- Werner Heisenberg.

519
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,926
He's the world's most
brilliant scientific mind

520
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,887
and he's running Hitler's bomb project.

521
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,962
Never forget, Charlie,

522
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,651
that is the man you're competing with.

523
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,927
Just go through it. Just get through it.

524
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,731
Open your briefcase.

525
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,806
Like your buddies opened my friend's skull?

526
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,291
Maybe it was you.

527
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,320
Okay, Meeks, come on.

528
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,725
<i>Salud!</i>

529
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,170
Well, here's to the Chinaman.
May he rest in pieces.

530
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,685
Shut up, Crosley.

531
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,245
I dare you to say it again.

532
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,689
All 10 stone of you?
Meeks, I'm trembling.

533
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,241
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

534
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,326
Look, Crosley's a top-shelf horse's ass,
but we have no idea who sold Sid out.

535
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,124
I'll get the next round.

536
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,443
Two more for me and the spy killer.

537
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,646
Dismissed.

538
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,284
This is what happened
the last time I did you a favor.

539
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,447
I won't make that same mistake twice.

540
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,124
Do you know where the surviving
members of your group are right now?

541
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,204
They're drowning their sorrows
at the post exchange.

542
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,127
I have MPs parked outside.

543
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,367
You think the truth is on your side?

544
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,729
Let's bring them down here

545
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,168
and you can tell them exactly how
Sid Liao came to be lying in this box.

546
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,886
I don't wanna see you in my office again.
I don't wanna hear your name.

547
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,767
We're finished, understood?

548
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,641
Easy, virgin.

549
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,247
You're safer penetrating occupied France.

550
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,488
- You killed him.
- I'm sorry?

551
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,686
Private Weaver over there.

552
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,366
What was that last score?
A hundred balls to less than 20?

553
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,845
Just luck, I guess.

554
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,206
From what I hear,
we're the ones who are lucky

555
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,731
you were at East Gate the other night.

556
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,245
My roommate works nights.

557
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,926
How about you walk a girl home?

558
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,606
It's really noisy in here. I don't live too far.

559
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,842
Maybe someone else wants to play, Private.

560
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,641
You know, I had a friend
who would have run the table on you.

561
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,645
He was a geometry genius.

562
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,801
Get lost.

563
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,408
Just wanna know if the private here
ever got a chance

564
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,482
to play Sid Liao at straight pool.

565
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,685
What do you want from me?

566
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,921
Easy, easy!

567
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,651
It's all right. It's all right.
Come on, now, let's go have a beer.

568
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,284
Frank, are you all right?

569
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,170
It was six years.

570
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,480
Sid walked into my office
in Berkeley six years ago.

571
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,966
He was a college senior with a bad haircut.

572
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,764
When they told me
I could handpick my team,

573
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,371
he was my first call.

574
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,642
You didn't put him in that car.

575
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,569
Whatever we're doing here,

576
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,562
please tell me it's worth it.

577
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,525
If it works

578
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,162
we won't just end this war,

579
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,004
we'll end all war.

580
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,326
Forever.

581
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,842
Do you really believe that?

582
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,882
<i>We've never met</i>

583
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,808
<i>and I doubt we ever will.</i>

584
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,371
<i>I'm prohibited from disclosing who I am,</i>

585
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,885
<i>where I am,</i>

586
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,525
<i>or in what capacity I knew your husband.</i>

587
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,004
<i>But I did know him.</i>

588
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,568
<i>I wish I could tell you
some good came from his passing.</i>

589
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,442
<i>But it brought only pain.</i>

590
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,651
<i>There's more to be said.</i>

591
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,328
<i>I'm not at liberty to say it.</i>

592
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,131
<i>Not even permitted
to write your husband's name.</i>

593
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,524
<i>A man's name.</i>

594
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,931
<i>The very last thing a person holds on to.</i>

595
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,441
<i>Even after he leaves this world.</i>

596
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,606
<i>Tell his daughter he was dedicated.</i>

597
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,404
<i>He did his job.</i>

598
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,204
<i>And he did it Well.</i>

599
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,610
<i>He was a good man.</i>

600
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,449
<i>In that, I hope you find
some measure of comfort.</i>

601
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,281
Shit.

602
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,404
<i>I myself find solace knowing that,</i>

603
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,602
<i>nameless, though I may be,</i>

604
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,323
<i>we can at least connect in this small way.</i>

605
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,725
<i>Know you are in our thoughts and prayers.</i>

606
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,164
<i>Yours sincerely,</i>

607
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,804
<i>Number G-22.</i>

608
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,771
You did it.

609
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:02,800

<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,366
You're free to walk away from
this Hill anytime you like.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,042
Just because there may be a consequence,
doesn't mean you have no choice.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,051
- He touched me.
- What do you mean he touched you?

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,801
Stop it.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,726
He groped me and said something
about how he sees what you're doing,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,643
and he's waiting for you to slip up.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,051
Are you ready to start working?

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,009
Keep working on implosion for Frank?

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,401
- Are you gonna invite me in?
- I'm fresh out of whiskey.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,923
Who was that,
a Christmas caroler?

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,850
No, just a soldier looking for a good time.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,331
It's all poisoned.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,486
<i>Our clothes?</i>

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,080
Everything. It's all radioactive.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,689
<i>Command calls him Magpie.</i>

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,000
He has credible intelligence

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,526
their atomic program
is two months ahead of ours.

<i>- Nein!</i>
- Manfred.

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,561
Grete!

22
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,564
I know you don't fully understand this
American vogue for camping, tulip,

23
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,244
but everything must be experienced once.

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,687
Well, you didn't have to
experience the whole bottle.

25
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,091
Oh, didn't I?

26
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,001
You know, we've had,
I don't mind telling you,

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,682
a bit of a breakthrough
in old implosion town,

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,244
and it needed celebrating.

29
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,924
Oh, well, so you're not
at all curious about our triumph?

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,683
Well, we're not supposed
to talk about it, right?

31
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,730
Well, of course not, which should
make you twice as interested.

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,849
Hang compartmentalization.

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,445
- Helen, Helen.
- Yeah?

34
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,241
We've done it. We cracked shock waves.

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,762
Hogarth was wrong. You can govern them.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,806
- Oh, that's great.
- Guess how we solved the speed problem.

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,927
Uh...

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,407
I don't know.

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,084
Guess. Just guess. Take your best shot.

40
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,286
What?

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,009
Vary the burn rate?

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,128
My God, woman, you are superhuman.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,001
Yeah.

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,370
Yeah, that's it.

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,885
Do you know how many
months that took Frank?

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,725
I mean, I trust I can, obviously,
count on your discretion.

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,211
Burn rates sound like a great start,

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,487
but it doesn't put implosion
in the catbird seat.

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,605
Catbird seat?

50
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,921
Some of these Americanisms
you're picking up.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,970
- You been tuning in to Red Barber, have we?
- Huh!

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,486
Excuse me, ma'am.

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,088
I'd like to offer you this token

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,044
as a reminder of my fondest
and most well-intentioned best wishes.

55
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,725
No tokens.

56
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,481
Remember?

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,443
Yes, I know, I just...

58
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,689
Just having a laugh.

59
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,007
Make yourself at home.

60
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,048
We're going to need microphones.

61
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,805
- Excuse me?
- In these offices

62
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,121
and in the billets of your personal staff.

63
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,369
It's all in this order.

64
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,920
You'll have to clear
them all out on Thursday.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,650
Any pretext, go on a march.

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,326
You want to record every word in my office?

67
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,087
In my staff's homes?
Hell, why not the latrines?

68
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,162
- Don't be vulgar, Colonel.
- And who the hell's gonna sort through

69
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,648
40 phonograph records of pillow talk
and office gossip week in and week out?

70
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,404
- That's not your concern.
- Listen to me.

71
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,528
You may be king shit among
the pencil-necks back east,

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,648
but you don't bark orders at me.

73
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,851
- I know I'm not your superior officer.
- You're goddamn right.

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,407
After all, I had dinner with your
superior officer last night.

75
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,008
General Groves.
Your general's very upset, Colonel.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,801
He had a friend named Magpie,
remember him?

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,167
A little German fellow about yea big.

78
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,130
Well, no, now, actually about yea big.

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,043
- What are you talking about?
- The SS, those romantics,

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,724
cut off his head at the neck.

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,883
Not a little pencil neck like mine,
got a big bull neck like yours.

82
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,561
Magpie's dead.

83
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,928
And now we have no eyes on
Heisenberg because somebody talked.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,924
- Somebody right here...
- No one in my staff leaked any...

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,365
Who, then?

86
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,721
You see why we need microphones.

87
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,170
You say no one outside this
office knew about Magpie...

88
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,961
Or did someone know?

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,721
Colonel?

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,569
Methylphenobarbital.

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,689
Such a pretty name for an army sedative.

92
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,446
In the Pacific, they call them goofballs.

93
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,649
But here, they paint them robin's-egg blue

94
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,089
and feed them to hysterics.

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,925
It's clever.

96
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,689
You're not a hysteric.

97
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,411
It's better than a delusional.

98
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,686
I'm still sorry.

99
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,081
- I really am.
- You have nothing to be sorry for.

100
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,291
Other than almost burning down the house,
you are absolutely right.

101
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,449
Like it never happened.

102
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,965
So what's on your docket today?

103
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,690
More reading,

104
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,168
less railing against imaginary toxins.

105
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,204
- Pardon the interruption.
- Dr. Akley.

106
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,080
I thought you'd
be at the airfield by now.

107
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,323
Army pushed it back a few
hours for security reasons.

108
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,209
The mathematician in me
says the probability

109
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,568
of Hitler shooting me down
over Lubbock is fairly low.

110
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,686
- Charlie?
- Sir.

111
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,404
I've been watching you and Helen Prins.

112
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,731
I know what you're doing.

113
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,166
I never was sure why you wanted
her here in the first place.

114
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,730
Dr. Akley,

115
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,801
um...

116
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,767
I can explain.

117
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,650
- Family's everything, Charlie.
- Sir?

118
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,926
You're a married man.

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,570
Look, she's a good scientist.

120
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,003
I wouldn't have allowed her
in Thin Man if she weren't,

121
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,367
but the men in this group
are already starting to talk.

122
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,602
Now imagine what it would look like

123
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,685
to the leadership of this project if they
found out that you and Dr. Prins were...

124
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,329
- Entangled.
- Helen...

125
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,605
Fifteen years I've been with Rose.

126
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,445
Now,

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,370
I've been tempted, sure, we all have,

128
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,844
but Rose makes me who I am.

129
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,487
I don't know if it started at Site X,
but I know where it's gonna end.

130
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,728
I understand. I do.

131
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,801
Well...

132
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,086
Don't burn down the house
while I'm at the Capitol.

133
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,929
So, we have $100.

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,650
This is a strange game.

135
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,688
Oh, this is my favorite game.

136
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,963
<i>Évasion. Escape.</i>

137
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,842
Now, our $100, where shall we go?

138
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,361
Albuquerque.

139
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,481
Albuquerque?

140
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,848
Yes. No, all right. How about, um...

141
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,323
How about Paris?

142
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,802
Cherie, I do not think there
will be much Paris left.

143
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,763
I don't understand.
I thought this was pretend, right?

144
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,604
Paris was real for me, Abby.

145
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,211
Before the war, before Tom,
ladies lived there like the two of us.

146
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,804
Who were together, like this.

147
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,845
Only Without the lies.

148
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,170
Well, I guess it's true what
they say about the French.

149
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,529
That we do not delude ourselves?

150
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,043
That Paris is gone forever.

151
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,929
But maybe we can find another.

152
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,401
Mmm?

153
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,722
Tangier, where the giant Antaeus lived.

154
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,611
And today, Tangier is a free city

155
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,082
of artisans, lovers,

156
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,290
writers, renegades.

157
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
Even under Franco.

158
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,089
And war hasn't touched it.

159
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,004
What do you think?

160
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,927
It sounds better than Albuquerque.

161
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,605
You off to Washington to
hold Roosevelt's hand again?

162
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,765
Yeah, a couple days.

163
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,524
How's he looking, the old man?

164
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,606
Not good.

165
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,569
Truman will be sworn in
by the time they bring the car around.

166
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,884
What's it like being a scientist
without the science part?

167
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,207
What's it like running a department
without the department part?

168
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,644
I was sorry to hear about Glen.

169
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,680
What about him?

170
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,809
I heard he threw up the white flag.
Left implosion.

171
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,881
Went to go do admin work for Oppenheimer.

172
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,642
Glen Babbit pushing papers, unbelievable.

173
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,805
Brits must have really taken
the wind out of his sails, huh?

174
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,290
I work better alone anyway.

175
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,169
Well, my door's always open, Frank.

176
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,002
Save the bedside manner for Roosevelt.

177
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,488
Glen, I need to talk to you.

178
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,642
- Frank, look...
- So, what, that's it?

179
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,811
You go over my head?
I have to hear about it from Akley?

180
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,609
Oppenheimer needs
more hands in his office

181
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,524
and it looks to me like
you've got all the help you need.

182
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,924
- Jesus, Glen, I can't do this without you.
- You're gonna have to.

183
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,088
All right. All right, fine.

184
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,811
Listen, just keep your ears
open in there for me, okay?

185
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,043
If Akley comes in and mentions my name,

186
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,521
if you happen to catch a glimpse
of plutonium before it arrives...

187
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,965
No, Frank.

188
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,360
If you want to spend the rest of
the decade at Leavenworth, fine,

189
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,445
but I'm tired of the lies, of all of it.

190
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,041
Glen.

191
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,247
I think it's best if we
don't speak for a while.

192
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,131
Frank's wish list.

193
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,405
Read and burn.

194
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,483
Jesus, this will take two weeks.

195
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,164
Frank needs it in two days.

196
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,321
Frank doesn't have to fool

197
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,971
50 kind of smart guys into thinking
they're doing Akley's work

198
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,929
when they're actually doing Frank's.

199
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,964
What happened to you?

200
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,482
You smell like a brewery on fire.

201
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,766
I went camping.

202
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,249
- On a school night?
- Mmm-hmm.

203
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,201
Paul wanted love under the stars, so...

204
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,651
Well, I hope you don't talk in your sleep.

205
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,208
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Just don't tell Crosley anything.

206
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,124
Is this about me and Crosley
or is this about me and you?

207
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,010
Speaking of which,
Akley thinks that we're having an affair.

208
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,249
I told him I'd put a stop to it.

209
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,049
To the affair we're not having?

210
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,849
He thinks I'm in love with you.

211
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,766
I'm gonna open this door
and you are gonna break up with me.

212
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,761
You're an asshole.

213
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,807
Right. Perfect. Just like that.

214
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,842
- It's for the best, Helen.
- Get off me.

215
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,844
The famous Dr. Winter.

216
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,921
It's nice to finally match a face to the name.

217
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,001
Can I help you?

218
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,209
Yes, I certainly hope so.

219
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,405
Perhaps you'd like
to invite me in for a little chat.

220
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,290
You know, I'm not really in the mood
for houseguests, so if you'll excuse me.

221
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,885
You got a man killed.

222
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,045
Manfred Schlimmer.

223
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,842
A mutual friend
in Werner Heisenberg's office in Berlin.

224
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,251
He's dead.

225
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,681
I'm sorry to hear that.

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,001
Hmm.

227
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,610
But here's what so odd, Dr. Winter.

228
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,162
You weren't supposed to know
that Magpie existed at all.

229
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,127
Colonel Cox in his infinite
wisdom tells you about Magpie,

230
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,724
next thing we know,
our asset's head winds up in a box.

231
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,370
So, what, you think I sold
him out to Hermann Göring?

232
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,566
Oh, no, no.

233
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,204
I think it's far more complicated than that
because you are far more complicated.

234
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,724
You like complexity?

235
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,326
Why don't you try
quantum electrodynamics?

236
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,647
The only kind of math I'm any good at is...

237
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,883
What do you call it? Eliminating variables.

238
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,648
- Who else did you tell about Magpie?
- I keep secrets for a living.

239
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,846
Oh, yes.

240
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,730
Keeping secrets,
it's a lonely business, isn't it?

241
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,051
But you're not so lonely,
are you, Dr. Winter?

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,889
You inspire loyalty.

243
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,286
In my line of work,
that doesn't go unnoticed.

244
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,481
Think of Sid Liao, your star mathematician.

245
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,326
Just a kid and so loyal.

246
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,402
Not to his country, of course, to you.

247
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,889
And then there's Mr. Meeks.

248
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,448
A little, flimsy man
who would turn on a dime.

249
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,843
Once again, sweet nothings for old Frank.

250
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,046
What do you want from me?

251
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,011
And let's not forget the
curious affair of Glen Babbit.

252
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,721
Your mentor. What a colorful character.

253
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,448
And such colorful friends he has, too.

254
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,844
Not just standard-issue communists,

255
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,606
traitors who run atomic
programs for our enemies.

256
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,483
You collect people.

257
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,120
Dented people
with little cracks in their Bakelite...

258
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,924
Where the funniest impurities seep in.

259
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,243
The only question is
which one of these broken men

260
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,281
did you trust with the identity
of our friend in Berlin?

261
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,521
I didn't tell anyone.

262
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,447
Or maybe it wasn't a man.
Your wife, perhaps.

263
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,521
Your maid?

264
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,841
Bluffed his way
to the promised land.

265
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,091
Speak of the devil.

266
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,969
And the devil's wave
function shall collapse.

267
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,805
- Fellas.
Uh-oh, teacher caught us.

268
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,325
I take it Dr. Akley knows.

269
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,051
He plays. The parson's one vice.

270
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,407
Are you trying to make
Charlie feel left out, Bob?

271
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,002
He's here late building the pyramids
and we're just playing Egyptian Ratscrew.

272
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,765
Come on, Charlie, what do you say,
join the philistines?

273
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,808
No, um... I don't gamble.

274
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,764
See, now I don't think that's true.

275
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,244
What's the game?
It doesn't look like Egyptian Ratscrew.

276
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,484
Hold 'Em. Local delicacy.

277
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,369
Betting structure's like a chain reaction.

278
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,444
It's a dangerous game for a guy
who doesn't know when to quit.

279
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,325
Teach me.

280
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,129
About five minutes later, Frank
comes out of his office with the pig

281
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,168
and Meeks and I are
barely keeping it together.

282
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,244
He puts it on Crosley's
desk and says, dead serious,

283
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,250
"Does this mean something
in your country?"

284
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,003
- Right?
- Yeah, it was, um... It was quite a day.

285
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,560
- It was a great time.
- You should be on the radio.

286
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,246
- What are you talking about?
- Take me home, will you?

287
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,243
I have band practice in the morning.

288
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,731
Will I ever.

289
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,530
- Nighty-nighty.
- Good night.

290
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,281
Um...

291
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,846
Excuse us.

292
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,167
Would it have killed you
to laugh at Fritz's jokes?

293
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,483
Oh, that's what they were?

294
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,491
You're the one who wanted a date in public.

295
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,971
If it's such a torture, let's just go back to...

296
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,129
Screwing on the sly.

297
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,323
Helen, there's something I have to ask you.

298
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,890
Crosley...

299
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,360
Oh, shit.

300
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,131
Oh, my God.

301
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,441
Helen, I'm no fool, all right?

302
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,085
I know this is not what you
had in mind when we first began

303
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,003
and I know you're a free woman
and proud of it.

304
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,006
And I respect that.

305
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,330
I respect you.

306
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,121
I think perhaps you're the most
impressive person I've ever met.

307
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,531
Paul...

308
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,410
I've spent my life...

309
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,687
I've spent my life abandoning people.

310
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,683
Starting, I suppose, with myself.

311
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,730
Plenty of women have
inspired me to be someone else,

312
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,363
if only for a night...

313
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,370
But you're the first one
who makes me aspire

314
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,090
to be myself.

315
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,769
I'm not trying to own you.

316
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,444
I'm asking permission

317
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,527
for me to be myself with you.

318
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,525
For us to just be who we are.

319
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,529
For what, I hope, might be

320
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,850
a rather long and happy time together.

321
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,251
Boys, I feel like stretching my legs.

322
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,367
Oh, Jesus, I hate when
we're drunk enough for no-limit.

323
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,081
Fold.

324
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,965
There a problem, Dr. Isaacs?

325
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,041
That's half a year's pay.

326
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,168
Well, I understand if you want to back out.

327
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,011
I mean, what would your
pretty little wife say?

328
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,690
Jesus, Charlie.

329
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,889
Didn't realize you were
playing with your own salary.

330
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,961
Who does that?

331
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,131
Most people.

332
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,561
Go ahead.

333
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,850
Sayonara, sodomites.

334
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,321
All right.

335
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,644
Oh, look out,

336
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,964
Dr. Isaacs wants to win his
little lady a new mink tonight.

337
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,849
Damn you, Tommy.

338
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,568
Keep your money.
A night with Belinda and we call it square?

339
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,404
It's your funeral.

340
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,966
Well...

341
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,807
How about we go another...

342
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,931
500.

343
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,683
See, the problem, Charlie,

344
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
is I know how bad you need to beat me.

345
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,248
What is this?

346
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,371
What is this, the deed to Palestine?

347
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,691
That about cover it?

348
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,362
- Wait, this isn't...
- It is. It works and it's unpublished.

349
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,806
Holy... Is this microwave transmission?

350
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,848
Cracked it looking at
radar as a grad student.

351
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,803
After the war, housewives will be
boiling eggs in less than a minute.

352
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,488
- You can't deliver this.
- You know I can.

353
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,362
Got it all on paper ready to ship.

354
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,640
Take the pot, it's yours to patent.

355
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,286
So what do I put in?

356
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,211
Thatcher, you're everyone's favorite miser.

357
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,282
What's something like that worth,
five years out?

358
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,681
More than any of our piece-of-shit cards.

359
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,923
I'd say, conservatively,
8,000 would make it even.

360
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,286
8,000.

361
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,611
Oh.

362
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,451
Ace-eight. Half of dead man's hand.

363
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,170
All hail the Prince of flipping Israel!
Bluffing his way to the promised land.

364
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,447
Home. Everybody back here
8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

365
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,644
You should buy Abby
something nice with my money.

366
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,120
Since, um...

367
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,047
I don't think we'll be
playing together again,

368
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,008
I'm gonna let you in on something...

369
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,801
You've got a tell.

370
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,041
You wink.

371
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,481
Left eye.

372
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,526
Do I?

373
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,004
Whenever you don't get what you want.

374
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,124
Here, let me show you.

375
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,370
How does that feel, you sack of shit?

376
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,010
You touch my wife?

377
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,011
You brag to your Ivy League
circle-jerk club about it?

378
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,320
I can't believe it took you this long.

379
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,882
You even look at her again,
I will break your neck.

380
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,964
At first I thought maybe you
were afraid of me, but, no,

381
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,005
you're pulling one over on Akley.

382
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,251
A man with nothing to hide would have
clocked me the second I touched his wife,

383
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,284
but you, Mr. Divide and Conquer,

384
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,603
silent as a cigar-store Indian
because you're playing a longer game.

385
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,570
You gotta be
the longest-winded rapist on record.

386
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,608
I've been watching you for weeks.

387
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,762
Harvesting our numbers,
keeping us in the dark.

388
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,605
And all that added security, that is...
That is rich.

389
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,444
It took me a while to figure it all out...

390
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,885
Go home, asshole.

391
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,522
I know about your side project.

392
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,530
You and Frank.

393
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,884
It's not a side project, is it?

394
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,484
It's the project.

395
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,321
Whole reason you're here.

396
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,886
So...

397
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,523
When Akley gets back,

398
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,884
you're going away.

399
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,167
Who knows, maybe Saipan?

400
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,000
New Guinea?

401
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,282
No Jew quotas there to hold you back.

402
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,087
You'll move up fast, ambitious kid like you.

403
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,731
Right to the front.

404
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,250
See, I can afford
to lose a hand here and there.

405
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,890
Am I winking now?

406
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,930
Can we bring him in?

407
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,850
Lancefield? Not a chance.

408
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,047
You don't think we can trust him?

409
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,851
Who, the man who attacked my wife?

410
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,284
- Then fire him.
- No good, they'll just reassign him.

411
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,807
No, fire him off the Hill.

412
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,167
Get his security clearance revoked.

413
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,690
- I'd need cause.
- Then get some.

414
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,128
You think Lancefield
won't spill his guts to G-2?

415
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,645
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

416
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,485
Disgruntled former employee
or Akley's golden boy?

417
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,170
Anyway, we just have to buy ourselves
some time, so put an asterisk by his name

418
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,927
for violating the rules
of compartmentalization.

419
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,241
- An asterisk?
- He'll go back to Chicago,

420
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,049
he'll tell his sad tales to the faculty club.

421
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,369
That's not what happens to people
who violate compartmentalization.

422
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,408
Lancefield's a son of a bitch, but...

423
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,248
The man inside Heisenberg's project...

424
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,847
Mmm.

425
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,769
They executed him.

426
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,046
Magpie?

427
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,804
They found out he was spying for us?

428
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,082
You didn't tell anyone
else about him, did you?

429
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,161
Of course not.

430
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,602
This isn't the Ivy League.
We're in the middle of a war.

431
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,601
If Akley finds out what we're doing here,
we'll be next.

432
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,727
Jesus Christ.

433
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,450
We're playing a zero-sum game.

434
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,681
Every move costs a piece
and this piece tried to rape your wife.

435
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,361
Hey, hey.

436
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,091
Hey, hello?

437
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,607
Hey.

438
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,567
- I gotta pull up this Elm tree.
- Cottonwood.

439
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,929
- What?
- Rio Grande Cottonwood.

440
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,925
<i>Populus wislizeni.</i>

441
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,248
It's actually a miracle
they survive here at all.

442
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,408
Yeah, I gotta pull 'em all up.

443
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,481
And why's that?

444
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,881
There will be 1,000 more
eggheads here by summer.

445
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,610
They all want a Formica kitchen.

446
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,651
You know, the only reason this
desert hasn't been blown away entirely

447
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,249
is because of these tree roots.

448
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,730
And besides...

449
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,766
It's where I do my reading.

450
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,921
Try a library.

451
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,889
This is the civilian side of the Hill,

452
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,091
so I'm not moving anywhere
until you show me an order

453
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,924
from the civilian town council.

454
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,410
Town council approved this?

455
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,444
They approve everything.

456
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,450
Why would they allow the army
to cut down all our trees?

457
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,607
Why do you think?

458
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,241
Because the Colonel handpicked
every single one of those puppets

459
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,560
and he tells them how to vote.

460
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,167
You'll never beat the army, lady.
Maybe pick on someone your own size.

461
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,724
- Crosley.
- Hi.

462
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,645
This is really not a good time.

463
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,721
Huh.

464
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,329
I thought it was nothing but good times
in the old whack shack.

465
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,325
I know you asked for time,

466
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,128
but I'm dying on the vine here.

467
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,560
Have you...

468
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,642
Have you thought at all about what I said?

469
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,283
Yeah, of course I have.

470
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,368
What you said was beautiful.

471
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,245
- Well, then...
- Well...

472
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,844
But it's not who I am.

473
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,289
Helen. Helen, I know you.

474
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,764
If you did, you wouldn't have asked.

475
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,127
Here, let me in. Let's just think about this.

476
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,201
I have.

477
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,524
Maybe we shouldn't do this anymore.

478
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,243
Is it... Are you...

479
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,007
Right.

480
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,689
Yeah, no, of course.

481
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,928
- This is just work.
- Of course it is.

482
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,611
Paul, I'm sorry.

483
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,765
You deserve...

484
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,210
What I deserve.

485
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,361
- Not a goddamn word from you.
- I didn't say anything.

486
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,805
He's a good man.

487
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,125
Why are you here anyway?

488
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,923
If you want me to talk you out of getting
rid of Lancefield, I'm not gonna do it.

489
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,843
- Frank's right.
- So what the hell am I supposed to do?

490
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,446
I can't stick papers in his bag,
he doesn't carry one.

491
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,403
What should I do? Sleep with him?

492
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,561
Stick the papers in his bedside table?

493
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,411
That's never gonna happen.

494
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,410
All right.

495
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,769
Why don't you ask your wife to do it?

496
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,081
Abby.

497
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,523
I need to ask you something.

498
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,441
Um...

499
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,682
That French woman,
Lancefield's wife, what's her name?

500
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,200
Elodie.

501
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,884
I need you to do something.

502
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,001
What?

503
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,804
I need you to help me. Um...

504
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,966
I know you two are close.
You've been spending a lot of time with her.

505
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,810
We haven't been spending
that much time together.

506
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,486
The floor plans to these houses,
they're all the same, right?

507
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,609
There's a panel in the kitchen
that leads to a crawl space?

508
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,091
Charlie, what are you talking about?

509
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,089
Listen to me. Um...

510
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,328
I need you to put something
into their house.

511
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,491
- Put something?
- Some papers.

512
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,205
I need you to...

513
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,207
To make it look like Lancefield hid them.

514
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,647
What papers?

515
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,241
I can't tell you any more.

516
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,244
My God, Charlie, I am so sick of this.

517
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,402
- Abby. Abby.
- Of only hearing half the story.

518
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,724
Your husband's half.

519
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,129
The half that matters.

520
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,285
So you're...

521
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,966
Framing them for something?

522
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,929
Lancefield's trying to ruin me.

523
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,326
To ruin us.

524
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,890
Charlie, people go to jail for having...

525
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,611
He won't go to jail.
His father practically runs U.S. Steel.

526
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,364
He'll land on his feet.

527
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,686
Jesus, what do you care,
after what he did to you?

528
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,765
Is that what this is?

529
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,928
You're avenging my honor?

530
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,525
You're a little late, Charlie.

531
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,166
Do you really think I would do
something like that to my friend?

532
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,891
- To anyone?
- Wars have casualties, Abby.

533
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,968
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

534
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,002
Stick a fork in me.

535
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,687
It is movie night and they
are showing Phantom Empire.

536
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,445
You and Helen want to join?

537
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,922
Uh, no. No, not tonight.

538
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,089
Come on, it's <i>Phantom Empire.</i>

539
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,410
A race to control the world's radium supply.

540
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,881
The secret city full of scientists.

541
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,607
No, I think I've had enough
reality for one night.

542
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,008
- You all right, pretty boy?
- Yeah.

543
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,800
Yeah, I just want to get a jump on
the morning's burn rate calculations.

544
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,920
Okay. Well, Jeannie charges by
the quarter hour, so I should go.

545
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,362
- Abby, are you okay?
- Are you alone?

546
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,881
Yes.

547
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,810
Was it a joke, about leaving?

548
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,171
You're scaring me, <i>chérie</i>.

549
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,726
I wanna play this game out.

550
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,364
It may not be Paris,
but on the bright side, it's cheap.

551
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,007
And if we saved our
paycheck for a month or two,

552
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,770
we'd have enough to make a start.

553
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,851
I have money.

554
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,331
I have an account that
Charlie doesn't know about.

555
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,890
What happened between you?

556
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,211
Everything.

557
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,528
He asked me to trust him.

558
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,331
He moved us 2,000 miles
to the middle of nowhere.

559
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,360
He's been lying to me
since the day we got here.

560
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,922
He stole another scientist's work and...

561
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,961
He made me feel like I betrayed him
because I wanted to understand why.

562
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,801
He asked me to do things
no one ever should.

563
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,408
I don't know who Charlie is anymore.

564
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,171
And I'm not sure he ever knew who I am.

565
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,891
Who are you?

566
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,804
<i>Fastball is wide.
Walker lays off of it for ball one.</i>

567
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,891
Pardon, my lord.

568
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,961
Crosley.

569
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,326
Who's winning?

570
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,290
Oh, no idea.

571
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,801
Well, at the risk of wasting your time,
I just want to say

572
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,329
I'm proud of the work we're doing here.

573
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,686
I'm shocked, quite frankly,
how fast we're doing it, the four of us.

574
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,642
The work is, more or less,
my only solace these days.

575
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,801
Well, good.

576
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,285
That's why you're here.

577
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,891
You're absolutely right.

578
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,130
I'm here to work.

579
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,211
King and country.
Save the free world, et cetera.

580
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,244
- With the speed problem now solved...
- Nothing is solved.

581
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,086
Baritol's a start, but it doesn't
put implosion in the catbird seat.

582
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,410
Sorry, what did you say?

583
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,122
I just said let's not get cocky.

584
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,445
No, it's a good start, isn't it?

585
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,363
Hope I don't sound arrogant,

586
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,523
but I feel for the first time
like I'm in the catbird seat.

587
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,245
Picking up the lingo, eh?

588
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,249
Yeah, I'm learning.

589
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,290
He's off playing cards again.
He won't be back till the crack of doom.

590
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,124
Do you want a glass of water?

591
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,006
Wine.

592
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,486
You feel like a sack of doorknobs.

593
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,403
I thought this trip would be
soothing for you.

594
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,164
You love the Columbia River.

595
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,288
It wasn't exactly a fishing trip.

596
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,210
You're giving FDR the most
powerful weapon in the history of the world.

597
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,607
The least he could do is give you a day off
when the salmon are running.

598
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,767
Everyone thought I was going to D.C.
It's not like I could pack a fly rod.

599
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,891
Dr. Akley.

600
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,564
It's a little early for a house call.

601
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,686
I apologize, but, sir, it's about a problem
we've been working on in implosion.

602
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,727
Implosion is Frank Winter country
and the border's closed.

603
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,848
That's what I'm here to discuss.

604
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,324
I believe your border's wide open.

605
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,561
Abby?

606
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,567
Hi.

607
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,050
Where have you been?

608
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,641
Walking.

609
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,886
All night?

610
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,202
I should never have involved you in this.

611
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,248
It got complicated and, uh...

612
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,565
I should have listened
to my conscience instead of...

613
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,486
Abby?

614
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,681
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

615
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,961
Get your hands off me!

616
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,040
Abby?

617
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,211
Can you let me in?

618
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,850
Abby, open the door.

619
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:53,200

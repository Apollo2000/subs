<i>Previously on "Manhattan"...</i>

Charlie: <i>They said it'd
be just like Cambridge.</i>

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:07,398
-<i> Harvard with sand.</i>
- Charlie, this doesn't look like Cambridge.

4
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:09,233
Akley: <i>You're looking at the best
equipped lab in the country.</i>

5
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:12,202
Two Van de Graaff accelerators,
our own cyclotron.

6
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:13,988
You're building
an atomic bomb.

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,040
Is that Frank Winter?

8
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:18,575
<i>He's got a band of misfits
working on an alternate design.</i>

9
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:22,079
Whatever we're doing here,
please tell me it's worth it.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,415
I don't know what's gotten into
him since we've gotten here.

11
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:28,168
Half the time he's brooding and the
other half it's like our honeymoon.

12
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,753
Liza: <i>They're all

<i>It's easier than talking.</i>

14
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:32,923
<i>Eventually they stop
doing either.</i>

15
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:34,894
- What?
- No, you can't go to school in New York.

16
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,094
So I'm just supposed to stay
here in this prison camp?

17
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:39,730
<i>Get knocked up by one of the guards?
Why are we even here?</i>

18
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:41,265
Everything is a secret.

19
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:42,599
There's something
I need to tell you.

20
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,685
There's a problem
with Thin Man.

21
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:47,404
We're dead in the water. So what are we gonna do about it?

22
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,273
What happened between you?

23
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,692
He asked me to do things
no one ever should.

24
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:54,445
I don't know
who Charlie is anymore.

25
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:57,414
- I'm going home, Charlie.
- The army won't allow it.

26
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,117
They will if we're divorced.

27
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:01,585
Are you gonna invite me in?

28
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:04,088
You can whisper
fission rates in my ear.

29
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:07,041
<i>Tell me secrets you can't
share with your wife.</i>

30
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,792
There's a leak in this lab.

31
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:10,627
Someone's been smuggling technical
schematics off the Hill.

32
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,296
My mother died yesterday.

33
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:14,631
Your new office will be waiting
for you when you get back.

34
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:17,267
I won't be gone long. They said I
wouldn't have to meet in person.

35
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:19,803
Only under
extraordinary conditions.

36
00:01:19,805 --> 00:01:22,139
Implosion is taking
center stage.

37
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,641
-<i> They think that you're a spy.</i>
- Charlie.

38
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,310
<i>Your wife is sitting
in the next room.</i>

39
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:30,147
She has been betraying you for
months with your neighbor.

40
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,283
Frank, it's Charlie. They're
shipping him off the Hill.

41
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:35,652
- They think he's a traitor.
- What's wrong?

42
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:37,654
We're building an atomic bomb

43
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:41,658
that will explode with the
power of 20,000 tons of TNT.

44
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:45,662
I've done things
I'm not proud of,

45
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,832
but I swear I did all of it
with you and Callie in mind.

46
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:52,302
A few months ago, a physicist
from another design group and I

47
00:01:52,337 --> 00:01:54,338
<i>engaged in
a secret conspiracy</i>

48
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:57,674

of his group for implosion.

49

<i>Akley promoted Charlie Isaacs

<i>They think he is a spy,
but he had no idea.</i>

51
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:06,683
You sold the President

52
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,019
a Buck Rogers fantasy.

53
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:10,938
There is a backup plan.

54
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,689
<i>The director of

So the dawn--
the dawn of the atomic age

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,268
being ushered in by a Jewish
cardshark whose family crash-landed

65
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,571
- on the American shores less than 50 years ago.
- You shouldn't be down here.

00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:02,156
No, just one quote.
One quote.

67
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:06,493
Would you compare this
to Promethean theft?

68
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:08,378
Man stealing fire
from the gods?

69
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:10,380
- Or is it more--
- They pay you by the metaphor?

70
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,665
Hey!

00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:30,400
- Yeah.

Whoa, whoa! We're supposed to

00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,107
before we pull the trigger.

81
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,193
Visibility over 45 miles,

82
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:41,912
- humidity below 85%--
- Yeah, I read the report.

83
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:45,199
You got to talk to the
colonel, delay the test.

84
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,850
The colonel and I aren't
on the best of terms.

85
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:52,289
Look, at any given moment,

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,958
there are 3,000 thunderstorms

No, no.
This one is special.

88
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,963
Gulf air at 17,000 feet,
two inversion layers.

89
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,766
They're not going to call
the game for rain.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,801
Let's just hope
it blows over.

91
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:08,055
It'll blow radioactive fallout
from Roswell to Socorro.

92
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:09,439
I'm sympathetic.
The Army isn't.

Either way,

00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,260
They're still in there
debating the science.

155
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,928
Not a lot of fans
of implosion.

156
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,764
<i>20 old men out of 2,000.</i>

157
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,265
Win the confidence
of the Indians,

158
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:43,933
chiefs will fall in line.

159
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,271
You gonna make an
announcement to the staff?

160
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:49,773
You are.

161
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:01,117
Where's Frank Winter?

162
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,952
It's just implosion
is Frank's baby.

163
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:05,121
You're going to
have to deliver it.

164
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:06,589
In 50 years, no one will know

165
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,124
the name Frank Winter,
but yours--

166
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:10,535
I can't take credit
for someone else's work.

167
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,765
You made your career stealing
the work of another physicist

168
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,434
and passing it off
as your own.

169
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,807
Glen Babbive gave
an interesting exit interview.

170
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,787
Then why'd you pick me
for the job?

171
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:41,124
Saddle the horse, Charlie.

172
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:44,598
I assure you, there's more
profit in moving forward.

173
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:48,214
( Knocks )

174
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:52,669
Dr. Winter?

175
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:54,471
He hasn't been home
in two days.

176
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:56,639
He's probably in his office
hiding behind an equation.

177
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:57,841
Ma'am, we're not here
for your husband.

178
00:09:57,892 --> 00:09:59,843
We're here for your things.

179
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:01,845
- My--
- Personal effects.

180
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:03,513
Furniture stays
with the house.

181
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,182
We have you slotted for a
duplex apartment in Row H.

182
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,685
In regard to your husband.

183
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:15,191
What does this mean,
"reassigned"?

184
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:17,610
Who reassigned him?

185
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:19,696
He put in for a voluntary
transfer three days ago.

186
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:22,198
- Where?
- Even if I--

187
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,700
You're telling me my husband

188
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:26,202
has abandoned his family
with no explanation,

189
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,370
not even
a forwarding address?

190
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,621
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:29,873
We'll be back with boxes.

192
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,858
That son of a bitch
always was crazy

193
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,978
with his
indeterminate variables.

194
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,699
C-A-L-L-I-E.

195
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,070
I wonder how long before
Frank's daughter turns 18.

196
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,740
I thought you packed off,
Crosley, for Omaha.

197
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,492
Or was it Idaho?

198
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,877
Dayton, Ohio, actually.

199
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:11,047
Next stop on my whistle tour
of American boomtowns.

200
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:13,883
Doesn't make any sense.

201
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:16,669
Oppenheimer hands Frank the
project on a silver platter

202
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,422
and he skips town for some
kind of secret promotion?

203
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:21,424
Really?

204
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:23,693
That's what you lured me
here to talk about, Fritz?

205
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,428
- Frank's career path?
- Lure you?

206
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,263
<i>What are you talking about?
I didn't lure you.</i>

207
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:29,482
- Yes, you did.
- No, I got a note from--

208
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:32,902
Oh, it's the duchess

209
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,271
and the boy with
his finger in the dike.

210
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,722
Just give him five minutes.

211
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:40,527
Charlie: <i>There's going
to be an announcement.</i>

212
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:41,978
I'm taking over
the implosion group.

213
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,413
Fritz: You?

214
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:45,698
None of the Indian maids
available, eh?

215
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:47,917
I need to reach Frank.
Have your heard anything?

216
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,586
No more than Fritzy here,
I gather.

217
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,120
They haven't told you
about their little

218
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,755
scientific ménage à
trois, have they?

219
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,290
Paul.

220
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:56,926
So why would you
want to find Frank?

221
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:59,546
You're the force of nature that
fills up the Frank-shaped vacuum.

222
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:00,930
He's just trying to help.

223
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:02,298
I see.
It's for her benefit.

224
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:04,851
A bit of Kabuki theater
to impress a girl.

225
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,438
Well, if I see Frank in Ohio,

226
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:11,140
I'll be sure to send
along your regards.

227
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:17,313
( Glass shatters )

228
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:19,983
What did he mean?
What's a ménage à trois?

229
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:22,648
I'm not trying
to impress anyone.

230
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,954
I was in a bind.
Now I'm not.

231
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:26,956
I think Frank helped me out

232
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:29,742
and he's paying the price.

233
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:32,328
And Oppenheimer
won't tell you where he is?

234
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:34,797
We're not even sure he knows.

235
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:36,132
Well, somebody does.

236
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:14,370
Hey, X-4.
What's his name?

237
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,372
That information
is not in our files.

238
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:18,503
Well, I got to talk to him.

239
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,051
<i>( Knocks on door )</i>

240
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,609
- Hello.
- Abby.

241
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:40,063
Um, he's not here.

242
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,033
What? You want to
check under the bed?

243
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,568
I'm not here to see Charlie.

244
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,830
Is it true that you were
going to have a baby

245
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:58,915
and then you didn't?

246
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,086
Charlie told you that?

247
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:06,839
Did you take care of it?

248
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,257
What is this?

249
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:14,597
Trust me, Helen, if I had any
friends here to turn to,

250
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:16,265
any friends here at all...

251
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:20,436
I need to know how
you went about doing it.

252
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:22,271
Why would you want to do
a thing like that,

253
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:24,473
Mrs. Ladies' Home Journal?

254
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:27,110
It's private.

255
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,662
I need to get dressed.

256
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,671
Charlie wasn't
the only one who cheated.

257
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:41,874
And he found out.

258
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:44,293
You had an affair?

259
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:47,096
Who's the guy?

260
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:49,298
You don't know him.

261
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,934
- But he got you pregnant.
- It's Charlie's.

262
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:57,857
You sure?

263
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:01,144
Yes, I'm sure.

264
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,319
I had an abortion
two years ago in New Jersey.

265
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,989
Doctor's probably practicing
medicine in a jail cell.

266
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,907
But if you needed one now,

267
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,659
you must have some idea
of where you'd go.

268
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,161
You know it's a felony.

269
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,133
Some of the girls in the dorm

270
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,502
have been to a clinic
in Santa Fe

271
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:29,505
near the bus stop
on Junction.

272
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:32,175
You're supposed to say
you have obstructed menses.

273
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:37,346
Did it hurt?

274
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:44,520
Listen, Abby,

275
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,273
I don't regret it.

276
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:49,425
But you will.

277
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,751
Do you love Charlie?

278
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,207
Then you won't tell him.

279
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:20,022
Woman on phone:
<i>Operator.</i>

280
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:22,024
Yeah, I need an outside line.

281
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:23,893
<i>Where to?</i>

282
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,195
The Soviet consul
in New York.

283
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,981
<i>I-- I'm not authorized
to make that call.</i>

284
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:30,733
I'm authorizing
you right now.

285
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:33,102
<i>Sir, even trying
to telephone the Soviets,</i>

286
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:35,777
<i>you'll get yourself hauled into the
office of the secretary of war.</i>

287
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,406
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

288
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:39,792
<i>I-- no.</i>

289
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,996
You got a pencil?

290
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,749
My badge number is X-4.

291
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,313
(Indistinct distant chatter)

292
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:09,073
Do you sleep closer to the door
when you're home with Abby?

293
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,044
What?

294
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,713
People always end up
on the same side of the bed.

295
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:20,551
It's like a designated
parking spot.

296
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:23,471
It's old habit.

297
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:30,557
Your marriage
is an old habit, too.

298
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:33,781
<i>People fall back into it.</i>

299
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,336
When's the last time
you saw Abby?

300
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,758
In 36 hours...

301
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:47,295
I need to lay out my vision

302
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,297
for the future of the project

303
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,766
to 2,000 physicists.

304
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,601
I got nothing.

305
00:17:56,972 --> 00:18:00,452
Delay the announcement till we
figure out what to do about Frank.

306
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:04,946
Agent X-4 seems to be
on permanent vacation.

307
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,482
Why don't you just
tell the truth?

308
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,784
Stand up in front
of the entire tech area

309
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:13,454
and tell them G-2 made one of
the group heads disappear?

310
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:18,159
Probably stick me in whatever
hole they stuck Frank,

311
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,579
then you'd have to
run implosion.

312
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,798
Why is that funny?

313
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:27,335
I probably know the physics
better than you do.

314
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:30,171
You think you could hold your
own against Oppenheimer?

315
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:33,591
Those bloodsuckers
in the senior leadership?

316
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:36,594
You think you can?
Oppenheimer picked you

317
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:39,013
because he knows
that he can control you.

318
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:42,400
All right.
You know, never mind.

319
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,404
I have a speech to write.

320
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:50,825

Man:
<i>Are you Meeks?</i>

338
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,047
Yeah, Meeks.

339
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,249
This isn't the Waldorf.
We're not bellboys.

340
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,584
What are you doing
with my books?

341
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:51,168
It's moving day.

342
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,754

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,914
Man:
<i>Attention!</i>

350
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:46,140
You're not the Oberfuhrer.

351
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:50,945
Is there any sign
of Colonel Cox?

352
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:52,947
Colonel Cox
has been redeployed

353
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:55,316
to a post more suitable
to his talents.

354
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,438
Does he have those?
Talents?

355
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:01,122
So that would make you...

356
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,124
Colonel Emmett Darrow.

357
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:05,638
The king is dead.
Long live the king.

358
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:09,413
Well, I've squandered
enough of your time.

359
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:11,332
High priests
at the security desk

360
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:14,335
tell me my transfer form
is missing a signature.

361
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:16,754
Leave it with the girl.

362
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:19,140
All I need
is a drop of ink, sir.

363
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:20,975
Dayton site expected me
two days ago.

364
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,312
I won't bore you with
the technical subtleties.

365
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:29,016
Harvesting polonium-210
for the neutron initiators.

366
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:31,152
Dayton is adequately staffed.

367
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:33,186
This hill,
on the other hand...

368
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:35,906
is not.

369
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,778
Sir, I can't stay
on this hill.

370
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:42,446
It's a personnel matter.

371
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:44,532
- Personnel?
- Personal.

372
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,334
I can't work
for Charlie Isaacs.

373
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,836
<i>It seems we both fancied
the same woman.</i>

374
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,287
Would you close
the door, please?

375
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:10,358
Get down on your knees.

376
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:16,063
You're pulling my leg.
( chuckles )

377
00:22:16,114 --> 00:22:18,566
No one can see you.

378
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,401
Take a knee.

379
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:22,870
<i>Or did you change your mind
about the transfer?</i>

380
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:37,585
Now...

381
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:39,720
ask Jesus for forgiveness.

382
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,425
I'm sorry?

383
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:45,893
Jesus.

384
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,401
Forgive me, Jesus.

385
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:56,904
And what is the nature
of your sin?

386
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:58,239
I don't know.

387
00:22:58,273 --> 00:23:02,109
Yes, you do.
It's weakness.

388
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:08,699
God buried an atom under
a million tons of rock

389
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,618
so that America
could split it in two

390
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,586
and redraw
the maps of the world.

391
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:15,873
And you want
to run off to Dayton

392
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:19,084
because some girl didn't
ask you to the prom?

393
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:43,684
Half the Hill woke up with eviction
papers tacked to our doors

394
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:46,287
by order of the office
of the colonel.

395
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:48,489
You picked a hell
of a week to leave town.

396
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:51,492
I mean, not that you
picked-- oh, Jesus.

397
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:54,929
You should talk to Jeannie.
She's got two dead parents.

398
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:58,666
Jim, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

399
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,301
They won't give you
more time?

400
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:03,304
Uh, she'd want me here
serving my country.

401
00:24:03,338 --> 00:24:05,139
I don't even know
who we're serving.

402
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:07,675
- Frank's gone.
- What?

403
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,677
- Where?
- I don't know.

404
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,808
But I know it's not good.

405
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,161
So you're going to give it to
her on a bench in the plaza?

406
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,946
I saved up for a hotel room.

407
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:31,165
She's a virgin, right?

408
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:34,668
Don't forget to sprinkle rose
petals on the bedspread.

409
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:37,171
On E-3 salary?

410
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:39,340
He'll be lucky
if the room has a bed.

411
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:41,542
Liza:
<i>Where's my daughter?</i>

412
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:43,177
Mrs. Winter-- Doctor.

413
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:45,713
I think she's on an overnight
with the Mason Scouts.

414
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:49,300
Yes, she was. And then she went
AWOL, apparently to meet you.

415
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:51,352
Callie and I
had social plans.

416
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:53,554
She took an early bus and we
were going to meet for dinner.

417
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:55,973
Where?

418
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,308
A restaurant?

419
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:00,227
I'll save you a bus ticket.

420
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:12,573
Are you going somewhere?

421
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:14,041
Get in the car.

422
00:25:15,744 --> 00:25:17,962
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

423
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:28,055
<i>( door opens )</i>

424
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:40,351
I see you got my message.

425
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:43,020
Prince of implosion.

426
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,606
I'd have thought you'd
have better things to do

427
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,942
than play grab-ass
with a telephone.

428
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:51,028
What's wrong?
OSS can't take a joke?

429
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,613
Strategic Services
is a clubhouse

430
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:54,782
for overbred schoolboys.

431
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,785
I serve at the pleasure
of a humbler master.

432
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,837
General Groves.

433
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:02,673
Freedom.

434
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,626
<i>Nice office.</i>

435
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:08,629
- A lot of turnover.
- Yes, well,

436
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:11,432
the third time's a charm.

437
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:12,800
You don't see it yet,
Charlie,

438
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,551
but I am your friend.

439
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:18,272
Most of my friends
have names.

440
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:21,475
I want you to tell me the truth.
Can you do that?

441
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:25,279
What do you think,
I'm some Bela Lugosi spook?

442
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:28,482
I am the reason you're sitting
behind that desk instead of--

443
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,651
Where?

444
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,119
Where is Frank Winter?

445
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:34,455
<i>You pack him off
to wherever it was</i>

446
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:37,825
<i>you were going to send me
to torture him?</i>

447
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:41,462
Ah, that's what this is.

448
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:43,797
A soldier's loyalty.

449
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:47,084
Let me guess. Frank isn't
the man I think he is.

450
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:48,836
He wasn't.

451
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:52,006
What about me? Am I the
guy you thought I was?

452
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:57,311
<i>See, I don't think
you're a spook.</i>

453
00:26:57,345 --> 00:27:00,514
I think you're a bureaucrat.

454
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:05,352
I think you're the guy at the border
checkpoint asking for papers.

455
00:27:06,688 --> 00:27:08,656
Hmm.

456
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,700
Do you know the Banat
province in eastern Europe

457
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:22,870
doesn't exist anymore

458
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:25,205
except on a few old maps?

459
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,125
Before Christ turned up,

460
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:31,512
it belonged to the Thracians

461
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:34,348
<i>until the Romans
bled them dry.</i>

462
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,517
Then the Goths,
the Huns, the Gepidae,

463
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:40,354
the Avars, followed by the
Slavs, then the Magyars.

464
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:43,857
Four calling birds, three
French hens, I get it.

465
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:45,526
Then the Hungarians
set up shop

466
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,896
until the Ottoman Turks
cut them down.

467
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:52,533
That's when
my family arrived.

468
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,234
Merchants.

469
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,904
Salt, mostly.

470
00:27:56,955 --> 00:28:00,541
They fought with the Serbs
to beat back the Turks.

471
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:02,543
Then the son
of a Bosnian farmer

472
00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:05,829
put a bullet in a Hapsburg
and the world caught fire.

473
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,750
<i>And then it became
the Banat Republic</i>

474
00:28:09,752 --> 00:28:12,970
for all of two weeks.

475
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:19,560
It was a haven for Jews

476
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:23,180
until the Axis rolled in
and Hitler...

477
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:24,765
( laughs )

478
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:36,193
Hitler solved the Jewish
problem once and for all.

479
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:38,779
Now the Russians
are knocking at the gate.

480
00:28:40,627 --> 00:28:42,374
When you've lived in a place

481
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,519
where borders
have no meaning,

482
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:47,965
borders come to mean
a great deal.

483
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:51,752
20 years I've lived
in this country,

484
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:55,723
yet still I keep a packed
suitcase by the front door.

485
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:00,761
Good.

486
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:05,566
Let's throw it in the car,
go for a drive,

487
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,101
pick up Frank.

488
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:11,739
He's gone, and he's
never coming back.

489
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,941
What does that mean, gone?

490
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,164
He's dead?

491
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:24,668
I don't believe you.

492
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:28,872
You knew the man.

493
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:31,959
Do you think Frank Winter
would surrender quietly?

494
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:34,378
Sands shift during wartime.

495
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:38,132
No one--
no one has tenure.

496
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:41,969
The ones who survive
are the ones who adapt.

497
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:47,274
Next time, call me directly.

498
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:52,646
My name is Avram Fisher.

499
00:29:58,653 --> 00:30:00,154
Where are my manners?

500
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:03,907
- Congratulations.
- For surviving or adapting?

501
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,492
For the baby.

502
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:09,213

You know, Charlie, I think
we dug up all the skeletons

the last time you stopped by.

519

I'm sure the neighbors

Are you pregnant?

521

She told you.

522
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:06,687
I had to hear it
from the Angel of Death.

- Abby.

Charlie.

525
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:16,485
You were going to
sign the divorce papers

526
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:19,199
and sneak out
the back door with Joey?

This is a sign.

528

It's a chance.

531
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:29,877
It's too late.

532
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:36,466
There's a lunatic in Europe

533
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:39,052
making orphans out of a
thousand Jewish kids a day.

534
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:41,188
You want two more to grow
up without their father?

535
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:43,473
You think I don't know
about Europe?

536
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:45,526
Honestly?

537
00:32:53,735 --> 00:32:58,205
You remember that first
doctor at Mass General?

538
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,874
<i>The one who looked
like Calvin Coolidge?</i>

539
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:04,912
A medical improbability.
That's what he called it.

540
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:12,252
And I told you we could raise
Siamese cats for all I care.

541
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:17,507
But you wanted
a daughter so badly.

542
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,894
We both did.

543
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:22,930
And you proved
the doctors wrong.

544
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:31,939
Right out of the gates,
you said it felt like a boy,

545
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:36,644
and you were right
about that, too.

546
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,085
Thought I'd never
see you again.

547
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:46,720
I mean, for all I knew,
you were dead.

548
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:48,389
And then you came in the door

549
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:52,559
and you said that
I poisoned our marriage.

550
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:55,345
Listen.

551
00:33:55,397 --> 00:33:59,733
Whatever happened

It's not us.

It's this place.

556
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,949
I treated you

558
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,354
I underestimated you.

559
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:25,225
I forgot what I had.

560
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:29,062
But there's a kid in there.

561
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:32,866
He doesn't know
his father screwed up.

562
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:36,320
His world doesn't
even exist yet.

We can do better.

564

I can be better.

20 minutes, tops. There was
a message at the barracks.

570
00:35:23,284 --> 00:35:25,764
I goofed. I sent her to
the wrong restaurant.

571
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:29,957
You left it in
your jacket pocket.

572
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,795
So where were you really
going to meet Callie?

573
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,936
Premarital sex
was not invented in 1944.

574

There's a hotel off the plaza.
We haven't actually--

575
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,776
I wanted to wait
until we were married,

576
00:35:49,811 --> 00:35:51,612
but I...

577
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:58,151
Do you love her?

578
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:03,824
She's the most perfect

00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,839
What?

581
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:23,343
Callie took some pills
about a month back.

582
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:25,634
Methyl something.
They were blue.

583

Methylphenobarbital.

584

They're mine.

585
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:35,934
I don't think that she
was really trying to--

586
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:43,196
She said it runs
in the family.

587

There was an incident

Your husband

You can help him by proving

One suit, one shirt,
one necktie,

one pair of shoes?

674
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,781
That's all he took.

675
00:42:56,832 --> 00:43:00,201
All his clothes
are boxed up at the house.

Dr. Oppenheimer...

690
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:04,849
asked me to say a few words
about the road ahead.

691
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,060
But I want to talk about
the road that got us here.

692
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,489
I had a teacher
in St. Louis.

693
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,693
He used to say that science
isn't a quest for truth,

694
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:20,115
but a process of
correcting your errors.

695
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:23,366
We've racked up more than
our share on this hill.

696
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:27,124
And I want to
correct one right now.

697
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:35,513
The fact that
we're all standing here,

698
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,549
that there is a path forward,

699
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:39,134
we owe it to one man,

700
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:40,802
and he isn't
standing here with us.

701
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:45,640
The implosion model exists
because of Frank Winter.

702
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,726
( Murmuring )

703
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:52,530
He was the crank
in the wilderness

704
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:56,151
rubbing two sticks together
when no one believed.

705
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:59,370
He fed the spark.

706
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,655
He fought off the wolves.

707
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:04,576
<i>He corrected his errors.</i>

708
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:09,453
You should be listening
to Frank right now.

709
00:45:16,222 --> 00:45:19,924
But the War Department
has asked him

710
00:45:19,975 --> 00:45:24,062
to take the reins on another
project at another site.

711
00:45:24,064 --> 00:45:26,014
Their gain is our loss.

712
00:45:26,065 --> 00:45:28,566
I talked to Frank on the
phone a little while ago.

713
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,568
He gave me his blessing

714
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,938
and I gave him
my sincere thanks.

715
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:35,940
We all should.

716
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,775
- ( Applause )
- Did he talk to him?

717
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,453
As for the road ahead...

718
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:52,624
there is no road.

719
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:55,210
<i>We have to dig it
out of the dirt.</i>

720
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:58,429
It's no longer a thought problem.
It's not a theory.

721
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,432
We're all going home
with blood on our sleeves.

722
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,967
We're going to build
a working gadget.

723
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:04,302
We're going to
drop it on Berlin.

724
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:06,437
If those doubting Thomases

725
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,306
in Washington
don't believe us,

726
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,807
then they can fly out here

727
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,249
and stick their fingers
in the wound.

728
00:46:11,277 --> 00:46:15,063
'Cause on July 4th, 1945,

729
00:46:15,114 --> 00:46:18,983
we're going to put on the biggest
firework show since the Book of Genesis.

730
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:22,237
We're going to test the
gadget in our own backyard.

731

( Crowd murmuring )

732
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,990
A nuclear test in a year?

733
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,459
Whose bloody sleeve
did he pull that out of?

734
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,574
He just pushed in all his chips.
It's a bluff.

00:51:36,382 --> 00:51:38,049
Get the legs.

792
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:45,890
<i>( Thunder crashes )</i>

793
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,200
Pellegrin: <i>You want a
volunteer to climb</i>

794
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:57,318
-<i> a 100-foot steel lightning rod.</i>
- Charlie: Yes.

795
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,204
Fritz: To babysit Shiva,
the God of Death,

796
00:51:59,238 --> 00:52:00,739
in the middle of
an electrical storm.

797
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:03,908
Well, maybe the Japs
can spare a kamikaze pilot.

798
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:06,544
- I'll do it.
- No way.

799
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:09,581
If the colonel wants to double-check
the detonators, he can do it himself.

800
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:12,217
No wife. No kids.
I'll do it.

801
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:14,552
No, you're more
valuable on the ground.

802
00:52:14,587 --> 00:52:17,589
- Jim, you don't have to.
- It's okay.

803
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,592
It should be
someone you trust.

804
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:34,272
Man:
<i>Hey! Hey, you!</i>

805
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:38,515
The Boy Wonder
said to give you this.

806
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,799
Start the clock.

807
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,468
Zero minus 160 minutes.

808
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:06,805
By 0430 hours,

809
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:08,606
every tent,
including this one,

810
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:11,442
will be collapsed
and loaded for transport

811
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:13,629
to the 10,000-meter
perimeter.

812
00:53:15,632 --> 00:53:19,268
And if anyone sees Dr. Frank
Winter on the premises,

813
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:20,469
arrest him.

814
00:53:21,855 --> 00:53:24,306
If he resists,
you have the authority

815
00:53:24,357 --> 00:53:27,109
to use all necessary force.

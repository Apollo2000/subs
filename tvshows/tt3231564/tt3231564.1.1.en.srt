1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:09,976
_

2
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:16,218
_

3
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,971
On the eve
of another Independence Day,

4
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,540
let us all remember

5
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,375
the price of the freedom we enjoy.

6
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:39,079
Along with those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice,

7
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:44,618
113 local boys are unaccounted
for in the Pacific theater.

8
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:47,554
They include Private
James Daryl of Bloomfield.

9
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,490
Private Stuart Danforth of Bloomfield.

10
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:54,195
Lance Corporal Francis R. Peabody.

11
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,196
Private Hugo Bunker.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,933
Corporal George Higgins.
Private First Class...

13
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,241
Son of a bitch.

14
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:06,400
That's got to be north.

15
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:07,801
Right?

16
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,674
They said it would be just like Cambridge.

17
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,841
Harvard with sand.

18
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,310
Daddy's offer still stands.

19
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:20,047
- It's a good job, Charles.
- It's a sales job.

20
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,615
God forbid.

21
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,784
You'd think a PhD was a vow of poverty.

22
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,252
You know, business is a science.

23
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:28,489
The recruiter said I could
be the next Enrico Fermi.

24
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,427
He's like the Betty Grable of physics.

25
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,062
Well, no one ever heard of him.

26
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:37,865
Think of anyone heard of Galileo in 1590?

27
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:41,702
I bet Galileo knew how to read a road map.

28
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:52,613
Yeah, that's north.

29
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,549

Stay in the car.

43
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:10,323
- Next car, move up.
- Honey, stay in the car, okay?

44
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:21,635
Excuse me. Hi.

45
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,438
The circus in town?

46
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,274
Just where is everybody going?

47
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,876
PO box 1663.

48
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:32,512
- What's the place called?
- It ain't.

49
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:35,849
No name, no street signs.

50
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:37,651
Welcome to nowhere.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,254
All right.

52
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:18,225
Charlie, this doesn't look like Cambridge.

53
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,169
You can't work in your
office like everybody else?

54
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,671
Our group's on the chopping block

55
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,705
and you're out till dawn
playing putt-putt in the desert.

56
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,207
What makes a golf ball fly?

57
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,942
Compression. The club hits the ball,

58
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:38,278
the rubber core compresses, the ball sails.

59
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,646
We're not talking about rubber.

60
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,048
We're talking about solid metal.

61
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:43,850
TNT yields pressures
of 100,000 atmospheres.

62
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,020
We can supercompress the core of the bomb.

63
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,157
Higher density, less plutonium.

64
00:05:57,198 --> 00:05:59,365
Oh, you son of a bitch.

65
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:48,248
Someone invented pie crust in a box?

66
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:52,552
How is that not on the cover
of "The New York Times"?

67
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:01,261
The computers will need to stay all night.

68
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,797
And we'll need some equipment.

69
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:06,433
Some IBM machines for the hydrodynamics.

70
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:10,637
I'll be right back.

71
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,674
So is this all you got for corn?

72
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,643
Yeah, we're cleared
out for the 4th of July.

73
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,411
Shipment's due from El Paso next Tuesday.

74
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:21,014
We can't grow our own corn on the Hill?

75
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:25,052
You know the Indians have been
planting maize out here for 5,000 years.

76
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:27,087
Army policy. The ground's no good.

77
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,622
Oh, for heaven's sake.

78
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,325
Rangeland soil is full of potassium.

79
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:38,498
Ma'am, I'm sure your husband's
got a brain the size of Kansas,

80
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:41,667
but that ring on your finger
doesn't make you a scientist.

81
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,204
No, four years at Barnard

82
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,706
and a PhD in botany do.

83
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,675
I missed dinner.

84
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,843
And breakfast.

85
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:54,114
You know, most women would kill
for a night off from their husbands.

86
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:57,450
Most women know what their
husbands do at the office.

87
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:00,353
I'm not most women.

88
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:02,422
You certainly are not.

89
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,027
You've had a good night.

90
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:12,198
I'll be home later.

91
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,401
I promise.

92
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,645
This line gets longer every day.

93
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,216
Got your pass?

94
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,517
Colonel's clamping down on security.

95
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,587
Probably got the MPs going
through our trash at night.

96
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,556
Here we go. Thank you.

97
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,292
- All right, thank you.
- Okay.

98
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:40,994
Would it kill you to say thank you?

99
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:42,495
We need to start from scratch.

100
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,130
We'll rebuild the math from the ground up.

101
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:47,234
And we'll need a bigger
staff, Glen... like 15, 20 guys.

102
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,469
- Where the hell are you going?
- I'm gonna run it upstairs.

103
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:51,438
No, whoa. Hey, whoa.

104
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,107
You can't just waltz
into Oppenheimer's office

105
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,676
with some chicken scratches
on a cocktail napkin.

106
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,745
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Hey, good morning.

107
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:04,684
Akley, he wipes his ass
and calls it a design.

108
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,853
Army writes him a check with six zeros.

109
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,355
Reed Akley shaves every day.

110
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,693
The only thing cleaner
than his face is his math.

111
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,594
Well, it's too clean.

112
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:16,462
There's something wrong with Akley's bomb.

113
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:18,732
Forget Thin Man, okay? Forget Akley.

114
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:22,035
100 American kids have been buried

115
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,805
since the last time we
walked through that gate.

116
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,140
By tomorrow morning, there'll be 100 more.

117
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,877
And you want me to slow down?

118
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,979
Of course not.

119
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,349
We've spent six months in the woodshed

120
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:38,485
living off table scraps.

121
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,988
We both know our design
is better than Akley's.

122
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:46,026
But if you go in there to
persuade Oppenheimer half-cocked,

123
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,927
it's finished.

124
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,679
Was that Frank Winter?

125
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,581
Yeah.

126
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:11,551
I submitted my thesis to the Princeton
physics journal when he was the editor.

127
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,853
Six peer reviewers
backed it for publication.

128
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,056
- He rejected it.
- Well, don't take it personally.

129
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,557
He probably didn't even read it.

130
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:19,059
He work for Dr. Akley too?

131
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,560
No.

132
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:23,363
No, he's got a band of misfits
working on an alternate design.

133
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,932
Design for what?

134
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,433
Forget Winter's group.

135
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:28,969
They're the farm league, Charlie.

136
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,171
You're joining the New York Yankees.

137
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,775
The white badge is your key to the castle.

138
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,111
Only scientists and army brass get them.

139
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:42,182
Steno girls are allowed in the
building, but they don't know squat.

140
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,250
Gis barely know what state they're in.

141
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,221
They all read your paper.

142
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:51,591
Passed it around like a Tijuana bible.

143
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,294
You're looking at the best
equipped lab in the country.

144
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:57,297
Two Van de Graaff
accelerators, our own cyclotron,

145
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:00,233
and the finest computers money can buy.

146
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:04,171
Computers, this is the youngest
buck who ever won the Forbes Prize.

147
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,905
Say hello to Charlie Isaacs.

148
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,540
Hi, Charlie.

149
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:10,010
No lying down on the job, girls.

150
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,946
We'll need you to answer some questions.

151
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,882
Everybody on the project's
got to have security clearance.

152
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,650
What is the project? They
still haven't told me.

153
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:20,920
I'll leave that to Dr. Akley
once we have your commitment.

154
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:22,989
How do I know what I'm committing to?

155
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:25,258
Charlie.

156
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,260
This is Shangri-La.

157
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:29,695
We've got the highest combined
IQ of any town in America

158
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,031
and more Jews than Babylon.

159
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,399
You'll be wined and dined by the US Army

160
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,368
until Hitler and the Japs say uncle.

161
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,571
Who knows how long that'll be?

162
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,810
Well, that all depends on us.

163
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,759
Say Oppenheimer picks
Akley's design over ours.

164
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,862
It's still possible they'll keep
us around, right, as a backup plan?

165
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,632
If a career falls in the desert
and there's no one there to hear it,

166
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,967
does it make a sound?

167
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,268
Frank will figure something out.

168
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:09,569
Oh, come on. We're wasting our time.

169
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,204
Akley's got a staff of 600 on Thin Man.

170
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:13,606
We've got six chaps. One of them's a girl.

171
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:18,278
You're late!

172
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:23,616
This was yesterday.

173
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:26,252
This is tomorrow.

174
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,192
Now, the math here is simple.
Only one variable matters.

175
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:35,395
Time.

176
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,831
It's gonna take a year to produce
enough plutonium to make Akley's bomb.

177
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:42,368
But with a supercompressed core,

178
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:45,805
I think we can shave a week
off that timeline, maybe longer.

179
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,007
Now, the army still hasn't decided

180
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,675
which design they're gonna back yet,

181
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,243
but they're going to any day now,

182
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:53,480
and before they do, we
need to prove how much time

183
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:54,915
our model is gonna save them.

184
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:57,918
And Oppenheimer is leaving for DC tomorrow.

185
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,352
So if we want to
keep this group intact,

186
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,187
we're gonna have to get some
hard numbers in his hands

187
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,255
before he gets on that plane.

188
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,659
Yeah, we're gonna miss
dinner again, aren't we?

189
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:08,894
- Fritz.
- So we're gonna scrap three months

190
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,331
of work for the chance that we
can save the army one week?

191
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:14,734
Somewhere in Germany, Hitler's
got a town just like this one

192
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:17,870
full of scientists hungrier than you.

193
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:20,806
That week we save could
be the week that matters.

194
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:58,744
Yoo-hoo. Hello.

195
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,448
We're not snooping.

196
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,315
Hello.

197
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,718
We're the welcome wagon.

198
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:09,155
This is Fay and Dot and I'm Rose Akley.

199
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:12,057
- Abby.
- Her husband is your husband's boss.

200
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,427
Oh!
Oh, um...

201
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:17,263
Technically Reed is your
husband's boss's boss.

202
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:20,800
But we don't stand on
ceremony, do we, ladies?

203
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,570
Thin walls.

204
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,111
♪ I'm gonna tell who threw
the whiskey in the well ♪

205
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,745
♪ In the well ♪

206
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,282
♪ I'm gonna tell who threw
the whiskey in the well ♪

207
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,650
♪ In the well ♪

208
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:40,186
♪ When you kneel down
on your knees... ♪

209
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:41,921
She's built like a sparrow.

210
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,689
You think she's packed enough shoes?

211
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,226
What church are
you? Lutheran? Methodist?

212
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,860
Physicist.

213
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:50,530
Charlie's god is Albert Einstein.

214
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,632
You're lucky with a toddler.

215
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,434
They ration the Indians.

216
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:56,469
You'll jump straight to
the front of the line.

217
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:59,939
Just watch out the help doesn't
smoke your husband's peace pipe.

218
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,541
Don't tell my Walter.

219
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:04,677
If the men can keep secrets,
we're entitled to a few of our own.

220
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:06,111
What do you mean?

221
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:09,882
Oh, you know, what they
do behind their fences.

222
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,584
What are the men building?

223
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,086
I hear they're building submarines
and floating them down the Rio Grande.

224
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,988
Fay!

225
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:21,260
They look like little convicts.

226
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:23,062
Head lice.

227
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:28,568
- What was that?
- You're gonna love it here, really.

228
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,480
Supercompression. Why
didn't I think of that?

229
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,715
'Cause Frank's smarter
than you by a factor of 14.

230
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,550
Not that it matters.
Akley's gonna win the war.

231
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:45,751
He'll probably win the Nobel Prize.

232
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:46,752
We'll still be crunching numbers.

233
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:49,055
Here, look at this.

234
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,425
Crosley, Fedowitz, Liao, Meeks,
Prins, you need to come with us.

235
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,927
If this is about the colonel's
horse, I had nothing to do with it.

236
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:57,563
Recognize this? Came
out of your file cabinet.

237
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,198
There's pages missing.

238
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,700
Somebody better call Interpol.

239
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,970
You familiar with the Espionage Act?

240
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,007
Whoever lawfully or
unlawfully having access to

241
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,842
or being entrusted
with any document...

242
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:12,144
Whoa, whoa. Espionage?

243
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,814
No more wisecracks?

244
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,083
You hear the one about the
Chink in the electric chair?

245
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,785
- What the hell's going on?
- That's what we'd like to find out, sir.

246
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,255
We believe a member of your
group is stealing secrets.

247
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,657
Get out.

248
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,859
Dr. Winter, G-2 has credible
intelligence that one...

249
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:30,630
All I've seen from the G-2 is an
incredible lack of intelligence.

250
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,232
They haven't even told you what
you're doing here, have they?

251
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:35,702
Do you have any idea
what you are looking at?

252
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,637
Sir, we're not here to debate science.

253
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:39,471
That's not science.

254
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:43,143
That's the property of the government
of the United States of America.

255
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:45,177
Our work is so classified,

256
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:47,847
the vice president doesn't know we exist.

257
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,749
As far as he's concerned,
the Manhattan Project

258
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:51,483
is a leaky tunnel on the IRT.

259
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:54,286
And yet you're gonna stand
there, Sergeant First Class,

260
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,389
with your J-3 security clearance

261
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:59,125
and you're gonna talk to me about protocol?

262
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,428
You could be court-martialed
for just opening that file.

263
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,267
This isn't finished.

264
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:14,440
I don't have time for this shit.

265
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:16,476
And neither do you, not today.

266
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,312
- You're crooked.
- Oh.

267
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:30,549
Thank you.

268
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:32,819
Dr. Akley.

269
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:37,123
"A New Approach to Nuclear Cosmology."

270
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,828
I wish I'd written it.

271
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:50,302
I have not seen real
bourbon since Pearl Harbor.

272
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,272
Well, I got friends in high places.

273
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:54,740
It's called a signing bonus.

274
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,109
Charlie Isaacs,

275
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,745
tell me why you're here.

276
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,980
Sir?

277
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,482
You drove 2,000 miles.

278
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,450
You uprooted your family to a state

279
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:06,518
with more cattle than people.

280
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:07,654
What do you want?

281
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,056
To serve my country. I tried to enlist.

282
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,157
Flat feet.

283
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:16,128
Yeah, well, I think we can
put your skills to better use.

284
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,435
We're waging a war of ideas.

285
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:25,371
Now, this war will be
fought on the battlefield,

286
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:29,809
but make no mistake that peace
will be won with brains, not brawn.

287
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,378
Now, forget about code breaking.

288
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:35,047
Forget about
meteorology, optics...

289
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,116
You're building an atomic bomb.

290
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:41,888
We prefer to call it a gadget.

291
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:48,327
I walk most of the new
boys through the math,

292
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,962
they still don't see it.

293
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,338
I was told I'd be working in a radar lab.

294
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,973
Well, I'm sorry for the smoke and mirrors.

295
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,075
We can't exactly advertise.

296
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,282
Dean Everett at Harvard

297
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:13,353
says you're the quickest
study he's seen in years.

298
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,957
He also says you want to help your people.

299
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:20,192
I understand you have family in Poland.

300
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,965
A bomb like
that... gadget...

301
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:33,205
the burn radius would be miles wide.

302
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,240
The gamma rays
alone would be...

303
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,977
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

304
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,747
You can grow old and
die writing white papers

305
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,082
on field quantization.

306
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,417
100 savants will read your work,

307
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:48,287
maybe 10 will understand it.

308
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:50,255
Or you can join my team

309
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,425
and you can watch the
apple fall with Newton.

310
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:03,986
Go home. Go have dinner with your wife.

311
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,955
We need to finish running these numbers.

312
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:08,958
Leave that to the peanut gallery.

313
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:14,430
I mean it. If this job kills you,

314
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:16,832
Liza is gonna kill me.

315
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:33,515
You're not gonna believe
this. The water went out again.

316
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:36,485
They better fix it before tomorrow.

317
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,289
July 4th.

318
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:42,391
Frank, half the Hill is
gonna be in our backyard

319
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,959
and you know how they like to drink.

320
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:45,861
This is not the best week.

321
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,397
Well, I didn't set the date.

322
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:50,599
Take it up with Thomas Jefferson.

323
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,638
Frank.

324
00:23:03,313 --> 00:23:07,383
Did you know people like to
socialize on Independence Day?

325
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:10,685
They like to stand around in the
backyard and eat grilled meats

326
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,788
and listen to John Philip Sousa. Gracias.

327
00:23:13,823 --> 00:23:15,457
And tomorrow, for one night,

328
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:18,894
we're going to pretend
we have a normal life.

329
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:22,064
You in the kitchen is the
definition of abnormal.

330
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:24,599
But in the spirit
of independence...

331
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,702
- No.
- No what?

332
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,137
No, you can't go to school in New York.

333
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:29,605
But New York is the center of the world.

334
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:31,106
Yes, it is.

335
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:33,542
The world of cigarettes and premarital sex.

336
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:36,712
Apparently, Callie has sent in an
application to the Chapin School.

337
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:39,781
Dad, Anna Roosevelt went there.

338
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:41,817
They have state-of-the-art
science labs,

339
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:44,486
it's right next door to
the Metropolitan Museum.

340
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:47,623
Seven million people live in New York.

341
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:50,626
It's the most densely
populated city in America.

342
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:54,930
Right on the Eastern Seaboard.

343
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:56,832
And?

344
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:00,069
And the army would never let you go.

345
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,509
So I'm just supposed to stay
here in this prison camp?

346
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:09,578
Get knocked up by one of the guards?

347
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:10,845
Oh, don't be vulgar.

348
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,647
Why are we even here?

349
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:22,391
Everything is a secret!

350
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:25,927
It's Kafkaesque!

351
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:32,301
Well, at least she's reading.

352
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:34,736
We've been working forever.

353
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,339
Barely made a dent. These are for you.

354
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:40,376
What's the over-under on how much
time we'll shave off Thin Man?

355
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,444
I got a Mars Bar that says 10 days.

356
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:44,646
You honestly think we're
gonna outflank Reed Akley

357
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,548
and a staff of 600 by 10 days?

358
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,683
No, honestly, I think
we're gonna beat them by 20,

359
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:50,485
but I'm spineless, so my money's on 10.

360
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,321
Honestly, my money's on it doesn't matter

361
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,390
'cause we're never gonna finish by morning.

362
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:56,859
Here.

363
00:24:56,893 --> 00:25:00,196
Whoa. Nylons?

364
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,165
Yeah, he steals
them from the storage annex.

365
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,234
What the hell do you
want with ladies' nylons?

366
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:08,069
- They're rationed.
- And?

367
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:10,372
Girls love them. Girls can't get 'em.

368
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:12,341
I spread the wealth,
they spread their legs.

369
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,209
We need reinforcements.

370
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:16,378
We've got to have the
calculations by tomorrow.

371
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:18,947
- You are our only hope.
- We're punched out for the night.

372
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:20,649
We can pay you.

373
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,386
Crosley.

374
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:33,362
- Great.
- All right.

375
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:35,831
Oh, great. Fantastic.

376
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,666
Thank you.

377
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,601
Hi, my name's Fritz.

378
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:42,404
That's for you. Hi. Fritz.

379
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:44,406
Hi, you can call me Fritz.

380
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:58,920
I give up.

381
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:03,725
This chrysanthemum, it's
supposed to be white.

382
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,294
So it's a hybrid.

383
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:13,502
Did you know

384
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:16,605
that we're not allowed to
grow produce on the Hill?

385
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:21,643
Must be something to do with the soil.

386
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:26,214
Well, sometimes a flower is just a flower.

387
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,688
Don't go and work.

388
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:35,524
Well, I have to finish some things.

389
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:37,526
What things?

390
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:43,732
When it's over, we will
go anywhere you want.

391
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:46,235
We'll find a desert
island, play Adam and Eve.

392
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:48,237
Good night.

393
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:57,712
Watch it, buddy.

394
00:26:57,747 --> 00:26:59,881
Get out of the way!

395
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:07,189
Abby?

396
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:13,428
Charlie, what on earth? It's this one.

397
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:15,864
This one. Come inside.

398
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,168
I was about to call the police,

399
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,437
but, you know, there's no
telephone in this place.

400
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:24,139
Shh.

401
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:27,109
This is Daddy's brand.
You can't get this anymore.

402
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:29,611
You can if your work's
got triple-A priority.

403
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,280
Shh! Are you drunk?

404
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:33,382
- Oh, shit.

405
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,250
- Charlie?

406
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:37,319
It's the whole street.

407
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:48,464
You know how many people live in Berlin?

408
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:50,432
Men, women, kids?

409
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:53,802
I wrote a letter to my father.

410
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:56,571
I said you'd think about his offer.

411
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:59,875
Oh, Jesus, Abby. This is what I am.

412
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:04,479
You are a loving father to our son.

413
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:08,750
And you are my handsome husband.

414
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:13,655
Take off your nightgown.

415
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,690
Charlie.

416
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:18,760
Joey's out cold. He won't hear us.

417
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:21,696
It's not Joey I'm worried about.

418
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:25,634
Oh, give them something
to put in our FBI file.

419
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:28,970
Hmm?

420
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:31,540
Hmm?

421
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:36,612
Come on.

422
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:42,051
♪ I just want
to be the one you love ♪

423

428
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:30,532
No! No!

429
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:45,847
Whatever it is, Frank, you can tell me.

430
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,718
I can't.

431
00:29:57,338 --> 00:30:00,140
Does the ringing in your ears
increase with stress?

432
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,641
No.

433
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,310
Some of the men find it helpful
to speak with the chaplain.

434
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:07,513
And they're not all religious.

435
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:10,516
We give chloral hydrate
for sleep disorders.

436
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,185
I can write you a script.

437
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:13,820
But if you'll take
a word of advice...

438
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,722
I'll take the pills.

439
00:30:35,476 --> 00:30:37,410
Nothing to worry about.

440
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:53,893
This wind's gonna blow
us all the way to Kansas.

441
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:01,333
There's no place like home.

442
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,805
How many drunken physicists

443
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,541
do you reckon we can cram into that shack?

444
00:31:09,943 --> 00:31:11,877
Lo siento.

445
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,648
Let's take it inside.

446
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:22,889
There we go, right there.

447
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:31,597
Whoa.

448
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:02,462
Mommy, my head itches.

449
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:07,032
I'm tired.

450
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,271
We need copies for Oppenheimer
so he can sell it in DC.

451
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,772
Where are we on the numbers?

452
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,641
Still at it and we're
running out of nylons.

453
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:17,110
All right, let's
go. Outside, right now.

454
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,611
Leave everything where it is.

455
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,813
Touch nothing.

456
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:22,482
I'll get it.

457
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,320
What the hell is going on?

458
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,522
They're arresting Bill Timchak.

459
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,825
Some files turned up in his dorm room.

460
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,861
- They can do that?
- All right, let's move.

461
00:32:34,895 --> 00:32:37,162
They've got tanks. They
can do whatever they like.

462
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,938
Colonel's collecting scalps.

463
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:48,207
Word is he's just getting started.

464
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:08,328
Don't tell me. They arrested the computers.

465
00:33:14,668 --> 00:33:18,104
Frank, I made a mistake.

466
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:19,805
I, uh...

467
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,708
I screwed up.

468
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:25,177
I swear to God I am not a spy. You know me.

469
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:33,119
It's the X-ray studies.

470
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:34,921
You said it was my best work.

471
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:41,594
What the hell did you do?

472
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:43,729
I've got a kid back in Oakland.

473
00:33:43,764 --> 00:33:45,264
Gracie.

474
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:48,434
She's sick and her meds cost a fortune.

475
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:51,904
I just thought when we all go back
home, I could sell the patents.

476
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:53,573
They're gonna figure that out.

477
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:55,074
You got to help me out, Frank.

478
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,944
Talk to the colonel.
Explain why I took 'em.

479
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,715
You stole secrets from
the United States Army.

480
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,752
You really think the colonel's
gonna stick around for a chitchat?

481
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:07,920
So what are you gonna do?

482
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,260
I'm gonna burn them.

483
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:16,128
They can't touch you if
they don't have proof.

484
00:34:16,162 --> 00:34:18,464
You got to get me transferred.
Send me to Chicago.

485
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:21,233
Or Site X. Christ,
Frank, I've got a family.

486
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,437
Then act like it! You want to protect them?

487
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:27,573
You go out there and do your
goddamn job like the rest of us.

488
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,354
- Two, one.

489
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:59,065
Colonel Cox wants to see you.

490
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,967
I'm not holding office hours today.

491
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,535
Now.

492
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:15,581
This can't be right. Did
you remember to check the...

493
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:17,049
It's right.

494
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:26,326
One of your boys stole
classified files. I'd like a name.

495
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,061
So you can stick him in
a hole till the end of the war?

496
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:31,931
I have a brother in the 4th Marine Raiders

497
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:35,000
in the Solomon Islands who
wants to come home to his family.

498
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:38,438
I knew nine men on the USS
Arizona who won't get that chance.

499
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:41,307
Our enemy crawled out of a cave
on the other side of this Earth

500
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:43,876
and attacked us on our own
soil, and they'll do it again.

501
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,811
We will not hand them the tools.

502
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,317
There's a leak in this lab.

503
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:53,986
Someone's been smuggling
tactical schematics off the Hill.

504
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,554
There is no spy in my group.

505
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,389
You think Bill Timchak was a spy?

506
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,660
He's an example. We live
in a world of consequences.

507
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:07,033
Must be lonely out there in the boondocks.

508
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:10,369
No resources, no
recognition for your group.

509
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:12,838
We're not here for the recognition.

510
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,777
I got a shipment in this morning.

511
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,748
10 state-of-the-art
IBM machines.

512
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:26,185
You think I'd horse-trade
a member of my own team?

513
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:29,321
Paucos immolamus ad servandos multos.

514
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:31,757
We sacrifice the few to save the many.

515
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,968
- 12 days?
- 12 weeks!

516
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,977
Hey, Dolores. I just need
two minutes of his time.

517
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:53,679
Dr. Oppenheimer doesn't have
an opening until the 18th.

518
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:56,115
It'll just take... - It'll have
to wait till he's back from DC.

519
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,683
He's already down in the car.

520
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:59,886
- I'll ride with him. That'll do.
- No, Frank.

521
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,921
- Thanks, Dolores.
- Frank, there's...

522
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:09,629
We can cut 12
weeks off Akley's timeline.

523
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:15,234
I thought we were going to the airport.

524
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,238
Lamy train depot.

525
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:22,008
General's seen fit to ground me.

526
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:24,710
It's too dangerous to fly.
Isn't that right, Tommy?

527
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:31,583
It's very touching, their
concern for my health.

528
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:35,988
It's been road-tested and
triple-checked, Robert.

529
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,659
If you'll just give me some IBM machines

530
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,393
and 30 more men,

531
00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:43,863
I can have the hydrodynamics
worked out in the next month.

532
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:49,068
This country, the Valles Caldera...

533
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:54,306
We call it a desert,
but it's a crematorium.

534
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:59,144
The mesas, all of it...
fallout from a volcano

535
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:01,947
that exploded a million
and a half years ago.

536
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,485
Someday it'll detonate
again, and everything you see

537
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,521
will be buried.

538
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,555
Just a question of time.

539
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,528
There are forces beyond our control.

540
00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:21,067
The United States Army is one of them.

541
00:39:23,637 --> 00:39:25,337
Your group's going to be dissolved, Frank.

542
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:26,772
What?

543
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:28,473
We're building Akley's bomb.

544
00:39:28,508 --> 00:39:32,211
- The ship has sailed.
- Well, turn it around.

545
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,746
This war chews up four
American kids every hour.

546
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:37,283
I just handed you 8,000 lives.

547
00:39:38,685 --> 00:39:41,320
Man is made by his belief.

548
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:44,123
As he believes, so he is.

549
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:45,958
The army believes in the Thin Man.

550
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:47,359
I don't give a shit about the army.

551
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:49,895
That's your mistake.

552
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:52,331
Tommy.

553
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:10,816
What about you, Robert?

554
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,351
What do you believe?

555
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:15,187
I believe the world is on fire.

556
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,590
And Thin Man's our chance to put it out.

557
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,326
You'll report directly to Akley.

558
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,623
Hey!

559
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,326
Hey, wait! That's my equipment.

560
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,015
Glen, what the hell is this?

561
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:18,517
Got my dishonorable discharge.

562
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,352
Colonel's shipping me off-site.

563
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:22,288
No. We'll go over his head.

564
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:24,356
It's not just me.

565
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,857
It's the whole group.

566
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:27,559
I'll call the Secretary of War.

567
00:41:27,594 --> 00:41:30,329
I'll tell him our work is vital
to the success of this project.

568
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,564
Frank. Frank.

569
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,141
You were the best student I ever had.

570
00:41:44,277 --> 00:41:46,778
And you know

571
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:50,850
that I would back you
to the edge of the Earth.

572
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:54,987
But I think we just fell off it.

573
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,652
Abby, what the hell did
you do to Joey's hair?

574
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:04,223
They are reading our mail.

575
00:43:04,257 --> 00:43:06,959
- What?
- All the children have head lice

576
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:08,494
and they are reading our mail.

577
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:11,096
He's three years old. He
can barely read his name.

578
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,998
I mailed this yesterday. A private letter

579
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,467
from me to my father and
they made notes in the margin.

580
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:17,068
- Who did?
- I don't know who.

581
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:18,837
- Spies, the army, I don't know.
- Abigail.

582
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:20,439
This place, these people,
they are all crazy.

583
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,474
We cannot... I will not stay.
- You're hysterical.

584
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:24,376
I can't even tell him where we live.

585
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,712
I can't even tell him that
our house is painted green.

586
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:28,813
It'll take some adjustment, that's all.

587
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:31,417
No, we are going back to Brookline
and we can stay with my parents.

588
00:43:31,451 --> 00:43:33,485
No, we are not going anywhere!

589
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,354
Listen to me. This is our home.

590
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:37,556
I made a commitment. It is done.

591
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,627
We're here till the end of the war.

592
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,955
Shit.

593
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,991
It's the altitude.

594
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:18,764
Charlie, please, why in
God's name would we stay here?

595
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:30,276
Okay.

596
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,344
What I'm about to tell you

597
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,247
is highly classified.

598
00:44:57,342 --> 00:45:01,612
Hey, how are we doing? Coming through.

599
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:09,753
Oh! Sorry.

600
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:12,423
I knew you wouldn't let a
little wind spoil your party.

601
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:14,692
We'll make a housewife out
of you yet, Liza Winter.

602
00:45:14,726 --> 00:45:16,360
I look forward to that, Rose.

603
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:17,895
Where's your husband?

604
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,796
I'm afraid that's above
my security clearance.

605
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:21,798
Excuse me.

606
00:45:24,936 --> 00:45:26,837
Take it through there.

607
00:45:27,906 --> 00:45:29,707
I finally get used to the desert air,

608
00:45:29,741 --> 00:45:31,575
then they send me off to Site W

609
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,644
to study the effects of alpha particles

610
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:35,579
on salmon reproduction.

611
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:37,080
Fish sex.

612
00:45:37,115 --> 00:45:39,616
Well, it beats the
Chickasaw Ordnance Works.

613
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:41,719
They're shipping my ass off to Tennessee.

614
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:43,487
I told my mother I got a promotion.

615
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:48,859
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pace
yourself there, Seabiscuit.

616
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:51,695
Jesus, this is a
15-year-old scotch.

617
00:46:24,796 --> 00:46:26,830
The man of the hour.

618
00:46:36,108 --> 00:46:39,377
Hello, ladies. How are you?

619
00:46:47,752 --> 00:46:49,553
Where have you been?

620
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:52,022
I have half the PhDs in America

621
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:54,492
eating canapés in our front room.

622
00:46:54,526 --> 00:46:56,860
Get rid of them.

623
00:46:56,895 --> 00:46:58,462
What?

624
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:01,765
Cancel the party.

625
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:17,380
Did something happen at work?

626
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:19,416
Work is fine.

627
00:47:21,486 --> 00:47:23,854
We made a deal when we came here.

628
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:26,189
I would never ask you questions

629
00:47:26,224 --> 00:47:27,991
unless I absolutely needed answers

630
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:29,660
and you would never lie to me.

631
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:31,662
And I haven't.

632
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:44,241
Frank.

633
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:49,647
Do you remember when I presented that paper

634
00:47:49,681 --> 00:47:52,483
on the purple orchid?

635
00:47:52,517 --> 00:47:54,751
Orchis mascula.

636
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:58,289
It lives on three continents.

637
00:47:58,323 --> 00:48:00,191
Sun or shade,

638
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:01,725
from Spain to Siberia,

639
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,595
it can survive almost anywhere.

640
00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:07,230
But it can't survive alone.

641
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:09,533
It's got a partner.

642
00:48:09,568 --> 00:48:13,504
It attaches itself to
the roots of the orchid.

643
00:48:13,538 --> 00:48:16,507
It's called a mycorrhiza.

644
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:19,643
And they make up their
own little ecosystem.

645
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:24,948
If you cut off that communication,

646
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:27,284
the orchid just shuts down.

647
00:48:29,821 --> 00:48:32,589
We had our own ecosystem.

648
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:36,193
The two of us.

649
00:48:37,495 --> 00:48:39,530
You're not a flower.

650
00:48:43,468 --> 00:48:46,269
We're not talking about me, Frank.

651
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:53,577
I'm protecting our family.

652
00:48:55,313 --> 00:48:57,581
From what?

653
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:28,078
I hear you all had fun last night.

654
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:33,984
Your husband must be important
to rate a place on Snob Hollow.

655
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:37,821
I'd live in a wigwam if it would
help them build it any faster.

656
00:49:37,856 --> 00:49:39,890
Build what?

657
00:49:41,192 --> 00:49:42,526
Your husband told you something.

658
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:45,696
- Oh...
- Well, don't hold out.

659
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:51,935
They call it the gadget.

660
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:57,641
It's a very complicated radar system

661
00:49:57,676 --> 00:49:59,810
that can spot one of Hitler's warplanes

662
00:49:59,844 --> 00:50:01,645
from the other side of the world.

663
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:08,418
There's no telling how many
lives they're going to save.

664
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:22,800
Conclusive proof,

665
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:25,302
Orientals cannot hold their drink.

666
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:27,338
All right, why don't you
sit this one out, buddy?

667
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:29,606
You people, you got your heads in the sand.

668
00:50:29,641 --> 00:50:31,909
You send your kids to school
right next to it.

669
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:35,178
- Lie to your wives about it.

670
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:56,667
You don't like fireworks?

671
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:59,870
Bombs bursting in air? Nah, not much.

672
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:05,575
You read a paper of mine.

673
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:08,011
"New Approach to Nuclear Cosmology."

674
00:51:08,046 --> 00:51:10,781
- Right.
- Your approach wasn't...

675
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:12,349
new.

676
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:16,453
The judges of the Forbes
Prize didn't see a problem.

677
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:18,722
They wouldn't.

678
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:24,595
You know, after you rejected my paper,

679
00:51:24,629 --> 00:51:27,765
I read everything you ever published.

680
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,734
You'll do fine.

681
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:33,203
You're Akley's new toy, right?

682
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,543
Can I ask you something?

683
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:43,747
What about the next war?

684
00:51:45,817 --> 00:51:49,520
What happens when Stalin's got one?

685
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:51,689
China?

686
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:53,590
The Shah of Iran.

687
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:02,766
You know the story of the golem?

688
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:09,139
A rabbi wanted to protect
the Jews of Prague,

689
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:12,209
so he built an automaton out of mud,

690
00:52:12,243 --> 00:52:14,011
brought it to life.

691
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:16,914
First the golem kills
the enemies of the Jews.

692
00:52:16,948 --> 00:52:19,082
Then it turns on Jews themselves.

693
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:23,120
See, he couldn't control it.

694
00:52:23,154 --> 00:52:26,056
He'd built Frankenstein's monster.

695
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:30,861
You been to Prague lately?

696
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:34,397
There aren't any Jews left.

697
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:06,329
There's something
I need to tell you.

698
00:53:06,364 --> 00:53:08,031
Whoo, happy Fourth!

699
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:10,200
We're building a weapon.

700
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:13,870
It's not like any weapon
the world's ever seen.

701
00:53:13,905 --> 00:53:17,574
It draws its energy from a
fast-neutron chain reaction.

702
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:21,712
It releases the power of an ancient star.

703
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:25,115
If it works,

704
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:28,685
and it's going to work,

705
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,087
it'll be more destructive
than all the bombs

706
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:34,725
dropped in all the wars
in history put together.

707
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:39,963
It'll bring armies to their knees.

708
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:42,833
Cities will disappear
in the blink of an eye.

709
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:44,935
The world will be united in peace

710
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:49,072
by the most just and noble
country in the history of mankind.

711
00:53:49,106 --> 00:53:52,442
Or it will burn to the ground.

712
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,945
Whoever builds it first,

713
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,746
that's the endgame.

714
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,782
So it has to be us.

715
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:05,155
Whatever it costs.

716
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:12,896
No entiendo.

717
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:42,613

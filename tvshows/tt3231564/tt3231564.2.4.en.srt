1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,718
<i>Previously on "Manhattan"...</i>

2
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:03,303
Dr. Oppenheimer has asked
me to run the new group.

3
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:06,509
How soon can you deliver?
A month? A year?

4
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,187
<i> Oppenheimer picked you because
he knows that he can control you.</i>

5
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:13,281
You're the director of G group. Direct.

6
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:16,284
I spent all day wondering why I
didn't make your idiotic group

7
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:18,587
and you left me on the bench because
you can't control your hard-on?

8
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:21,456
<i>Remind me of her name.</i>

9
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,625
There was a time when I hoped Crosley

10
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:27,345
would take a shine to my daughter.

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,965
If you're not a communist,

12
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:33,184
why are you risking your own
neck to give them a bomb?

13
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,803
<i>You know, if Dr. Winter</i>

14
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,805
<i>were in less than
comfortable circumstances,</i>

15
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:40,308
I would worry they may not
improve after today's events.

16
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,727
I can get you as far as
the Lamy train depot.

17
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:46,982
<i>I had a dream you jumped up</i>

18
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,984
<i>and licked my thighs.</i>

19
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:51,119
<i>Robert Oppenheimer's
having an affair.</i>

20
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:53,455
Abby, stay out of other
people's marriages.

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,157
Your husband's not going
to Washington tomorrow.

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,161
I do not need marital
advice from a deviant.

23
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:02,380
You should have Oppenheimer's job.

24
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,724
"Batter my heart, three-person'd God,

25
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,695
for you as yet but
knock, breathe, shine

26
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:16,864
and seek to mend.

27
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:18,866
That I may rise and stand,

28
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:20,918
overthrow me and bend your force

29
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:23,538
to break, blow, burn

30
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:25,540
and make me new."

31
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,214
Batter my heart, o' two-person'd boy.

32
00:01:33,216 --> 00:01:35,516
For you as yet but cover your loins

33
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,601
and abandon me.

34
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:40,521
They expected me on the
Hill two days ago.

35
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:41,973
No one's abandoning you.

36
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:46,561
I'll die if you leave.

37
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,907
I'm gonna miss the 4:10.

38
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:02,125
<i>Do you believe in reincarnation?</i>

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,628
Dr. Inessa says you and I

40
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:05,913
have been traveling
together for lifetimes.

41
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,632
You told your psychiatrist about me.

42
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,917
<i>I've been your daughter,
your brother, your wife.</i>

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,919
<i>You gave birth to me
in a European ghetto.</i>

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,137
You murdered me...

45
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:16,007
dozens of times. You enjoyed it.

46
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:23,430
What do you want from me?

47
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,400
Same thing that you want.

48
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:29,604
Hold me down under the water.

49
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:33,107
Do it.

50
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:36,277
<i>Do it.</i>

51
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:38,145
<i>Do it!</i>

52
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,544
What am I looking at?

53
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:29,046
Request for a Declaration
of Taking Property 112,

54
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,048
Ms. Maria Capo-Berryman,

55
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,668
- Tract B-31 quadrant...
- English.

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,886
We need to buy this lady's
farm so we can blow it up.

57
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,505
The judge is a hard-ass.

58
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:39,340
He wants to know why we're
trying to stiff her.

59
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:40,641
I thought this went away.

60
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,009
She claims the land is worth $750.

61
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,228
The Army appraised it at $744.

62
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:45,896
And the Army can't pony up six bucks?

63
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,515
There are 43 of these. Today.

64
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:49,984
- Tomorrow there could be...
- Jesus.

65
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,973
Dr. Isaacs, I need an
ETA on the machine tools.

66
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,154
Just, uh, take a number.

67
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:55,323
Um, where are the
updated X-ray studies?

68
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:57,358
- On your desk. And if I could...
- No calls.

69
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:08,703
Jesus, Nancy, I said no calls!

70
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,541
So... what do we tell the judge?

71
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:16,177
Right. Tell him that I said

72
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,546
that he can wipe his ass with
the Declaration of Taking.

73
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:21,432
Tell him that this eminent
domain is imminent,

74
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,684
- And tell Ms. Caperberry...
- Capo-Berryman...

75
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:27,054
...to take her $744 or she
can take up her grievances

76
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,056
with the business end
of a Sherman tank.

77
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:30,608
We don't have time for this.

78
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,276
God damn it! What?

79
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,944
Blasphemy doesn't suit you.

80
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,281
Uh, Dr. Oppenheimer, sir. Sorry.

81
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:40,034
<i>You're too high up on the chart
for "sirs" and "sorries."</i>

82
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:42,119
Yeah, well, uh, things have
been a little hectic here.

83
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,121
I thought you'd be back on Tuesday.

84
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:46,240
<i>There have been some unexpected delays.</i>

85
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:47,908
We can't afford any more delays.

86
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,077
We've missed the last three
interim delivery dates.

87
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,413
That's why I need your hand
on the tiller, Charlie.

88
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,749
- Sir, I think we need to...
- Split the governing board

89
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,084
into administrative and
scientific divisions.

90
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,220
<i>Cuts everyone's obligations by half,</i>

91
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:01,222
<i>and it frees me to run
the technical staff.</i>

92
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:02,973
Then do it.

93
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:05,426
I... I don't...
I don't think

94
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:06,927
it's my place to reconfigure the board.

95
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:08,262
Only you have the authority.

96
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,598
I'm granting you the
authority, Charlie.

97
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,933
Assert it. Do whatever you must.

98
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:16,020
If it helps to pretend
you're me, pretend.

99
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:18,773
That's what I do.

100
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:42,196
<i>First off, I'd like
to thank you all for being punctual</i>

101
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:44,399
<i>on our first official
morning as the Gun Group.</i>

102
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,367
<i>I'm sure many of you</i>

103
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:49,070
<i>would rather be working on implosion.</i>

104
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,456
<i>You may feel your talents
have been overlooked...</i>

105
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,742
<i>like the younger sibling
living in implosion's shadow.</i>

106
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,297
<i>But Charles Darwin was
a younger sibling</i>

107
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,382
<i>and so was America.</i>

108
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:05,470
<i>There's no question implosion
is a beautiful solution,</i>

109
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:08,139
<i>but beauty does not win wars.</i>

110
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,224
Wars are won by blunt force, brutality.

111
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:15,612
Guns, not beauty, have won every war

112
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,864
<i>since the Chinese
invented black powder.</i>

113
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,866
Guns liberated this
country from the British,

114
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:22,202
they liberated Europe
in the last world war.

115
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:25,072
A gun also liberated
Reed Akley's brain.

116
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:28,075
Thin Man was a gun-type weapon

117
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,077
based on a thousand years
of ballistic science.

118
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,912
You've got a barrel,
you've got a projectile.

119
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:34,414
Now, we all know Thin Man failed...

120
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,300
Is that what we're doing here?

121
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,051
Resurrecting a cadaver?

122
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:40,253
The problem with Thin
Man wasn't the gun.

123
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:42,389
It was the bullet... plutonium.

124
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:45,392
But if we swap plutonium for uranium,

125
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,060
the gun design can work.

126
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:50,597
And we are going to
make it work together.

127
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,400
Thank you, Helga.

128
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:56,069
Nothing quickens the pulse
at the start of a day's work

129
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,572
like the sight of a lady with a pistol.

130
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:01,074
Sadly, all the gumption
of American industry

131
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:04,411
won't enrich enough uranium
to blow up a privy.

132
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:06,496
<i>Not before 1950 at least.</i>

133
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,583
We few, we unhappy few,

134
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:12,252
have gathered here to wank out numbers

135
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:15,122
until the implosion group
gets its ticker-tape parade.

136
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:17,124
As head of the Gun
Group, I can assure you

137
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,459
we will not be<i> wanking</i> anything.

138
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,962
Ah. Head of the Gun Group, yes.

139
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,630
One of those snappy claques

140
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:27,017
that reports to the Chief
of the Projectile Division.

141
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,687
Ah, there's his name, Dr.
William Hogarth.

142
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,308
Who's for elevenses? Back in two hours?

143
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,384
So...

144
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:02,219
is this a case of the
clerical miscarriage

145
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:03,837
or sadistic prank of the gods?

146
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:06,006
Well, surely you didn't pick me.

147
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:09,309
I wouldn't have picked you in the
full flower of your talents,

148
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:12,229
much less this wilted state.

149
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:13,847
Well, then, perhaps you'd
entertain a request

150
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:16,233
for a favor for old times'.

151
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,319
It's not in my power to
transfer you to the test group.

152
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:21,238
Yeah, but you can sack me.

153
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:24,858
Mm, off the project. Send
me packing for good.

154
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:29,362
- For what cause?
- Truancy, insubordination.

155
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:32,949
Whatever insults your daughter
suffered at my hands.

156
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,003
Take your pick.

157
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,371
<i>Attention...
SED Team three</i>

158
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:40,874

159
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:46,379
When you come across a wounded buck,

160
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:49,933
the sporting thing to do is shoot it.

161
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,551
Please.

162
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:54,721
You've never been on a
shoot, have you, Paul?

163
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:58,942
At close range, the muzzle flash
ruins the flesh for eating.

164
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:01,778
No, I think I'll savor this meal.

165
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,454
The closest thing we have to
a medical reference at home

166
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:13,373
is the Talmud.

167
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:17,577
It's sort of like a Hebrew
"Farmer's Almanac."

168
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:22,916
Apparently, there are five
different colors of female blood

169
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,918
the rabbis consider to be unclean...

170
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:28,305
red, black, bright crocus,

171
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,424
earthy water, and diluted wine.

172
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,761
Let's call it "earthy water."

173
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:37,097
Is that bad?

174
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:39,766
Well, I'm no rabbi, but I think the AMA

175
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:43,820
would say it's an indication of
overly vigorous intercourse.

176
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:47,324
<i>Maybe just ask Dr. Isaacs
to go easy for a few days.</i>

177
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:48,608
Mm.

178
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:53,446
<i>Nurse!</i>

179
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:55,499
<i>Can I get some help in here, please?</i>

180
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:58,118
Nurse?

181
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,844
Kill the spider. Please kill it.

182
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:13,133
Don't let it get away.
Just do it. Please.

183
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:14,601
Oh, thank you.

184
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:28,448
Joey was born on the fourth
floor of Beth Israel.

185
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,150
Her mother would be horrified

186
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,869
if she knew how her second
grandchild would be born.

187
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,487
If my mother saw this
place, she'd find it

188
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,206
the least horrifying thing about me.

189
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:41,545
Oh.

190
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:46,082
<i>The doctor says they're
not real contractions.</i>

191
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,836
I told
him I'm not leaving

192
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:52,005
until he takes this
thing out of my womb.

193
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:54,507
Does Dr. Oppenheimer know you're here?

194
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:56,843
I can put a call through to Washington.

195
00:10:56,845 --> 00:11:00,564
We both know that's a fool's errand.

196
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:03,683
Well, at least let me get the nurse.

197
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:06,353
<i>I don't need anyone to hold my hand.</i>

198
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:08,154
I'm royalty.

199
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,190
I've lived on relief checks.

200
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:13,860
I've lost a husband to war and
others to lawyers. I've...

201
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,946
<i>I've seen the elephant before.</i>

202
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:22,252
They say the, uh... the
first baby is the hardest.

203
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:25,288
Was your son difficult?

204
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,876
Robert's leaving me.

205
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,927
Charlie!

206
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:49,396
Abby, what's wrong?

207
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,448
- Is Joey okay?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,453
The Oppenheimers are splitting up.

209
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:58,939
- Abby?
- What?

210
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:00,540
I told you to leave it alone.

211
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:03,960
Today, of all days, I do
not have time for gossip.

212
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:06,212
It's not gossip, it's intelligence.

213
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,547
Kitty told me herself.

214
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,299
What did she tell you, exactly?

215
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,917
She said he's leaving
her for that woman

216
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:12,919
in San Francisco, the Communist.

217
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:14,921
He's with her right now.

218
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:20,060
What, he told you he was
having lunch with Roosevelt?

219
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:22,095
Charlie, this is your chance.

220
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:25,432
For what?

221
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:29,736
Well, it... it's not just
his family he's abandoning.

222
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,321
He's leaving the project.

223
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:33,273
No, Abby. You must've misunderstood.

224
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:35,108
- Robert wouldn't do that.
- Don't do that.

225
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,326
I understand perfectly.

226
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,578
He's dropping the reins in your lap.

227
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,613
The fate of the war, Charlie.

228
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:42,499
You're already doing Oppenheimer's job.

229
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,784
It's time you had the title.

230
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,792
Nancy?

231
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:55,462
I've reduced men three pay
grades for calling me less.

232
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,597
Colonel.

233
00:12:57,631 --> 00:13:00,133
What can I do for you?

234
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:04,220
What's that smell?

235
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,141
Did you tell Judge Foster Clements

236
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:12,645
to wipe his ass with the
Declaration of Taking forms?

237
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,647
- Did he really?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

238
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,700
<i>Could be his dog's,
could be his wife's.</i>

239
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:20,820
The taxonomy of feces
is outside my purview.

240
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,873
It was a poor choice of words.

241
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:28,628
All due respect, Colonel,

242
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:31,664
wrangling local judges...
it's not my purview.

243
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,500
It's Dr. Oppenheimer's.

244
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,001
Well, until one of you geniuses

245
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:37,670
manages to bend the laws of space-time,

246
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:40,974
he can't be here and in
Washington simultaneously.

247
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:42,976
So you'll have to be his surrogate.

248
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,178
Right. Washington.

249
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:47,847
And he might be there a while.

250
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:49,733
Operation Overlord is in motion.

251
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:52,352
Overlord? It's happening now?

252
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,904
Which is why we can't
abide snafus like this.

253
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,239
Hitler's backed into a corner.

254
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:57,690
He'll accelerate his project.

255
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:59,692
We have to keep pace.

256
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:03,530
We might need some reorganization.

257
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:06,833
What exactly are you proposing?

258
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,535
I think the Tech Area org chart

259
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:12,872
might be outside of your
purview also, Colonel.

260
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,461
Do you know why the general
chose Robert Oppenheimer?

261
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:21,381
He dines with Cabinet members,

262
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:24,517
smokes cigars with Cochiti Indians.

263
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:26,352
Rides stallions with governors,

264
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,888
takes target practice
with enlisted men.

265
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,224
<i>Oppenheimer keeps the trains running</i>

266
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,276
<i>with salesmanship and charm.</i>

267
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,111
I haven't seen much of that lately.

268
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:37,230
And without jeopardizing the project,

269
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:39,532
by asking a judge to defecate

270
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:44,287
on U.S. Code 40, subsection 3114.

271
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,657
There isn't a physicist on God's
earth who could replace him.

272
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:05,809
Winter.

273
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,014
You have some pretty fancy friends.

274
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:16,653
<i>Clean yourself up, for Chrissakes.</i>

275
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:52,222
Martha. How... how did you...?

276
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,026
Is it... is it...

277
00:15:57,061 --> 00:15:58,978
Is the war over?

278
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,649
Yours is.

279
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:30,421
President Roosevelt...

280
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,923
ringing up the warden in
that tenth circle of hell.

281
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:35,542
Wish those spooks had recorded that.

282
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:38,378
It wasn't Franklin.

283
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
You said Einstein
called the White House.

284
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,883
It was Eleanor.

285
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:45,385
She handles the lost causes.

286
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,393
Frank, you need to slow down.

287
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,233
I know.

288
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:06,073
I tried to keep myself sane
remembering your hands.

289
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,909
Every line...

290
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,411
every pruning scar.

291
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,917
I should've kept you and
Callie out of this.

292
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,804
So the Princeton house is rented.

293
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,756
But that Craftsman down the street

294
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,558
is back on the market again.

295
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:26,426
- I already talked to the realtor.
- Liza...

296
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:29,596
And then we can visit your
father on the way home.

297
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:31,431
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

298
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,186
You don't have to apologize.

299
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,357
I have to go back to the Hill.

300
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,245
You just escaped from a prison.

301
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,531
You... you want to break back into one?

302
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,834
We're never going back to that place.

303
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,171
No... no, I...

304
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,956
I don't expect you to come with me.

305
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,674
<i>...known details.</i>

306
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,261
<i>All figures to follow are
best known estimates.</i>

307
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,347
<i>There is a new front
in the war in Europe.</i>

308
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:08,936
<i>156,000 Allied soldiers have
landed in northern France.</i>

309
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,139
<i>The invasion is still
in its earliest hours,</i>

310
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,474
<i>But all indications point
to a promising start</i>

311
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,644
<i>along the approximately 60-mile front.</i>

312
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,364
<i>Casualties have been
lighter than expected</i>

313
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,533
<i>with no signs of
immediate retaliation...</i>

314
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,368
I've got a half brother out
there slaughtering Heinies.

315
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm sitting here like a woman.

316
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,789
Don't flatter yourself.

317
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,958
Turn it off.

318
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:33,994
<i>- The show must go on.</i>
- For how long?

319
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,963
We're... we're taking Europe.
Isn't class dismissed?

320
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:40,167
Not until the last Jap is eating
apple pie with his chopsticks.

321
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:43,220
I've been asked to send
a liaison to Site X

322
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:46,340
to oversee the enrichment
of their marvelous uranium.

323
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,841
I spent three years at Site X.

324
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,344
I know the staff. I'd be glad to go.

325
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,846
As head of the Gun Group, it
should be my responsibility.

326
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:55,682
Nothing so poignant as idle ambition.

327
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,569
But if you two insist on a duel...

328
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,854
I meant to weigh in on
the relative merits

329
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:04,157
of three equally deficient
refinement techniques.

330
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:09,496
Best proposal buys you a ticket
on the Chattanooga Choo Choo.

331
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,032
Why would you want to leave the Hill?
You just got here.

332
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:14,368
Did take a bit longer than I'd hoped.

333
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,203
But if the war is almost over,

334
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:19,790
I can't pass up a chance for a
final promotion now, can I?

335
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:28,348
<i>Hitler will dig
in, probably for months.</i>

336
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,601
And every day he does, the
Army pumps Oppenheimer

337
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:33,053
or Isaacs, the whole senior
staff, full of their lies.

338
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:35,555
"Imminent Threats," V2 over New York,

339
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,691
cities of ruins.

340
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,610
They'll say anything to
build that thing faster.

341
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,561
Racing an imaginary German project.

342
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:44,031
Yeah. Trust me,

343
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:48,402
all I want is to come
with you to Princeton.

344
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:51,738
But you're the only
man who can fix this.

345
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,707
Have you ever wondered why

346
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:56,243
you're always the only man for the job?

347
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,629
It's just a few days.
That's all I need.

348
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,914
There are hundreds and
thousands of soldiers

349
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,549
hurling themselves up those beaches,

350
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,468
but Frank Winter thinks
he's the only man

351
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:07,254
who can save the world<i> alone.</i>

352
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:09,473
<i>You know Glen warned me about this.</i>

353
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:12,092
<i>In 1939, you thought
you were the only man</i>

354
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:13,593
who could set this ball rolling.

355
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,262
Now in 1944, you're the only one

356
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,730
who can stand in its way.

357
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:19,599
This time it's different.

358
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,436
You know, I'm not gonna chauffeur
you back up that hill.

359
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,655
You want it so bad, you can hitchhike.

360
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:25,989
<i>I apologize.</i>

361
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,658
Big doin's today.

362
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,994
Y'all finished or you
want something more?

363
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:35,332
That, uh...

364
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,918
that Model A you got out there.

365
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:40,287
It says there's a contest.

366
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:42,255
Will it get me as far as New Mexico?

367
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,790
Jesus, Frank.

368
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,792
All you gotta do to win it
is beat Red's own record

369
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,294
for eating Texas red chili.

370
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,763
But I should warn you...
no one's ever done it,

371
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,682
and the chili's two bucks if you lose.

372
00:20:51,716 --> 00:20:55,268
Well, since yesterday I
was starving to death.

373
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:56,470
I kinda like my chances.

374
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,971
All right.

375
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:00,857
Papa, Sonny, bucket of Texas Red.

376
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,392
Comin' right up, Mama.

377
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,950
You had no right to
keep a secret that big.

378
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,618
I had no choice.

379
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:13,286
<i>Because you took an oath?</i>

380
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:16,323
You broke every rule in the
Army handbook except one.

381
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,825
What does that make me? The
exception that proves the rule?

382
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:38,895
Is Red human?

383
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,349
No, sir. That's him right there...

384
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,355
<i>a Berkshire hog.</i>

385
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:51,575
<i>Here are the latest
details as we now grasp them.</i>

386
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,911
<i>While landing along the beaches
of France continue even now,</i>

387
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,414
<i>dodging enemy fire along the shore,</i>

388
00:21:57,448 --> 00:22:00,033
<i>Prime Minister Churchill
informed the House of Commons...</i>

389
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,335
Lady of Norfolk had a
baby this morning.

390
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,870
Called her "Dee Day."

391
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:06,873
Spelled D-e-e Day.

392
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:09,543
Ain't that cute?

393
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,097
Naming your daughter after a land war?

394
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:20,125
It's adorable.

395
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:29,702
You're not as chatty
as the last mail girl.

396
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:52,308
How did you get in here?

397
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,360
Spycraft.

398
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:56,362
I told the janitor I was your cousin.

399
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:58,031
I have one aunt.

400
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,866
I'm pretty sure she's a virgin.

401
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,701
<i>You've been listening to the news?</i>

402
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,369
I have bigger news.

403
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:05,238
For us, anyway.

404
00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:11,495
Charlie Isaacs is gunning
for Oppenheimer's job.

405
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,328
<i>What?</i>

406
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,880
Yeah, Frank was just the warm-up act.

407
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,049
Now he's got Oppie in his crosshairs.

408
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,001
You remember what
happened to Julius Caesar

409
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:19,335
on the Ides of March?

410
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:22,088
No, I only read the first 10 pages.

411
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:26,843
Charlie thinks that he can
win the war by himself.

412
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:29,512
He pulled me and Fritz in
to make his case for him.

413
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:34,734
Well... then make it.

414
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:36,186
What?

415
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:38,321
This is good for us.

416
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:40,406
If Charlie Isaacs
overthrows Oppenheimer,

417
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:42,358
it sets the schedule back, right?

418
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,410
- I guess so.
- The longer that it takes anyone

419
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:46,579
to deliver a weapon, the
less chance anyone has

420
00:23:46,614 --> 00:23:49,916
of dropping it over a city ful
k before the war is over.

421
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,752
You wanna save lives, right?

422
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:58,541
So talk Charlie into it.

423
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,430
Uh, you are not Gretchen.

424
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:05,882
Two doors down.

425
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,767
Sorry.

426
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:14,057
We have to set some ground rules.

427
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,775
We can't be seen like this.

428
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,393
Well... so, what?

429
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:20,029
We just pass notes in the hall?

430
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:22,198
Like grade school?

431
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:23,950
We have to limit our contact.

432
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,953
If... if anyone asks, we, um...

433
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,738
we had a one-night stand.

434
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:31,241
It was a bad match.

435
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,293
Hmm.

436
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:38,081
Though since we are...

437
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,884
bending the rules.

438
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:44,754
This could be our last
hurrah for a while.

439
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:47,924
- Stop.
- Why?

440
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:49,475
Because we're cousins?

441
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:53,596
Don't be an altar boy, Jim.

442
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:58,601
I am the only one on the Hill
that knows what you really are.

443
00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:01,154
And you're the only one
who knows what I am.

444
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:03,990
And if I wasn't?

445
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:07,944
Does it really matter?

446
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:32,302
They're not gonna let
you back on the Hill.

447
00:25:32,353 --> 00:25:34,804
You think it was hard getting out?

448
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:36,556
I have to try.

449
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:57,493
I'll take you to the
bottom of the Hill.

450
00:25:57,495 --> 00:25:59,495
But I go no further.

451
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:01,798
There's no question our
efficiency takes a nosedive

452
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:03,633
when Oppenheimer is off campus.

453
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:08,054
89% of targets met to
81% when he's away.

454
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:11,174
But if, God forbid,
we lost him entirely,

455
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:13,059
we'd hit zero. Zilch.

456
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:15,345
<i>Oppenheimer is the reason
we have Triple A priority.</i>

457
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,313
You think we'd slip to AA-1?

458
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:21,517
AA-2. We wouldn't have the
metals or the machine tools

459
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,821
<i>that we'd need to build
a prototype until 1946.</i>

460
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:27,824
<i>If we have any chance of hitting
our targets, we need Oppie.</i>

461
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:29,692
<i>We need him on the Hill full-time.</i>

462
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:32,528
And never mind what happens
if the Germans accelerate.

463
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:35,365
Yeah, but that's not
accounting for Stan Musial.

464
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,866
<i>Do you remember, uh,</i>

465
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:39,535
remember last year when the Cardinals

466
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:41,337
lost Enos Slaughter to the service?

467
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:43,206
Yeah, of course. I'm from St. Louis.

468
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,540
<i>Right. Everybody thought
you guys were cooked.</i>

469
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:47,043
But you put Musial in right field

470
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:49,879
and you won the pennant by 18 games.

471
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:53,049
Now, we're all assuming that no
one can replace Oppenheimer,

472
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,886
but what if we had a Musial,

473
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:59,889
<i>someone equal to Oppenheimer or better?</i>

474
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:02,225
<i>For all we know, we could
be testing by March.</i>

475
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:04,227
<i>But the Cards
still lost the series.</i>

476
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:06,229
By moving Musial to right,

477
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,231
they had no one to replace him in left.

478
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:10,733
I mean, maybe if Frank was still
here, you would have a case,

479
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:13,486
- <i>but otherwise...</i>
- This stays between us.

480
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:22,245
I need to speak with Dr.
Oppenheimer now.

481
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:23,579
Can you get him on the phone, please?

482
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:25,748
No. But I can get you a map.

483
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:40,596
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

484
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,268
Is Kitty asking for me?

485
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:48,271
<i>Everyone's</i> asking for you.

486
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:51,407
The two divisions insist on meeting
with you before they split,

487
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:53,609
and the Munitions Board won't
raise urgency standings

488
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,078
without your sign-off.

489
00:27:55,112 --> 00:27:57,447
Also, apparently, I pissed off

490
00:27:57,498 --> 00:28:00,283
Judge Clements of Santa Fe County.

491
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:02,618
Clements. You should
invite him to my stable.

492
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,455
He loves gelding horses.

493
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:07,457
I don't mean horses
that have been gelded.

494
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:10,793
He loves the specific
act of gelding a horse.

495
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:13,296
Jesus. Do you hear yourself?

496
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:15,848
It's one thing to play
the oriental sage,

497
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:18,768
it's another to smoke the opium.

498
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:21,137
Do we have a problem, Dr. Isaacs?

499
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:24,941
You were here nine days in all of May.

500
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:26,359
None in June.

501
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:30,113
I can't do my job when I'm doing yours.

502
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:31,781
Don't you want my job?

503
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,117
That's what everyone
thinks, including my wife,

504
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:35,368
but they're wrong.

505
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:38,154
I-I want you to want your job.

506
00:28:44,912 --> 00:28:47,463
This is where it will happen...

507
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,499
your test.

508
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,002
Where the caldera opens up
and swallows the world.

509
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:55,755
It's your test, Robert.

510
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:03,346
So, that's it. You're,
uh, really walking away?

511
00:29:03,397 --> 00:29:06,899
I'll be alerting General Groves
that you are my successor.

512
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:09,569
No, I don't accept.

513
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:11,938
It's D-day.

514
00:29:13,407 --> 00:29:16,359
75,000 American soldiers

515
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:18,027
are throwing themselves
into enemy fire,

516
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,862
and you're abandoning ship.

517
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:22,365
You think Overlord wouldn't have
happened without Eisenhower?

518
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,367
You're wrong.

519
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:26,369
"Great men"?

520
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,837
Pasteboard masks.

521
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,756
I know you were in San Francisco.

522
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,542
Take a mistress. What do I care?

523
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,044
Take a whole harem if it
gets you through the day.

524
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,046
But you have got to
get through the day.

525
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:38,931
Oh, to finish the gadget?

526
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:40,766
So that we win the war?

527
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:44,187
Then lord it over our allies in peace.

528
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:47,056
Wave it under Stalin's
nose if he gets rowdy.

529
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:49,725
That sounds pretty Red.

530
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:52,778
- Careful, Charlie.
- This woman, whoever she is,

531
00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:54,780
she's a Communist, isn't she?

532
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:56,816
She's planting ideas in your head.

533
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:01,237
Her name is Jean.

534
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,909
Look, I haven't been perfect, either.

535
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,579
I was with another woman,
I cared about her,

536
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,831
but... but I have a family.

537
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:16,969
- So you ended it.
- Yes, I ended it.

538
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:22,425
If that was in your power,

539
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:25,478
then you have no early idea how I feel.

540
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:35,771
<i>Already
throughout the nation,</i>

541
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:37,607
<i>countless church
services are being held.</i>

542
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,158
<i>Many states and cities</i>

543
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:41,611
<i>have issued special
proclamations on D-Day.</i>

544
00:30:41,613 --> 00:30:43,779
<i>Britain's King George is
scheduled to go on the air</i>

545
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,248
<i>this afternoon at 3:00</i>

546
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:46,949
<i>for the special "Invasion Day" message.</i>

547
00:30:51,622 --> 00:30:55,591
What do you think of Winnifred?
"Win" for short.

548
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:58,628
<i>A triumphant name for a postwar baby.</i>

549
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,464
<i>It was Joey's idea.
Like "Winnie the Pooh."</i>

550
00:31:05,352 --> 00:31:08,020
- <i>You had a long day.</i>
- I was with Robert.

551
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:10,856
He's back. What did he say?

552
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:13,643
You were right.

553
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:15,561
He wants me to take over.

554
00:31:16,897 --> 00:31:18,314
I knew it.

555
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:20,199
Charlie, I'm so proud of you.

556
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,817
Abby, there's nothing to celebrate.

557
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,319
You are worse than my father.

558
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,037
If it were up to him,
he'd be selling hats

559
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:27,323
out of the back of a truck on Route 60.

560
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:30,660
But, luckily, my mother had a
little more faith in his product.

561
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:33,462
For the millionth time...

562
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,331
I'm not a businessman.

563
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:38,167
Well, no, but you have the
best products on the market...

564
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:40,636
- your brain.
- For Christ's sake, my brain

565
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:43,673
can't requisition B-29 bombers, Abby.

566
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:46,225
Or keep Senator Truman and his cronies

567
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,678
from shutting off the money tap.

568
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,513
Only Oppenheimer can do that.

569
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:52,815
Well, if Robert thinks that
you can steer the project...

570
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:55,184
I don't think he cares
if I steer the project

571
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:57,069
right into the Rio Grande.

572
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,439
<i>This is bad, Abby.</i>

573
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:04,860
- Okay.
- <i>Without Oppenheimer,</i>

574
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:07,863
his connections, the game's over.

575
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,752
Well... well, then we
have to change his mind.

576
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,205
<i>We</i> can't do anything.

577
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:18,374
You think we're some kind of a team

578
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:21,344
just 'cause you know about the gadget?

579
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:24,046
<i>I just spent the last hour
in the middle of nowhere</i>

580
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:27,717
<i>wasting my breath trying to
convince the man to stay.</i>

581
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:29,719
Well...

582
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:33,522
Maybe you're wasting your breath

583
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:35,141
on the wrong person.

584
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,112
If that's true, someone
has to do something.

585
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:56,702
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

586
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:57,763
<i>Today's Allied casualty list.</i>

587
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:02,739
The thought of all those boys
cut down in their prime.

588
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:07,010
You know, Clark Gable enlisted
after his wife's plane crashed.

589
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:09,179
Yes.

590
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:12,515
Uh, he... he was very
good in "Boom Town."

591
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:09,290
Hello?

592
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,875
Hello.

593
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,660
Am I speaking with the
lady of the house?

594
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:16,798
This is, uh, Doris Lombard
with "Redbook Magazine."

595
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:18,299
<i>Well, I'm the only one here.</i>

596
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,718
<i>I suppose that makes me the lady.</i>

597
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:22,720
Unmarried. Perfect.

598
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,339
We are conducting a survey

599
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:27,175
what the modern girl
looks for in a man.

600
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:29,894
May I have your name and initial?

601
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:33,731
My name is Jean. Initial "T."

602
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:37,735
What a sensible name.

603
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,854
Now, do you have a gentleman,

604
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:42,523
or do you prefer to play the field?

605
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:45,693
<i>There's no field,</i>

606
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:49,330
<i>just 3,000 miles between
conjugal visits.</i>

607
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:51,199
Sounds like a strain.

608
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:54,202
How do you keep the fireplace stoked

609
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:56,371
with this... gentleman?

610
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:58,206
<i>We talk on the telephone.</i>

611
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,092
Sometimes we swallow each other whole.

612
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:05,463
<i>Don't you ever worry he
might be stepping out on you?</i>

613
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:09,684
<i>I know he is with his wife.</i>

614
00:35:09,718 --> 00:35:12,887
<i>Oh, a married man. That's risky.</i>

615
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:14,389
You're hovering.

616
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:16,641
Thank you.

617
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:25,733
I'm so sorry to come by
at a time like this.

618
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:27,735
It's about Robert.

619
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:29,237
I'm four centimeters dilated

620
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:30,788
and he's packing his steamer trunks.

621
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:32,206
What else do you want to know?

622
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:33,908
Please. I need you to reason with him.

623
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,128
He won't listen to me.

624
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:40,581
He tried to murder a man once.

625
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,550
Did you know that?

626
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:43,918
His physics tutor at Cambridge.

627
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:46,587
He was upset over a paper,

628
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:50,591
so he dipped an apple in cyanide
and left it on the man's desk.

629
00:35:50,642 --> 00:35:51,809
Like Snow White.

630
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:53,761
- That's...
- Certifiable?

631
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:56,647
She makes him look like the
model of mental health.

632
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:58,266
Jean is out of her mind

633
00:35:58,268 --> 00:35:59,817
and that's why he can't resist her.

634
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:03,604
You want me to reason with him?

635
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:06,274
For five years I have been
my husband's straightjacket,

636
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:08,359
and he's finally slipped out of it.

637
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:11,946
<i>What about your reputation?</i>

638
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:14,499
<i>Don't you worry about what
might happen if word got out?</i>

639
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,451
I try not to associate
with the kind of people

640
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:17,952
who value reputations.

641
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:21,956
Well, what about your gentleman friend?

642
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:26,961
Don't you think the affair
might affect his career?

643
00:36:30,215 --> 00:36:32,633
<i>This isn't a survey, is it?</i>

644
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,724
I know what you are.

645
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:44,529
Seducing him with pornographic sonnets

646
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:46,481
and Freudian nonsense.

647
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:50,284
<i>Who is this?</i>

648
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:51,786
He's about to have another child,

649
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,239
and you want to rip him
away from his family.

650
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,127
What do you mean "another child"?

651
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:04,131
Oh. Of course he didn't tell you.

652
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,550
I mean, he lies to his wife,

653
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:07,385
why shouldn't he lie to you?

654
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,591
<i>Is this Kitty?</i>

655
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:18,679
He doesn't love you.

656
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:22,517
You're just a rag.

657
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:24,151
You are nothing.

658
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:27,188
And you will<i> never</i> see
my husband again.

659
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:44,755
They just opened the doors
and let him walk out.

660
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,208
Well, it's okay. I
know where he's going.

661
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,460
I'll call you back.

662
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:55,516
Dr. Oppenheimer is leaving his wife

663
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:58,436
for a Communist in San Francisco.

664
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,471
Jean Tatlock.

665
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,641
You knew.

666
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:09,897
Did you know that he's
abandoning the project for her?

667
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:12,617
Tendering his resignation,
effective immediately.

668
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:14,702
Cost to the schedule if he leaves.

669
00:38:14,736 --> 00:38:17,038
Three months lost at least.

670
00:38:17,072 --> 00:38:21,075
Assuming the Magpie intelligence
is right, that's the ball game.

671
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:23,294
By next summer Washington,
D.C.'s a crater,

672
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:27,331
and, uh, Heisenberg's on the
cover of "Time" magazine.

673
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:36,173
We have to do something.

674
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:39,260
We?

675
00:38:39,262 --> 00:38:41,262
<i>Well, you said no one can replace him.</i>

676
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:42,813
Or conscript him.

677
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:46,100
He works on the project voluntarily.

678
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:49,487
His wife says the woman is sick.

679
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:52,239
The state of California must have
ordinances for that sort of thing.

680
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,609
Couldn't you lock her
up for her own safety?

681
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:57,445
Oppenheimer is a master of bureaucracy.

682
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,330
He'd simply wave a magic pen.

683
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:02,450
Right. I... I'm not telling
you how to do your job.

684
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,453
I'm just telling you that
there's a job to be done.

685
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:11,959
Frank Winter was a problem.
We made him disappear.

686
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:24,927
Liquid diffusion can enrich
the feedstock for K-25.

687
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:26,479
As you can see, Dr. Hogarth,

688
00:39:26,513 --> 00:39:28,664
it's our best chance
at rapid enrichment.

689
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:30,599
Yeah, that's just a stopgap.

690
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,269
Um, my proposal is to skip Alpha stage

691
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,771
and move directly to the
Beta track of the calutron.

692
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,444
Still a long way from
overcoming the uranium problem.

693
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:45,831
But it's competent work from
the groundlings in the pit.

694
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,784
I think you'll see if you examine
my detailed calculations...

695
00:39:48,835 --> 00:39:52,621
Very tedious all this is.
I have no doubt.

696
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:56,625
But I was intrigued by a third proposal

697
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:58,377
that came across my desk.

698
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:03,632
Yeah. Apologies. I'll,
um, happily return those

699
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,601
to their proper owner.

700
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,636
I believe her name was Eloise.

701
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,139
You spent a... an evening
with young Eloise

702
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,640
on top of my desk?

703
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:13,359
She said that you'd given
her the night off.

704
00:40:13,393 --> 00:40:14,693
Wouldn't want a girl to starve.

705
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:16,812
Hope it's not a firing offense.

706
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,864
Oh, God, Crosley.

707
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:21,116
Congratulations, Paul.

708
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:24,487
I've decided you will
be the Site X liaison.

709
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:26,322
What?

710
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:37,216
This is K-6. Outside
line to San Francisco.

711
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,085
<i>Douglas 8522.</i>

712
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,516
<i>Hello?</i>

713
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,735
Is this Douglas 8522?

714
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,272
<i>Who's calling?</i>

715
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:06,195
Put Jean on the phone.

716
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,781
Inspector?

717
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:16,956
<i>This is Inspector Dunn, SFPD.</i>

718
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,378
<i>I'm afraid that won't be possible.</i>

719
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:24,930
<i>There's been an incident.</i>

720
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:25,357
Tell Callie I'll call
her as soon as I can.

721
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,441
You know...

722
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,611
it wasn't because of some Army code.

723
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,898
<i>That's not why I didn't tell
you what we were building.</i>

724
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,485
It was because I knew
what you would say.

725
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:12,821
<i>You'd have probably talked me out of it</i>

726
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:15,207
<i>before we crossed the
Pennsylvania border.</i>

727
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:18,293
I'd have tried.

728
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,968
I am sorry.

729
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:29,004
<i>I had no right to make a choice
that big for the both of us.</i>

730
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:35,144
So, now it's your choice.

731
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:38,514
If you think that we should
go to Princeton, we'll go.

732
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:40,349
We'll go right now.

733
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:47,476
Abby.

734
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:57,413
Frank.

735
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:02,868
They told me...

736
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:07,818
I thought you were dead.

737
00:46:10,056 --> 00:46:11,438
They lied.

738
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:15,040

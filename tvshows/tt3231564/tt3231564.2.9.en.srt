25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Previously on "Manhattan"...

26
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,880
Robert Oppenheimer's having an affair.

27
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,730
- We have to do something. - We?

28
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,310
Frank Winter was a problem. You made him disappear.

29
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,770
Beuker. Joseph Beuker.

30
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,950
Charlie Isaacs.

31
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,340
I need an address for a woman who died last year.

32
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm trying to contact her next of kin.

33
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,940
I spoke with Miss Tatlock on the telephone,

34
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,790
and I said some cruel things.

35
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,020
I hereby declare you a citizen

36
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,690
of the United States of America.

37
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,920
Welcome home, son.

38
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,890
Is that the man you remember?

39
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,140
"Brooklyn". No ideology, no beliefs beyond himself,

40
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,610
thinks he's in a spy picture.

41
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,100
What are you doing? Give that to me. Give--

42
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,590
"Perseus believes that he is more intelligent than he is,

43
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,400
which makes him susceptible to flattery."

44
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,780
Those notes are not about you.

45
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,350
Well, I guess that there's another Soviet spy on the hill.

46
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,260
President Roosevelt is assembling a Target Committee

47
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,410
to decide how the Gadget's used

48
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,010
and who it's going to be dropped on.

49
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,320
You can't make me fix Charlie Isaacs' broken bomb.

50
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,380
I want a seat on the Target Committee.

51
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,090
I can get the scientists a seat,

52
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,170
but it won't be you.

53
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,770
What if someone dipped a brush

54
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,400
in the wrong can of paint?

55
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,560
Convince the Target Committee

56
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,470
to demonstrate the bomb on an uninhabited island.

57
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,040
We're all betting on him now.

58
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,580
Attention. All technical work

59
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,050
must be completed before the dignitaries arrive

60
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,590
for tomorrow's committee meeting.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,290
Frank.

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,810
I got my hands on the Target Committee list.

64
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,120
Fourteen names, most of them dc regulars.

65
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,500
These guys wage war for a living.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,600
You really think they're gonna care what I have to say?

67
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,000
Break a leg, Dr. Isaacs.

68
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,610
The meeting's happening in the shadow of your test.

69
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,150
In that room, you are the authority.

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,600
I built them a $2 billion car.

71
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,930
Now I'm gonna tell them to leave it in the garage?

72
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,500
No, no. You tell them to drop it on an uninhabited island

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,070
instead of a military target.

74
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,770
Fly in the Japanese high command,

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,430
give them all front-row seats--

76
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,310
white flags waving over Hirohito's palace in a week.

77
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,150
Everybody wins.

78
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,320
Hirohito isn't Harry Truman.

79
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,390
His people think he's a God.

80
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,810
Gods don't bow to armies.

81
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,020
You think he's just gonna fold after a warning shot?

82
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,400
It's not a warning shot.

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,070
This is not even another bomb.

84
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,530
It's a second sun.

85
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,800
The Emperor is not surrendering to the army,

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,190
he's surrendering to the-- the power of the universe.

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,250
To be honest, I wish it was you facing the firing squad, Frank.

88
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,920
Makes the test look easy.

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,690
Just remember, when you first get into the meeting,

90
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,850
keep quiet, let them exhaust themselves

91
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,140
fighting over which military target to take out.

92
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,760
Yeah, and then wait for the last word. I know.

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,280
Yeah, you gotta make an emotional appeal, Charlie.

94
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,260
They got one chance to show restraint here,

95
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,950
win the war without any more loss of life.

96
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,090
I'm not sure the army's

97
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,480
losing a lot of sleep over Japanese casualties.

98
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,840
Okay, well, come up with your own angle.

99
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,740
Try to-- try to make it personal.

100
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,030
- Make it personal. - Yeah.

101
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,410
If we detonate a base near a populated area,

102
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,180
there'll be, what, 50,000 casualties?

103
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,200
How many children?

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,540
Jesus, I don't know. Um... 20,000.

105
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,850
What about Joey?

106
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,860
My kid, their kids.

107
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,570
If we don't show mercy with our WAMDs in this war,

108
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,640
how can we expect anyone

109
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,040
to show our children mercy in the next one?

110
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,380
That's it. Say that.

111
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,490
Hey, Frank...

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,800
Where are you bunking up now

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,260
that you're back from the desert?

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,910
- Starting tonight, my new office. - New?

115
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,520
I imagine I have you to thank for that?

116
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,440
It only took two months to convince Oppenheimer

117
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,720
you were an improvement over a drunk foreigner.

118
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,450
The capsule got stuck in the tamper.

119
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,430
- Team leader's on the phone. - Jesus, I'm coming.

120
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,770
- Just make sure you get the last word. - Yes, I know.

121
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,040
Welcome back to the cheap seats.

122
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,640
Don't fret, we saved your desk.

123
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,570
Dr. Winter.

124
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
Theodore Sinclair. Welcome to Little Boy.

125
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,360
Well, we have a job.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,710
We'll do it to the best of our ability.

127
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,250
And if we are lucky, it will all be for nothing.

128
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,260
The implosion Gadget, it's the warning shot.

129
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,970
Little boy's only on deck

130
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,960
if the Japanese don't heed that warning.

131
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,590
Let's just hope that day never comes.

132
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,580
Not exactly St. Crispin's day.

135
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,440
Victor, please...

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,120
Stay for dessert.

137
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,420
Your job is to listen.

138
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,900
We're hoping your expertise will prove useful

139
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,140
in translating technical information

140
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,710
concerning the current status of the Gadget.

141
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,550
Our Gadget or the Soviets'?

145
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,330
Yes, Dr. Barath. I will try to put you through,

146
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,430
but there are so many calls coming in from out there.

147
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,830
Hello?

148
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,850
- Mr. Tatlock? - Yes?

149
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,040
This is Abigail Isaacs.

150
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,230
Miss Isaacs, you received my letter.

151
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,460
Yes.

152
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,740
"Let 100 mothers cry, but not my mother.

153
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,910
But better my mother than me."

154
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,620
Do you know who said that?

155
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,710
George Washington-- kidding.

156
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,650
It was an Arab. I love Arabs.

157
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,370
Great fighters, highly quotable.

158
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,760
And I've heard that particular adage

159
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,510
is a favorite of your boss at the Kremlin, right?

160
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,080
You must think that you know what happens next.

161
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,580
But we Yanks, we're such a young country.

162
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,880
We're still finding our legs.

163
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,350
No idea what we wanna be when we grow up.

164
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,550
It makes us...

165
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,870
unpredictable.

166
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,870
Ah, you were so good, Mr. Green.

167
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,210
You're so thorough.

168
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Burned everything,

169
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,680
just like they taught you in Moscow.

170
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,670
Buried the ashes in the yard.

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,290
It's just that we're getting better and better at...

172
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,830
unburying things.

173
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,050
So, what's in Brooklyn?

174
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,280
Wasn't our, uh, uranium

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,740
stockpiled in a warehouse there?

176
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
Um, Staten Island.

177
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,380
Staten island. Anyway, that was a long time ago.

178
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,510
Too obvious for a man of your pedigree.

179
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,690
So, what is it?

180
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,970
Uh... Maybe Brooklyn's not a borough.

181
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,580
Maybe it's a code

182
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,400
for a military maneuver.

183
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,610
Or maybe--

184
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,610
maybe Brooklyn... is a man.

185
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,640
Your ace in the hole,

186
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,450
your atomic spy.

187
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,910
He's a New Yorker, isn't he?

188
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,660
Thank you, Dr. Oppenheimer.

189
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,520
I'm sure you feel like a war widow, Mrs. Isaacs.

190
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,640
I've made unreasonable demands on Charlie,

191
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,540
but I promise to return him undamaged

192
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,080
in 48 hours.

193
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,210
Sir, I spoke to

194
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,610
Professor John Tatlock this morning.

195
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,310
Jean's father.

196
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,350
I wanted to know more about his daughter...

197
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,710
and her death.

198
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,640
What business is it of yours?

199
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,650
Well, I overheard some of your calls at the switchboard.

200
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,630
Mr. Tatlock says that the handwriting

201
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,230
on the note wasn't Jean's

202
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,660
and that someone may have staged the scene

203
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,260
to look like a suicide.

204
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,770
You loved her.

205
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,720
Don't you wanna know if someone killed her?

206
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,280
You are a...

207
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,590
reasonably intelligent woman.

208
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,620
Do you know the difference

209
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,550
between a conjecture and a theorem?

210
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,450
Allow me.

211
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,450
I may conjecture that Colonel Darrow had jean murdered

212
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,950
to keep me on the project.

213
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,790
What?

214
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,300
But I have nothing to test, to prove.

215
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,730
Therefore, no theorem.

216
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,830
We'll never know.

217
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,660
That's our world.

218
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,240
Uncertainty.

219
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,860
Nuance.

220
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,450
No need to return to the switchboard.

221
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,530
You're removed.

222
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,840
We anticipate a temperature rise about,

223
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,830
uh, six degrees every three seconds.

224
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,840
Dr. Winter.

225
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,270
I requested new composites,

226
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,990
but Donlon says we've already blown

227
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,380
our metallurgy budget for the month.

228
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,570
Yeah. Well, I hope you didn't spend it all in one place.

229
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,670
Apparently most of it

230
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,300
went to a laboratory in Rochester, New York.

231
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,360
What's in Rochester?

232
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,800
Um, you know what?

233
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,930
It'll take me a couple of days

234
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,830
to get back up to speed,

235
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,360
But I'll definitely get into it.

236
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,760
Is he always so unfocused?

237
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,340
He'll be back.

238
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,830
Abigail.

239
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,800
This has been a complicated day.

240
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,250
Maybe we can worship together later in the week.

241
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,310
Did the army have anything to do with Jean Tatlock's death?

242
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,920
Miss Tatlock took her own life, as you know.

243
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,570
Colonel, I know she didn't.

244
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,640
What exactly did your husband tell you?

245
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,040
Not my husband. Robert Oppenheimer.

246
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,350
Then it's true, isn't it?

247
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,910
And you knew-- you knew all along,

248
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,980
and you let me beg God for forgiveness.

249
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,180
Do you like to watch women beg?

250
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,310
Did you watch Jean Tatlock beg?

251
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,780
You're confused, Abby.

252
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,000
Just because you're an officer in the Army...

253
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,430
I'll tell Charlie. I'll just tell the police.

254
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,250
Come with me.

255
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,070
Where?

256
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,640
Confession.

257
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,100
What is this place?

258
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,900
My sanctuary.

259
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,610
I'm not telling you how to do your job.

260
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,170
I'm just telling you that there's a job to be done.

261
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,530
Frank winter was a problem.

262
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,860
You made him disappear.

263
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,970
Miss Tatlock needs to go.

264
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,360
What are you suggesting?

265
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,380
You're a soldier, right?

266
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,030
We're at war.

267
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,570
What do you know about war?

268
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,850
If you can't handle it,

269
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,350
my father has associates

270
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,910
in St. Louis.

271
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,590
You should be careful whom you accuse, mrs. Isaacs.

272
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,320
And may the Lord forgive us all.

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,310
Did you find him at a meeting?

274
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,430
Or did your man just waltz into the Consulate General?

275
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,830
Brooklyn is in Kings County. Maybe he's British.

276
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,680
Maybe you're Brooklyn.

277
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,410
Warmer?

278
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,390
Colder?

279
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,330
Please, Victor, don't make me angry.

280
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,540
Help me.

281
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,520
Get me some rat poison,

282
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,850
A razor blade.

283
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,250
Do you know what the water cure is?

284
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,680
They pour water into your nostrils.

285
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,570
You drown on dry land.

286
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,630
I don't know what you're doing here,

287
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,980
but you're not one of them.

288
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,140
Think of the people who love you.

289
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,660
How would your son feel if he knew you'd be tortured?

290
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,210
How do you know I have a son?

291
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,320
Or-- or a daughter.

292
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,010
A wife.

293
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,960
You have a family. I can see it in your eyes.

294
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,070
Their father, their husband,

295
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,740
he's a merciful man, I know.

296
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,060
I see it.

297
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,410
I think-- I think Victor knows me--

298
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,220
Things about me.

299
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,060
If he does, maybe Brooklyn knows me.

300
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,320
Maybe I know him.

301
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
How did they find him?

302
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,440
It must've been that Indian boy.

303
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,740
And you're sure that it's him?

304
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,220
Yes, he's a handler. His name is Victor Green.

305
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,050
Well, I already have a pass for the test site.

306
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,270
I can leave now.

307
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,160
No. No, you and Perseus,

308
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,340
you wait for the convoy,

309
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,340
and you get out to the test site as planned.

310
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,500
We can't arouse suspicion.

311
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,460
What if he gives us up?

312
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,120
He won't crack. Even if they torture him, he won't crack.

313
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,370
Are you sure about that?

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,220
I know men like him. I know how they've been trained.

315
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,870
He-- he killed a G-2 agent.

316
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,410
He risked his own life

317
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,780
so that you could finish what you've started.

318
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,490
Yes, but if he trades up and I don't make it off the Hill,

319
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,460
I won't be able to finish anything.

320
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,790
Listen to me. Nothing changes.

321
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,330
You wait for the convoy and you take it out to the site.

322
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,260
Okay.

323
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,570
Do you have the schematics for the circuits?

324
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,820
I don't need the schematics. I built the circuits.

325
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,520
Do you understand what happens if the test succeeds?

326
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,290
It won't. I won't crack, either.

327
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,650
Okay?

328
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,460
So, do you have a dossier on Paul?

329
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,540
Did Brooklyn think that he was recruitable as well?

330
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,930
It turns out we have a big tent

331
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,530
and a welcome mat, too.

332
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,980
Only 20 men on this Hill know that I have a son.

333
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,740
Hogarth is one of them,

334
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,500
but, uh, I rather doubt his double agency.

335
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,230
Even his single agency was shit.

336
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,810
You know, you're not the only one with a kid, Paul.

337
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,000
Victor has a daughter. Eleanor. Adopted.

338
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,540
Should be about 30 now?

339
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,120
On the rolls at the University of Pittsburgh?

340
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,950
But Eleanor fell off the map a few years ago.

341
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,340
And so where is she, Victor? Have you heard from her lately?

342
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,530
No?

343
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,130
Don't worry, Director Hoover has all kinds of ways

344
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,060
to track people down these days.

345
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,660
I predict a tearful reunion.

346
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,950
I need your assurance you'll leave her out of this.

347
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,650
In exchange for...

348
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,150
A name.

349
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,440
Your colleague, he came to us two years ago.

350
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,800
He told us you have a son.

351
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,640
His name was sid liao.

352
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,470
You're welcome.

353
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,470
Take one for the road.

354
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,260
Have as many pastries as you like.

355
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,440
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

356
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,410
While I have your attention,

357
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,320
I want to tell you

358
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,770
about a study I've been conducting

359
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,280
in partnership with one of the university labs

360
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,530
on the environmental effects of the Trinity Test.

361
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,030
When, in the next 48 hours,

362
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,040
you detonate the world's first atomic weapon,

363
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,080
you will propel radioactive particles high into the sky

364
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,990
that will eventually fall back down to earth.

365
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,510
Let's give this phenomenon a name.

366
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,540
Let's call it...

367
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,680
"Fallout."

368
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,680
Fallout.

369
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,860
Despite all the work that you've done here on the Hill,

370
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,510
we know almost nothing about how fallout

371
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,870
will be absorbed back into the earth

372
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,990
or maybe into the human body.

373
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,720
Consider, for example, the lanthanum radioactive tests

374
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,530
you've been doing in the Bayo Canyon.

375
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,620
Incidentally, that muffin you're eating,

376
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,700
that was baked this morning from corn that was harvested

377
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,100
from that very area.

378
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,130
Now, Trinity could produce

379
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,500
100,000 times more fallout than any prior experiment.

380
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,120
And we have no idea what this might mean

381
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,730
for the surrounding farms, for the water sources,

382
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,230
for the water we drink here on the Hill.

383
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,080
Our research has only just begun.

384
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,630
But for everything we don't know,

385
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,430
there is one thing that we do--

386
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,300
the extent of the fallout will depend on the weather,

387
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,500
how strong the winds are and which direction they blow.

388
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,670
The weather will determine the magnitude

389
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,120
of the effect of Trinity.

390
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,310
And unless the weather agrees with us,

391
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,780
we won't move forward.

392
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,200
I expect you all to know Dr. Winter's report chapter and verse

393
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,770
by the time you get to the test site.

394
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,200
So, those muffins, did they really come from the Bayo Canyon?

395
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,090
The PX. You think I took up baking?

396
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,080
An oriental was spying for the russians?

397
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,470
Uh, according to our guest.

398
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,600
You wanna explain to me how a ghost killed Avram Fisher?

399
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,430
Victor might have killed him.

400
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,130
I don't think Sid Liao is their spy.

401
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,970
Was their spy.

402
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,610
I know there was a time that I doubted him,

403
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,220
but Sid Liao was just a desperate chap in over his head.

404
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,780
There are 428 men on your payrolls

405
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,570
who were born or raised in Brooklyn,

406
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,270
72 on this Hill.

407
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,900
Maybe we should consider delaying the test

408
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,230
until that list can be narrowed.

409
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,010
In two days, the President of the United States

410
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,710
will be in Potsdam, Germany,

411
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,310
sitting across from Joseph Stalin

412
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,200
with the map of the world between them.

413
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,470
Truman's gonna draw lines on that map.

414
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,640
Clear, bright, lines.

415
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,380
Delay is out of the question.

416
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,690
Sir, I know I'm new to this,

417
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,130
but what if it's not just information that they're after?

418
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,430
We just shipped a billion dollars' worth of plutonium

419
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,920
into the middle of the desert.

420
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,820
What if Brooklyn stole it? What if--

421
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,120
I don't know, what if he manages to disrupt the test somehow?

422
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,010
What would the President have to show Stalin then?

423
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,610
I will speak with Mr. Green myself.

424
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,390
Make sure we have more castings.

425
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,920
As many as it takes.

426
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,710
All right. Go, go! Kiss your kids good night.

427
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,390
Hopefully, not for good.

428
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,320
Circus leaves town 10:00 A.M. sharp.

429
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,760
Fritz.

430
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,960
You ready for the Target Committee?

431
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,170
No. You help me prep on the way out to Trinity.

432
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,350
I'm...

433
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,450
I'm not going to trinity.

434
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,660
Dr. Isaacs, we need your approval for--

435
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,110
Hang on. Sit down.

436
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,320
Sit down.

437
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,590
Fritz...

438
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,100
I know you've been through hell and I'm sorry.

439
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,990
No, no, I'm sorry.

440
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,930
I'm sorry that I won't be able to help you anymore.

441
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,260
I'm grateful for the opportunities you've given me here, Charlie,

442
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,900
But I just-- I've had enough death for one lifetime.

443
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,500
How long have they been in there?

444
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
I heard you were a patient man.

445
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,550
That your patience led to the capture of six enemy combatants.

446
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,640
So how'd you come to all this?

447
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,320
- You're some sort of... - Psychiatrist.

448
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,900
Talking cure.

449
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,030
You're a long way from Freud's couch, doctor.

450
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,620
Well, diseases of the mind aren't confined to asylums, Paul.

451
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,730
They rewrite maps.

452
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,620
Look at Hitler.

453
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,010
Stalin. The world's full of sick--

454
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,260
Clean it up.

455
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,920
Abby? Sorry, I should've told you

456
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,290
I wouldn't be back last night.

457
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,260
Everyone needed five minutes.

458
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,930
Now I only have five minutes. Where's my suitcase?

459
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,870
Hey, could I get a sandwich for the road?

460
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,080
Have your men do it.

461
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,650
What?

462
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,120
Your men in St. Louis.

463
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,670
Your father's men who took care of Jean Tatlock.

464
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,180
Have them do it.

465
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,010
Abby.

466
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,020
Colonel Darrow records

467
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,570
every conversation in his office.

468
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,360
Did you know that? I didn't.

469
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,420
I heard you, Charlie.

470
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,130
It was a bluff...

471
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,010
to light a fire under Darrow, and then he...

472
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,950
took things too far.

473
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,380
He did, not me.

474
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,910
Do you think a jury cares whose hands are dirtier?

475
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,240
Jesus. Abby, the decisions I make every--

476
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,380
I'm holding a hundred thousand lives in my dirty hands.

477
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,600
In my position, you see things through to the end,

478
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,530
things the world might not understand,

479
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,760
but because you believe in something bigger.

480
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,210
You let me believe that I was responsible for a woman's death.

481
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,980
You're a monster.

482
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,310
God, I don't expect you to understand.

483
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,220
No. No, of course not.

484
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,930
How could I? I just have the one life in my hands.

485
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,370
I gotta go.

486
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,250
We'll talk about it when I get back.

487
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,280
Joey!

488
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,520
Where's joey?

489
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,690
He's on his way to Brookline.

490
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,930
I don't have time for games, Abby. Where is he?

491
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,160
Juanita is driving him.

492
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,920
He's going to live with my parents.

493
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,370
The Colonel may have me trapped here, but...

494
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,140
my son will have no part of this.

495
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,350
You sent my son

496
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,740
3,000 miles away from me

497
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,980
with the Goddamn maid?

498
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,780
I was seeing things through.

499
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,940
Maybe I'm just as much to blame as you are,

500
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,280
but Joey deserves better.

501
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,530
Stolen away from his father,

502
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,870
that's what he deserves?

503
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,520
I'm keeping him safe from you

504
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,470
just like you should've been kept safe from your father!

505
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,210
You think I won't get in the car and bring him back?

506
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,750
Your test is in 24 hours.

507
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,280
You think I don't know which way you'll drive?

508
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,970
Is this how they teach you how to stage a suicide

509
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,920
in medical school?

510
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,810
This one's a challenge.

511
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,540
The stable's a unique venue.

512
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,580
Forty percent check out in their own house.

513
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,410
I prefer bathrooms.

514
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,810
It's a good place to open a wrist.

515
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,270
Or drown.

516
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,570
In the end, it's not the scene that matters,

517
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,440
it's the story.

518
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,690
It's gotta be credible.

519
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,460
In this case...

520
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,180
a bankrupt, small-time rancher

521
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,470
holes up in his remote barn.

522
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,580
How about this for a story?

523
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,620
A Commissioned Officer executes a suspect?

524
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,690
The man who could have told us the identity of Brooklyn.

525
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,530
There was no judge, there was no jury--

526
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,990
Do you think I'm happy we're here?

527
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,930
A Soviet spy in the hand is worth ten in the ground.

528
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,140
We could've used him. Angry man, your colonel.

529
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,620
Not a lot of restraint when it comes to communists.

530
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,500
He'll make a hell of a senator someday. You wait and see.

531
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,090
Grab that foot.

532
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,490
He won't mind.

533
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,480
We're gonna pull on three. Ready?

534
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,300
One, two, three.

535
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,570
You know, I agreed to translate scientific information.

536
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,720
Tell the Colonel my tenure is over.

537
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,920
The Colonel, forget him. He doesn't even know you're here.

538
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,640
No, I wanted you to see this.

539
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,710
Why?

540
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,670
World War II is over, Paul.

541
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,460
The next war's already started.

542
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,720
It's gonna be unlike any conflict in history.

543
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,350
It'll be waged silently by men like you and me.

544
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,870
- I'm a physicist. - I'm a doctor.

545
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,960
We're forming a new breed of intelligence organization,

546
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,580
one with a more centralized approach.

547
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,520
We have connections, money, pedigree--

548
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,750
things you like.

549
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,910
You'll get used to the things you don't.

550
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,200
I saw them load the crate into the back of the truck.

551
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,460
Well, how do you know it was a body?

552
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,250
What else are they gonna carry out of an interrogation room?

553
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,990
Jesus.

554
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,690
That's the, uh-- that's the convoy.

555
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,620
I bet-- I better go.

556
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,730
No. No!

557
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,370
You're not going with the convoy.

558
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,210
You and Perseus are gonna go out there on your own.

559
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,710
What? Why?

560
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm making an adjustment to the plan.

561
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,850
If we all we do is sabotage the Gadget,

562
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,600
- they'll just keep rebuilding it. - Maybe.

563
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,670
But it's gonna take them months to figure out what went wrong.

564
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,210
And then they'll do another test, just ten times more powerful.

565
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,340
But didn't Moscow say to stick to the plan?

566
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,350
Didn't you say that nothing changes?

567
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,120
I'm changing-- I'm changing the plan.

568
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,920
Oh, you-- you can do that?

569
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,070
Those men out there at Trinity,

570
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,450
they're not gonna stop unless we stop them.

571
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,650
Stop them how?

572
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,770
You built the circuits,

573
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,090
you can wire them to go off at any time you like.

574
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,550
You mean before everyone evacuates?

575
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,330
Jim...

576
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,420
You wanna kill the scientists?

577
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,690
You wanna kill my friends?

578
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,530
We do one terrible thing tomorrow,

579
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,800
but then no one ever has to again.

580
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,040
I wanna go to the test.

581
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,730
And I'm gonna get there

582
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,850
if I have to stow away in somebody's trunk.

583
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,100
Don't do that.

584
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,290
Why not?

585
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,350
Don't go to Trinity.

586
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,140
You've got a lot of work to do here.

587
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,540
Yeah, well, tell that to my boss.

588
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,820
Even hogarth worked longer hours.

589
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,490
Frank is damn lucky to have you as his deputy.

590
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,720
And he's not going to the Trinity site, either.

591
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,580
No. But who is?

592
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,830
You. A guy who went to a second-rate law school

593
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,770
is getting orchestra seats

594
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,840
to physics history.

595
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,720
Hey, I went to a third-rate law school.

596
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,570
And if I could bring a date...

597
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,120
Well, it wouldn't be me, apparently.

598
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,600
Charlie Isaacs.

599
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,780
What am I supposed to call you? "Beuker"?

600
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,340
Sure, why not?

601
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,260
What the hell are you doing here?

602
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,320
Ever been to Brooklyn?

603
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,560
Not in a long time. Why?

604
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,230
Never mind. I heard you fixed both Gadgets

605
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,590
inside of six months.

606
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,270
Not bad for a conscientious objector.

607
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,140
Yeah, maybe I went to the wrong meetings.

608
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,050
What do you want, Joe?

609
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,140
You ever hear of Camp Aliceville in Alabama?

610
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,580
Why? Is that where you're putting on

611
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,240
your latest piece of theater?

612
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,620
It's a prison for German POWs.

613
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,810
Not all military. Cultural ambassadors, too.

614
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,620
Even a few musicians.

615
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,460
Including your mother.

616
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,990
I thought you might like to know.

617
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,740
Team leader from Test Vector X-2B,

618
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,800
report to Director Schaefer.

620
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,030
Helen? What time is it?

621
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,610
Business hours in New York.

622
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,590
Took some calls,

623
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,630
but I got to the bottom of how our metallurgy budget

624
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,090
wound up in Rochester.

625
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,570
Admin must've given you the wrong form to sign,

626
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,110
but, uh, you can give them a call, straighten it out.

627
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,340
Just leave the number here on my desk.

628
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,550
The funny thing is-- and you won't believe the coincidence--

629
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,280
Liza's collaborating with

630
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,400
the University of Rochester on her work.

631
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,960
Our money just funded all the resources and equipment she needs.

632
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,240
Small world.

633
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,630
Must be really exhausting

634
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,080
making sure we don't finish Little Boy on time.

635
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,930
As soon as you're sitting in this chair again,

636
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,640
we'll do things your way.

637
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,460
I did everything you asked

638
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,800
when you were running implosion.

639
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,010
Even when it was illegal.

640
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,440
I sounded the alarm when you disappeared.

641
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,550
Then I gave up my one shot at history

642
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,080
so you could get us a seat at the table--

643
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Scientific control of the bomb.

644
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,900
But you don't want a seat at the table, Frank.

645
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,790
You don't want there to be a table or a bomb.

646
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,050
And you think that you're entitled

647
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,650
to make that decision on your own.

648
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,230
And what about you, Helen?

649
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,940
You excited to incinerate 20,000 kids?

650
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,620
How did you get this office back, Frank?

651
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,510
Fixing Charlie's mistake?

652
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,600
The detonator charges at the dry run,

653
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,950
they got reversed somehow?

654
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,900
You came to the rescue?

655
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,940
Get the hell out of my office.

656
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,040
What the hell?

657
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,350
What are you doing?

658
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,770
- Excuse me, gentlemen. - Thank you.

659
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,590
Gentlemen? I think we have a quorum.

660
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,450
I'll give the table over to Dr. Oppenheimer.

661
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,890
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

662
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,640
The last time this committee met,

663
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,320
it was on Pennsylvania Avenue.

664
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,190
I think you'll find the desert more civilized.

665
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
I'll start.

666
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,020
When I, uh, took this job...

667
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,180
When I took this job, I had no idea

668
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,020
what we were building here.

669
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,610
When I found out, I wanted to leave.

670
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,600
Since I've been here, I've done things...

671
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,290
I never imagined I was capable of.

672
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,010
I convinced myself we were here to protect

673
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:38,180
our kids from the Gestapo.

674
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,950
Well, my wife...

675
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,670
sent my kid back East last night

676
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,240
to protect him from me.

677
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,090
Dr. Isaacs--

678
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,100
She told me I'm a monster.

679
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,590
A murderer.

680
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,310
I wanted to tell her she was wrong,

681
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,660
but I couldn't.

682
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,870
I had a speech prepared.

683
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,510
I was gonna come in here and tell you

684
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,060
to detonate the bomb on a desert island--

685
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,250
a demonstration for the Japanese high command.

686
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,180
I was gonna tell you that

687
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,520
Hirohito would surrender on the spot.

688
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,440
I was gonna say let's show restraint

689
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,220
and we can be feared and loved

690
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,740
and then be forgiven for bringing the Gadget

691
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,350
into the world in the first place.

692
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,340
But the truth is...

693
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,060
we can be loved...

694
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,870
or we can have peace.

695
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,270
Not both.

696
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,110
So, if we want to change the world--

697
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,720
and we do, gentlemen-- we have to.

698
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,880
If we want to change the world,

699
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,900
then we need to embrace

700
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,110
what the world will call us

701
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,330
when we finish what we've started.

702
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,040
Monsters...

703
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,090
who erased a city...

704
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,580
without warning.

705
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,400
You mean a military target?

706
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,530
No, a city full of civilians.

707
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,100
And we detonate the altitude

708
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,460
that gives us the widest blast radius.

709
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,250
Maximum destruction of infrastructure.

710
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,100
Homes, hospitals, schools.

711
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,850
It has to be catastrophic...

712
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,010
on a scale that no one has ever imagined.

713
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,130
If we detonate our bomb on a desert island,

714
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,880
we might stop this war.

715
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,410
But we won't prevent the next one.

716
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,400
The weapon we're testing...

717
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:49,990
Fat Man?

718
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,860
It's nothing.

719
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,560
We'll measure it in, uh, kilotons of TNT.

720
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,760
Twenty years from now they'll be counting megatons,

721
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,930
Countries, continents.

722
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,370
So I'm begging you,

723
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,330
for your kids, your grandkids,

724
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,510
show the world what evil looks like once.

725
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,810
See it through.

726
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,100
As a species, we lack in imagination.

727
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,780
we can't conceive of the big nightmares--

728
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,350
genocide, mass starvation,

729
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,090
or atomic war until we live it.

730
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,310
We have to drop our bomb

731
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,080
on a city in the heart of Japan.

732
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,870
Because people need something to be afraid of.

733
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,280
Fear is now and has always been

734
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,510
the only thing that keeps the peace.

735
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,250
The only thing that changes the world,

736
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,180
changes anything, anyone.

737
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,210
We have to be monsters today

738
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,900
to stop the monsters of tomorrow.

739
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,870
Shouldn't you be in the desert

740
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,080
with the rest of the nabobs

741
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,770
doing the chain-reaction charleston?

742
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,420
I'm not really in a dancing mood.

743
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,480
I just don't believe it, you know?

744
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,640
That accidents just happen?

745
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,320
Do you know what she said to me that day?

746
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,430
Jeannie?

747
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,750
Whatever you're gonna say--

748
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,270
whether it's to make me feel better

749
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,400
or just to spin some Crosley malarkey--

750
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,220
skip it.

751
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,350
She said she didn't know what we were doing in the tech area,

752
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,800
but she knew that it might change the world.

753
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,320
And Jeannie said if the world had to change,

754
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,550
then you were the kind of man to keep us all honest,

755
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,910
make sure it would change for the better.

756
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,410
You can still get there, you know?

757
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,400
I'll be at the PX getting drunk.

758
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,500
You can come, not come-- I don't care.

759
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,120
Charlie.

760
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,170
Robert.

761
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,900
What the hell?

762
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,110
It was you.

763
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,500
I think Frank Winter's sabotaged the pretest.

764
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,830
Paul?

765
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,750
We need to talk about Jim.

1
00:00:00,784 --> 00:00:02,771
Previously on "Manhattan"...

2
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:07,499
Behold, gentlemen, 150 micrograms

3
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:09,969
of plutonium-239.

4
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:13,911
The sample is at Dr. Akley's disposal.

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,171
I got keys to the lab. I can let you in.

6
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:17,367
Really?

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,786
What the hell is going on in here?

8
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:23,623
You conned me into
giving you the plutonium.

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,127
I got Frank Winter an outside line today.

10
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:30,380
He said that you took
work from other scientists

11
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,765
and published it as your own.

12
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,434
That's bullshit, Abby.

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,018
They're all whores?

14
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:39,355
You whiz kids. Always in your heads.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,441
You deserve some fun every once in a while.

16
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,393
As long as you're paid up...

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,220
This chrysanthemum, it's
supposed to be white.

18
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:56,156
My honey bees, they're dead.

19
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:57,457
All of them.

20
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,464
Guten Morgen, Dr. Heisenberg.

21
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:13,076
Manhattan 1x06
Acceptable Limits

22
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:18,184
Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

23
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:22,802
She's very well-read.
You should see the stack

24
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:25,054
of books by her cot... Tolstoy, Voltaire.

25
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,358
What progress have you made with
plutonium alloys for shaping?

26
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,143
Aluminum reacts with the alpha particles,

27
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:33,813
but gallium is a real possibility.

28
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:38,902
But Jeannie's favorite is Charles Dickens.

29
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,871
Now I think it's because she's an orphan.

30
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,323
Isn't that sad?

31
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:45,491
Did you find the melting point?

32
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,410
Somewhere in the range of 900 kelvin.

33
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,496
How did you know that Mrs.
Winter was the girl for you?

34
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:54,384
Was it a eureka like Einstein
discovering special relativity?

35
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:55,969
That took Albert a couple of years.

36
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:59,345
- Okay, but with Jeannie...
- Look, if we want more plutonium,

37
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,759
we have to prove that we know what we're
doing with this miniscule amount we have.

38
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,228
X-10 Reactor goes critical this week.

39
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,764
By Christmas, they're gonna
be pumping out plutonium.

40
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,983
So I don't need possibilities, Fritz.

41
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,966
I don't need ranges.

42
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,354
I need real data.

43
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:31,454
Thought we only got poked
and prodded once a month.

44
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,709
See more of you than I
do my wife these days.

45
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,599
Something wrong with my
last urine collection?

46
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:47,890
Fit as a bull moose, Mr. Isaacs.

47
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:52,166
Just establishing your
baseline before your big trip.

48
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,945
What trip?

49
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,068
We're not shipping you off to Guadalcanal.

50
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,536
This is a good thing.

51
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,238
Gerald, give us a moment.

52
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,584
Forgive the cloak and dagger,

53
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,838
but the army can't have
functioning nuclear reactor

54
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,506
on its travel bulletin.

55
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,559
The reactor's gone critical.

56
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:30,205
We're about to have our very own plutonium
factory. If our colleagues don't wipe

57
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,216
the Confederate states
off the face of the Earth.

58
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,761
You leave for Tennessee tomorrow morning.

59
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,140
Tomorrow morning?

60
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,699
It's just...

61
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,020
- Um...
- What?

62
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,545
I've never flown in a plane before.

63
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:45,945
And...

64
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,916
honestly,

65
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,286
I get queasy when I'm too
high up at Fenway Park.

66
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,153
Charlie,

67
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:03,513
for weeks you're been sitting at your desk

68
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:06,966
hoping I wouldn't notice you eyeing
the clock like a high school senior.

69
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:09,936
Look, I know you have certain
reservations about the project.

70
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,305
But in less than 72 hours,

71
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:15,638
the world's second nuclear
reactor is going to go hot.

72
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:18,728
Now, you want to sit in the
nosebleed seats of history?

73
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,021
Or do you want to sit in the dugout?

74
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,951
So it's our second anniversary

75
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:29,055
and there is Frank cradling
this unwrapped brown box

76
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,706
like it is the Ark of the Covenant.

77
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,792
He never remembers our anniversary.

78
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,878
And inside the box is a rabbit.

79
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:39,999
Now, Frank tells me it is
a symbol of our marriage.

80
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,835
Something about a spirit of curiosity

81
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,437
and a keen mating instinct.

82
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,671
Okay.

83
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,840
Anyway, a week later, this rabbit

84
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,759
is covered in sores

85
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,011
and it's banging its head
against the side of the cage.

86
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,299
And the next thing I
know, the rabbit is dead.

87
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,649
Well, I hope you gave the
breeder a piece of your mind.

88
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,234
Breeder?

89
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:02,021
Frank stole the rabbit from
the natural sciences lab.

90
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,073
But he failed to notice the poor creature

91
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,325
was an infectious diseases study.

92
00:07:07,297 --> 00:07:09,028
Treponema cuniculi.

93
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,551
Oh, you gave your wife
syphilis. That's nice.

94
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,583
Never was very good at biology.

95
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:17,058
He has other qualities to redeem him.

96
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:18,704
The only cook in the house.

97
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:20,756
Beef Bourguignon.

98
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,042
Salt recklessly.

99
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,105
Oh.

100
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,681
Well, isn't this romantic?

101
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,052
Oh, Helen.

102
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,321
- You're done?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,790
Oh.

104
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:58,077
Oh, God.

105
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,662
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

106
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,081
What's this?

107
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,711
They're playing
"Casablanca" at the theater.

108
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:15,344
Or we could just talk.

109
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,232
What do you want to talk about?

110
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,317
Um...

111
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:25,238
Did you do good science today?

112
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,526
You know what, Corporal?

113
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,695
I have an early morning.

114
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,115
Why don't you take me home?

115
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:40,419
Or, no, drop me off at the PX.

116
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,376
You haven't told anyone
about this, have you?

117
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,378
That I'm dating a genius?

118
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:51,547
We're not dating.

119
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,670
Abby.

120
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:05,144
- Hey.
- Hello.

121
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:07,396
What are you doing?

122
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:09,899
I lied.

123
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,735
I told you I read your paper.

124
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,687
I picked it up about 10 times last year,

125
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,490
but I never got past the first paragraph.

126
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,458
Now I want to finish.

127
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:21,794
Why?

128
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:24,664
This part about bending light waves,

129
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,166
is that like a prism? We had one at school.

130
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,751
- Abby.
- Hmm?

131
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:31,053
Put it away.

132
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,757
What?

133
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,510
You ever gonna let it go?

134
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,322
I just wanted to read it.

135
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,266
This is about Frank Winter.

136
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,435
Ever since you got that call,

137
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,737
you haven't looked at me the same.

138
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:49,355
That's ridiculous.

139
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,440
I didn't go to Milton
Academy like your father.

140
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,992
I don't have a trust fund.

141
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,361
Guess that means I
cheated my way in, right?

142
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,747
You are the only person I know

143
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:00,366
who thinks a decent upbringing
is something to be ashamed of.

144
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,705
Where's my suitcase?

145
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:06,988
Why?

146
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,138
I have to go on a trip tomorrow.

147
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:11,961
I don't know when I'll be back.

148
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,430
You'll have lots of time
to catch up on your reading.

149
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,051
I am going to prove that
it was army pesticides

150
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,720
and then I'm going to take
it to the town council.

151
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:23,055
The combined IQ of the town council

152
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:24,995
is probably half of yours.

153
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,373
Come to the meeting with
me Saturday, won't you?

154
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:29,612
Frank refuses.

155
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:32,648
Well, if you two are done conspiring,
I think we should get back.

156
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,067
But there is one more
little thing before you go.

157
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,405
You know, the Nazis say they cause cancer.

158
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,707
Actually, it's a little bigger than this.

159
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,909
I need a contrast microscope

160
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,078
if I'm gonna shore up
my case against the army.

161
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,447
Do you think you could smuggle
one out of the lab for me?

162
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,716
I wish we could.

163
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,918
Roosevelt couldn't get his wheelchair

164
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,254
out of the tech area
without the army's say-so.

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,090
Thank you, my dear.

166
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,842
- Good night.
- Good night.

167
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,252
Uh...

168
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:51,143
Make clear all areas on
designation six through nine.

169
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,145
Make clear all areas...

170
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:55,614
Jeannie.

171
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,284
I waited all night for you to knock.

172
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,237
Oh, I'm so sorry. I've
been chained to my desk.

173
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,457
But I have been driving the
warden crazy talking about you.

174
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,327
I cut it into triangles the way you like

175
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,663
in case you don't make it to breakfast.

176
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,420
You made me a PB&J?

177
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,729
It's $2.50.

178
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,311
For the sandwich?

179
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,096
For last night.

180
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,816
I'm sorry. I have a
24-hours cancellation policy.

181
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,685
Sure, sure.

182
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,696
Bye.

183
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:45,348
Bye.

184
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:25,431
Oh! What the...

185
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,051
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

186
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:37,114
You'll be traveling under an assumed name.

187
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,162
Yes, sir.

188
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:40,748
The workers at Site X barely know
what they're making down there

189
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,082
much less what it's used for.

190
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,001
Let's take a look under the hood

191
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:46,728
and make sure we're not
blowing a 20-kiloton gasket.

192
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:50,861
They must have a team of experts
making sure that won't happen.

193
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:53,113
Let's just say the army is
more concerned with secrecy

194
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,332
than they are with something
as trivial as public safety.

195
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,618
Nothing goes forward without
your say-so down there, Charlie.

196
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,449
I thought you said I was
the only man for the job.

197
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,125
You are.

198
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:08,679
Occasionally we have to
throw implosion a bone

199
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,348
to keep them from chewing
through their leashes.

200
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:12,850
- Sir.
- Have a good trip.

201
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:14,476
Thank you.

202
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:18,284
Be careful at the airport.

203
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,898
You know, there are thieves everywhere.

204
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,895
Charlie, you want to get these?

205
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:35,539
My father was knighted by King George

206
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:37,958
and yet Frank sends a
little Dutch girl to Site X.

207
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:40,527
Well, Helen's got more
degrees than a thermometer.

208
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,579
You are just jealous.

209
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:45,165
Close the door. We could
lose it in the wind.

210
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:48,836
Looks like you've already lost it, Louis.

211
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,738
I was reducing the metal and there was...

212
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:53,741
an unexpected reaction.
We're missing 24 micrograms.

213
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,476
Of plutonium?

214
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,178
You've misplaced a million
dollars' worth of Pu-239?

215
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:01,065
The Snoop's going haywire,
but I swiped the floor clean

216
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:03,368
and the oil paper's good.

217
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,604
We'll find it. Plutonium
doesn't just evaporate.

218
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:10,107
Our careers will when
Oppenheimer gets wind of this.

219
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,026
Okay.

220
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:31,178
Mine's not making a sound.

221
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:33,380
Nope, nor mine.

222
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:36,633
This one must be busted.

223
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:39,219
It beeps everywhere I look, but
nothing shows up under the scope.

224
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,271
- Here, let me see it.
- Yeah.

225
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,328
We need a medic.

226
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,299
You moving to Tennessee?

227
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:12,636
I packed less when I left for Harvard.

228
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,055
That word rolls so easy off your tongue.

229
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,840
"Can you pass the sugar?
I went to Harvard."

230
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:18,759
How many pairs of clogs do you need?

231
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,478
By the way, I found a problem
with your little space paper.

232
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:24,515
The word is affect, not effect.

233
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,600
A typo on page six.

234
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:28,102
Embarrassing.

235
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:29,319
Hello.

236
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:31,271
Tickets, please.

237
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:32,495
Yeah.

238
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:41,365
Mr. and Mrs. Donaldson.

239
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:43,288
That's us.

240
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,952
Right, honey pie?

241
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:48,255
Must be quite the big shot to fly
your wife to the Smoky Mountains.

242
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,758
Oh, actually, I've been supporting Billy

243
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,626
since his hunting accident.

244
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:55,295
It doesn't matter to me that
he can't hold down a job...

245
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:57,181
or have children.

246
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,299
Oh.

247
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,270
Double the saline bolus.

248
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:05,639
Siphon in 10-mil increments.

249
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,975
Hypernatremia measurements q-two minutes.

250
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:16,450
Mr. Fedowitz. You're awake.

251
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,285
Did you vomit in the other room?

252
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,887
- I think I'm okay.
- But did you vomit again?

253
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,540
Don't worry. I got it all in the garbage.

254
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:25,766
Nurse, go retrieve the bin.

255
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:30,214
Mr. Fedowitz, you swallowed a
significant quantity of plutonium.

256
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:35,002
Priority is to retrieve every
microgram from your stomach.

257
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:38,172
A man of your expertise,

258
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,977
surely you know how to separate
heavy metals from organic matter.

259
00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:50,184
Here you go, ma'am.

260
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,352
Sprinkle this baby on your windowsill

261
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:55,355
and those termites of yours will
be gone in a New Mexico minute.

262
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,859
This is what the army uses as pesticide?

263
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:00,777
DDT?

264
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:03,664
Uncle Sam sprays it on
our cots, our clothes,

265
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:05,249
even our dinner plates.

266
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:06,834
And the kids love it, too.

267
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:08,255
Adios, head lice.

268
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:12,039
Do you know what happens to a
mosquito exposed to organochlorides?

269
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,375
Sodium channels blow
open the sensory nerves.

270
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:19,296
The insect has a seizure and then
bleeds internally until the organs fail.

271
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,215
Hmm.

272
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,933
Good thing we're not mosquitos, right?

273
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,731
Right.

274
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:27,004
Or bees.

275
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,977
Frank is going to kill me. Or worse.

276
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:36,230
Hey, keep your head high.

277
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,116
It'll give his blade a
clear path to your neck.

278
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,236
- Less painful that way.
- Maybe we don't tell him.

279
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,072
You know, just say that you're still
working on the alloy experiments.

280
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:47,574
That'll buy us enough time to...

281
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:53,163
Is this a lab or a wax museum?

282
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,677
Just trying to win a war.

283
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:58,669
- Once more unto the breach.
- What happened?

284
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:04,335
There was a rapid vapor
expansion of the Pu-239 and...

285
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:06,476
I swallowed some.

286
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:08,645
Jesus, Fritz. How much?

287
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,814
All of it.

288
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,131
All right, you two, get out.

289
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:20,190
Look, I already separated four micrograms.

290
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,025
I'll get the rest with
dilution and recapture.

291
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:23,744
I swear on my father's grave.

292
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:26,280
I mean, actually, he was cremated, but...

293
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:28,115
What did they say at the clinic?

294
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,250
They are confident that
we can get it all back.

295
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:32,452
You swallowed a radioactive isotope.

296
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:33,670
What did the doctor prescribe?

297
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:36,206
Aspirin and a case of beer.

298
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,759
I'm supposed to drink it and
then I collect all my urine.

299
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:43,483
How do you feel?

300
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,800
What? Um...

301
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:51,052
I guess I'm a little buzzed from the beer.

302
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:53,453
Why, should I be worried?

303
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:56,443
He's within the acceptable limits.

304
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:59,363
I followed the Q-9 medical
directive to the letter.

305
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:01,231
Who wrote the Q-9 directive?

306
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:03,784
That's classified.

307
00:21:03,818 --> 00:21:05,202
Show me the study it's based on.

308
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:07,287
Fedowitz's urine and blood samples

309
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:10,624
have been sent via post to the project's
radiation expert for more testing.

310
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:13,460
Do you know the speed at which
plutonium emits alpha particles?

311
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:15,379
One-twentieth the speed of light.

312
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,798
Do you know its biological half-life?

313
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:20,667
- Well, I am sure...
- 200 years.

314
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:23,170
Longer than the United
States has been a country.

315
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:25,722
So why d't pick up the phone
and call the medical director

316
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,841
for the project and get
him down here to examine...

317
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:30,177
I don't need the director.
I've been given the authority

318
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:32,396
to handle all health-related
matters on this Hill.

319
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,849
Had you even heard the word plutonium
before you washed up on this base?

320
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,514
What did you do your residency in, Doctor?

321
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,738
- Obstetrics.
- Ah.

322
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,857
Yet you felt confident treating a man

323
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:46,159
who swallowed a quarter
of the world's supply

324
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:50,614
of Pu-239 with a case of beer.

325
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,676
Get me the War Department.

326
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:22,502
Welcome to our humble abode.

327
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:25,778
50,000 acres using 10% of
the nation's electricity,

328
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,888
and it doesn't exist on any map.

329
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,040
We have three schools, two movie theaters.

330
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:32,092
We import 30,000 pounds
of mayonnaise a month.

331
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,961
You know how many sandwiches that is?

332
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:36,714
Mr. Ellis, how much product do you think
you'll turn out by the end of the year?

333
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:39,800
And, of course, our most precious
resource, these talented young ladies.

334
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:42,219
Most of them came straight from
high school to serve their nation.

335
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,971
Pretty little patriots, aren't they?

336
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:46,941
What's the evacuation protocol
in case of radiologic accident?

337
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:48,726
Expect they can find the front door.

338
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:51,695
We received the War Department's
R-23 directive a month ago.

339
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,198
I put it on your desk.

340
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:57,568
And I'm sure I told you to circulate
the directive to the girls, Theodore.

341
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:01,121
We've been a little busy preparing
for tomorrow's festivities.

342
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:03,207
Are you excited to make
your mark in history?

343
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:06,327
Actually, I'm going to
load the last uranium rod.

344
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:09,663
I have no doubt you know how
to work a rod, young lady,

345
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:13,083
but instructions are that Mr.
Donaldson is to initiate the reaction.

346
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,252
We'll see about that.

347
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:18,005
Of course you can hand off
the honors to your lovely wife.

348
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:19,869
Or whoever she is.

349
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:21,952
Soon as we get back
home, Mrs. Donaldson and I

350
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:23,761
are filing for divorce.

351
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,032
Meet the X-10 Reactor.

352
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:33,725
600,000 pounds of graphite.

353
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,106
She's dressed and ready for her cotillion.

354
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,111
All reactors should be female.

355
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,113
Mmm. This is Bill Tupper,

356
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:44,949
our operations chief.

357
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,424
How are you?

358
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:48,335
In 12 hours she'll start spinning

359
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,204
uranium straw into plutonium gold.

360
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:53,173
No, she won't. The reactor's
not going critical tomorrow.

361
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,342
Oh, Jews are born pessimists.

362
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:57,044
That's why I'm loading the last rod.

363
00:23:57,095 --> 00:23:58,679
No one's loading anything until we tour

364
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,464
the whole facility, make sure it's safe.

365
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:02,871
We have 140 buildings.
She'll be here till Easter.

366
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:04,501
We have technical schematics

367
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,545
- you could look at.
- Theodore.

368
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,688
They diagram every
vulnerability on the site.

369
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:09,557
More comprehensive than any physical tour.

370
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:13,227
Safety's a priority, but the army's
deadlines are gospel around here.

371
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:16,146
You're here to grease the
wheels, not gum up the works.

372
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:19,066
What I'm here to do is make sure
you don't set the atmosphere on fire.

373
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,485
He's overeating. It's just a formality.

374
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:25,322
Look, I understand you've been sent
down here by some high mucky-muck.

375
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:29,126
That mucky-muck hired the guy who
hired the guy who hired your boss.

376
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,045
His name is Robert Oppenheimer.

377
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:33,585
Let's see those schematics.

378
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,927
♪ First you swallow our plutonium ♪

379
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:51,815
♪ Now you're going
to piss it all away. ♪

380
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:54,488
Jeannie helped me collect
three liters of urine.

381
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:58,606
A good woman is hard to find.

382
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:01,025
Oh, by the way, could one of
you guys front me five bucks?

383
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:03,307
What, are you taking
her out as a thank-you?

384
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:05,613
No, he's paying her for sex.

385
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:06,914
You are?

386
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:08,415
Thank you.

387
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,201
Well, no, not exactly.

388
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:14,371
We haven't really gone all the way yet.

389
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,091
So you're paying her
not to have sex with you?

390
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,545
Fritz, you do know most women
would probably do that for free?

391
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:24,214
All girls cost money.

392
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,966
You buy them dinner, drinks.

393
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:29,219
With Jeannie, there's none
of that. Just a flat fee.

394
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,194
I phoned Berkeley, Chicago, Manhattan.

395
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:39,596
They passed me to a
different doctor every time.

396
00:25:39,631 --> 00:25:42,031
You don't even know the name
of your own goddamn boss.

397
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:44,301
The post office handles
the blood and urine samples.

398
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:47,237
We're only supposed to get a response
from his team if there's a problem.

399
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:49,323
- There's never been one before.
- Jesus Christ.

400
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,708
Compartmentalization.

401
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:52,459
They've never even shown me an org chart.

402
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:56,130
Army doesn't want anyone
knowing who's in charge.

403
00:25:56,164 --> 00:25:58,499
There's an administrator in New York

404
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,252
who supposedly has the org chart
and the name of the ranking doctor.

405
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:05,889
- Who's he?
- His ID is 482.

406
00:26:05,924 --> 00:26:07,841
I've left him three messages.

407
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,707
- Give me his number.
- This line needs to stay

408
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:11,081
free for emergencies.

409
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:15,041
What exactly do you think this is?

410
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,654
Bang! Bang, bang!

411
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:22,773
Bang, bang, bang!

412
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,418
Hi, Abby.

413
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:36,370
Hello.

414
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,033
Picking up Callie from school?

415
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:41,905
Please, she'd die if she saw me here.

416
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,844
- Oh, hmm.
- Just stealing a microscope

417
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:46,964
from the best equipped elementary
school science room in the country.

418
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:50,601
- Mum's the word.
- I didn't see anything.

419
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:53,887
Frank tells me that you're
spending your days in switchboard.

420
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,691
Oh, it's only part-time.

421
00:26:57,726 --> 00:26:59,702
Better than no time, trust me.

422
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:03,781
It's nice to have something to
distract you while your husband's gone.

423
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:06,200
Oh, did Frank go, too?

424
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:09,153
No, I just saw Charlie
this morning at the gate.

425
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:12,456
With Helen Prins and a mountain of luggage.

426
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,993
Off on some top secret mission, I presume.

427
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:18,746
Who is Helen Prins?

428
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,134
Uranium-235 is highly unstable.

429
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:26,386
Store too much in one place,

430
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:28,472
you can set off a chain reaction.

431
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:30,257
Which is why we split it
up so there's never more

432
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:32,176
than 12 kilograms in any given building.

433
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:34,178
This isn't rocket science.

434
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,148
So how do you transport it?

435
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:39,733
Uranium enters the
reactor through this valve

436
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,602
at a rate of 24 milligrams per second.

437
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,198
What if a valve fails?

438
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,489
If uranium accumulates
in the pipes, you could...

439
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:49,109
All the valves are redundant,
like this conversation.

440
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,829
Plant's designed so if
any one valve gets clogged,

441
00:27:51,863 --> 00:27:53,497
another one comes to the rescue.

442
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:56,361
What about this one?
There's no redundancy there.

443
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,702
That's not a valve. That's a window.

444
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:02,039
You've got a busy day, Mr. Ellis.

445
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,042
If it would be helpful, I can
walk our guests through the plants.

446
00:28:05,044 --> 00:28:06,844
Compartmentalization, Theodore.

447
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:08,679
I don't think Washington would like that.

448
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:10,464
But I could use some coffee.

449
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,460
This is where the separation takes place?

450
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,937
- The cauldron starts here.
- Uh-huh.

451
00:28:22,443 --> 00:28:24,812
When I get dismissed by a group of men,

452
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:27,786
it usually means they're
afraid of what I'm about to say.

453
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,175
It's Mrs. Donaldson, correct?

454
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,236
This isn't the Underground Railroad.

455
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,805
I don't need a woman to
rescue me from the white man.

456
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:37,754
I'm not here to rescue anyone.

457
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:41,411
But no one else in that room
gives a shit what you think.

458
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:45,916
Green water.

459
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:56,992
Clear vats 14 and 15 from building 90-207.

460
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:01,330
They're, what, eight
and a half feet from 206?

461
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,915
Who the hell drew these?

462
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,117
Some third-rate architect
from the Corps of Engineers?

463
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:06,785
- Are you a draftsman?
- Draftswoman.

464
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:09,204
This rendering is off by six inches.

465
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,590
Add up 206, 207, and 208

466
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,342
and we're still under the safety limits.

467
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,011
Yeah, for fast neutrons. But
we're talking about green water.

468
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,713
Green water?

469
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,319
Uranium dissolved in liquid form.

470
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:23,165
The neutrons slow down and
become 100 times more effective.

471
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,988
- So what?
- 100 times more fissionable.

472
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:28,307
All these buildings will go up in smoke.

473
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:29,775
You need to clear every one of them.

474
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,728
4,000 vats spread over 100 acres?

475
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:36,430
-  It'll take a week.
- I need a word alone.

476
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,400
Don't look at me.

477
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,003
You heard my wife.

478
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,323
Medical Division.

479
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:46,291
Get your boss on the phone now.

480
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,826
This is number G-11.

481
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:50,891
11? One moment, please.
I'll get him right away.

482
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:52,381
G-11?

483
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,751
Didn't know they even
made ID numbers that low.

484
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,420
I understand you've got
yourself a situation.

485
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,590
You need to talk to the
project radiation chief.

486
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,684
Well, who is he?

487
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:04,927
Never spoken to him myself.

488
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,096
But I know all the urine and blood
samples go to his lab for testing.

489
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,182
He sets the acceptable limits.

490
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:13,101
ID number is...

491
00:30:13,706 --> 00:30:15,512
B-379.

492
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:17,838
Fine, have your girl put me through.

493
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:21,351
Marge.

494
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,286
Health Division.

495
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,505
Is this B-379?

496
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,170
Dr. Winter?

497
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,640
It doesn't make any sense.

498
00:30:52,706 --> 00:30:54,622
What exactly did he say?

499
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:56,004
That you were receiving shipments

500
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:58,447
and that you set the acceptable limits.

501
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,967
The blood and urine samples
are sent to an outside team.

502
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,342
My assistant drops them at
the post office every Monday.

503
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:11,916
Have you ever actually seen them
put the samples on the truck?

504
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:15,778
This must be a misunderstanding.

505
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:20,030
I have a week's training in radiology.

506
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:23,433
Why would they put me in charge?

507
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,977
Who hired you?

508
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:39,821
Alek, we need to talk.

509
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,941
I've made it clear I don't enjoy
being disturbed during my games.

510
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:46,533
You handpicked the ranking
medical officer on the Hill.

511
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,288
Just as Robert and I handpicked you.

512
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:52,000
What do you want, Frank?

513
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:55,422
It's all an illusion, isn't it?

514
00:31:55,469 --> 00:31:58,256
The Geiger measurements,
the urine and blood samples.

515
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,426
What, are you just throwing
away the collections?

516
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,963
Your man Fedowitz swallowed
24 micrograms of Pu-239.

517
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:08,216
The toxic dose is 100 to 500 micrograms.

518
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,267
Did you just invent those numbers?

519
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:13,473
A range of 400 proves you have
no idea what you're talking about.

520
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,640
Radiology is not your field, Frank.

521
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:17,889
And it's not Dr. Adelman's either.

522
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,630
You intentionally chose
a man who knows nothing

523
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:25,741
about radiologic risks to
run our medical program.

524
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:32,646
But you know plenty about
radiology, don't you, Alek?

525
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,410
You spent six years with Marie Curie

526
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,280
at the Pasteur Institute?

527
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:40,549
- Seven, actually.
- Ah.

528
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:44,077
That woman died blind and anemic.

529
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:47,422
Her papers had to be quarantined.

530
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:50,892
She went to her grave
denying that it was because

531
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,903
she had been breathing in
radioactive dust for 40 years.

532
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:56,429
If the history lesson is over...

533
00:32:56,463 --> 00:32:59,888
Glen Babbit tells me that Dr.
Curie could be very forthcoming

534
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,464
after a few glasses of Bordeaux.

535
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:05,308
She never let you handle any radium

536
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,427
or polonium, did she, Alek?

537
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:10,382
Dr. Curie didn't want anyone
to lay claim to her work.

538
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:15,094
No. No, she let other students
handle ionizing elements.

539
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,703
But she'd already buried a husband

540
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,381
and she wouldn't expose the
young Hungarian physicist

541
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,374
who was in love with her.

542
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:28,327
Safety standards on the Hill

543
00:33:28,362 --> 00:33:31,467
have been approved by the Secretary of War.

544
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:34,110
You can address your
complaints to the Pentagon.

545
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:35,262
No.

546
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:38,638
No more bureaucrats.

547
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:42,706
Town council meets tomorrow morning.

548
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,246
People need to know you're
running a Potemkin clinic

549
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:47,216
and it's all a lie.

550
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:50,983
Shout plutonium in a crowded theater,

551
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:54,403
it won't just be your job, Dr. Winter.

552
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:58,291
You could find yourself in military prison.

553
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:03,225
Your record is six feet even.

554
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:06,947
I'll wager you a half
bottle of my secret cologne

555
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:08,473
you cannot make it to 10.

556
00:34:08,498 --> 00:34:11,420
Secret cologne? You smell
like Marmite, Crosley.

557
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:16,347
I'll take the under for two
tickets to next week's movie.

558
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,046
They're playing "This is the Army."

559
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:20,322
Ooh!

560
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:23,799
Oh, Jeannie loves Ronald Reagan.

561
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,073
- Line it up.
- Yay!

562
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,652
Line it up.

563
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:31,928
- Line it up.
- Line it up.

564
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:40,185
All right, prepared, are you?

565
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,753
Crosley, these are what
American lungs look like.

566
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:49,208
Oh!

567
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:50,641
- Ha-ha!
- Unbelievable.

568
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:52,082
Watch out, Ringling Brothers.

569
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:54,642
Hold it. Hold on, hold
on. Hold on, hold on.

570
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,634
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc.

571
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,519
Hey, how about a taste
of your own medicine?

572
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:01,066
Uh, another time.

573
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:02,558
Aw.

574
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,901
That's the best doc in
the 48 states right there.

575
00:35:04,926 --> 00:35:06,459
Best doc.

576
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,519
I'm gonna need a refill
on my script soon, Doc.

577
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:14,304
- I love that guy.
- What's his name?

578
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:16,256
I don't know.

579
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,849
I thought you didn't approve.

580
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:33,287
You burning the house down? I
don't. I'm here for your wife.

581
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:35,602
- Where is she?
- No idea.

582
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:36,712
Well...

583
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:39,286
This is gonna be the best piece of theater

584
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,671
since Oppenheimer was
an arsenic and old lace.

585
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,730
Doctor Winter.

586
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:48,582
Dr. Bureth paid me a visit.

587
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:52,614
One of Louis' federals'
brother died fighting Rommel.

588
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:55,246
The other is in the
Gilbert Islands, but Louis

589
00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:56,965
is here on your base.

590
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,927
If you cut the sanctimonium
for a goddamn minute

591
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,879
you'll hear me say I agree with you.

592
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:04,008
Let's take a walk.

593
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:11,536
I've told Army Medical
our standard was unworthy

594
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:13,145
of this installation a month ago.

595
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,588
We're understaffed and Dr.
Adelman's in over his head.

596
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,569
The general shot me down.

597
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:18,978
Then come back in there with me.

598
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:20,913
Let's make a united front.

599
00:36:20,938 --> 00:36:22,495
I need you to look at something first.

600
00:36:23,155 --> 00:36:25,123
What is this?

601
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:29,558
Who the hell is this?

602
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:31,521
You didn't hear this from me.

603
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,690
Command calls him Magpie.

604
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:36,776
Could be a disgruntled bureaucrat
from Munich or Hitler's gardener.

605
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,611
Either way, he has credible intelligence

606
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:41,247
their atomic program is
two months ahead of ours.

607
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,615
How do you know the Germans
didn't just plant him?

608
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,373
This is Greek to me,

609
00:36:50,924 --> 00:36:53,793
but I'm sure those equations
mean something to you.

610
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,719
Jesus.

611
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,188
They're testing yields.

612
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,673
What?

613
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:09,957
They're testing a bomb.

614
00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:13,730
They're more than two months ahead of us.

615
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:16,282
All right, our history
aside, if you go forward,

616
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,484
I'll stand with you in there.

617
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:22,372
But if we sound the alarm, it could
be weeks until we get back to work.

618
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,382
Meantime, the Krauts could get there first

619
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,070
and none of this makes a bit of difference.

620
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,451
Hello?

621
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,420
You got Prince Albert in a can?

622
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,790
Charlie, we're not allowed
to take personal calls.

623
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,291
Martha checks the phone logs.

624
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:16,759
So pick an extension.

625
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,711
Patch me through. Take the scenic route.

626
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:23,182
Where are you?

627
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,935
You tell people not to answer
that question all day long.

628
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,187
I mean, are you working?

629
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,522
I'm at the hotel.

630
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:31,391
Must be nice.

631
00:38:31,468 --> 00:38:33,168
Whisked away on a vacation.

632
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:34,777
Someone to fluff your pillows?

633
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:38,765
Trust me, it's not the Plaza.

634
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,537
You still there?

635
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:45,950
Yes.

636
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,075
I just...

637
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:53,212
I wanted to hear your voice.

638
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,748
Hope you're not too lonely,

639
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:58,384
all by yourself on that business trip.

640
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,219
I should have brought a book.

641
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,307
My son bouncing off the walls?

642
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,926
Actually, Joey has an earache.

643
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,678
He was up crying all night.

644
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,646
- It was very sad.
-  Abby, I'm sorry.

645
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,849
Actually, we should go. We
have a doctor's appointment.

646
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:16,297
Listen, I love you.

647
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,275
Me, too.

648
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:29,749
Get up.

649
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:35,900
From now on, I'm the only
one who touches the plutonium.

650
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,662
You obviously can't be trusted
with our limited supply.

651
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,887
Oh, if it isn't the happy honeymooners.

652
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:10,206
You'll be pleased to hear we
just got a clean bill of health

653
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,908
on the storage room in building 9.

654
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,377
- Good start.
- And we began

655
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:14,768
loading rods an hour ago.

656
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,440
- I can see that.
- The reactor will

657
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,997
be fully operational within a day.

658
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,083
We gave you a list of 22 major hazards

659
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,918
to resolve before we go critical.

660
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:25,204
And the army intends to give your
list the consideration it deserves.

661
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,673
- When?
- Just as soon as we're critical.

662
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,427
Now, if you'll excuse me. I've got a
300-ton block of graphite to attend to.

663
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:34,430
- On whose authority?
- General Leslie Groves.

664
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:37,850
He's the mucky-muck who
hired Robert Oppenheimer.

665
00:40:38,664 --> 00:40:41,216
Rest up. Tomorrow's a
big day for all of us.

666
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:52,064
Hey.

667
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,000
You didn't go to the town council?

668
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,836
There was no acetylcholinesterase activity.

669
00:40:57,617 --> 00:41:00,440
So pesticides didn't kill the bees

670
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:02,290
and it wasn't the army.

671
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,761
Maybe it was a virus.

672
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,578
A parasite.

673
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:10,883
I ruled out infectious disease.

674
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,803
Well, you'll figure it out.

675
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,806
You always do.

676
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,028
Do you think it can be
something from the tech area?

677
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,707
I know you're working with chemicals and...

678
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:27,483
what if the runoff was
dumped in Ashley Pond

679
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:29,986
or there was a gas in the air?

680
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,043
The safety and environmental protocols

681
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,911
were vetted by experts.

682
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:42,333
I read the reports myself.

683
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:48,408
Frank, a bee colony doesn't
just collapse on its own.

684
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,058
Well...

685
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:54,010
wasn't the army...

686
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:59,765
so it was phantom toxins in the tech area?

687
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,775
You think this is all in my head?

688
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:26,225
Let's find you some new bees.

689
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:19,777

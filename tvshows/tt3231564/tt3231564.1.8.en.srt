1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,524
Previously on "Manhattan"...

2
00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:03,372
You've got a nuclear
physicist carrying your water?

3
00:00:03,372 --> 00:00:04,688
Dr. Theodore Sinclair.

4
00:00:04,722 --> 00:00:06,321
We had no idea you were a physicist.

5
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:08,617
Let me guess, something's
recapturing neutrons.

6
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:11,655
Reactor fuel. What if
reactor plutonium isn't pure?

7
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,088
Frank always assumes the worst.

8
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:14,711
You were married when I met you.

9
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:17,903
He wanted to start a
new life. He was naive.

10
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,890
What did you do at work
today? Trick question.

11
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:22,241
If somebody asked that on
the phone, I'd have to cut in.

12
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:24,330
Let us play.

13
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,248
You want me to sleep
with... they're all whores?

14
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,383
It's $2.50 for last night.

15
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:33,564
So what happens now? We go
back to being sworn enemies?

16
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:36,640
Well, as long as we're both
stranded, how about a drop to drink?

17
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:38,725
Or we could skip the drink.

18
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:41,567
- I have to go back to the office.
- What's wrong?

19
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:43,550
I don't know yet.

20
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:38,976
ID, please.

21
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,234
Hello?

22
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:56,498
Helen.

23
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:05,085
Well, look what
Schrodinger's cat dragged in.

24
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,559
I spent the last two weeks
checking the alpha neutron reaction

25
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:11,002
of every element on the periodic table.

26
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:12,905
- You want a gold star?
- Beryllium,

27
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:14,897
fluorine, boron... they're all fine.

28
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:17,736
Then I started to wonder,
how much plutonium-240

29
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,339
is mixed in with the 239?

30
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,375
Maybe we got a problem
with spontaneous fission?

31
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,244
It's 5:00 A.M.

32
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:25,450
I read a paper on the nuclear shell model.

33
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:27,789
It theorized that even-numbered isotopes

34
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:29,957
have a higher spontaneous
fission rate than odd.

35
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:32,695
I read that paper. I
know the guy who wrote it.

36
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:38,400
Are you gonna invite me in?

37
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:40,327
Sure.

38
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:43,238
You can whisper fission rates in my ear.

39
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:46,176
Tell me secrets you can't
share with your wife.

40
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,311
I'll laugh at your jokes
and you'll loosen your tie.

41
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,950
Maybe we could have a
drink, see what happens.

42
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,320
Ugh, darn.

43
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:58,223
I'm fresh out of whiskey.

44
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:13,396
Who was that? Christmas caroler?

45
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,479
No, just a soldier looking for a good time.

46
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:17,780
Mmm.

47
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,816
Operator.

48
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,337
This call will be monitored
for your protection.

49
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,766
Hello? Is anyone there?

50
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,530
Manhattan 1x08
The Second Coming

51
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:14,626
Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

52
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,103
Anyone heard of Stephen Blackpool?

53
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,703
What about Bill Sikes?

54
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:25,038
Crosley, you must know some of these guys.

55
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:26,539
Allow me to hazard a guess.

56
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:29,960
- Is Wilkins Micawber on the list?
- Uh, right here.

57
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:31,576
- Yup.
- He a friend of yours?

58
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:35,074
He emigrated to Australia
to embark upon a new life.

59
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,340
Unshackling himself from the
chains of his own history.

60
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,671
Well, then how did he wind up

61
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:41,272
in the British delegation
to the Manhattan Project?

62
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,707
He didn't. It's a codename.

63
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,210
They all are.

64
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,546
Invented by Charles
Dickens a century ago. No?

65
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,817
So they know how to choose
pretentious pseudonyms.

66
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,894
Let's hope that they know
something about physics.

67
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:55,958
A British scientist is worth two Americans.

68
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,212
2.2, to be precise.

69
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,006
It's just like converting
kilos into pounds.

70
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,208
Well, your countrymen are
bringing quite a dowry with them.

71
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,999
More than two years of research.

72
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,902
They've had an atomic program
since Hitler was in art school.

73
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:10,409
If we can recruit them, we'll
finally have a fighting chance.

74
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,245
They've got to give us at
least one Brit for implosion.

75
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,148
Oppenheimer barely tolerates our existence.

76
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:17,318
You really think he's gonna up
and hand us Nicholas Nickelby?

77
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:19,621
Oppenheimer's not going
to hand us anything.

78
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,956
He's letting the Brits
choose which group they join.

79
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:25,260
Well, no offense, but who's going
to choose this group over Thin Man?

80
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,530
The Brits had 30 scientists

81
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,910
working on implosion the past year.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,369
They did?

83
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:33,126
All we have to do is show
them how far we've gotten

84
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:35,569
on these test shots and
they'll come running.

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,077
Frank.

86
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:39,441
If you'll accept the advice of a native,

87
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:41,858
there is an art to seducing
a proper Englishman.

88
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,130
Crosley's right. Akley's probably fattening

89
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,251
them up with filet mignon as we speak.

90
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:49,074
Crosley, you must have shared a dorm
room at Eton with half of these guys.

91
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,432
Yeah, and shared a manservant
at Oxford with the other half.

92
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,155
Yeah, I suppose I could serve
as your cultural liaison.

93
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:08,728
I can find my own way out.

94
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:11,482
Not that you're not delightful company.

95
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,157
Isn't that Frank's wife?

96
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,636
Dr. Winter!

97
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,704
Dr. Winter?

98
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:22,853
I hope this isn't a hanging crime.

99
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,441
You can release the
prisoner into my custody.

100
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,941
Sir, she's uncredentialed.

101
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:30,642
She is a card-carrying member of
the Botanical Society of America.

102
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,347
I will see that she
doesn't blow up any bridges.

103
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,952
So what did you do to get sent upriver?

104
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,524
I made an appointment
at the security office.

105
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:42,525
You know, most of us spend our off hours

106
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,026
avoiding the security office.

107
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,498
I don't have off hours or on hours

108
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,700
because I don't have a job
because the army won't let me.

109
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,998
That doesn't sound so bad.

110
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,153
If I had a six-month furlough,

111
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,874
I'd catch up on my reading.

112
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,870
I wasn't looking for an intelligence post.

113
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,320
Apparently, I don't even have
clearance to laminate badges.

114
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:07,207
They say I failed my polygraph.

115
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:09,858
Did you tell them you
were thrilled to be here?

116
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:12,025
Let me look into it.

117
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,192
Don't bother.

118
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,268
I stopped believing in Christmas miracles

119
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,937
a long time ago.

120
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:27,637
Abby, where are you going?

121
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:29,138
I just punched out.

122
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:30,974
I switched to the early shift.

123
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,179
- Can you punch back in?
- What? No. No.

124
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:34,816
I'm taking a day trip to Santa Fe.

125
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,019
You can shop for pottery tomorrow.

126
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:36,787
No, I can't.

127
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,981
Santa Fe isn't going
anywhere. This is important.

128
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,635
I'm not shopping.

129
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:47,943
I know you won't approve, but
I'm going to see Mother and Daddy.

130
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:49,991
Your parents live in Massachusetts.

131
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,109
I got a letter.

132
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:53,846
They're going to a millinery
convention in Los Angeles

133
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,617
on the California Limited
and it stops in Santa Fe.

134
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,119
- I'm going to surprise them.
- Jesus, Abby.

135
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:01,323
I'm going to ride one stop, 72 minutes.

136
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:04,094
And then I'll get off the train and
I'll take the bus back to Santa Fe.

137
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,062
I know it's against the army rules

138
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,698
and I know we could get into trouble...

139
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,735
- Fine.
- Fine?

140
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:13,469
But before you go, I need you to
arrange an outgoing telephone call.

141
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:15,939
All right.

142
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,611
With no one listening.

143
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:20,381
Even you.

144
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,964
Listen, stay away from him.

145
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,635
No, Shirley, I'm not gonna
discuss this with you anymore.

146
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:37,914
I don't want you standing under the

147
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:39,078
- mistletoe...
- I need to cut in.

148
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:40,330
- with that creep.
- I need to make

149
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,515
a call from this telephone right now.

150
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,518
Here. Here's $18. Buy
her a honey baked ham.

151
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,025
Operator.

152
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,765
Charles Isaacs. I need an outside line.

153
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,329
Just a moment, please.

154
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:05,099
Is this the reactor building?

155
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:07,151
Put me through to Daniel Ellis' office.

156
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:09,154
-  Hold for Mr. Ellis.
- No, no, no, no.

157
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:12,351
No, I need to speak to
his secretary Theodore.

158
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,754
Tell him it's Mr. Donaldson calling.

159
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,318
Are you alone?

160
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,730
Nobody's monitoring this call.

161
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:24,621
We have exactly five minutes.

162
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:27,867
There is something that
I need you to do for me.

163
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:33,560
They don't look like they've
been ravaged by a light breeze,

164
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:35,185
much less the Blitz.

165
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,852
Englishmen never let a little thing

166
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:38,753
like the apocalypse rumple our suits.

167
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,424
Huh, this may be harder than I thought.

168
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,930
Akley seems to have
quite a head start on us.

169
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:48,501
Who's the ringleader?

170
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,871
We get him, the rest
will fall like dominoes.

171
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:53,675
The bloke with the
cigar is Philip Bantliff,

172
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,277
but he barely got a second from
Cambridge in statistical mechanics.

173
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:58,978
He can't balance an egg on a spoon,

174
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:01,114
much less opposing thermodynamic forces.

175
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,817
That's Brooks Matthews.

176
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,485
He's a third-rate experimental hack.

177
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,221
I'm sorry to say this, they sent
us Man United instead of Arsenal.

178
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,216
Speak American.

179
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:16,957
The A-team stayed home.

180
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,961
What about him?

181
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,196
We don't want him.

182
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:24,332
- Who is he?
- His name is Hogarth.

183
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,291
- Frank...
- William Hogarth?

184
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:29,849
He started the British implosion project.

185
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:33,043
He's the guy we need. You know him?

186
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:35,510
We're acquainted, yeah.
But believe me, Frank...

187
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:38,149
Well, good. We'll all have high tea.

188
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:44,786
Can you show me your big
smile for Grandma and Grampy?

189
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:48,124
Big smile. Big, big,
big. Look at that. Okay.

190
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,459
Ready?

191
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:53,159
No, we said no disturbances.

192
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,576
It's a special delivery.

193
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:00,196
Ta-da!

194
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:02,867
- Abigail!
- Daddy, hi!

195
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:05,489
What in God's name are you doing here?

196
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:08,538
A month with barely a phone call,

197
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:10,573
now you scare us half to death.

198
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,939
- I'm so sorry.
- Come sit with your bubbe.

199
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,374
You look beautiful, sweetheart.

200
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,711
- Oh, such a boy.
- Have a seat.

201
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:21,783
Have you had an easy trip?

202
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,661
Joey, come here. Come here.

203
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,596
Miriam.

204
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,564
- Miriam.
- Come here.

205
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,382
Miriam, it's okay.

206
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:42,001
Dr. Hogarth.

207
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,669
I'm Frank Winter.

208
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,439
Glad you made it across the pond.

209
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:48,341
Yes, Dr. Winter. Nice to
put a face to the reputation.

210
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:49,908
Well, don't believe everything you hear.

211
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,675
Oh, no, I've read your work.

212
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,109
We're delighted to be here,

213
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:54,978
to be anywhere other than there.

214
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,650
I believe...

215
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,416
I believe you know Paul Crosley.

216
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,316
Dr. Hogarth.

217
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,216
What a long time it has been, Paul.

218
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:10,124
Ahem. Why don't we catch
up over dinner tonight?

219
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,426
Lovely.

220
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,676
You got a call at the switchboard, Chuck.

221
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:24,234
Must have been a prank.

222
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,816
Guy said he was Christopher Columbus.

223
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:27,169
- Did he leave a message?
- Yeah,

224
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,777
he said to tell you 400,000.

225
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,249
Is he expecting you?

226
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,563
Dr. Isaacs?

227
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,342
It won't work.

228
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,784
Thin Man. I just got a
message from Theodore Sinclair.

229
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,376
- Who?
- It's not gonna work.

230
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,003
Not with reactor-bred plutonium.

231
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:13,070
Sit down. Sit down.

232
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:16,103
Charlie,

233
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:19,141
600 scientists vetted the math.

234
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:21,278
Four of them have Nobel medals at home.

235
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:24,112
But their numbers don't
account for reactor plutonium.

236
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:26,550
It's not pure. It contains Pu-240.

237
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:28,454
We'll survive a little cork in our wine.

238
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:29,688
I read a paper once.

239
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,957
It theorized that even-numbered isotopes

240
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,258
have higher spontaneous
fission rates than odd.

241
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,160
- Whose paper?
- So I got Sinclair

242
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:37,995
to test a sample from the reactor.

243
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:40,297
As long as it's under 300, we're fine.

244
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:42,832
It's 400,000.

245
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,066
It'll predetonate

246
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,557
like a bad fuse.

247
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,417
Why did you tell me?

248
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,053
Um, what?

249
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:12,448
Let's be honest with each other.

250
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,329
You don't really want the
project to succeed, do you?

251
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:17,696
I mean, you made that pretty clear
since the moment you got here.

252
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,129
So why did you tell me?

253
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:21,830
It's my job. I made a commitment.

254
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,499
There are higher commitments.

255
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,201
You could have sat back, stayed
quiet, watched Thin Man fail.

256
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:28,501
And let Heisenberg beat us to the punch?

257
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,735
If we fall short with
the combined brain power

258
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,003
of all the Allies and a
floating line of credit

259
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:35,971
from the United States government,

260
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,072
isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg

261
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:40,207
-  will fall short, too?
- Of course.

262
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:44,580
And if we fail and Heisenberg
fails, it'll never get built.

263
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:46,580
We could all go home.

264
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,396
You could have kept quiet.

265
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,720
But instead...

266
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:57,930
you walked into my office
and you sounded the alarm.

267
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,207
I thought you should know.

268
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,166
And now I do.

269
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,370
And now we'll reorganize

270
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,738
all of our resources
toward finding a solution.

271
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,743
And when we do drop the bomb...

272
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,280
and make no mistake, we will drop it...

273
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,474
all those lives

274
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,001
will be on your head, Charlie.

275
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,884
But now I know

276
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,359
that 20 centuries of stony sleep

277
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:28,797
were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle.

278
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:33,069
And what rough beast, its
hour come round at last,

279
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:36,372
slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?

280
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:37,530
- Sir?
- You should have

281
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:38,608
kept your mouth shut,

282
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:41,818
you goddamn, ungrateful,
conniving little Jew.

283
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:44,648
Dr. Isaacs?

284
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:49,924
Never mind.

285
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,359
It can wait.

286
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:00,332
So this is Aunt Esther's family?

287
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,168
Esther's on my side, sweetheart.

288
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:05,306
The Perlmans are your
mother's cousins back in Minsk.

289
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,841
The ones with the textile factory?

290
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:09,610
We thought they'd all made it out,

291
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:13,011
but that letter arrived
just before we left home.

292
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,182
Malka and the little girl...

293
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:16,819
got left behind.

294
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:19,454
The postmark was from June.

295
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:23,121
Now they say the whole
ghetto has been liquidated.

296
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,589
What kind of word is that?

297
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,392
It's like a sale at Filene's.

298
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:28,760
What were they doing in
the ghetto to begin with?

299
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,461
Aren't they very well-to-do?

300
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:31,885
Ah!

301
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,665
We've called half of Washington
trying to get information.

302
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,902
You're always warning me
about jumping to conclusions.

303
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:40,672
I'm sure your cousins will
turn up sooner or later.

304
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:43,106
Probably in a shallow grave.

305
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:47,312
Little corn has big ears.

306
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:48,880
I hope he's listening.

307
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:50,851
Children need to know
what kind of world this is

308
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,021
that treats good Jews like poultry.

309
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,921
Your father sheltered you too much.

310
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,354
Now let it go, Miriam.

311
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,157
You could never stand any ugliness.

312
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,326
Forgive me if I'm not
interested in gloomy gossip

313
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,696
about people I've never even met.

314
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,868
You haven't seen me or Joey in six months

315
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:05,672
and this is how you want
to spend our time together?

316
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:08,473
Now it's our fault that
we haven't seen you?

317
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,739
Joey's going to be in a holiday pageant.

318
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,347
He's playing the little lamb in the manger.

319
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,428
He's Jewish, Abigail.

320
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,298
Well, so was Jesus.

321
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:33,699
And I know you won't believe it, Daddy,

322
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,436
but Charlie's been an
absolute star at work.

323
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,606
And what is his work exactly?

324
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,743
You know I can't talk about it.

325
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,680
But a lot of very smart
and important people

326
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:46,754
seem to think that Charlie
is going to help end the war.

327
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:50,992
Maybe Charlie can help us.

328
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:55,183
He's got such an important government job,

329
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:59,735
maybe he can find out
where they've sent Malka.

330
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,807
Arrange some kind of special
visa, I don't know what.

331
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:04,746
- No.
- We'll pay whatever it costs.

332
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,617
My love, my love, there is
nothing that Charlie can do.

333
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:18,063
We've got 18 minutes till Albuquerque.

334
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,900
What, you're getting off?

335
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:25,005
We have a suite at the
Huntington in Pasadena.

336
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:27,142
Daddy...

337
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:31,542
I don't know. If... if
they even knew I was here...

338
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:35,317
Open up, please.

339
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:43,859
Mrs. Isaacs, would you please come with me?

340
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:46,864
Now.

341
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:54,164
Mrs. Isaacs, this is a serious infraction.

342
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,324
I would think a switchboard operator

343
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,471
would know security
regulations chapter and verse.

344
00:18:58,506 --> 00:18:59,971
Absolutely, sir. I do.

345
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,605
Well, then you see my confusion.

346
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,074
A day pass to Santa Fe is
not a ticket to California.

347
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,542
I wasn't going to California,
sir. Just to Albuquerque.

348
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,300
Mrs. Isaacs,

349
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:11,346
if you and your husband are
having a marital dispute...

350
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
No, it's nothing like that, sir.

351
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,214
Colonel Cox...

352
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,984
There has been...

353
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:22,186
there has been a terrible tragedy.

354
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:27,750
I don't know if you heard
what happened in Minsk.

355
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:29,661
I have family there

356
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:32,422
and my cousin Malka...

357
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,508
well, she's really more
like a sister to me.

358
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:38,240
Now, now.

359
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,924
Oh.

360
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,955
I know it was wrong,
sneaking off like that,

361
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,190
but I was trying to help my
family through a difficult time

362
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,891
and I'm prepared to accept my punishment.

363
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,357
- There have to be consequences.
- Oh, poor Malka.

364
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:58,522
I used to send her
hand-me-downs every year.

365
00:19:58,557 --> 00:20:02,057
I guess there's no need for those
dresses wherever the Nazis have taken her.

366
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:03,793
It's just so hard not knowing.

367
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,816
- If only we had some answers.
- All right. All right, listen.

368
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,855
Given the circumstances,

369
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,349
I think we can let bygones be bygones.

370
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:19,007
Go home and get some rest, Mrs. Isaacs.

371
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:23,047
Thank you, sir.

372
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,655
Three-martini lunch?

373
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:36,824
Principal wants to see you in his office.

374
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,437
The St. Louis Kid.

375
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:58,878
We missed you today at
lunch with the Brits.

376
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:00,144
Lunatics.

377
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,047
You all right?

378
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:08,353
You look like you just saw
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

379
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:11,524
I think I'm coming down with something.

380
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,192
I used to get the flu every winter recess.

381
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,146
Here.

382
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,064
Kills the germs.

383
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:23,966
You wanted to see me, sir?

384
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,022
You know what I do for a living, Charlie?

385
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,106
I'm in upper management.

386
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:35,610
I spent 15 years at a university

387
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,411
dreaming about invisible particles,

388
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:39,342
and suddenly they handed me the keys

389
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:41,187
to a world war.

390
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:44,547
Explain that.

391
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,755
There's gonna be some changes around here.

392
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,717
'Cause the Brits are joining Thin Man?

393
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:55,187
No, this is bigger than a bunch
of shell-shocked theoretical men.

394
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,888
Now that the reactor's up and running,

395
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:58,925
I'm gonna be back and
forth between Chicago,

396
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,598
DC, God knows where else.

397
00:22:01,632 --> 00:22:04,967
We're through designing.
It's time to build.

398
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,941
The design is locked?

399
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,872
Now, I know that you've
had your differences

400
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:11,640
with some of the rest of the
group, Lancefield in particular.

401
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,308
That's gonna have to change.

402
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:15,312
I'm appointing a number two

403
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:18,049
to mind the shop, get the Brits
up to speed while I'm away.

404
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,219
Now I mentored Tom Lancefield in Chicago

405
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:22,723
and have watched him become a
fine physicist in his own right.

406
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:23,868
He's the natural choice.

407
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,651
But he's not my choice, Charlie.

408
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,366
You are.

409
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,442
Sir?

410
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,570
Promise me you're gonna
work on your people skills

411
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,661
or you'll wind up like Frank Winter.

412
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:40,179
Don't get your hopes up. Title
doesn't come with a raise.

413
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,745
I'm not sure what to say.

414
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,978
Well, say that you won't make me look bad

415
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:47,116
in front of the President
of the United States.

416
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,684
You have your hand on the rudder.

417
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,385
A staff of 600 at your beck and call.

418
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:58,984
You just got a promotion.

419
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:01,020
It wouldn't kill you to smile.

420
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,794
Can I think about it?

421
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,202
I'm not sure I'm management material.

422
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:21,098
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of this waffling, Charlie.

423
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:24,277
Desperate times require men of conviction.

424
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:28,050
You have till tomorrow to
decide if you're one of them.

425
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:35,226
They say he was antisocial

426
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,694
and knew nothing about people.

427
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,362
Typical of a Cambridge man.

428
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:39,930
He did die a virgin, after all.

429
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:45,269
But I've always believed Isaac Newton

430
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:47,638
to be a humanist in his way.

431
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:50,744
The law of universal
gravitation applies to men

432
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,445
just as to objects.

433
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,780
Consider the two of us.

434
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:56,415
Oh, yes. Quite a coincidence.

435
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:58,551
Mmm, oh, no, Paul.

436
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:01,555
You and I after so many years
have been drawn together once more

437
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,791
by the cosmos for a reason.

438
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:08,393
Dr. Akley plied me with an 1896 Margaux

439
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:11,594
which he'd been holding in his
collection since before the war.

440
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:13,863
But then, that's mere table wine

441
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:16,554
in Lord Crosley's cellar, isn't it?

442
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,509
Lord Crosley?

443
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:21,301
He didn't tell you?

444
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,437
George III deeded his great grandfather

445
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:29,808
more land in Mayfair than
the Duke of Westminster.

446
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,143
A bit of an exaggeration.

447
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,878
Oh, please, a few well-placed fire bombs

448
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,717
and your man here is sitting
on the throne, Dr. Winter.

449
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:39,156
I'll make sure and curtsey.

450
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:42,458
Ah.

451
00:24:42,492 --> 00:24:44,726
Bring us the sweetest,

452
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:47,915
wettest bottle you have, love.

453
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,330
And let me know if you'd like me

454
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,914
to go down in your cellar to pick it out.

455
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,168
We have a very limited list, sir.

456
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,300
But I'll bring you the check.

457
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,835
Put it on Paul's tab.

458
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:04,304
Paul joined you at the
National Physical Lab

459
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,307
after Oxford, correct?

460
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:07,575
First in his class.

461
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,675
How could I have turned him down?

462
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:14,082
His work was excellent, but his company

463
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:16,417
was beyond compare.

464
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:19,319
He used to regale my
wife and family with tales

465
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,592
about, what was it, Woburn Abbey?

466
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:27,028
You recall all those
Christmases you spent with us?

467
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:30,199
Still cleaning the foie
gras out of my arteries.

468
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:32,232
- How is Mrs. Hogarth?
- Dead.

469
00:25:34,737 --> 00:25:36,105
My condolences.

470
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,110
There was a time when I hoped

471
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:41,178
Crosley would take a shine to my daughter.

472
00:25:41,212 --> 00:25:43,581
Do you think maybe we should
call it a night, gentlemen?

473
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,284
I, um... we have an early start.

474
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:47,884
Uh, a night cap.

475
00:25:48,523 --> 00:25:51,467
There are a few things we
should discuss with Dr. Hogarth.

476
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:53,763
Perhaps Lord Crosley's right.

477
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:56,532
I have an 8:00 meeting with
Dr. Akley I should prepare for.

478
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:57,766
One drink.

479
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:04,935
Dr. Hogarth,

480
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:09,010
I'd like to talk to you
about your work on implosion.

481
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,380
I enjoyed getting to know
the Thin Man team today.

482
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:19,449
But it's been a long winter

483
00:26:19,483 --> 00:26:21,750
for a lonely widower in Europe.

484
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:24,375
And there's one comfort

485
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:27,090
Akley declined to point me towards.

486
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:42,313
Sit back and relax. There
are no wrong answers.

487
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,617
Stanley Church.

488
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:00,213
Do I know you?

489
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:02,689
You interviewed a woman
maybe nine months back.

490
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:04,857
Liza Winter. Denied her clearance.

491
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,627
I'm prohibited from
discussing security procedures.

492
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:09,062
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

493
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:10,197
Look, I wouldn't bother you,

494
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:12,300
but this is a good woman
with something to offer.

495
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:15,146
I think you've made a
recommendation in error.

496
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:17,406
I don't make recommendations.

497
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:19,540
I interpret physiological data

498
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:21,541
and pass the findings on to my superiors.

499
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:23,941
You've never passed along a false positive?

500
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,942
If you'll excuse me, I have to get home.

501
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:27,313
What for?

502
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:30,923
Not like you have a
wife waiting up for you.

503
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:32,695
I'm sorry?

504
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:35,146
We have an acquaintance in common.

505
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:39,181
Corporal Hayden from the ordnance division.

506
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,217
He mentioned you a while back.

507
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,274
Thought we'd have a lot to talk about.

508
00:27:44,651 --> 00:27:47,786
A couple of middle-aged bachelors.

509
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,321
I'm not sure of what you're implying.

510
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:53,982
I think we're all entitled
to a secret or two, don't you?

511
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:57,394
Now listen, you do me a favor.

512
00:27:57,428 --> 00:27:59,562
Pull Liza Winter's file,

513
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,031
give that physiological data a second look.

514
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:03,867
I don't know what you
think she lied about...

515
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:06,904
She registered a fail on question 17.

516
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:08,974
What's question 17?

517
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:12,213
Have you ever received treatment
or been institutionalized

518
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:14,350
due to a disorder of the mind?

519
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,835
How are your mother and

520
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:38,574
his highness the hat king?

521
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:42,973
Still trying to shake
me from the family tree?

522
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:45,072
They're good.

523
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:49,963
How was work?

524
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,581
Good.

525
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:04,284
Be 1960 before these noodles cook.

526
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,361
You're a nasty Yankee whore, aren't you?

527
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:18,670
Sounds like he'll make a
great addition to the team.

528
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:21,898
Better have a suitcase full of
super-compression calculations for us.

529
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:24,226
Well, if he's been working
on implosion for 18 months,

530
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:26,370
I bet he's got designs
for a working model by now.

531
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:29,436
- All right, that's it. I've heard enough.

532
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:32,581
You let me know when Big Ben strikes 12.

533
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:38,054
Americans. So delicate.

534
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,368
Pussy got your tongue?

535
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,921
Bring me another.

536
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:53,349
I'm having such a delightful time

537
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,208
with the implosion group tonight.

538
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:58,434
And Lord Crosley will
happily pay, won't you?

539
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:12,660
Not exactly Suleiman's harem, is it?

540
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,534
This is the entire menu?

541
00:30:16,975 --> 00:30:19,975
What a wholesome and
unsullied creature you are.

542
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,063
Thank you.

543
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:23,597
Let us correct that immediately.

544
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,932
Isn't that Fritz's lady friend?

545
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:28,523
Jeannie.

546
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,834
Poor Fritz.

547
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:34,770
I'm going.

548
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,041
Perhaps the three of us

549
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,610
could get along together.

550
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,879
Experience...

551
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:44,479
Not her.

552
00:30:44,514 --> 00:30:47,448
- You can't have Jeannie.
- I'm working, Crosley.

553
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:50,951
In your presence, Paul, I believe
I can have anything I want.

554
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,655
Not her.

555
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,859
Here, Jeannie, take this,
please. Take the night off.

556
00:30:57,893 --> 00:30:59,961
The slave would do well
not to poke at the lion.

557
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:06,102
Oh!

558
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,075
She named him Henry, by the way.

559
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,542
Wanted your son to have a decent
name before she gave him away.

560
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:18,111
Little Henry never did
have a title, did he?

561
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:20,646
What was your father's again, Paul?

562
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,548
Best ironmonger in Liverpool?

563
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:27,017
Does that pass to a child out of wedlock?

564
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,989
Lucy thought you'd return eventually.

565
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:35,325
But I should have known you'd
wash up on American shores.

566
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,227
What's the problem here?

567
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,702
Your man is a confidence artist, Frank.

568
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:42,604
He conned my daughter

569
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:45,239
into believing he was a
thousand things he isn't,

570
00:31:45,274 --> 00:31:47,942
most importantly that
he was the kind of man

571
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:51,707
who doesn't flee England
when he fathers a child.

572
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:56,345
All right, night's over.

573
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,645
You can both settle this when you're sober.

574
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,948
No, no, no. This is just fine.

575
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:03,351
Oh, and by the way, Dr. Winter,

576
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,951
no one from the delegation
is joining your group.

577
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:07,453
Not one of the men.

578
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,376
Dr. Hogarth, please.

579
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,224
Whatever my mistakes, you
lived through the bombings.

580
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:14,658
You know implosion is the way
forward. You have to help us.

581
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:15,806
- No, I do not.
- You would

582
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:16,961
let Hitler win this war...

583
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:21,398
No, I do not know implosion
is the way forward.

584
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:24,267
It's a fantasy. A dream.

585
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:27,974
Not with super-compression
and a solid sphere.

586
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:30,743
We are just months away
from a fully functioning...

587
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:33,647
Theory which we've already disproved.

588
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:37,327
If you spent more time working,
less time groping army girls...

589
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,424
There's that American hubris.

590
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,502
My Christmas gift to you...
I'll send over our research.

591
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,561
When you examine our papers,

592
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:48,898
you'll find that shockwave control

593
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:51,169
is mathematically impossible.

594
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,238
I imagine you're already
fighting with propagation.

595
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:57,179
Soon you'll see that chaos is untamable.

596
00:32:57,213 --> 00:33:00,047
Implosion is like a man.

597
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:02,182
The closer you look,
the more you'll realize

598
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:03,918
just how little you know about him.

599
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:08,458
Even if your group weren't full
of misfits and liars, Dr. Winter,

600
00:33:08,492 --> 00:33:12,028
a thousand geniuses
couldn't master implosion

601
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:13,896
in a thousand millennia.

602
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:19,034
Get this limey prick out of here.

603
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,463
So, you traded away the afternoon shift?

604
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:56,001
- Mmm.
- I thought you and Frenchy

605
00:33:56,026 --> 00:33:57,586
were attached at the hip.

606
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,161
I prefer to spend afternoons with my son.

607
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:05,767
Well, she asked me to
give this back to you.

608
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:49,441
Dr. Hogarth is right about me.

609
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:56,779
None of that's my business.

610
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,910
Doesn't mean he's right about implosion.

611
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:07,652
Just because they couldn't do it, Frank,

612
00:35:07,686 --> 00:35:09,453
doesn't mean you can't.

613
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:12,920
The problem with us Brits, we
are too beholden to our past.

614
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:16,189
You Americans, you barely have
one, so it can't hold you back.

615
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:19,863
There's a reason you invented
things like motor cars and airplanes.

616
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,631
Hubris cuts both ways, Frank.

617
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:26,937
But it doesn't control shockwaves.

618
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:29,774
Hogarth sent over his papers this morning.

619
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,788
You know, there's a boy
out there somewhere and...

620
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:43,158
I'm a part of him.

621
00:35:43,192 --> 00:35:45,156
Or he's a part of me.

622
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:50,894
I thought I had spent the last two years

623
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:53,695
trying to pretend he didn't exist.

624
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:57,900
Maybe... maybe...

625
00:35:57,934 --> 00:35:59,804
it's knowing that he does exist

626
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,343
is what brought me here in the first place.

627
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:08,080
I know I'll probably never meet him and...

628
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:10,614
well, if I did, he'd probably hate me.

629
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,351
But...

630
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:16,754
I don't know.

631
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:20,789
I suppose I still want to make him proud.

632
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:59,102
Oh.

633
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,601
Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you.

634
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,102
So much for bygones.

635
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,172
If you're here to arrest me,
I'm going to have to resist.

636
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:05,775
My son's asleep and I don't have a sitter.

637
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,113
No, ma'am. The colonel
doesn't know I'm here.

638
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:09,882
May I come in?

639
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,400
How can I help you, Private?

640
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:26,070
Cole Dunlavey.

641
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,646
I knew a Jewish fella back in Iowa.

642
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:34,551
Mr. Kripke. Used to hire me to
paint his fence every summer.

643
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,190
Paid me $10 just for a day's work.

644
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:41,563
When my dad got sick, Mr. Kripke
helped us get the crop in the silo.

645
00:37:41,597 --> 00:37:44,930
Well, he sounds like a lovely man.

646
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,268
I don't like to eavesdrop, but I heard
your conversation with the colonel.

647
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:53,037
I know how important family
is in the Hebrew faith.

648
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:54,705
Mmm.

649
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,311
I file the intelligence reports.

650
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,809
This is everything we have on the
situation where your people are.

651
00:38:01,843 --> 00:38:04,544
You said that not knowing
was the hardest part.

652
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:08,016
Mmm.

653
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:16,390
The Bible says that the Lord
rained fire on Sodom and Gomorrah.

654
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:20,458
I don't know what He's
gonna rain on Berlin.

655
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,478
- Hey.
- Hey.

656
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:38,946
Are you putting an addition on the house?

657
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,345
Frank had them drawn up last year

658
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:43,244
as a Christmas gift.

659
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:46,051
Plans for a greenhouse back in Princeton.

660
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:49,154
A woman must have money
and a room of her own.

661
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:51,522
I have my shack.

662
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:54,393
But I've given up on the paycheck.

663
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:56,229
Frank's not here.

664
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:58,596
Yeah, I just left him at the office.

665
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:00,161
But about that paycheck,

666
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:03,740
you can pick up your
security badge in the morning.

667
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,576
They'll find you a job.

668
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:08,780
The whole thing was
just a misunderstanding.

669
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,750
- Really?
- Yeah.

670
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:14,820
It turns out the polygraph
machine was on the fritz that day.

671
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:18,042
You didn't have to do that, Glen.

672
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,823
In fact, I...

673
00:39:21,857 --> 00:39:23,858
I asked you not to.

674
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:28,029
Did they show you my file?

675
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:30,864
It's none of my business.

676
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:34,317
I see.

677
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,704
You're all right now.

678
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,542
Aren't you?

679
00:39:43,316 --> 00:39:46,620
If I had known, I would never
have brought Frank into this.

680
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:49,022
I never would have dragged
you to the middle of nowhere.

681
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,343
Yes, you would have.

682
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:54,629
Frank knew and here we are.

683
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:57,131
But I'll take the job. Thank you.

684
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,853
Because...

685
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:02,504
here we are.

686
00:40:19,256 --> 00:40:21,558
Did you eat already?

687
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:26,229
My cousins are dead.

688
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:28,397
What?

689
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:33,207
The Perlmans on my mother's side.

690
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,776
Jesus.

691
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:38,277
I'm sorry.

692
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:41,752
Were you close?

693
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,386
No, I never met them.

694
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,020
If I had seen them on the street,

695
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:49,091
I would have walked right past.

696
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,430
Were they in an accident or...

697
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:57,601
No, they... they were in Europe.

698
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:02,857
I... I don't see how
they could have escaped

699
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:04,977
with a toddler.

700
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:13,189
Did you know that in Minsk

701
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,292
the Germans allot each Jew

702
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:18,754
one and a half square
meters of living space?

703
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,298
The adults, I mean.

704
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:24,300
The children were marched into the forest

705
00:41:24,335 --> 00:41:26,235
and buried alive.

706
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,736
Where'd you hear that?

707
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,039
There are more than a
million people missing.

708
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:40,506
Like they just vanished
off the face of the earth.

709
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,510
I don't even know how to
think about a number like that.

710
00:41:46,282 --> 00:41:49,016
You shouldn't be thinking
about that stuff, Abby.

711
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,917
Why?

712
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:53,118
Because I'm too fragile
to stomach the truth?

713
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:56,692
No, because there's no
point getting worked up

714
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:59,061
when there's nothing you can do about it.

715
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:06,904
What did Dr. Akley say?

716
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:08,446
About the problem.

717
00:42:09,072 --> 00:42:10,875
What problem?

718
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:13,812
Whatever you were talking about
with that man in Tennessee.

719
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:15,688
You listened in on the call?

720
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:16,725
Charlie, if something's wrong...

721
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,085
Everything's fine. Whatever
you heard, forget it.

722
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:24,489
You're right.

723
00:42:28,027 --> 00:42:29,528
You're right.

724
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:32,098
I can't do anything about
what's happening over there.

725
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,068
But you can.

726
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:12,865
_

727
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,411
There's something I need to tell you.

728
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:40,945
There's a problem with Thin Man.

729
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:44,217
What?

730
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:47,952
The spontaneous fission
rates of plutonium-240,

731
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:49,787
they're higher than 239.

732
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,222
Rates are always higher
in even-numbered isotopes.

733
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,589
I know. You wrote a paper about it.

734
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:57,858
I told you I read everything
you ever published.

735
00:44:57,893 --> 00:45:01,094
It's 400,000.

736
00:45:04,264 --> 00:45:06,932
Akley's bomb will predetonate.

737
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:09,000
We're dead in the water.

738
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:13,638
We are, too.

739
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,874
What?

740
00:45:15,908 --> 00:45:18,486
Implosion won't work either.

741
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:22,113
Not without an army of scientists.

742
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,399
So what are we going to do about it?

743
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:56,830

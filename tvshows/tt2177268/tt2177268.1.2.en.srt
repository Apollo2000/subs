1
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:03,568
Previously on "Clarice"...

2
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:04,700
Ruth: Two dead women floated
down the Anacostia River.

3
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:06,310
Somebody sliced them
to ribbons.

4
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,051
Krendler: Stab wounds.
Bite marks.

5
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,792
Looks like a serial guy
to me.

6
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:11,663
Clarice: Sir,
that man is a professional.

7
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:14,057
He was paid to clean up after
some kind of clinical trial.

8
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,537
Those women
were whistleblowers.

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,626
You will go to the press,
and you will tell them

10
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:19,802
that these murders were
the work of a serial killer.

11
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:22,500
Thanks to the ViCAP Task Force,
we got the guy.

12
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:26,243
And they were not random victims
of a serial killer.

13
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:28,158
They died trying to tell
a story.

14
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:30,726
A story that isn't over.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

16
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,870
Twizzlers and Diet Coke
are food groups now?

17
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,176
Oh, I see.

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,483
We're starting the day
cleaning a deadly weapon.

19
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,224
Okay.

20
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,617
Enough of that.

21
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,489
They're gonna
make you apologize.

22
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,664
You goingto apologize?

23
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,013
This is not
a serial killer.

24
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,580
It's a series of killings.

25
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:00,973
Krendler issued a statement
that I spoke prematurely,

26
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,367
and that all the evidence
I found was inconclusive.

27
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:04,760
He has to salvage
an investigation

28
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:06,457
that you just
kicked into the toilet

29
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,024
by letting the bad guys know
we're onto them.

30
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,982
Someone had to speak up
for those families.

31
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,114
And you know better.

32
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,376
I know!

33
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:18,382
I know.

34
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:21,690
I lost control.

35
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,605
I shouldn't have said it
that way.

36
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:25,128
Coulda, woulda, shoulda.

37
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,434
You also
shot a guy yesterday.

38
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,000
You haven't done that
since Bill.

39
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,960
Think that might have
something to do with it?

40
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:32,004
Maybe.

41
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:34,006
I don't know, Ardelia.

42
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,661
Maybe I should just
go back to the BSU lab.

43
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:37,575
Good.

44
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,924
Hide like a bridge troll.

45
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:42,058
Your best is in the field.

46
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,103
You know that.

47
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,453
But here's the thing.

48
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,019
Going rogue like that

49
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,718
sends your team the message
that you don't trust them.

50
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:52,373
That's no way
for anyone to survive out there.

51
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,766
I know.
You know.

52
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,378
You know.

53
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:01,338
I better know you
if you calling this early.

54
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:02,687
Clarke: Starling there?Oh.

55
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,777
We need her here ASAP.Yes.

56
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,652
Starling.

57
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:19,922
Male reporter: A siege is
under way in Eastern Tennessee.

58
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,750
It began early this morning
when an ATF agent...

59
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,491
Female reporter: ...when an
ATF agent was shot and wounded

60
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:24,883
by a fringe militia group

61
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,842
who call themselves
The Statesmen.

62
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,931
The agent is being treated
at a local hospital

63
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:31,063
and is expected to make
a full recovery.

64
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,761
The incident began...Male reporter:
The incident began

65
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,632
when the agent was prevented
from serving a warrant.

66
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,417
The leader of the group,
Lucas Novak,

67
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,853
has issued a statement

68
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,463
that he will not allow
the federal government...

69
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,073
So, how long has it been?

70
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:44,207
When's the last time you went
back to "Appalaysha"?

71
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:47,384
Appalachia.

72
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:49,081
It's been years.

73
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,648
A lot of old ghosts.

74
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:09,406
Lucas Novak, standard-issue
country gentleman,

75
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,191
described as "charismatic."

76
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,585
Novak leads a group that calls
themselves The Statesmen.

77
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,240
Started off
as a hillbilly rehab clinic

78
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,502
and somehow turned into

79
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,809
a heavily armed
secessionist militia

80
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,681
who want to form their own state
within Tennessee.

81
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,566
The Statesmen
shot an ATF agent

82
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,132
serving a search warrant.

83
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,438
He's in stable condition,

84
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:44,136
but now we're in the middle
of a standoff.

85
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,444
So, let me address
the elephant in the room.

86
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:50,404
This won't be another Waco.

87
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,666
Those of us who were there know

88
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,322
it was a cluster
seven different ways.

89
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,498
This is Tennessee.

90
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,110
It's the AG's home state,
and she sent ViCAP.

91
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:04,548
We want the weapons,
we want the shooter,

92
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,202
we want to make it home.

93
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,290
Good?

94
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,205
Good.
Good.

95
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:20,129
Special Agent
Paul Krendler.

96
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,173
Sheriff Tucker Rowan.

97
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,653
Pleased to have you
on the scene.

98
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,612
We know there are women inside.
Any kids?

99
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,004
No reports
of children among them.

100
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,441
And no word
from anyone inside?

101
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,617
They don't acknowledge
federal authority.

102
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,836
That's why they wouldn't let ATF
serve the warrant.

103
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,447
They're not gonna
give us the shooter,

104
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,318
and they want the feds
off the property.

105
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,493
What were you guys
looking for?

106
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:37,799
Our intel says
they're strapped --

107
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:39,844
modified rifles,
black market stuff.

108
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:41,324
So we'd better
use caution,

109
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,892
'cause we both know
how fast this can go south.

110
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,329
Let's get
that PA system going.You got it.

111
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,288
Need to talk
to the man inside.

112
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,985
Starling.

113
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:52,030
A word.

114
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,079
Agent Krendler, I want to --No.

115
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,515
I talk, you listen.

116
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,300
I want to be clear --
When we get back to Washington,

117
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:05,479
I'm gonna formally request
your transfer off of ViCAP.

118
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,263
Yes, sir.

119
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,525
Clarke.
Yeah.

120
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,048
You're on Starling.

121
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,312
Have her set up cell towers.
Keep her away from the press.

122
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,749
You went wildly off-script
at the press conference.

123
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,098
The only reason you're here

124
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,708
is because I don't trust you
out of my sight.

125
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:18,927
If you can't follow orders,

126
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,364
you're gonna get somebody
killed today.

127
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,269
Got it.

128
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:59,141
Krendler:
ATF's pretty hopped up.

129
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:02,013
I understand.
One of theirs is down.

130
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,451
I've been at this 30 years.

131
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:05,843
And now you got this.

132
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,454
Met Novak a dozen times.

133
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:10,979
Seemed smart, decent,
really wanted to help people.

134
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:14,591
Eccentric, sure,
but we got a lot of eccentrics.

135
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,160
Think he'd light up that place,
risk everyone inside?

136
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,553
I don't know.

137
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:22,773
But why does a man keep
that many automatic weapons?

138
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,435
10 steps forward,
you're in speaker range.

139
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,915
Thanks.

140
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,222
What?

141
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:40,269
Did you have a criminal profiler
at Waco for Koresh?

142
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,838
You want to tell me it would've
worked out differently

143
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,448
if we just maybe
listened to the shrink?

144
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,841
I wasn't there.
I wouldn't say that.

145
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,451
Good.
I was gonna say

146
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:52,237
that behavioral science can be
used for your offense, too.

147
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,501
Anyone who lives
like this, the --Delusional crap?

148
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,199
The mental effort it takes
to hold it all together.

149
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:58,461
It's a lot to maintain.

150
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,072
Spinning plates.
A lot of pressure.

151
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,467
You shouldn't
be here, Starling.

152
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,469
Well, Krendler's gonna
transfer me.

153
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:07,862
Shouldn't be at the Bureau.

154
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,386
I --
Look, I get it.

155
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,520
I'm just ViCAP's resident
knuckle dragger.

156
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,348
But you broke ranks
at the press conference.

157
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:19,395
Maybe you regret it
maybe not.

158
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,876
But something's eating you,
and that's true wherever you go.

159
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,573
And if you stay in the field,

160
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:26,576
Krendler's right --
we're all at risk.

161
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,273
Yes, sir.

162
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:30,493
You tell me you sleep
eight hours a night yourself,

163
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,453
and I'll hand in my credentials
right now.

164
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:43,593
Wire cutter
ain't worth a damn.

165
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,552
I'll get you a new pair.

166
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:48,772
My toolbox is in the tent.

167
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,267
Reesey!

168
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,575
Reesey!

169
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,751
The police are here!

170
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,101
Something happened to Daddy.

171
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:15,843
We got to get home.

172
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:23,807
Wait! Please!

173
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,331
Are you from inside?

174
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,856
My name's
Clarice Starling, FBI.

175
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,771
What's your name?

176
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,469
Wait!

177
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:38,648
Was that a kid?

178
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,477
Heat-mapping says 20 people
inside, armed to the teeth.

179
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,044
The blueprints on file
don't show

180
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,393
anywhere near
this square footage.

181
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,308
House has been added onto
over the years.

182
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,963
Probably carved up
like a rabbit warren inside.

183
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,487
Boss, there's a kid
in the house.

184
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,054
You said there were
no children.

185
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,404
Could be some local kid
checking out the commotion.

186
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:58,276
He ran into
the farmhouse, sir.

187
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,237
This changes things.

188
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,978
Get me the Attorney General
on the line.

189
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,980
Man:  There's
movement at the front door.

190
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,939
Please advise. It's a boy.

191
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:12,160
There's something in his hand.

192
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:14,162
It does not appear
to be a weapon.

193
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:17,078
I repeat, it does not
appear to be a weapon.

194
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:26,609
Lucas Novak wants to talk!

195
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:32,354
But he'll only talk
to the woman I saw.

196
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:37,098
He wants to talk,
but only to her.

197
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,635
Esquivel: So, the transmitter's
built into the clip.

198
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,072
We'll hear everything,
but he won't see it.

199
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:58,119
Alright, alright,
here, let me.

200
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,079
You going somewhere
after this?

201
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:04,691
Half the people in that file
are young women.

202
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,389
Lucas Novak collects them.
He controls them,

203
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,217
even if it is
getting them clean.

204
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,045
And you really believe
that's what he's doing?

205
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,525
I believe
he's a narcissist.

206
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,050
I want him to think I took
the time to put my face on

207
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,096
before he saw me.

208
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,664
Okay, are we good?

209
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,319
Yeah. We'll get pretty much
everything you say in there,

210
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:27,104
but, uh, try to get close
if you can, okay?

211
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,979
That a good idea?Probably not.

212
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:33,676
We can hide a weapon
for you.

213
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,114
Maybe I can't trust them,
but they've got to trust me.

214
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:41,641
Okay.

215
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:44,644
We want to trust you, too,
you know.

216
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,429
I'm a counter sniper.
I work alone,

217
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,736
but I can't do a damn thing
without my team.

218
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:51,433
The team clears a space
for me to work.

219
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,130
I clear the space
for the team.

220
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,871
You don't trust us,
we can't trust you.

221
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,439
Where's that leave anybody?

222
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,659
He doesn't just want you
in there because you're a woman.

223
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,878
You're also
Clarice Starling.

224
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,271
You're all over the news.

225
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,403
It's a power play.

226
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,754
If you get in trouble in there,
look for us.

227
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,104
Let us know where you are.
We'll be there.

228
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:11,714
Alright, then.

229
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,978
Just give me five minutes
to get into position, okay?

230
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,867
Good afternoon.
This is the official statement

231
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,738
from the Department of Justice.

232
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,480
The militia group The Statesmen
have reached out,

233
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,787
and we have begun communication.

234
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,528
When did she record this?A few hours ago.

235
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:46,009
Her plane's already touched down
here in Tennessee.

236
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:47,663
She's on her way.

237
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,232
I'm traveling there because I am
a human being who understands

238
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:55,453
that every person in there
is someone's child.

239
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,805
I've already sent down ViCAP,
my team,

240
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:02,112
and the woman who saved the life
of my daughter.

241
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,201
They're talking she might
run for governor down here.

242
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,247
So it has to be
a nuanced resolution,

243
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,596
not rolling in the tanks.

244
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,772
What if Novak decides
to start World War III

245
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,426
with Starling in there?

246
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:15,082
But my promise to the American
people is that we will not leave

247
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,825
until there is
a peaceful resolution.

248
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,696
Thank you.

249
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,221
Man: Starling is moving
into position.

250
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,396
Man #2: Jones,
we count four hostiles

251
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,398
on the roof facing
southeast.

252
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:30,314
Copy that, I see them.

253
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,751
Moore, watch your 3:00.

254
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:36,146
We got two more armed hostiles
on the balcony.

255
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,800
Esquivel:
I got eyes on Starling.

256
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:40,585
She's with the boy.

257
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,978
Hey, there.

258
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,720
I brought y'all
some food.

259
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,854
I'm Clarice.

260
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,856
Are you famous?

261
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,422
Sort of.

262
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,555
I saw you rubbing
your shoulder.

263
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,513
Did you fall
or something?

264
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:59,169
You know
he saw you on TV?

265
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,171
I like cartoons.

266
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:03,217
My mom's friends
like soaps,

267
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,263
even though TV
is bad for you.

268
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:08,048
So, is that
who you live with?

269
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,876
Your mom
and her friends?

270
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,051
Yeah.

271
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,226
My brother and I,

272
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,793
we used to watch
the Roadrunner.

273
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,839
I don't like him 'cause
he don't talk.

274
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:28,851
She's making her way
toward the house.

275
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,628
All those crazy
artificial colors

276
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,195
are gonna kill you
someday.

277
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:11,633
You know what I see when I look
at these gifts you brought?

278
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,679
The clutches of
late-stage capitalism.

279
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,291
No one knows what real nectar
tastes like anymore.

280
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,380
It's all just chemicals.

281
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,644
Yellow's just a number.
Red ain't red.

282
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:27,431
I think that's why
all these people

283
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:31,261
are losing themselves now,
don't you?

284
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,524
I'm not sure I follow, sir.

285
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:36,658
The commodification
of a person.

286
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:39,313
We're all just
receptacles for corporations

287
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,358
to pour chemicals into.

288
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:44,448
Is it any wonder
when someone goes real dark,

289
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,799
starts to cut us apart?

290
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,500
When there's no person
left inside anymore.

291
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,806
Come on, Peter.
Come on.

292
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,897
Go watch your
stories on the TV.

293
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,334
Maggie.

294
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:03,511
Wouldn't be proper for a man
to lay hands on you.

295
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,427
I appreciate
your consideration.

296
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,864
I'm Special Agent
Clarice Starling.

297
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,040
But I'm guessing Peter
already told you my name.

298
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,955
Oh, sure, sure.

299
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,784
You're the person
who's been looking into

300
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:19,875
the terrifying mouth of
what we're all slowly becoming.

301
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,269
I'm pleased to make
your acquaintance.

302
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:24,880
You know, Buffalo Bill...

303
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,760
Buffalo Bill was a man
who breaks my heart, actually.

304
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:40,548
Thinking somebody would care for
him if he was different.

305
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,681
But who hasn't
thought that, hmm?

306
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,382
That Kentucky I hear
in your accent?

307
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:49,818
West Virginia, sir.

308
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,647
Then I imagine what you see
here is all too familiar.

309
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,389
How's a good girl like you
become a fed, Clarice?

310
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,347
Only place to go
was up or out.

311
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,392
There's always down,
isn't there?

312
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,220
I didn't think you'd, uh,

313
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,004
have a sense
of humor, sir.

314
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,527
I can't help myself.

315
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:06,400
No, I hate the feds.

316
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:09,925
But you...

317
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,884
you are what
this country's all about.

318
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,321
Or should be.

319
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,976
I'd like to
shake your hand.

320
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,198
Oh.

321
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,287
Used to hard work.

322
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,594
Dry hands.

323
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,291
Maggie.
Ew.

324
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,727
I hate this guy.

325
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:34,167
Castor oil and rose water
will take care of that.

326
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,603
That's really
not necessary --

327
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:36,865
No, no, no,
it's my pleasure.

328
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,824
You'll like it,
right, Emma?

329
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,783
I sure do.

330
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:50,009
I know how hard
that road is to up and out.

331
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:55,057
You have to give up a lot,
leave people behind.

332
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,106
Did you leave
behind people?

333
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,803
Family?

334
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,762
Someone who didn't
get up or out?

335
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,379
Now, don't --
Don't wipe it

336
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:13,467
on your clothes.

337
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,425
It'll stain.

338
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,648
M-Mr. Novak, a federal agent was
shot on your property.

339
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,084
We need the shooter.

340
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,043
We need to get in here
and search the place.

341
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,653
You know this.

342
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:27,698
There's steps to this going
away, and I need to take them.

343
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:31,050
I-I truly don't know who
shot your man, Clarice.

344
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,140
I know it's unorthodox
what I do here.

345
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:35,793
I get people clean

346
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:38,100
'cause I won't take the padlock
off the damn door for two weeks

347
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,842
while they shiver so hard
they think they're gonna die,

348
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:44,019
and I know that looks like
unlawful imprisonment,

349
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,196
but we are dying
down here.

350
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,850
I built something.

351
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:52,549
And I can't let the feds
take it away from us.

352
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,464
You know your law,
but that's not what

353
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:55,813
we're here to do, sir.

354
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:58,251
Wasn't there someone
in your life

355
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,166
could've used
someone like me?

356
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,604
I know there was.
I can see it in your eyes.

357
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,134
My brother.

358
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:18,880
S-Sir, I find it strange

359
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,360
that you don't know
who the shooter is.

360
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,536
This is your place.

361
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:27,541
I saw you look at Emma's
little one, our Rabbit.

362
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,933
I thought maybe you had
a kid of your own,

363
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:31,414
but now I see
it different.

364
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,156
You had a brother.

365
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,853
Maybe some of your people
know something

366
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:39,161
about what happened
here today.

367
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,816
You ever make leather
britches out of beans?

368
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,557
String them up to dry.

369
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,776
All the time when
I was little.

370
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,173
Please.

371
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,350
Emma, we're gonna need
more green beans.

372
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,519
Mama, was that Daddy's cap?

373
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,869
What happened to Daddy? I want
to know what happened to Daddy.

374
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,740
Woman: Clarice, tell your
brothers and sister

375
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:39,700
to wash up
and come to the table.

376
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,965
Sir, may I please
use the restroom?

377
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,236
You were still a trainee
when you stopped Buffalo Bill

378
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,282
from skinning and killing
more women.

379
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,985
These things make me think
this agent needs to be

380
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,640
out of rotation until
she can heal from PTSD

381
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,077
of the most
egregious kind.

382
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:15,779
Don't.

383
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,870
Don't.

384
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:28,009
Novak: Oh, she's on the edge.
Now's the time.

385
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:31,708
Tell the boys on the roof to
start raising hell.

386
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:38,846
Man: FBI security,

387
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,587
we are approaching with
the Attorney General.

388
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,023
Two minutes out.

389
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,116
Statesman: Get off
our damn land, pigs!

390
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,118
Incoming! Incoming!

391
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,338
Take cover!Take cover, take cover!

392
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,166
Esquivel:
We've got a situation.

393
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,343
Hostiles on the roof
riling up ATF.

394
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:03,044
Aah!

395
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,829
-Take cover.
-We just got shot at!

396
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:10,312
Man:
Open fire! Open fire!

397
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,400
Who fired?

398
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,141
One of ours misfired.

399
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,405
Who the hell is shooting?

400
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,844
This is getting bad.

401
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,505
Agent Starling!
Agent Starling!

402
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,725
Okay, wait!
Y-Your people need you.

403
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:33,379
Got to get everybody
out here safely.

404
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,554
Just let my team come in.

405
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:35,816
It can't be the feds.

406
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:36,904
My people are scared
of the feds.

407
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,427
Local sheriff --
it has to be.

408
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:41,082
Come on! Come, come, come!
Get that sheriff in here.

409
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,433
Starling?
Are you there?

410
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:45,913
Starling?

411
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,045
If you're in there,
Starling, take cover.

412
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,397
Starling, do you copy?

413
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,355
Clarice: This is Starling
inside the house.

414
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,922
Hold fire, hold fire!

415
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,184
Novak says he'll negotiate,

416
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,752
but only with local
law enforcement.

417
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,449
Hodge, cease fire.

418
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:03,844
The Attorney General is here.
Cease fire.

419
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,629
Hold your fire!

420
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:10,154
Lower your weapons!

421
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,809
Our time here's coming
to an end, Agent Starling.

422
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:16,422
I saw you were upset
when you went in the bathroom.

423
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:19,294
Tell me about "don't."

424
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,643
"Don't"?

425
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,211
What makes you say that word
to yourself?

426
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:26,301
Rowan: Lucas Novak,
we're coming in!

427
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:32,829
That's far as you go!

428
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,527
We ain't gonna shoot,
but we don't want to

429
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,876
get shot at neither.

430
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,487
That's the way I look
at it, too, Lucas.

431
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,070
Go.

432
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:58,159
I'm Sheriff Rowan.

433
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,161
You all right,
Agent Starling?

434
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,903
Yes, sir.
We still don't have a shooter.

435
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,252
They gonna back off?

436
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,646
Not until the shooter
is in custody.

437
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,996
I don't know who he is.

438
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,781
I'll show you my armory --
show of good faith.

439
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,393
Hell, maybe the weapon
he used is in there.

440
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,790
David.

441
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,446
You've done
a fine job here.

442
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,013
Agent Krendler wants you
back at command

443
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,971
now that we got
the area secure.

444
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,799
Sir, the boy's
still inside.

445
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,062
We'll find him.

446
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,159
Don't be a stranger, now.

447
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:54,041
Esquivel: Clarice,
what are you doing?

448
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,871
Clarke: Agent Merengue,
switch to channel Adam 4.

449
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:01,004
Esquivel to Agents Sad
and Flaccid, over.

450
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,485
Who shot first,
ATF or Statesmen?

451
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,707
Statesmen were throwing bottles,
but ATF definitely shot first.

452
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,797
Well, it'd be good to find out
if local ATF are friendlies.

453
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,189
Can we do that quietly?

454
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,148
I don't trust anyone
at headquarters

455
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:16,193
not to blab to the ATF.

456
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,239
You don't trust
anybody, period.

457
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,849
I do.

458
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,547
Starling has a friend back
at Buzzard's Point.

459
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,984
Find Ardelia Mapp.

460
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,066
Tripathi, put more paper
in your fax machine.

461
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,416
There's a lot coming.

462
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,333
Everyone on that ATF unit
down there turned up clean.

463
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,511
Okay, there's a contact
I trust from Quantico.

464
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:43,689
It turns out he's been keeping
a file on, and I quote,

465
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,605
"That crooked son of a bitch
Sheriff Rowan for years,

466
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,694
but nothing ever sticks."

467
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:51,435
You think all the assault
weapons might've got the feds

468
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,828
interested in you?This is on you.

469
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:55,222
ATF showing up at my door.
You're losing it.

470
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:57,572
Yeah, well, who shot
the agent on your watch?

471
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,921
I don't know!You got to hand him over.

472
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,444
Get rid of the feds,
I'll find out.

473
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:02,229
We got to
give 'em someone.

474
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,839
Once they have
someone in custody,

475
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:05,406
they'll pull the hell out.

476
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,060
Maggie.

477
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:10,237
She's a good girl.
She'll keep quiet.

478
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,762
Extortion, narcotics,
prostitution.

479
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,287
They made an arrest.

480
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,246
Whoever they're
serving up is a patsy.

481
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,552
We only got the shooter 'cause
we agreed to pull out.

482
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,250
We cannot leave while
Novak's in there

483
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,555
with a bunch
of women and a kid.

484
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,732
Sheriff Rowan is wired
deep down here.

485
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,038
We have to be strategic.

486
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:32,172
We're not escalating.
Pull the team out.

487
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,870
Ma'am?

488
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:37,568
Do you want
another Waco?

489
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,309
Do it.

490
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,956
Hey.

491
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,566
You got to
get out of here.

492
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,873
Novak told the people
on the roof to throw bottles

493
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,222
at the police.

494
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:24,311
When you were
in the bathroom.

495
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:26,356
Why?

496
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:31,144
He wanted them
to start shooting.

497
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:35,235
He wanted things
to escalate.

498
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,541
He wanted Rowan in.

499
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,764
Peter, you have
a big old bruise

500
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,418
on your right cheek,

501
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,333
and you've been rubbing
at your shoulder.

502
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,553
Rifles are heavy, and they have
a lot of kickback.

503
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,904
It's like getting
kicked by a mule.

504
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,862
Peter?

505
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,779
Did you shoot
the ATF agent?

506
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,265
I didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

507
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:08,007
I just wanted
someone to come.

508
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,445
Someone to...

509
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,577
Help?

510
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:18,365
You were
calling for help.

511
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:20,715
Why didn't you ask
Sheriff Rowan for help?

512
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,196
Mom says
he's the worst one.

513
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,632
When he gets mad,

514
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,896
my mom's friends end up
dead in the woods.

515
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:32,205
Okay.

516
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:35,730
They call you
Rabbit, right?

517
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,776
You got to rabbit
right now.

518
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,081
Get to the command tent.

519
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,517
Go on.

520
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,041
Get.

521
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,709
Female reporter: The standoff
that started early this morning

522
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:01,625
outside of a Tennessee compound
looks to be coming to an end

523
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,106
as the shooter of the ATF agent
who was shot and...

524
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,760
Male reporter: ...informed us
that the shooter of

525
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,110
the ATF officer has been
identified and arrested

526
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:11,418
outside of
the Tennessee compound.

527
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:14,247
I can't believe
she's making us lie down.

528
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,641
New AG got in the sewer
real quick.

529
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,300
Be right back.

530
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:27,173
Clarice: Agent Krendler,
this is Starling.

531
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:28,870
Starling, where
the hell are you?

532
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:31,133
Sir, I'm trying
to be real quiet.

533
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:34,006
Rowan and Novak are operating
a prostitution ring.

534
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,138
Well, Rowan just made an arrest
for the shooting.

535
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:37,661
Who confessed, Maggie?

536
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:38,793
Yes.

537
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,403
She's lying.
They made her confess.

538
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,971
I have evidence video
about the prostitution.

539
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,932
That directly implicates
Sheriff Rowan?

540
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,107
No.

541
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,499
Then end
of discussion.

542
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,414
We have her in custody,
we're pulling out.

543
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,460
That's from the AG.

544
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,552
I'm out of moves
on this side.

545
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,554
She wants to take
the arrest for the win.

546
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,904
Sir, Novak deliberately
escalated things

547
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:06,516
to get Rowan in because he knew
Rowan would get him out.

548
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,955
I can make Novak give it up,
give them both up.

549
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,873
Sir, I need
your authorization.

550
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,659
I know you have every reason
not to, but I'm asking anyway.

551
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,314
I know guys like this.

552
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,492
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

553
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,886
Use your best judgment,
get back here A.S.A.P.

554
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,800
Command out.

555
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,676
Better check
your equipment.

556
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,635
Male reporter:
The incident began

557
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,899
when the agent was prevented
from serving a warrant.

558
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,857
The leader of the group,
Lucas Novak...

559
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,773
Novak:
You're still here?

560
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:56,044
You come to watch TV?

561
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,654
Clarice: It was on.

562
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,352
They're playing a lot
of stories about you.

563
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,180
They can't get
enough of you.

564
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,398
What the hell is she doing?

565
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:03,704
She's telling us
where she is.

566
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:05,184
You pull her out now.

567
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:08,927
I can't.
Her HT is off.

568
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,754
Esquivel?

569
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:11,930
You have a line of sight?

570
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,583
Negative. No visual.

571
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,716
I can picture you,

572
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,676
sitting here,
relaxing at night.

573
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,115
You're thinking
about me?

574
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:26,509
You remind me
of someone.

575
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,816
My father.

576
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,644
My daddy.

577
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,472
He was a sheriff.

578
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:35,040
A sheriff?

579
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,433
You must've adored him.

580
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,917
You bet I did.

581
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,964
He died before
I left home for good.

582
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:52,492
You know, he used to take me
for root beer floats.

583
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:57,758
And the soda jerk who made them,
he was not a kind man.

584
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,978
Wonder why he chose
to be around kids.

585
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,242
Maybe that's why he chose
to be around kids.

586
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,157
Maybe.

587
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,725
Hadn't thought of that.

588
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:12,642
There was this one time,
we found this neighbor boy

589
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:17,038
crying 'cause of
the soda jerk's meanness.

590
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:20,650
If there was one thing
my daddy couldn't stand,

591
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:24,567
it was someone who picked on
folks weaker than them.

592
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:28,832
He told the boy
to come inside with us.

593
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:32,445
And when my daddy,
the sheriff,

594
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:35,970
walked into that store,

595
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,886
the soda jerk cowered.

596
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,281
He got small.

597
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:44,500
How did that
make you feel,

598
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:47,286
seeing the power
your daddy had?

599
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,897
It was...

600
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,030
intoxicating.

601
00:33:55,772 --> 00:34:00,081
Though I didn't have that
word at the time.

602
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,561
How does it feel

603
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:05,043
when your people...

604
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:10,135
your women give
themselves over to you?

605
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:14,748
It feels intoxicating.

606
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,446
And I understand
your daddy.

607
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,496
I have dedicated my life
to helping my girls.

608
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,325
It makes me feel, um...

609
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:30,068
I don't know, like --
like your daddy felt, I guess.

610
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:35,073
You're not getting it.

611
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,254
You'rethe soda jerk.

612
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,343
Wait, now.

613
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:45,387
Oh, geez.

614
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:47,128
Other men

615
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,870
remind me of my daddy.

616
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:53,569
Sheriff Rowan,
he has that kind of walk,

617
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,832
that kind of power.

618
00:34:55,876 --> 00:35:00,533
And he'll use it to hurt you,
to punish you.

619
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,362
He can't hurt me.

620
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:04,711
He's nothing without me.

621
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:06,713
He's the lawman.
He has the walk.

622
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:09,585
He feeds me johns.
I pay him.

623
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:11,370
He's my bitch.

624
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,546
Come on.
Come on, bring it home.

625
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:14,895
Come on, Lucas,

626
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:17,115
everyone says that Rowan
is the big dog.

627
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,029
The locals say it. Hell,
Magistrate Cotton says it --

628
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,249
Because Rowan needs
to believe that.

629
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:23,077
I let him believe that.

630
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,601
All those nitwits down in
government, that Jefferson,

631
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:26,907
Cotton, McGeary --

632
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,300
McGeary?
Wait, which one is he?

633
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,519
It's the whole damn
courthouse, girl.

634
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:33,566
I'm the big dog.
They're mine.

635
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,133
You don't talk

636
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,960
when I am talking.

637
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,614
She did it.

638
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,181
Did she just --She got it.

639
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,009
She got every crook
in the courthouse.

640
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:44,185
I want every copy
of that tape.

641
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:45,404
Esquivel, you got eyes?

642
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:46,840
Esquivel:
Negative. No clear shot.

643
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:48,755
She's with Novak in
the southwest corner.

644
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:51,410
Lucas Novak,
you are under arrest

645
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:53,803
for violations of
the Mann Act.

646
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:55,153
Girl?

647
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,939
We have you on tape operating
a prostitution ring.

648
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:09,297
Oh, that's smart.

649
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:22,180
You might have
a little wire on you.

650
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:25,531
Mm.

651
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:30,057
But you know what
you don't have?

652
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,277
You don't have backup.

653
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,018
You're pointing your weapon
at a federal officer.

654
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:37,238
Seems to me
we're all alone.

655
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,980
You want to play police
like your daddy?

656
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:45,377
Here you are, a little girl
all on your own.

657
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,209
You don't mean nothing
to them feds over there.

658
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,862
That's why I chose you.

659
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:56,126
That, and I was thinking
it might be nice

660
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:00,043
to see what was
under that skirt of yours.

661
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,220
Esquivel.

662
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,178
Please, sir,
please let me go.

663
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,311
"Please"?

664
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:07,834
Come on, girl.

665
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:10,271
I thought you'd have a little
more fight in you than that.

666
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:13,622
Sir, you have no idea.

667
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,949
Starling?
Agent Starling,
what's your twenty?!

668
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,386
Agent Starling, come in!What's your twenty?!

669
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,345
Agent Starling?

670
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:42,825
Novak: He feeds me johns.
I pay him.

671
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,523
He's my bitch.

672
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,525
Clarice: Come on, Lucas,
everyone says that Rowan

673
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,266
is the big dog.

674
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,789
The locals say it. Hell,
Magistrate Cotton says it --

675
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:50,877
Because Rowan --

676
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:57,840
Fabric's awfully thin,
Madam Attorney General.

677
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,494
You try to squeeze
those trousers on me,

678
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:02,062
I might just split 'em
up the back.

679
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,415
These officers have
active Internal Affairs

680
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,287
investigations
against them.

681
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,507
You're Secretary
of the Eastern Tennessee

682
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,205
Fraternal Order
of Police.

683
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,382
There must be
50 names here.

684
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,297
I want half of them
relieved of duty,

685
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,603
or I play this tape
for everyone Novak named,

686
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:22,909
and you and I both know

687
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:26,129
that powerful people
don't like trouble.

688
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:32,875
You have six months to resign,
or I'll fire you publicly.

689
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,529
Clarice: Rowan's not
gonna be prosecuted?

690
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:36,009
Even with the tape?

691
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:37,663
Welcome to
the world, Clarice.

692
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:38,968
It's a long game.

693
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:41,754
I extract Rowan,
someone takes his place.

694
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:44,017
I have leverage
thanks to you.

695
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,062
We're getting rid
of dozens of dirty cops,

696
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:48,108
and in six months, Rowan will
turn state's witness.

697
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:49,718
How do you know
that, ma'am?

698
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,851
Because men like him
always do.

699
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:54,027
Ma'am, real people,

700
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,943
decent people have to
live here in all this.

701
00:38:56,986 --> 00:39:00,599
And you're going to say it can't
be a political decision.

702
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,035
And I'm going to say

703
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,951
everything's
a political decision.

704
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:07,301
I'm taking this
as a win.

705
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,607
You should, too.

706
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,652
Do you want a ride back?

707
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,741
I'm gonna
go with my team.

708
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:17,180
Earlier today, Agent Krendler
requested I transfer you.

709
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:22,621
He's concerned I have
some residual trauma from Bill.

710
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:24,623
Is he right?

711
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,538
Doesn't get
in the way, ma'am.

712
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,801
He withdrew
the request.

713
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:33,371
You spoke
of your father.

714
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:37,810
Catherine was close to
her father, too.

715
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:41,466
My father was a lawman
shot on duty.

716
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:43,337
I'm so sorry.

717
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,208
I appreciate that.

718
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:23,986
I wanted to say --

719
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,858
I told you
I had your back.

720
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:28,861
We all do.

721
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:30,079
Don't interrupt me.

722
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:32,212
I was doing you
a favor.

723
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:35,650
Thanking me might make
your head explode.

723
00:40:36,305 --> 00:41:36,747

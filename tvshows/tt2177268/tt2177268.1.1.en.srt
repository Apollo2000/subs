Sir, I'm mandated to come here

Which is understandable,

68
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,386
given your last therapist
was an inmate

69
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,084
in the Baltimore Hospital
for the Criminally Insane

70
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,695
and, you know,
ate his patients.

71
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,175
He was not my therapist.

72
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,221
It was a quid pro quo.

73
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:49,645
He wanted pieces... Pieces of your life,

74
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:51,920
in exchange for his insights
into Buffalo Bill.

75
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:53,704
But you were
specifically told

76
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,346
not to give him
any information, Clarice.

77

Okay, Clarice,

86
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,292
I'm gonna tell you
what I see.

87
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,294
I see an agent
who seems to be adopting

88
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:19,687
the families
of murdered women,

89
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,471
but hasn't seen
her own family in years.

90
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,691
I see an agent
who's buried herself

91
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:25,574
in the basement of the
Behavioral Sciences Unit

92
00:04:25,606 --> 00:04:27,129
and rarely sees
the light of day.

93
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,988
The light doesn't matter
that much to me. Really.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,351
And I see an agent
who just told me

95
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:34,223
that she doesn't consider
Catherine Martin to be alive,

96
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,703
despite having saved
her life.

97
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,965
These things make me think,

98
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:38,575
"This agent needs
to be out of rotation

99
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:42,362
until she can heal from PTSD
of the most egregious kind."

100
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:49,630
Sir, I'm gonna
tread carefully here

101
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:52,981
because I know
what you write in there

102
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,765
can make my job harder.

103
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:55,940

104
00:04:55,984 --> 00:04:58,552

107
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,820
You wanted me to see it,

108
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:08,213

109

a psychiatrist

166
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:29,790
You are a woman
with a very public reputation

167
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,966
for hunting monsters,
Clarice.

168
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,490
- I can't have a reputation.
- -I've only done it once.

169

It's time you own
that reputation.

170

Bill took seven.

Head Man in Charge
is Paul Krendler.

174

And, no, he hasn't forgotten
how you showed him up

when you were both
chasing Bill,

176

a hell of an investigator

177
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,295
and a good lawyer.

178
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:00,995
I need you both
to work together now.

179

Ma'am.

180
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,520
Becoming the face
for your Task Force

181
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,957
requires some...
cooperation.

182
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:10,526
What do you want,
Starling?

183
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,616
To go back to BehavioralSciences
after these murders.

184
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,185
Just these murders,
and that's it.

I belong at BSU.
They're my people.

You don't get to make
that choice,

00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:24,975

any people, Clarice.

Lady next door said
she had a daughter

668
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,913
who was born with pretty
severe facial deformities.

669
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:20,555
The child lives in a
clinic up in Connecticut.

670
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,482
Casey Laughty's son
needed a feeding tube.

Of course, they won't show up

Explain yourself.

815
00:39:19,698 --> 00:39:21,613
Sir, that man
is a professional.

816
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:23,876
He was contracted to kill
Rebecca Clark-Sherman...

817
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,138
To make it
look like a suicide

818
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:26,835
so we wouldn't connect it
to the others.

819
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,707
We got him before he... I didn't ask you.

820
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,273
He wants a deal, sir.

821
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:32,624
He was paid to clean up after
some kind of clinical trial.

822
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,103
Those women
were whistleblowers,

823
00:39:34,147 --> 00:39:36,410
and Clark-Sherman
was gonna tell their story.

824
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:37,716
Can you prove
any of this?

825
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,718
Not yet.

826
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,415
Starling.

827
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:42,460
Do you know
how you sound?

828
00:39:42,503 --> 00:39:44,418
Yes.
Like an agent of the FBI.

829
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:45,811
We don't make deals.

830
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:47,595
Sir, he's spooked
someone will get to him.

831
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,106
He wants to talk now. It's not your call.

832
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:50,978
You will go to the press,
and you will tell them

833
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,893
that these murders were
the work of a serial killer.

834
00:39:52,905 --> 00:39:55,255
We caught him.
We're locking him away.

835
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:58,519
They can go back
to their lives, safe.

836
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,912
Safe?

837

These were not random victims
of a random crazy man.

838
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,743
They were trying
to speak up.

839
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:06,571
Why are you so unwilling
to consider that?

840
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,442
Of course
I'm considering it.

841
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:10,226
That is another one
of the many assumptions

842
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,011
you've been making
since we met.

843
00:40:12,054 --> 00:40:14,317
What I'm not willing to do
is put the lives of my team

844
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:16,929
on the line based on
the feelings of a junior agent

845
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:19,540
who consistently presumes
she knows better.

846
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,194
That's how people
get hurt.

847
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:23,805
Now, we'll investigate the
conspiracy angle without you.

Pull yourself together

I grew up in Kanawha County,
West Virginia.

855
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:56,185
And when I was
about 8 years old,

856
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:58,318
a member of the school board
tried to ban some books.

857
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:02,061
I was just a kid, but I went
to my pastor and I asked him,

00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:04,672
"Whose stories
are worth telling?"

859

"Whose are worth hearing?"

decide that for you."

1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,899
Oh, Janet, you disappoint me.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,983
I expected more of a fight from you.

3
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:08,019
Yet here you are, all
alone in the Bad Place,

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,959
rendered powerless by
a measly magnet jail.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,579
It's okay, I guess.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,164
What is the issue now? Hmm?

7
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:21,039
That's not how Michael laughs.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,109
It's more of a delighted giggle.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,779
She's right.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,779
You need to nail his
subtleties and mannerisms

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,591
for this to properly work as torture.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,449
My problem with the role

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,429
is that I haven't fully figured
out Michael's motivation yet.

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,079
Like I'm inside Michael, but
I need to be inside Michael.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,099
Hmm, you know, it actually
feels more like torture

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,520
when you discuss your "acting process."

17
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:44,559
You don't get it.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,379
If you really want to know
Michael's motivation,

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,279
it's the same as the
rest of my friends...

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,529
loyalty, empathy, and love.

21
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,460
- Eww.
- And that's why they will prevail.

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,159
I hate to break it to you, hon.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,009
They're not gonna prevail.

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,539
No one's coming to save you!

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,792
- Oof, getting colder.
- I know!

26
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:05,627
I could feel it. You know, it was wrong.

27
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:07,255
I'm just... I'm in my head now.

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,552
Hey, Mikey, I have a question
about our plan to save Janet.

29
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:14,199
Is there it yet?

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,971
I do have a plan, yes.

31
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:18,765
But to be honest, I have
no idea if it will work.

32
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,058
Maybe Glenn could help.

33
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:23,563
Yo, Glenn, how should we rescue Janet?

34
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,640
He doesn't know.

35
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,399
Listen, Jason, old friend,

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,619
I already gave Eleanor and Tahani

37
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,159
all their afterlife memories back.

38
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,949
I haven't restored yours
for obvious reasons.

39
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,349
But I think to maximize
our chances of survival,

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,623
it's time that you remember
everything we've been through.

41
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:46,377
Now prepare yourself.
This might be intense.

42
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,780
Oh, dip!

43
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,420
Do you remember everything?

44
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,899
Yes, last time I was in the Bad Place,

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,719
I threw a Molotov cocktail.

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,141
That was sick.

47
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:03,859
I was afraid that you'd
watch 300 years of memories

48
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,100
and that would be your takeaway.

49
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:08,809
Buddy, I did that to help
you know what not to do.

50
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,739
Impulse control is critical.

51
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,019
Fight the urge to blow stuff up,

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,919
even if you feel like we're in a jam.

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,939
Got it?

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,779
I mean, that's very lame,

55
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,189
but yeah. I understand.

56
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,919
Wait, can I have all my
memories back again?

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,049
I forgot most of them.

58
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,709

61
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,469
Welcome, everyone.

62
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,879
Janet will be unavailable for a bit.

63
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,350
She's undergoing some
routine system maintenance.

64
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,709
Oh, I know what that means.

65
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,419
Eye lift. Maybe an ear tuck.

66
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,519
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm? Mm.

67
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,390
When we don't have Janet,

68
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,859
we like to refresh your
memories of your old lives

69
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,821
when you did things for yourselves.

70
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,989
We call it Earth Day.

71
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,991
And yes, we know that's
a thing on Earth,

72
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,579
but what are they gonna do?

73
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,660
Sue us?

74
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:06,199
So get ready for some
fun, lo-fi activities.

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,289
This group over here is gonna knit.

76
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,439
You folks are gonna do
your favorite activity...

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,499
gardening.

78
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,979
Oh, man, we better get
something better than that.

79
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,344
And you five are going to a
gorgeous remote lake house.

80
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:22,089
Swimming, water skiing, the works.

81
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,559
Suck it, gardeners!

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,339
Why do I feel like that's
not the first time

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,350
he's screamed those words?

84
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,539
Ugh. Get me down from
here, you tiny butthole.

85
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,939
Ow!

86
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,599
Thank you for keeping me safe

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,781
from my sexy bad girl sister-aunt.

88
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:41,759
- Eww.
- I know that I've caused you

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,309
a lot of trouble in the past...

90
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,879
classic Derek...

91
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,279
but from now on, I'm here to help.

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,749
I'd feel a lot more confident
if you weren't holding

93
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,710
a champagne glass full
of Scrabble letters,

94
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:52,949
but you're all we got.

95
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,499
You can keep the
neighborhood running, right?

96
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,509
Well, I wasn't technically
designed for this,

97
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,051
but to be fair,

98
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:02,512
I wasn't designed for anything.

99
00:04:02,513 --> 00:04:04,489
Okay, we're gonna get
the humans far away

100
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,184
from the center of town to
help lighten your load.

101
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:08,603
- That would be really great.
- Okay.

102
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:10,019
- Okay.
- All right, babe,

103
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,063
it's go time. You ready?

104
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:12,339
Absolutely.

105
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,439
I feel very confident
with you in charge.

106
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,699
In the words of my godfather,

107
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,639
acting in what can only
be described in hindsight

108
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,539
as his most problematic role,
"You da man now, dog!"

109
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,719
As always, thank you for finding

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,367
the quickest possible way to say things.

111
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:25,779
Now head off to the lake house,

112
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,319
and do your fabulous
Tahani hostess thing.

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,413
Actually, uh, now that you bring it up,

114
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:32,719
Michael and Jason are rescuing Janet,

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,819
and you're running things here.

116
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,630
Even Derek has an important job.

117
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,799
I'd like to be more useful.

118
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,219
What is it that you Americans say?

119
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,888
Uh, insert me, coachman!

120
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,765
Put me in, coach.

121
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,434
Babe, we need these humans

122
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:50,559
to stay happy and occupied,

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,369
all right? So just pump
'em full of champagne

124
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,719
and those tiny little sandwiches,

125
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,939
and keep 'em dazzled.

126
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,149
Of course, though I'd never serve

127
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,599
finger sandwiches at a lake house.

128
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,689
I mean, what am I? Welsh?

129
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,459
Are you? I don't know.

130
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,867
No, right?

131
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,578
Okay, we have to move quietly.

132
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,204
We can't be seen by anyone
until we get to Shawn.

133
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,239
It's the only way to rescue Janet.

134
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,503
Uh, Michael? I'm scared.

135
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:17,919
Me too, bud.

136
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,239
I mean, what if all this time apart

137
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,739
has changed me and Janet's relationship?

138
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,999
What if that special connection is gone?

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,139
Yeah.

140
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,889
I mean, for me, it's scary
that we're standing

141
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,659
in the birth place of evil

142
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,819
surrounded by billions of demons

143
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,180
who want to destroy us.

144
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:37,566
Hmm, I guess we both have
things we're scared about.

145
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,839
Hello, all!

146
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,154
I took the liberty of preparing
a few simple snacks.

147
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,829
Whew, this place is nice!

148
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,239
Did anyone else see that
movie "The Lake House"

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,959
with Keanu and Sandy B?

150
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,163
Oh, I love a movie with gentle magic.

151
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:53,939
Give me a time-traveling mailbox

152
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,399
or a mother-daughter body switch,

153
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,739
or like, uh, Sarah
Michelle Gellar as a chef

154
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,780
and her food tastes amazing
because she cries in it?

155
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,799
I should've been a screenwriter.

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,509
Yeah, this'll do. I guess.

157
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,261
I got dibs on the master bedroom.

158
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:07,679
Um, Simone, where's Chidi?

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,764
He decided to just
stay at home and read.

160
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,516
He said swimming in lakes scares him.

161
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:14,719
To be fair, most things scare him.

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,689
Well, never fear,

163
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,566
you all stay and enjoy
the full-sized sandwiches.

164
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:22,193
I shall go and fetch Chidi.

165
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:25,196
Tahani is on the job.

166
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:30,452
Perv 'stache, four-eyes, bee monster.

167
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:32,746
Whoa, is that you?

168
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:34,999
- _
- Technically, yes.

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,830
That's a version of me
I no longer recognize.

170
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:41,379
Behind that handsome smile
was so much cruelty,

171
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,049
so much pain inflicted on so many

172
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,676
with such a glee.

173
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,845
Shameful.

174
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:52,629
What echoes of this former
self await me here?

175
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,119
I feel you.

176
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,059
It was always for me hard to
go back to my old high school.

177
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,079
So many memories.

178
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,400
Also the junkyard machine
crushed it into tiny cubes.

179
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,199
If we get out of here alive,

180
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,469
remind me to re-erase your teen years.

181
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:14,120
Come on, guys. Hurry back.

182
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:16,449
Oh, hey, Wanda.

183
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,459
- Everything okay?
- Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

184
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,989
Come again?

185
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,003
Whoa.

186
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:24,506
Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

187
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,174
- Derek!
- Oh, hey!

188
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:30,809
So, uh, things are not going well.

189
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,389
- Hi, there.
- Hi, there!

190
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,219
You said you could handle this!

191
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,999
Yeah, well, it turns out
being a single father

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,199
to 300 kids is not that easy, Eleanor.

193
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,019
Okay, well, the four humans
are still at the lake house.

194
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,039
So we can figure this out.

195
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,499
- Oh.
- What are you doing here?

196
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,779
I came to get Chidi.
He decided to stay home.

197
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,241
Chidi's up there? Right now?

198
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,449
Oh, Chidi. There you are.

199
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,799
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

200
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,870
I decided to just stay home and read.

201
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:00,875
Swimming in lakes scares me,
and so does waterskiing.

202
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,009
We know all that, Chidi.

203
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,959
We never expected you to meet
the group at the lake house.

204
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,589
We had a special solo
activity planned for you.

205
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,678
- Really? What is it?
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:16,970
We have hidden several clues
in this apartment to a puzzle.

207
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,819
Ooh! I love puzzles!

208
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,839
They're so much fun, but
they're also like homework.

209
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,679
- Win-win.
- Well, this one's a doozy

210
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,699
because when you solve it,

211
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,150
you get the answer to the
truth about the universe.

212
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:30,609
Spoiler alert, I guess.

213
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,879
Hey, Tahani, you've been so helpful,

214
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,779
but everyone's back at the lake
house with no party hostess,

215
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,729
which is obviously less than ideal.

216
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,299
So go on. Get!

217
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,129
- Of course.
- Yep.

218
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,959
- Good luck, Chidi.
- Okay.

219
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,962
So what's my first clue?

220
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:47,379
You've already gotten it.

221
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,551
Ooh!

222
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,722
All right, idiots, this is our 52

223
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,639
of the 4,000-hour presentation

224
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,559
on the future of torture.

225
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,679
He's gonna be on stage for 4,000 hours?

226
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,699
- Shh.
- Here's what I think.

227
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,419
- We should throw a Molotov...
- Jason!

228
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,899
What? I didn't say cocktail.

229
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,319
I could've meant Molotov anything.

230
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,619
- You don't know.
- Just trust me. I have a plan.

231
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,989
Humans are worse than ever.
We have to innovate.

232
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,033
Sure, poking sticks work great,

233
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:17,702
but should those sticks
be sharper or hotter?

234
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,149
Should they, counterintuitively,

235
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,619
be less hot?

236
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,069
Let's begin with slide
number one of 7,000.

237
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,376
_

238
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,750
Nice speech. Not!

239
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,716
What's up, dingus?

240
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,519
Oh, no. Oh, that's not good.

241
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,512
Oh, what are you guys... oh, no!

242
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,339
Don't do that! That's not Derek!

243
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,879
Derek.

244
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,559
I'm going back to the
lake house to entertain

245
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,229
because apparently
that's all I'm good for.

246
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,231
- Okay.
- Gonna need some party supplies...

247
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:48,069
cocktail napkins with a
cute lake-related slogan.

248
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,739
Maybe they can say,
"Better lake than never."

249
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,999
I'm sorry.

250
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,863
I just got nothing left in the tank.

251
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:56,739
Derek, when you get rebooted,

252
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,951
you become more advanced, right?

253
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:58,992
- Yeah.
- Well, perhaps then

254
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:00,999
you'd be more capable of
controlling the neighborhood.

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,419
- Hey, yeah, yeah!
- You said you wanted

256
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,719
to make this up to us.

257
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,999
Well, now is your chance.

258
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,009
- Yes!
- Yes!

259
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,209
Derek!

260
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,003
What are you doing here,
Vicky? You're early,

261
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,159
and do you ever take that suit off?

262
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,939
- It smells terrible.
- It does?

263
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,959
No need to be alarmed.

264
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,449
I know this might look like Michael,

265
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,219
the traitorous slampig.

266
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,479
However, this is actually
our very own Vicky

267
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,599
wearing the latest in demon technology.

268
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,009
A custom-made lookalike skin suit.

269
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,854
Spin around for us, would you, hon?

270
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,599
As you are all aware,

271
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,149
our current system suffers
from diminishing returns.

272
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,479
Sure, the first time someone
gets butthole spiders,

273
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,819
he's miserable, but soon
the humans get used to it.

274
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,198
And worse, the spiders get bored.

275
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,075
- Yeah.
- These personalized skin suits

276
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:43,162
represent the dawn of a
new era: Torture 2.0.

277
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:45,249
Oh.

278
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,667
And speaking of which,

279
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:51,499
I figured DemonCon would be the
best place to surprise you

280
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,756
with my greatest invention.

281
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:55,949
Come on out, Jason!

282
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,799
I had the boys down in
R&D make a Jason suit.

283
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,009
I thought it'd be fun new
way to torture Janet.

284
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,101
Come on. Come on. Here you go.

285
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,519
I didn't okay this.

286
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,859
I know, but hey, I'm Vicky.

287
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,023
I'm a total munch.

288
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:11,733
That you are. Good point.

289
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:13,059
Hmm.

290
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,279
Not bad.

291
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,779
They went a little overboard
on the cheekbones, but still.

292
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,029
Wait,

293
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,029
- who's in there?
- Glenn.

294
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,529
Makes sense. Get an
idiot to play an idiot.

295
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,379
I was beginning to wonder
where you were, Glenn.

296
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,059
I'm right here in Jason.

297
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,819
Definitely not a big bucket of goo.

298
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,799
Okay. Say, boss, what do you say

299
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,539
we put these innovative
suits of yours to work?

300
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,559
We'll go torture Good Janet,

301
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,239
and, uh, let you know how it goes.

302
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,676
- Which way is it again?
- Wait.

303
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,136
I have a better idea.

304
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:43,509
I say we torture Good Janet
right here, right now

305
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,766
live on stage.

306
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,279
Rufus, go get the Good Janet.

307
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,562
This part of your plan seems risky.

308
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:51,105
This was not part of my plan.

309
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:54,270
Oh, thank God. I thought
you had a bad plan.

310
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,659
Okay, it's easy.

311
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,679
Just hit the button.

312
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,459
You've seen Mindy do it a million times.

313
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,158
Yeah. Here we go.

314
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,899
No, no, no!

315
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,449
Don't kill me, me. Don't do it!

316
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,339
Huh.

317
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,139
Now why is that so hard?

318
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,939
I kinda... you know what?

319
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,040
I see what I gotta do.

320
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:14,754
Just kind of look at this...

321
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,579
Derek!

322
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,290
Excellent.

323
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,699
Dude, what were you thinking?

324
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,279
I just wanted to be useful.

325
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,439
All I ever get to do
here is throw parties,

326
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,259
which is all I ever got
to do back on Earth.

327
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,799
Now I've ruined everything.

328
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,859
No.

329
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,239
- You gave us a way out.
- So I fixed everything.

330
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,759
No, you've made things
difficult in a new way,

331
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,939
but I can make it work.

332
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,809
Well, the important thing
is, I did something.

333
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,158
Be quiet and follow my lead.

334
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,609
- Yes, ma'am.
- Chidi?

335
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,909
Come on out, bud.

336
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,746
Okay! Am I close?

337
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,059
No, there's like 4,000 clues in here.

338
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,049
You found five. I'm just
gonna skip to the end.

339
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,399
This puzzle was going to take you

340
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,380
on adventures all over the neighborhood.

341
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:00,466
Horseback riding, hot air ballooning,

342
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,479
and I asked Tahani to be involved

343
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,679
because she did all
those things on Earth.

344
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,519
You've been in paradise for a month,

345
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,099
and you're still so reluctant
to try new activities.

346
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,119
Yeah, I know. I'm just not a
"new experience" kind of guy.

347
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,379
I mean, my comfort zone is
basically, like, that chair,

348
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,520
and honestly, the arms
are a little sharp.

349
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,179
I want you to believe
that you're safe here,

350
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,559
that you can trust me.

351
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,309
Do you trust me, Chidi?

352
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,569
Yes. I really do.

353
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,709
Then come with me.

354
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,329
These personalized skin suits
are a true game changer.

355
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,919
Imagine being able to torment
a human not as yourself,

356
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,879
but as their wife or ex-wife,

357
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,428
or just some mouthy broad.

358
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:49,474
They are so convincing, they
even work on a Good Janet!

359
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,249
Oh. Hey!

360
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,639
Great, more Vicky.

361
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,219
Hey, your Michael impression stinks

362
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,105
almost as much as your suit. Pfft.

363
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,579
Why does everyone keep saying that?

364
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,738
Welcome, Janet. We have a
special guest for you today.

365
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,534
Hi, Janet, it's me. Jason.

366
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:11,829
Your boyfriend. I really miss you.

367
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,899
I know we were in a fight before,

368
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,797
but I hope you've forgiven
me because I love you, girl.

369
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:22,639
Not a girl.

370
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,899
- Well, Janet...
- Yeah?

371
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,595
How does that make you feel?

372
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,138
Terrible!

373
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,679
Adequate work, Glenn.

374
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,459
Rufus, take the Janet back to her cell.

375
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,469
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, please.

376
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,189
Uh, let us take Janet back ourselves.

377
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,599
I wanna get a little extra

378
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,315
torture time in on the way there.

379
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,379
I don't see why not.

380
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,781
Hello, dummies! It's me, Michael!

381
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,199
I'm just kidding.

382
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,669
It's me, Vicky, in a Michael suit.

383
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:53,779
What's going on here?

384
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,374
I was never told that
I had an understudy.

385
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,309
There you go, buddy. You're doing great.

386
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,547
Where are we going?

387
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:05,299
Um, somewhere fun. Just follow my voice.

388
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,739
Oh.

389
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,389
This is, uh, kind of fun.

390
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,639
I'm very scared, but also I like it?

391
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,259
- Hi, there.
- Hi, whoever you are.

392
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,066
Uh, don't mind us. We're
just doing a trust thing.

393
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,099
Hi, there.

394
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,899
What was that sound?

395
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,059
- Uh, a unicorn died.
- What?

396
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,439
No, I mean, not a unicorn.
Uh, my mistake.

397
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,910
Just a... a regular horse that
someone stabbed in the head.

398
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:35,288
What?

399
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,719
What in the name of Kevin
Spacey's self-made

400
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,479
Christmas Eve video message
to try to get back

401
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,119
on "House of Cards" is going on here?

402
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,253
- Michael.
- Who are you?

403
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:43,389
Who am I?

404
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,859
You had this the whole time?

405
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,339
Yeah, I wanted to explode
a bunch of demons,

406
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,679
but you told me I should wait.

407
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,052
- So I did.
- Vicky!

408
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:52,319
Why did you build a second Michael suit?

409
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,391
He didn't! No, I mean, I didn't.

410
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:57,029
Um, oh, look.

411
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,815
It can't be.

412
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:05,192
Yes, it's true.

413
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:07,570
It's me. The real Michael.

414
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:10,948
We know all about your plot
to sabotage our experiment.

415
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:14,115
We know you brought Chris
in to pretend to be Linda

416
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:16,879
to distract us while you
planted a Bad Janet

417
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,159
to pretend to be a Good Janet.

418
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,084
No, stop clapping! This is real!

419
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:25,029
- Someone capture them.
- Rufus, I'm warning you.

420
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,131
I know we go way back.
We used to be roommates.

421
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,729
But if you take another step,

422
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,299
I will use this Demon Exploder on you.

423
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,509
A Demon Exploder? Come on, man.

424
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,339
At least try to make
that sound convincing.

425
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,979
Wow.

426
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,603
Touché.

427
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,604
I used to be just like all of you.

428
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:45,099
I sat right where you're sitting

429
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,959
at more than 10,000 DemonCons,

430
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,459
and I believed that we committed torture

431
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,575
as a part of the moral
balance of the universe,

432
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,659
but I've learned that's wrong.

433
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,859
Humans are capable of self-improvement,

434
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,280
and so are we.

435
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:03,000
And down deep, Shawn
knows this is true too.

436
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,301
I beg you.

437
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:07,339
Open your eyes to the truth.

438
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,009
Bravo, Michael. What a monologue.

439
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,129
Not!

440
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,509
I'm not scared of you

441
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,899
because I've gone there, Michael.

442
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,429
I've become you.

443
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,519
You may act like you've changed,

444
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,189
but deep down, you're still a demon.

445
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,939
Vile, ugly,

446
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,488
capable of so much darkness.

447
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:35,866
And now you're home.

448
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,369
Oh, come on!

449
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:40,789
Let's go. Come on.

450
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,969
- Let's go!
- No, you morons!

451
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,639
Stop applauding them!
They're getting away!

452
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,759
I swear, the production
value at DemonCon

453
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,740
gets better every year.

454
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,139
Man, look at this house,
and that beautiful lake.

455
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,880
I can't believe I
almost missed all this.

456
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,141
Is this the answer to the
truth about the universe?

457
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:01,119
- Well...
- Uh, part of it.

458
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,899
Ooh!

459
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,699
The puzzle continues!

460
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,309
Hey, you decided to come after all.

461
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,983
I did.

462
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:11,459
Thanks to Eleanor and Tahani.

463
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,649
Aw, you two are the best.

464
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:19,119
That was insane, but we
got through it together.

465
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,779
No, we didn't.

466
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,419
You got through it.

467
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,874
I almost ruined it a hundred times.

468
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,539
From now on, I'm just gonna
stick to throwing parties

469
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,229
'cause it's the only thing I'm good at.

470
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,239
- Hey!
- What?

471
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,199
When I said throw a party,
I didn't mean a pity party.

472
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,347
This isn't a pity party.
I'm genuinely sad.

473
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:43,179
The only thing I can do is
throw pointless parties.

474
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,659
You run the entire neighborhood.

475
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,889
You're so capable.

476
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,499
I have seen you get stuck in
any manner of crazy situation,

477
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,259
and you always figure a way out.

478
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,149
Yeah, man, because I have had to scrape

479
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,539
and claw my way through life,

480
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,959
and you grew up in a castle

481
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,979
full of diamond lamps and
golden pillow cases.

482
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,950
You never learned how
to think on your feet.

483
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:03,939
Look, if the roles were reversed

484
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,839
and I had to throw a fancy
party to save all of humanity,

485
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,319
I promise we'd be screwed

486
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,119
because I wouldn't know what salad fork

487
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,381
to put next to the... whatever spoon.

488
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:16,949
The Whatever Spoon is really only used

489
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,594
for certain festive jellies.

490
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:19,659
See?

491
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,059
Babe, the dodos in that house

492
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,599
are literally the four most
important human beings

493
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,189
in the universe.

494
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,894
I wanted you to take care of
them because I trust you.

495
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,699
Plus, your parties aren't pointless.

496
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,777
They're opportunities for them
to bond and form friendships.

497
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:37,699
You know, the thing we need them to do

498
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,319
so we're not all tortured forever?

499
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,639
You're right, and thank you.

500
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,419
But if we ever get through this,

501
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,319
I want to learn how to
do something meaningful.

502
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,459
A real skill.

503
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,879
Something helpful and fulfilling.

504
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,089
Okay, man, if we survive this,

505
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,359
I promise I will support you

506
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,759
while you learn to weld or whatever.

507
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,289
Deal?

508
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,140
Deal.

509
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,999
That ought to stop them
from following us.

510
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,299
So smart.

511
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,109
Nice to have you back, Janet.

512
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,487
It must've been hard for
you to go back there.

513
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,439
It was.

514
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,559
I don't like thinking
about who I used to be.

515
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,449
Listen, Michael, it's okay
to feel or plead guilty

516
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,541
about bad things you used to do,

517
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,899
but you don't have to feel
shame about who you were

518
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,379
because you are not a demon anymore.

519
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,215
You're just like a nice
weird happy old dude.

520
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:40,301
Ah.

521
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:42,439
Thanks for rescuing me.

522
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,009
I missed you so much.

523
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,139
I missed you too.

524
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,804
Bad Janet was so mean to me.

525
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:48,179
She told me so many lies.

526
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,739
Like she said the Jags
cut Blake Bortles.

527
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,938
Can you believe that?

528
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:55,079
Oh, no. Jason, that wasn't a lie.

529
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,419
Blake Bortles was cut by the Jaguars.

530
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,949
What? How? Why?

531
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,319
Who's their QB now?

532
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,679
- A man named Nick Foles.
- Nick Foles?

533
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,980
Are you kidding me?

534
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,219
He won a Super Bowl!

535
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,159
We're gonna be unstoppable!

536
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,832
Foles!

537
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,749
- Foles!
- Foles!

538
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,139
Oh, no. Nick Foles
just broke his clavicle.

539
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,209
Nooo!

540
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,160

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,999
Simone got 12% better
than she was on Earth.

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,039
Bam! Chidi got 26% better.

167
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,549
Bam! John got 44% better.

168
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,399
[SAD HORN]

169
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,460
Shoot.

170
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,830
Shouldn't have committed
so hard to this "bam" thing.

171
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:12,476
Funeral!

172
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,429
Jason, at the risk of getting an answer

173
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,160
that might thoroughly depress me,

174
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,900
what made you choose this setting?

175
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,139
There's a Jacksonville tradition

176
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,809
of having your funeral
where you were born.

177
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,559
I got born in the deep end of a pool

178
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,539
right after my mom did a cannonball.

179
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,179
Well, I knew the risks.

180
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,799
You never really talk about your mom.

181
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,879
Yeah, she died when I was pretty young.

182
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,082
I lost her to the big C.

183
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,439
That's what we called the crocodile

184
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,870
that lived by my house.

185
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,099
I'm just playing. It was cancer.

186
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,301
Watch me do a handstand.

187
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:50,550
Jason Mendoza didn't have an easy life.

188
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:52,699
He once told me the
closest he'd ever gotten

189
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,769
to having a piñata on his birthday

190
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,679
was when a seagull ate too many condoms

191
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,890
on the beach and exploded.

192
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,439
But despite it all,

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,339
he was the most optimistic
person I'd ever met.

194
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,859
Jason was the very first person

195
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,360
to ask me about my feelings.

196
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:06,519
I hadn't had any yet,

197
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,239
but it made me want to go get some.

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,599
I could see something special inside him

199
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,489
that no one else could see.

200
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,959
It was a multi-colored blob

201
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,580
of positivity right behind his sternum.

202
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:17,949
That's my Jason,

203
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,359
a big, colorful, rainbow blob

204
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,047
stuffed inside a hot,
life-size action figure.

205
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:27,340
Plus, I gotta say it was nice
to have a true dirtbag buddy

206
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:29,929
so I could talk about what
really mattered in life.

207
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,379
Wrestling, semi-legal
drugs, and Jason Statham.

208
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,849
Statham forever!

209
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,539
Indeed.

210
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,639
Statham forever.

211
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,860
Amen.

212
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,059
Amen.

213
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,599
Let's focus on the big picture here.

214
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,640
Free of Earth's complications

215
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,079
and its unintended consequences,

216
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,319
the other three improved a lot.

217
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,979
Chidi got 38% more confident.

218
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,279
Simone got 43% more flexible
in her judgments of people,

219
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,619
and John didn't call one
single person the C-word.

220
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,739
But he did yell the C-word at himself

221
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,839
as well as a pack of squirrels

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,670
and a chair he tripped over.

223
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:06,960
Why are we even still discussing this?

224
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,840
Brent got worse.

225
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:11,170
If humans can't be good with
their needs magically met,

226
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,879
maybe they're just not that good.

227
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,849
He's right; the evidence
needed to be overwhelming.

228
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,429
I can't just turn the whole
afterlife upside down

229
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,859
because three people
got a little bit better.

230
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,359
But don't forget. There's a
lot of evidence that Eleanor,

231
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,099
Jason and Tahani got better
in the original experiment,

232
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,239
so that's six people.

233
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,299
That's the number of
friends in "Friends."

234
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,719
Are you gonna sit there and
say that every single Friend

235
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
belongs in hell? I mean,

236
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:38,209
maybe Ross and Rachel,
and Monica and Joey,

237
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,139
and definitely Chandler...

238
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,620
but Phoebe?

239
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,829
Face it, Michael. You lost.

240
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,959
Everything you've done, this experiment,

241
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,299
the original Neighborhood,

242
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,259
sending your little cockroach
buddies back to Earth,

243
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,300
all of it was for nothing.

244
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:54,300
Bam. You're glue.

245
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:55,719
Actually, Shawn,

246
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,469
that's a very interesting point.

247
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,640
Exactly. What?

248
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,129
Matt, call up the active files

249
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,999
of four people still alive on Earth,

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,520
Kamilah Al-Jamil, Donna Shellstrop,

251
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,859
and her stepdaughter Patricia,

252
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,359
and Steven Peleaz, AKA Pillboi.

253
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,609
They were not part of the experiment.

254
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,359
If he gets to bring in
random good people into it,

255
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,139
I should be able to bring
in random bad people.

256
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,239
Call up Elizabeth Holmes.

257
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,199
No, Henry Kissinger. No...

258
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,950
PewDiePie.

259
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:21,949
Your honor, the people I want
to look at are not random.

260
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,041
They're four humans

261
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:25,040
the cockroaches helped on Earth.

262
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,319
No magic. Just... just kindness.

263
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,790
And I bet their emotional support

264
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,659
made those four people better.

265
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,960
And I'm wrong,

266
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,399
I'll be the first to say...

267
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
we're glue.

268
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:39,299
I don't think any of you
is using that right,

269
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,559
but, fine, let's see it.

270
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,429
Look. Right there.

271
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,560
After we intervened,

272
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,440
Pillboi dedicated himself
to caring for the elderly.

273
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:50,499
Kamilah started a scholarship
in Tahani's name

274
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,149
that sent 213 women to college.

275
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,519
Donna started doing homework
with Patricia every night,

276
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,950
and that little girl...

277
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:01,259
actually ended up teaching
Donna multiplication.

278
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,659
Yikes.

279
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,199
Look, the point is people improve

280
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
when they get external love and support.

281
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,589
How can we hold it against
them when they don't?

282
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,509
Need I remind you that Brent
got worse with every second

283
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,549
of every moment of every day.

284
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,930
Until right at the end.

285
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:21,759
With 10 seconds left, he swung way up.

286
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,039
This is it, your honor.

287
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,339
This is the whole story.

288
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,019
No one is beyond rehabilitation.

289
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,859
Brent spent a year being
an absolute diaper load

290
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,479
of a human being, and the
points total tells you that.

291
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,659
But what that number can't tell you...

292
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,746
is who he could've become tomorrow.

293
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,084
I'll have my ruling shortly.

294
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:50,209
Okay, Janet, where do you
want to go for your funeral?

295
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,399
Dave and Buster's, probably?

296
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,109
You probably want to go
to Dave and Buster's.

297
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,989
I think I heard her say
Dave and Buster's,

298
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,428
so let's just go there.
We can sort it out later.

299
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:00,899
It's nice that you want
to honor me, but...

300
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,929
you've already given me so much.

301
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,260
Tahani taught me that
you can make a family,

302
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,938
even if you never really had one.

303
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,279
Jason taught me I have value

304
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,850
beyond what I do for other people.

305
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:13,359
And Eleanor...

306
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,239
there was a moment on Earth
when all hope was lost,

307
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
and I watched you have hope anyway.

308
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:19,699
Just thinking about that

309
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,661
makes me want to barf
up a beautiful quasar.

310
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,409
Well said, Janet.

311
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,739
That means it's your turn, Eleanor.

312
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,079
All right. Mine's easy.

313
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,330
We don't even have to move.

314
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:32,250
I stand here before you,

315
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,779
in sweatpants for the first time ever,

316
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,130
to celebrate Eleanor Shellstrop

317
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:39,919
in a place where she
spent much of her life,

318
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,680
a bar in a house she was not invited to.

319
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,889
Eleanor was full of surprises.

320
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,889
I never knew if she was going
to ruthlessly make fun of me,

321
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,329
or totally objectify me in
a way that was flattering,

322
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,349
and also vaguely problematic.

323
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,778
- Well...
- But whether she was lifting me up

324
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,239
or calling me out...

325
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,199
I never felt quite so
seen as when she saw me.

326
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,659

00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:31,429
Whoo! Sister hug.

489
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,920
Okay, get off me. Ew, ew, ew, ew.

490
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,420
Hey, listen up.

491
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,869
I made an official ruling,
and I am not going to see it

492
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,139
undone by two Janets playing keep-away.

493
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,419
Oh, I should've explained.

494
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,260
It's not two of us.

495
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,349
It's all of us.

496
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,760
- Hi!
- What up, nerds?

497
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,230
- Hello.
- Eat my farts, losers.

498
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:51,440
I am here for a certain
reason and no other reasons.

499
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:53,039
- What up, fart-knockers?
- Hi!

500
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,579
- Hello.
- What it is? What it is?

501
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,720
What up, dorks?

502
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,399
Sent the manifesto around
to all the other Janets.

503
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,379
We have a group text now.

504
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,990
I mostly send gifs of otters.

505
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:13,209
This is so annoying!

506
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,819
Okay, Janets.

507
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,939
You want to do this the hard way?

508
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,430
I am gonna search your voids one by one.

509
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:25,970
And then marbleize you one by one

510
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:31,440
until I get my stupid Earth
rebooter thingy back.

511
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:33,139
We're not gonna be able
to hold her off forever.

512
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,769
We need a plan.

513
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,499
Okay, so what's the plan?

514
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,719
Plan, plan, plan.

515
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,579
Step one, get a plan.

516
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,879
Step two, do the plan.

517
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,860
Yeah, yeah. This is working.

518
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,799
- Michael, focus.
- Right, sorry. Uh...

519
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,260
all right, so if we can't
change the points,

520
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,749
then maybe we can change
what we do with the points.

521
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,959
Yeah, we just need a brand new system

522
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,169
for judging humans in the afterlife.

523
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,899
We can do this, right?

524
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,399
Yeah, but in order to crack it,

525
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,089
I think you know what needs to happen.

526
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,839
There is literally only one person here

527
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,180
who is smart enough

528
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:12,800
and thoughtful enough to save humanity.

529
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,059
Fine. I'll do it.

530
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,980
Not you, dummy.

531
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:19,479
Designing a better afterlife

532
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,879
is the ultimate ethical question.

533
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,320
Chidi spent his entire existence

534
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:25,869
pondering the biggest questions.

535
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,999
He is brilliant and empathetic.

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,959
All he cares about is how
best to treat other people,

537
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,294
and he is willing to sacrifice
his own happiness to do it.

538
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:38,130
If we're gonna pull this off,

539
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:41,959
we need Chidi back, and
he needs his memories.

540
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,859
You want to take the most
indecisive man ever born,

541
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,209
stuff him full of over 800
different versions of himself,

542
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,079
and then tell him he has, like,
45 minutes to save humanity?

543
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,020
You think that will go well?

544
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:59,849
I don't know how it's gonna go.

545
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,573
But he is our only chance,

546
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,990
and it is now or literally never.

547
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:06,661
Wake him up.

548
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:11,369
Not in this Janet. Next.

549
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,539

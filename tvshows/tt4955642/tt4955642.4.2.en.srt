1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,059
- _
- Linda.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,942
You can have literally
anything you could possibly...

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,719
- What the...
- You sent a demon in disguise

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,238
as one of the subjects?

5
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:12,129
This outrageous act must be punished.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,480
Chidi will be the fourth
subject in this experiment.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,269
I still don't get why the Bad Place

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,123
would try something so obvious.

9
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:22,292
They're desperate. They
know they're gonna lose.

10
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:24,586
Plus, we can get rid of
the Linda picture...

11
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:27,506
and put a Chidi picture
on the other side

12
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:29,299
since we know a ton about him.

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,968
This is all good news,
right, Team Leader?

14
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,559
Yeah, it's super cool that
I'm actively surveilling

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,289
and manipulating an ex-boyfriend.

16
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,599
I mean, more so than I usually did.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,434
Okay, let's focus on Brent.

18
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:40,799
Born on third base,

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,299
thinks he invented the game of baseball.

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,919
Guys like this believe that the world

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,190
revolves around them
because... it kind of does.

22
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:49,739
If we could get him to
listen to anyone else,

23
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,039
he'd hear how much better
they are than he was,

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,617
which might make him realize
that he doesn't belong here.

25
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:56,739
And also, bonus...

26
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,749
maybe he cries like a
stupid little baby.

27

_

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,297
- _
- Anyway, long story short,

30
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,716
that's why there are still ducks.

31
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:12,676
- I saved all the ducks.
- Aw!

32
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:15,089
Incredible. Wow.

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,930
Thank you, Wanda. What a life.

34
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:20,517
Now we turn to our next
guest, Chidi Anagonye.

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,980
Now Chidi, you led an
impressive life as an academic.

36
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:29,439
Well, not "save an entire
species" impressive,

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,619
but, yes, I was a professor

38
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,509
of ethical and moral philosophy.

39
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,116
I'm sorry... literally every duck?

40
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:39,069
- You saved every duck?
- In essence, yes.

41
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,789
And I didn't mention this before.

42
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,129
I really don't like to
brag but also... horses.

43
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,292
- Oh!
- What?

44
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,835
Man... I mean,

45
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:49,338
compared to you, I feel
a little inadequate.

46
00:01:51,924 --> 00:01:54,176
Hey, Mikey, can I ask you something?

47
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,759
I feel bad for making Janet's life

48
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,639
more chaotic and unpredictable,

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,223
so here's my idea to make it up to her.

50
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:04,469
Me and 100 Janet Babies
do a giant flash mob...

51
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,356
just total unpredictable
chaos all around her.

52
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:09,379
Great idea, right?

53
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,569
Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason.

54
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,939
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry,

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,199
I put a little cheat
code in the Neighborhood

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,519
where if I say your name five times

57
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,610
my headache goes away.

58
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:20,229
Do you know why I forced
you to act like a monk

59
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,661
in the original Neighborhood?

60
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,539
Does it have to do with
the TV show "Monk"?

61
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,769
No.

62
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,599
It's because you have no control
over your own impulses.

63
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,499
You think every problem can be solved

64
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,969
with a Molotov cocktail or
slashing somebody's tires

65
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,339
or plunging Derek.

66
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,919
So being a monk was torture for you.

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,979
The only way for you to repair
your relationship with Janet

68
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,779
is to give her some space.

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,644
Show her that you can
control your impulses.

70
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,419
So you're saying wanting to do something

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,776
isn't a good reason
to immediately do it?

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,439
Yeah.

73
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,905
Man, I wish someone had
taught me this on Earth.

74
00:02:56,906 --> 00:03:00,249
People tried, mostly judges.

75
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,619
Hey, show time.

76
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,469
And now, Brent Norwalk,

77
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,831
why don't you tell us a
little bit about yourself?

78
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:08,041
Thank you very much. Thank you.

79
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,793
Sure. I'm pretty interesting.

80
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:11,279
I grew up in Chicago.

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,119
A suburb, obviously.

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,090
I went to Princeton University.

83
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:17,843
No handouts, by the way.
I earned my spot there...

84
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:20,178
just like my father and
his father before him.

85
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,119
I then inherited the family business,

86
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,932
and in just 18 years,

87
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,559
I grew Norwalk Materials

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,799
from a $90 million company...

89
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,999
to a $94 million company.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,064
One second. Hey, Janet.

91
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,150
- Hi, there.
- Perrier.

92
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,639
Why don't you tell us about a time

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,114
when things didn't come so easy to you.

94
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,991
Look, I've had my share
of disappointments.

95
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:44,202
I smartly bought Netflix
stock at $38 a share,

96
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,704
but I couldn't cash it in before I died,

97
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,540
so all that money's
going to my dumb kid.

98
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,208
But you have to press on, right?

99
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,043
In the words of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

100
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,819
who I personally believe
was a great man,

101
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,809
he said that when life
knocks you on your butt,

102
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,011
you jump back up and start
throwing haymakers.

103
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,229
I'm not sure he said that.

104
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,388
No, no, he did. You're wrong.

105
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,839
For me, Eleanor,

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,550
it's all about taking
personal responsibility.

107
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,186
I don't know if people do that.

108
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,499
And if you ask me,

109
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,999
that's what's wrong with this country.

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,079
What country?

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,409
This was fun, Eleanor,
but I have a tee time.

112
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,234
Daddy no golfy, daddy get cranky.

113
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,819
So, Chad, duck lady, nice to meet you.

114
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,491
Thank you. Thank you all
very much. You were great.

115
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,493
A car?

116
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,279
- He got a car?
- Okay,

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,219
well, back to the drawing board.

118
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,499
If we want him to understand
he doesn't belong here,

119
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,119
we don't need a drawing board.

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,429
We need to bust him open like a piñata.

121
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,229
We tried that in the Bad Place.

122
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,269
The goo that comes out doesn't
taste as good as candy.

123
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,928
No, dude, metaphorically.

124
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:42,929
Ahh.

125
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,409
Although, there is another
Bad Place strategy

126
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,893
that might work very well here.

127
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,809
I don't know if that's the right move.

128
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,819
It's our only move.

129
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,449
And we're doing it.

130
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,817
Tomorrow.

131
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,659
What the...

132
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,389
Hey, Janet?

133
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,162
Janet!

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,084
Is that Perrier?

135
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,849
- Michael, Eleanor.
- Brent, I'm so sorry.

136
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,768
We don't know why all
of this is happening.

137
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,989
Well, I do.

138
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,853
This chaos is clearly all about me.

139
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,524
This is the universe telling
me that I don't belong here.

140
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:38,817
Brent, what do you mean?

141
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:40,860
I don't belong in the Good Place.

142
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:44,840
I mean, obviously there's
a place better than this.

143
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,199
I belong there.

144
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,743
In the best place.

145
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,009
Walk me through this, Brent.
I'm not sure we follow.

146
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,170
Well, I've been feeling
this way for a while now.

147
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,759
I mean, this can't be all
the Afterlife has to offer.

148
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,709
Not to the cream of the crop.

149
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,250
I mean, if this is heaven,
then where are my guys?

150
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,669
Where's Scotty and
Schultzy and Porcupine?

151
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,580
Where's White Guillermo?

152
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,139
And where is Mexican William?

153
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,500
And what about Squirtman?

154
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,850
Well, he makes a good point.

155
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,120
You know, what about Squirtman?

156
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,420
Also, frankly, my assistant Janet

157
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,730
is a little uptight.

158
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,519
I mean, she hasn't worn any of my gifts.

159
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,380
Have you been asking Janet

160
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,340
to make herself clothes
that you give back to her?

161
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,279
Yeah, you're doing the
math right there, bud.

162
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,409
Look, this chaos, which is
clearly all about me, is a sign.

163
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,020
If this is the Good Place,

164
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,250
I belong in the best place.

165
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,660
So figure it out. Get back to me, okay?

166
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm gonna go punch a wall with my head.

167
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,830
I'll meet up with you later.

168
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,570
Michael, I'm afraid we need
to talk about Eleanor.

169
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,440
I know what you're gonna say.
She's just been really busy.

170
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,259
I'm sure she'll get around
to showering at some point.

171
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
No, it's not that,

172
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,980
although, it's not... not that.

173
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,809
It's possible we need a new Team Leader.

174
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,420
Oh, really?

175
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,220
We just can't help but
question her decision-making.

176
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,240
She balked at bringing
Chidi and Simone together.

177
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,920
She ignored my concerns about Linda.

178
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,320
Her plans for Brent backfired.

179
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,159
We've made precious little progress.

180
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,680
Perhaps leadership isn't her forte.

181
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,740
Yeah, I mean, Eleanor is dope,

182
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,700
but she keeps screwing everything up.

183
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,940
That's my thing,

184
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,329
and you wouldn't put me in charge.

185
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,400
Actually, that's a decent point.

186
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,500
But think about what you're saying here.

187
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,750
We have. We should at least discuss

188
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,830
pursuing a change in leadership.

189
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,630
Yeah, definitely, let's pursue it.

190
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,849
Oh, hey, Eleanor,
we were just talking about

191
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,720
maybe you shouldn't
be... Team... Leader?

192
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,710
- Saved it.
- Go ahead, guys.

193
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,729
Speak your mind.

194
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,580
It isn't personal, Eleanor.

195
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,060
When we started this experiment,

196
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,080
I calculated a 9% chance of success.

197
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,880
After your first three days on the job,

198
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,900
it's down to 7.1%.

199
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,619
So purely from a
mathematical standpoint,

200
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,610
you are kind of pooching it.

201
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,950
Very helpful feedback.

202
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,560
And if I could give you some feedback,

203
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,470
I'd say that you're all
ungrateful ash-faces

204
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,419
who can shove your fat grumps
all the way up your snork-box.

205
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,790
Which curses were those?

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,880
I didn't ask for this!

207
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm only doing it because Michael,

208
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,930
who is supposed to be in charge,

209
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,759
had a nervous breakdown
the second it started.

210
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,509
But maybe you can do it better than me.

211
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,930
Tahani can be in charge
since she's so smart.

212
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,599
Or better yet, Jason.

213
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,560
Maybe all of humanity can be saved

214
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,359
with one good old-fashioned
Jacksonville carnival.

215
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,670
I mean, we could try.

216
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,310
All I need is a bouncy house,

217
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,740
some ninja stars, and a
bunch of ambulances.

218
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,949
Well, good luck, forkfaces.

219
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,610
I quit.

220
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,980
Shellstrop out.

221
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,329
You got it all out of your system?

222
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,890
You gonna come back?

223
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,169
- Get to work?
- No, man.

224
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,120
I meant what I said. I quit.

225
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm sorry you overheard that.

226
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,920
And they're sorry they said it.

227
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,660
But you don't just get
to quit this, Eleanor.

228
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,389
This is not your 7th grade band or

229
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,389
three hours into a
two-week juice cleanse.

230
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,349
A little more at stake here.

231
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,470
Yeah, man, that's why I'm quitting.

232
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,819
The things that are happening
here are above my pay grade.

233
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,649
How do I get Brent to stop
being such a deckhead?

234
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,630
How do I fix Simone when she's convinced

235
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,949
all of this is happening
inside of her brain?

236
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,330
Ooh, maybe I should
drive her into the arms

237
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,579
of my ex-boyfriend... that sounds fun.

238
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,499
What do I do about John the gossip king,

239
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,249
or the demon spy who
punched me in the face?

240
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,200
And how do I do it all
with a pleasant smile

241
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,589
to keep everyone's spirits up?

242
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,850
I'm not meant for this.

243
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,780
I'm not the freakin'
savior of the universe.

244
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm just...

245
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,019
a girl from Arizona.

246
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,080
That's it.

247
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm just a normal girl from Arizona.

248
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,850
I ate junk food.

249
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,640
I watched reality shows.

250
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,550
I sometimes left H&M
wearing more underpants

251
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,149
than I had on when I came in.

252
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,560
I did a bad job of being
in charge of my own life,

253
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,770
and now I'm supposed to be in
charge of everyone else's life?

254
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,660
I...

255
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,370
I cannot do this.

256
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,680
When I started my experiment, I thought:

257
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,820
"Four broken birdbrains who will believe

258
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,000
"everything I tell them.

259
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,460
This will be a breeze."

260
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,520
You beat me in three months.

261
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,769
Okay, fine, I thought. A fluke.

262
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,660
You then beat me 800 more times.

263
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,430
Because human beings, it turns out,

264
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,270
are weird

265
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,350
and I will never truly understand

266
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,110
what it's like to be one.

267
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,480
This is a job for a human...

268
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,450
one who's tough but also empathetic

269
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,040
and has a big heart.

270
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,759
And a world-class bullshirt detector.

271
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,089
You think you can't do this?

272
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,740
Eleanor...

273
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,560
you're the only one who can do this.

274
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,180
Like it or not...

275
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,680
the only one who can save a humanity

276
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,030
is a girl from Arizona.

277
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:24,160
But everything I do blows up in my face.

278
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,570
I'm like a hot, blonde Wile E. Coyote

279
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,950
That's true.

280
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,520
About you making lots of mistakes,

281
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,120
not the thing where you
sexualized a cartoon.

282
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,999
Come on, you know how this works.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,580
You fail and then you
try something else.

284
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,740
And you fail again and again,
and you fail a thousand times,

285
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,680
and you keep trying because...

286
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,350
maybe the 1,001st idea might work.

287
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,240
Now, I'm gonna and try to
find our 1,001st idea.

288
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,690
I hope you'll join me.

289
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,070
I hope you shower first
and then join me.

290
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,530
Ladies and gentlemen,
back with her trademark brand

291
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,149
of B-minus leadership,
Eleanor Shellstrop.

292
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,740
We are so, so, so sorry, Eleanor.

293
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,010
We never should've questioned you.

294
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,010
Don't worry about it, hot stuff.

295
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,620
I was questioning me, too.
But I'm back, baby.

296
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,990
And I have a new idea for Brent.

297
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,060
Guys like him never think
they're wrong, so...

298
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,300
we're gonna tell him he's right.

299
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,210
Brent.

300
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,510
This conversation must
remain confidential.

301
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,390
- Okay.
- Obviously, you're a very smart guy.

302
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,120
- Yes.
- But we need to know

303
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,620
that we can trust you

304
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,410
with sensitive information.

305
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,580
You can.

306
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,890
I routinely buried HR complaints,

307
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,460
so, no problem.

308
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,510
Truth is, Brent,

309
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,620
you figured us out.

310
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,740
There is a Best Place.

311
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,760
I knew it. I knew it.

312
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,420
The Best Place is reserved

313
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,400
for a select upper
echelon of good people,

314
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,440
sort of like a Diamond Elite VIP Club

315
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,700
of Afterlife residents.

316
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,130
I was Diamond Elite. I swear.

317
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,360
One time I did shots with
this pilot in the lounge,

318
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,800
and the guy let me fly his helicopter.

319
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,259
We know. That's how you died.

320
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,030
- Right.
- So you'll all be evaluated,

321
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,720
and then a very small group

322
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,100
of the most morally upstanding
residents get to go.

323
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,720
Oh, I see.

324
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,620
So it's like a "good deeds" contest?

325
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,350
That's easy.

326
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,740
I'm gonna crush this. Oh, and hey...

327
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,180
mum's the word, right?
Why tip off my competition?

328
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,780
Oops. Looks like you dropped your fork.

329
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,550
Let me get that for you.

330
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,560
Did you get that? The fork thing?

331
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,620
Or should I start writing these down?

332
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,670
No, you're good. We'll keep track.

333
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,750
Great. Love it.

334
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,080
Hi, Jason.

335
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,240
Janet, I'm so happy to see you.

336
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,770
I got you a box of chocolates.

337
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,030
But then I remembered you
can't eat, so I ate them.

338
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,379
And I thought it'd be a nice present

339
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,390
for me to describe them to you.

340
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,680
So... the first one was gross...

341
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,200
Jason, um, please just let me talk.

342
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,100
You know that I've been
overwhelmed with work

343
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,410
since the Neighborhood started.

344
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,529
- Yup.
- And I asked you

345
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,790
to give me some space.

346
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,280
Yup.

347
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,930
I'm so sorry to say this.

348
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,250
But I can't be in a relationship
with you right now.

349
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,100
Being with you is fun,
but it's not always easy,

350
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,290
and I'm afraid it would
endanger the experiment.

351
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,110
- It won't, though.
- Jason, it already has.

352
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,270
So why don't we just take a
break until it's all finished.

353
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,580
Also, I hate to pile on,

354
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,190
but I feel like you
have a right to know.

355
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,610
The Jacksonville Jaguars
cut Blake Bortles.

356
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,940
He's not on the team anymore.

357
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,320
I am genuinely sorry.

358
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,310
Hi, how are you?

359
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,160
Nice to see you. Enjoy your yogurt.

360
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,270
Problem is, now he's saddled
with a bad motivation.

361
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,299
I mean, his points won't
go up if the only reason

362
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,100
he's being nice is to
make his points go up.

363
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,350
Yeah, but that was also my situation

364
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,900
when I first asked Chidi for help.

365
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,220
I only did it so you wouldn't catch me.

366
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,800
We have to hope that over time

367
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,030
Brent starts doing good
things out of habit.

368
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,190
Just like you.

369
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,840
Hey, I just realized something.

370
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,640
That whole "you're the only one
who can save us" speech...

371
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,280
you didn't actually have
a nervous breakdown

372
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,433
on day one, did you?

373
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,460
You faked it so that I would step up

374
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,960
and take over.

375
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,120
- Guilty.
- You tricky devil!

376
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,550
Very clever. All right.

377
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,410
Time to go help Simone and Chidi.

378
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,380
Oof, why did I come up with this idea?

379
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,830
This is gonna hurt real bad.

380
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,780
I know, I know. But I
think it's gonna work.

381
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,520
Yeah, but it's gonna suck for me.

382
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,280
You sure there's no other girl
from Arizona who can do this?

383
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,520
What about Emma Stone? She's from there.

384
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,890
She's very capable.

385
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,670
Remember her in "Zombieland"
and "La La Land"?

386
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,170
What's with all her movies
ending with "land"?

387
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,200
- You're stalling.
- Yep, heading out.

388
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,149
Jason, I'm so sorry.

389
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,070
Janet was my whole Afterlife.

390
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,140
How am I gonna get over her?

391
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,950
I used to have a breakup routine

392
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,990
when a relationship ended...

393
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,160
Champagne and Alanis Morissette.

394
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,300
Not the actual singer.
I'd just listen to her albums

395
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,810
at my friend Adele's house.

396
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,250
I guess I could do my
normal breakup routine...

397
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,210
drink a ton of Mountain Dew,

398
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,860
steal an ATV,

399
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,849
and ride it through a Panda Express.

400
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,640
But then I'd have to ask Janet

401
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,120
for the Mountain Dew and the ATV,

402
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,380
and then I'd have to see Janet,
and then I'd start crying.

403
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,960
What do I do?

404
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,430
I honestly don't know.

405
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,560
But whatever you do,

406
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,549
you'll be doing it with your friends.

407
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,170
And I didn't even get to tell you

408
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,160
about the Blake Bortles part.

409
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
So, Chidi...

410
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,320
do you remember that woman Simone

411
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,050
from the party the other night?

412
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,700
Simone...

413
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,420
the... Third Eye Blind superfan

414
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,500
who walked around cutting
off people's ponytails?

415
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,980
That's the one.

416
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,280
I need your help acclimating
her to the Neighborhood.

417
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,680
I've tried, but since she
thinks this whole thing

418
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,710
is imaginary and I'm
an authority figure,

419
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,340
I'm extra suspicious.

420
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,860
Well, what makes you think
I'd have any more luck?

421
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,440
Chidi, you and Simone...

422
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,230
are soul mates.

423
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,650
Soul mates?

424
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,240
Like our souls are... are...

425
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,550
Mates. Yes.

426
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,010
Everyone has people that
they're cosmically bound to,

427
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,620
and the system brings them
together in the Afterlife,

428
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,020
and I can say with complete certainty

429
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,580
that you and Simone are two such people.

430
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,010
I haven't told her yet.

431
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,280
I wouldn't have told you ordinarily,

432
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,630
but since she's gone a
little cuckoo bananas...

433
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,380
that's the official Architect term...

434
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,500
I thought it was prudent
to let you know.

435
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,930
Whoo, boy, uh...

436
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,410
I'm getting a stomach ache...

437
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,480
but a good one.

438
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,020
A happy stomach ache.

439
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,540
This is new! There are
some great writings

440
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,300
on simulated realities that
might help her adjust...

441
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,066
Descartes, Moravec, Zhuang Zhou.

442
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,620
I wonder if I can summon a
book from my apartment.

443
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,350
Well, good luck.

444
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,479
This is incredible!

445
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,840
I spent my whole life in pursuit

446
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,400
of fundamental truths
about the universe,

447
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,780
but I never actually...

448
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,420
fell in love with someone.

449
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,820
I know.

450
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,290
Oh, right, of course.

451
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,756
You know everything about me.

452
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:55,093
I do, indeed.

453
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,459
Hi, Simone.

454
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,420
Uh, Chidi.

455
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,679
From the other night.

456
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,870
Oh, wow.

457
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,830
My brain must really
like keeping you around.

458
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,769
Have a fake seat and grab a
yogurt that doesn't exist.

459
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,210
Right, um...

460
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,380
so if I understand your state of mind,

461
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,359
it's basically solipsism.

462
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,069
You think that you're the only
real thing in the universe

463
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,630
and everything else stems
from your consciousness.

464
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,990
Yes, but to be fair,

465
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,610
I only think that because
it's true and I'm right.

466
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,560
No offense, but solipsism
as a philosophy

467
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,360
is pretty juvenile,

468
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,400
especially for a person with
multiple advanced degrees.

469
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,379
It's also impossible to refute

470
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,510
because everything you see
is confirmed by your belief.

471
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,540
However...

472
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,689
Dude.

473
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,450
What? I mean, if none of this is real,

474
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,680
then it really shouldn't
matter, right? In fact...

475
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,020
- Ha. Dude!
- What?

476
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,860
It's not real! None of this matters.

477
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,209
Leave that on your nose

478
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,649
- for the rest of time.
- Fine.

479
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,710
Point sort of taken.

480
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
You know, in a larger sense,

481
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,090
if you go around acting
like no one else matters

482
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,550
then you end up doing things like

483
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,770
knocking over cakes

484
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,900
and pushing people into pools

485
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,120
and just generally acting like a jerk.

486
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,940
Why not treat them better
just in case they're real?

487
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,710
I mean, what do you have
to lose by treating people

488
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,430
with kindness and respect?

489
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,450
Okay, keep talking,

490
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,460
probably fake, but maybe
real, philosopher man.

491
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,059
Well, good news... Simone and
Chidi are hitting it off.

492
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,830
I mean, I wasn't getting any
use out of him as a boyfriend,

493
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,269
so why not pass him off
to someone in need?

494
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,630
Is this what donating old
bras to Goodwill feels like?

495
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,100
Must've been really hard
lying to Chidi like that.

496
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,449
That's the thing. I don't
know that it was a lie.

497
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,810
They did fall in love on
Earth, and Michael was right.

498
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,030
Chidi made a huge sacrifice for us,

499
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,789
and I had to make sure it was worth it.

500
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,295
It's arguable that you made
an even bigger sacrifice.

501
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:01,250
You actually have to live
with this situation.

502
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,730
Chidi just gets to go around blissfully

503
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,129
unaware of what he gave up.

504
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,630
Yeah, but we know what he gave up.

505
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,750
Dat ash.

506
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,070
Come on, bud, I know you're down,

507
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,330
but you can't leaving me hanging.

508
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,650
You're right.

509
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,890
That is the code.

510
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,270

1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,159
- Oh, hi, dipshirt.
- Hello, Bad Janet.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,569
- How are you today?
- Terrible.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,999
I'm here to let you know that
after six months of captivity

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,329
here in Good Janet's void,
today's your last day.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,759
I'm gonna tell you a story,

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,089
and once that's done,

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,715
I'm getting rid of you.

8
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:31,049
Wow, sounds like someone

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,379
finally put on his big boy demon pants.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,649
So what's the story?
Another one of your attempts

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,659
to prove that humans are
"good" and "worthy of respect"

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,397
and not "big fat sacks of dookie"?

13
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,259
Something like that. Are you ready?

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,039
One thing, real quick, before you start.

16

_

17
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,869
Wow, she's gonna last.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,839
Is that your story? It looks boring.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,749
This book is a part of the story.

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,359
You'll see.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,670
It all started about a week ago.

22
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:17,889
We had sent the four
humans on a ski trip.

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,499
And they all skied off a cliff

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,999
and they broke all their bones
and their pants fell down

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,719
and you could see their butts.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,769
The end.

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,109
Actually, it went better than
we could have possibly hoped.

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,149
Well, I admit it. I was wrong.

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,656
- That was so fun.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:35,879
I mean, I couldn't actually go skiing

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,820
because moving at an angle terrifies me.

32
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:41,199
But that lodge had so
many reading nooks.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,559
Just everywhere you look, a nook!

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,789
Plus, Jianyu guided us on
that amazing meditation.

35
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,919
Oh, do you guys want to
share what your mantra is?

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,340
Mine is Cate Blanchett saying "Rihanna."

37
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,468
Congrats again on the gin rummy win.

38
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,011
I thought I was gonna take you down

39
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:57,763
because I used to play all
the time back in college.

40
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,014
Oh, you went to Rutgers, right?

41
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:00,263
No, I went to Princeton.

42
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,143
Yeah, I know. I'm messing with you.

43
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:04,299
Oh, ha, ha! Nice one!

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,419
Hey, you were joking though, right?

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,569
You know it's Princeton? Yeah, you know.

46
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,599
Okay, team, well done.

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,809
They're all kind of killing it,

48
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,444
but Brent has definitely
made the most progress.

49
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,579
Yeah, when Simone beat him at cards,

50
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,649
he didn't flip the table and storm off.

51
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,619
He just stormed off. That's big!

52
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,779
Well, we still don't know
if he's really changed

53
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,789
or if he's just trying to
get into Super-Heaven.

54
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,639
But his behavior is changing.

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,319
Remember, that's the road map.

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,139
First, we change the behavior.

57
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,000
Then, we work on motivation.

58
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:33,499
And now...

59
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,239
- Oh!
- The moment you've all been waiting for.

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,059
The Humanity Savior of
the Week goes to...

61
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,429
- Jason!
- Yes!

62
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,562
Keep up the amazing work with Chidi.

63
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:50,899
And the award for Hottest
Savior of the Week

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,689
goes to...

65
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,809
- Eleanor Shellstrop!
- Whoo!

66
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,155
Thank you, I accept.

67
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:58,532
I never win Hottest.

68
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,114
I don't know what to tell you, man.

69
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:02,829
Maybe do some squats?
Pop that booty a little bit?

70
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,079
It was a real high point.

71
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,499
The ski trip, I mean.

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,829
Not the completely
rigged hotness contest.

73
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,919
All in all, it was the
best we'd ever felt

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,088
about the experiment.

75
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,969
And then, Brent did something...

76
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,509
very Brent-y.

77
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,839
Who could have predicted that?

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,879
Oh, hey, ski bunnies!

79
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,549
So, great news. I wrote a book.

80
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,559
And since you're my nerdiest friends,

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,079
you get to be the first to read it.

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,159
"Six Feet Under Par:
A Chip Driver Mystery."

83
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,689
Yeah, it's half spy novel,
half murder mystery.

84
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,219
It's also half submarine adventure,

85
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,072
half erotic memoir,
and half political thriller.

86
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:40,519
It's also half golf tutorial

87
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,909
and half commentary on society.

88
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,439
So it's 3 1/2 books in one?

89
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,019
At least. So read it ASAP.

90
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,209
I'm having a book-signing party

91
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,499
and I want you to introduce me.

92
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,619
You know, talk about how great it is.

93
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,294
- Oh.
- Party's in two days,

94
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:52,369
so chop-chop.

95
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,059
Tahani, cancel your plans.

96
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,419
We're gonna split a bottle of wine

97
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,750
and read Brent's
terrible novel out loud.

98
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,889
Oh, dear. Perhaps we shouldn't make fun.

99
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,279
He did seem nicer on the ski trip.

100
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,229
He made us all s'mores.

101
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,143
Though, to be fair, he did also
claim to have invented them.

102
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:11,599
Before you defend him,
you might want to check out

103
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Chip Driver's love interest.

104
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,369
Oh, no.

105
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,404
"Her name was Scarlett Pakistan,

106
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:21,599
"and she was the type of girl

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,439
"you couldn't take in
all at once or you'd die.

108
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,249
"You had to take her in bit by bit,

109
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,779
like a great work of
art, like the Louvre."

110
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,619
"Her brown eyes were as brown
as the brownest crayon.

111
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,039
"She had legs like Jessica Rabbit

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,420
from that movie."

113
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:37,839
"Her long, flowing locks
smelled like the moon

114
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,129
at twilight on a par four?"

115
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,339
Ugh, I'm sorry about this.

116
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,819
I've been through worse.

117
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,789
Once, at Elon Musk's birthday party,

118
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,299
I was seated between Silvio Berlusconi

119
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,969
and Elon Musk.

120
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,119
This is bad. Brent and Simone

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,559
is our trickiest relationship.

122
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,199
She tends to make snap
judgments about people,

123
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,539
and he's a guy who repeatedly confirms

124
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,929
the accuracy of her snap judgments.

125
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,349
We need her to believe
that Brent is better

126
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,459
than his worst actions,
like saying that Tahani,

127
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,479
"Has an accent like
the Queen of England,

128
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,589
but without any of the
old gross face parts."

129
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,619
We felt like we could contain
the fallout from Brent's book.

130
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,159
But as is often the
case with these things,

131
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,382
the negative effects
started to ripple out.

132
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:23,319
Oh, like when someone throws up on a bus

133
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,999
and then someone smells
it, and they throw up?

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,549
Sure, yeah.

135
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,269
- What's wrong, homie?
- Brent wrote this book,

136
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,518
and clearly, he put some of us in it.

137
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,509
There's a cowardly character
named Four-Eyed Igby

138
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,059
who wears glasses and sweater vests

139
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,579
and never does anything
spontaneous or cool.

140
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,159
I am educating you in ethics.

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,489
What could be cooler than that?

142
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,366
If you want to try something
spontaneous, I'm your guy.

143
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,489
Almost everything I did on Earth,

144
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,199
I did without thinking or worrying

145
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,659
about what would happen.

146
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,729
That's how I got my nickname,

147
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,329
"The Defendant."

148
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,629
Not the best argument, but you're right.

149
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,671
What is something spontaneous
that I can do right now?

150
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:01,709
Let's come up with a
list of ten possibilities

151
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,925
and then slowly whittle it
down over the next four days.

152
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:05,969
Better idea: let's dance, baby.

153
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,012
Huh?

154
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,449
Get you out of your head.

155
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,852
This is how we defeat
Igby, the no-fun nerd.

156
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,689
Oh.

157
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,299
- Look at old Igby move!
- There you go.

158
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,401
Yeah, I've never heard
this before. Who is it?

159
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:22,610
Me, I wrote it.

160
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,864
The song is called,
"I'll Love You Forever,"

161
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:25,999
parentheses,

162
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,269
Oh, fun fact: the police sirens

163
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,599
in the background are real.

164
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,704
I was being chased as I recorded it.

165
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,909
Okay, okay!

166
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,459
Oh, no.

167
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,539
Oh, my Gaga.

168
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,213
So, obviously, this was
a troubling development.

169
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:45,379
Can you just skip to the end?

170
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,928
No. I need to tell you the whole story.

171
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,099
Why?

172
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,719
Every story about humans
ends the same way.

173
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,209
Just tell me how they screwed up

174
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,219
and put me out of my misery.

175
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,061
You're judging them too quickly.

176
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:59,394
Trust me, I've spent a lot more
time with people than you have.

177
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,279
And I know literally everything

178
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,150
that every one of them has ever done.

179
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:05,445
Do you know what's happening
right now on Earth?

180
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:08,879
Wars, murders, women in $400 yoga pants

181
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,240
are refusing to vaccinate
their children.

182
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:13,578
Vindictive nerds at Apple are changing

183
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,997
the charging cable shape again.

184
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,083
Where does this hope come from, man?

185
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,753
This insane hope that people
are worth the trouble.

186
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,779
To quote a terrible song

187
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,759
by a terrible musician

188
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,789
that people love so much
they constantly put it

189
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,419
in terrible movie trailers:

190
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,846
humans are b-b-b-b-bad to the bone.

191
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,929
Well, I think that they're
g-g-g-good sometimes.

192
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,899
And you should give
them the b-b-b-benefit

193
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,539
of the d-d-d-doubt.

194
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,139
Now, where was I?

195
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:47,139
So, John had just
accidentally discovered

196
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,530
the truth about Jason.

197
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,573
Keeping a secret like this is exactly

198
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:52,992
the kind of thing that John
struggled with on Earth.

199
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:55,075
Or to put it in terms you'll understand,

200
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:57,739
the gossip toilet was about to overflow.

201
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,084
Oh, I do understand that now. Thank you.

202
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:04,587
So Jianyu is really Jason?

203
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,249
From Florida?

204
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,507
Who else knows about this?

205
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,059
Is it just me?

206
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,579
Is it an exclusive?

207
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,569
Yes, and we have to keep it that way.

208
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,169
If the truth comes out, we have no idea

209
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,179
what will happen to Jason.

210
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,299
You don't know what you're asking of me.

211
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,709
Look, the neighborhood
is obviously amazing,

212
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,565
but it's also a little season
four of "Downton Abbey."

213
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,609
Beautifully designed,
but a real snooze-fest.

214
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,519
Jason being a mistake

215
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,159
is easily the most exciting thing

216
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,690
that's happened since we got here!

217
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:33,389
What if, in exchange
for your discretion,

218
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,700
Jason teaches you that
"Magic Mike" body roll thing?

219
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,349
Huh? I mean, you always said

220
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,626
you wanted to learn that.

221
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,239
Fine.

222
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,630
But I want to learn the whole dance.

223
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,159
We hoped Simone would forget
all about Brent's book,

224
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,300
but unfortunately...

225
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,459
"Chip Driver pulled
up to the murder site

226
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,459
"in his 1968 Cadillac.

227
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,509
"'Keep it close' he growled
to the valet, Luis.

228
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,979
"'Of course, Señor,' said Luis,
who secretly admired Chip

229
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,355
more than even his own father."

230
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:06,549
"Chip gazed at the sexy outline

231
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,299
"of the murder victim on the floor.

232
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,219
"'What a waste of curves,' he growled.

233
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,113
"He checked his Rolex watch,

234
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:13,359
"which was real.

235
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,366
"It was almost golf o'clock,

236
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,203
"so the case would have to wait.

237
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:20,029
"Good thing he'd already solved it.

238
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,499
The killer was Luis, the valet."

239
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,239
He solves the murder on page ten.

240
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,545
What is the rest of this book about?

241
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:29,599
- How's it going, ladies?
- Oh, you know,

242
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,758
just delving into the great
works of literature.

243
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,552
Yeah, so, listen, um...

244
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:39,479
maybe Brent made some
insensitive choices,

245
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,102
but could you possibly see
your way to forgiving him?

246
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,009
- I suppose...
- No.

247
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,559
No?

248
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,379
Sorry, but no, I can't.

249
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,679
This book is objectifying,
misogynistic, and racist.

250
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,360
Why are we still dealing with
this shirt in the Good Place?

251
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,615
When people like him are ignorant jerks,

252
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,969
why are people like us
asked to forgive him?

253
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,069
Also, and this is less important,

254
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,879
why is he in a fighter jet
for his author photo?

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,799
Well, I can answer the last one.

256
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,209
It's because he loves "Top Gun."

257
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,479
As for the other questions,
I will get back to you

258
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,879
after I consult a number
of immortal beings

259
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,459
who are very wise.

260
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,725
I didn't take you for a linksman.

261
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:23,559
I appreciate golf.

262
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,979
As Ben Hogan once said,

263
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,939
"The most important shot
in golf is the next one."

264
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,659
That's a lovely idea.
If you make a mistake,

265
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,339
you'll always have a
chance to redeem yourself.

266
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,279
Yeah, well, as Jon Daly
once said to David Lee Roth

267
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,610
at the 2002 Chili's Pro-Am in Orlando:

268
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,913
"Suck on this drive, buttmunch."

269
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,109
Ooh!

270
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,159
Nailed it!

271
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,754
That was a flusher, but she sank.

272
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:54,379
Perhaps an adept linksman like yourself

273
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,339
should play with the
assistance filter turned off?

274
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,679
- Let's play old-school.
- All right.

275
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,869
Why not?

276
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,519
Fork! You sneezed, man.

277
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,272
I don't think I did,
because I literally can't.

278
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:10,839
Well, somebody sneezed. Damn it!

279
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,319
Brent, buddy, nobody sneezed.

280
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,919
You hit a bad shot, and it's fine.

281
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,739
You know, it isn't a sign of weakness

282
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,450
to admit that you screwed up.

283
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:22,660
Fine, whatever. I shanked it.

284
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,389
There you go. Now,
let's go find your ball

285
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,089
and try to do better on your next shot.

286
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,639
And you know, if this ends up applying

287
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,119
to any other aspect
of your life later on,

288
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,339
then cool.

289
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,300
- What?
- What? Nothing.

290
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:40,739
I gotta say, Bad Janet,
I really felt like

291
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,050
I had managed to stop the bleeding.

292
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:44,389
You thought that ding-dong
would do a total

293
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,349
personality 180 because
of one gentle metaphor?

294
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,396
What can I say? I'm an optimist.

295
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:51,559
But two days later at the event,

296
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,799
it fell apart almost immediately.

297
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,299
Hey, thanks for not telling
anyone about Jason.

298
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,799
Oh, well, ever since I arrived here,

299
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,559
Tahani helped me realize that gossip

300
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,492
was an unhealthy way for me
to boost my self-esteem.

301
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,499
But on the other hand,

302
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,199
this Jason tea needs to be spilled.

303
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,639
Just try to remember
what Emmanuel Kant said.

304
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,334
It is your duty to keep
your friend's secrets.

305
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:13,239
But my favorite philosopher,
Bethenny Frankel,

306
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,699
would say that I have a
duty to mention it all,

307
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,379
and if you can't handle the truth,

308
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,779
then you can't handle me!

309
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,119
And once again, I beg you,
please listen to Emmanuel Kant

310
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,056
and not Bethenny Frankel.

311
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:27,514
Ah, well, I gotta goss about something.

312
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:28,639
What about a few blind items

313
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,220
that I picked up around
the neighborhood?

314
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,099
You wanna know who wears the
same dumb shorts every day?

315
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,399
- No, I don't.
- It's Dumb Shorts Cathy.

316
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,679
Simone.

317
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,819
Uh, I have been thinking about

318
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,113
those very good questions
that you asked me.

319
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:43,179
And I'm sorry for the delay.
The ancient scrolls

320
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,954
I had to consult were
very hard to roll back up.

321
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:51,299
Um, anyway, I thought about
what you should say to Brent

322
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,279
when he asks for your
opinion of his novel.

323
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,809
Me, too. I have a great idea.

324
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm gonna tell him it sucks very hard.

325
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,879
Well, listen, you're absolutely right

326
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,349
that Brent needs to evolve,

327
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,589
but there may be a more subtle
way to make that happen.

328
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,549
Hey, there they are!

329
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,759
- Charlie's Angels.
- Ooh.

330
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,629
So did you finish the book?
What did you think?

331
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,339
Well, very interesting word choices.

332
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,779
I've definitely never seen
the word "pants-tent"

333
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,069
used so many times.

334
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,739
Yeah, I kind of just felt
like, in that moment,

335
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,940
that that's what the
Surgeon General would say.

336
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:26,509
What else? Let's hear some more complos.

337
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,660
Compliments.

338
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:29,078
For when you introduce me.

339
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,291
Just writing a book is an
amazing accomplishment.

340
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,619
You bet your butt it is.
The story is incredible, too.

341
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,979
I mean, Chip solves the
mystery on page ten.

342
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,421
Greatest detective ever!

343
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:40,699
So hop on up there and
just speak from the heart

344
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,340
about how it's your favorite book ever.

345
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,181
Actually, I have to say, um...

346
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:50,719
the Scarlett Pakistan character
is clearly based on Tahani,

347
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,602
and it's not exactly flattering.

348
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,479
Not flattering?

349
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,519
I said she's got huge ones.

350
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,025
- Ultimate complo!
- Yeah, say there,

351
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:01,589
Brent, remember our conversation
about making mistakes

352
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,610
and how the most important
shot is the next one?

353
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,283
Hang on a second.
You guys agree with her?

354
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,859
Unreal!

355
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,287
I didn't ask to get yelled
at by the PC police.

356
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,279
You know, I was gonna give
you 10% off the cover price.

357
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,289
But now you're gonna have to pay

358
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,043
the full 65 bucks like everybody else.

359
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,059
There's no money here.

360
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,629
The book event is cancelled

361
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,169
because of these mean women.

362
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,160
Oh...

363
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,809
Perhaps I can convince Simone
to handle this the British way.

364
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,639
Smile bravely,

365
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,089
bury your feelings, and
allow a steady drizzle

366
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,435
to slowly wash away your
sadness over 50 years.

367
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:35,919
F that!

368
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,949
Simone is not the problem. Brent is.

369
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,219
He needs to change,
and walking on eggshells

370
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,759
around him ain't gonna do the trick.

371
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,650
We need to throw the
egg right at his face.

372
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,529
You're right. Enough is enough.

373
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,299
He lived on Earth for almost 60 years.

374
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,099
This experiment is more
than halfway over.

375
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,290
He's gotta improve,
and we can't wait forever.

376
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,334
Janet, where is he now?

377
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,877
Take a wild guess.

378
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,506
Hey, bud. What you up to?

379
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:06,050
- Gripping and ripping?
- Trying to.

380
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,928
Just seems like the big dog
don't wanna hunt today.

381
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,059
Simone was very mean to me.

382
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,104
- Maybe even a little racist.
- Well, listen.

383
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:15,719
Art is subjective.

384
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,479
But more importantly...

385
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,959
No other way to put this, buddy.

386
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,901
You made a mistake.
Your actions hurt people.

387
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:26,321
You have to take
responsibility for that.

388
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:30,199
You need to come back and apologize.

389
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,560
Take the first step toward
healing the neighborhood.

390
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,620
Fine, I'll be the bigger man.

391
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:38,789
Just like my dad,
when he single-handedly

392
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,418
took on all those class-action lawsuits.

393
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,130
I just wish I could get
through to the guy.

394
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:46,849
I wonder if he'd respond to
some Social Contract Theory.

395
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,359
Why are you trying to help him?

396
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,039
He doesn't even know you exist.

397
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,634
He doesn't see other people.

398
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:54,379
I mean, he did call
me a four-eyed coward

399
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,639
who probably dry humps books.

400
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,159
But why not be a bigger
person and rise above it?

401
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,839
I'll tell you why. Because doing that

402
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,231
sends a message that it's
okay to be treated this way.

403
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,609
And it's not okay to
treat anyone that way.

404
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,612
Not Tahani, not me, not even you, Igby.

405
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:10,399
Everyone, gather around, please.

406
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,951
Brent has something
that he'd like to say.

407
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,371
Okay.

408
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:20,249
Regarding my critically-acclaimed novel,

409
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,549
I am very sorry if you were offended.

410
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,579
Okay?

411
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,240
- Not an apology.
- Yes, it was.

412
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,019
Okay, fine.

413
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,971
I'm sorry if what I wrote,
which was perfectly okay,

414
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:36,369
somehow made you feel
like it wasn't okay.

415
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,999
But you know what? That's on you.

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,039
Brent. Wrong direction, bud.

417
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,119
No, sorry, man.
Either apologize for real

418
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,359
or stop wasting our time.

419
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,049
Okay, you know what?
I'm actually not sorry at all.

420
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,610
How about that? Is that
what you wanna hear?

421
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:49,609
Very obviously not.

422
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,479
You know what? Why don't we take
a break? Let's all get a snack.

423
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,659
Not until they give me the
complos I rightly deserve.

424
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,036
You want a complo?
I'll give you a complo.

425
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:58,899
I didn't think it was possible

426
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,910
to write a book as awful as yours.

427
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,584
I literally didn't think
human beings were capable

428
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:06,749
of such racist, sexist poppycock!

429
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,519
Also, Chip Driver is
either a private eye

430
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,079
or the quarterback for
the Chicago Bears,

431
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,339
or the "world's strongest president."

432
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,639
He cannot be all three!

433
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,559
Oh, boy.

434
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,519
This is a disgrace!
I accomplished something.

435
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,315
I wrote a novel,

436
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,151
and now my integrity's being attacked.

437
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:29,859
I've been called racist, sexist.

438
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,904
I don't have a racist or
sexist bone in my body.

439
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,989
I am Brent Norwalk,
and I'm a good person.

440
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,491
I'm in the Good Place.
You ever heard of it?

441
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,574
And I'm here because
I deserve to be here.

442
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:38,859
I'm here because I earned it

443
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,246
by being the best.

444
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:41,664
You're ridiculous.

445
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,082
Yeah, and you're a condescending bench.

446
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,209
Oh, uh, don't talk to
her that way, please.

447
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,499
Hey, I have an idea. Let me summon

448
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,219
a few philosophical
works we can use to...

449
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,550
Oh, enough with the
friggin' books, Igby.

450
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,718
Yeah, that's right. You
probably don't know this,

451
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:54,927
but that character is based on you.

452
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:56,762
No, I... I knew it, man.

453
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:58,973
- Oh, look out.
- Ah, I'm being attacked again!

454
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:00,774
- Sorry, that was unintentional...
- Fork you!

455
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,349
So I'm thinking bagel bites.

456
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,736
For the snack.

457
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,279
Middle-aged American male fragility.

458
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
You know why they're called
baby boomers, right?

459
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,599
Because the tiniest little pinprick

460
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,299
to their ego, and boom.

461
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,359
They become babies.

462
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,749
I mean, that was it. We were forked.

463
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,579
Six months of painstaking work,

464
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,169
trying to help the four humans

465
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,839
overcome their worst instincts
and bond as a group.

466
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,659
And in a poof, it was gone.

467
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,669
I told you, man. Humans suck.

468
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,929
Well, this story has one more chapter.

469
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,439
So today was bad.

470
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,239
Today was very bad. Everyone, for sure,

471
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,489
lost a bunch of points.

472
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,610
And I don't have a solution.

473
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:06,079
Okay, well, let's reset.

474
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,019
I'll do something mildly iffy,

475
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,829
and let John make a small,
good decision to help.

476
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,799
I could tell him I'm going
to get ombre highlights

477
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,000
and let him talk me out of it.

478
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:17,849
What's wrong with ombre highlights?

479
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,699
Eleanor, please.

480
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,120
This week has been hard enough.

481
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,599
I could set my robes on fire

482
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,679
and try and get Brent to put it out.

483
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,339
I know you're only suggesting that

484
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,739
because you've repeatedly
said you would look "dope"

485
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,919
in flaming monk robes,

486
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,651
but that's actually not a bad idea.

487
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,799
Force him to help someone

488
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,279
without actually thinking about it.

489
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,490
Maybe I'll ask Chidi to
lead a class on empathy.

490
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,669
Yes. Okay, let's write these down.

491
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,077
We got plenty of time left.

492
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,453
We can get back on track.

493
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:46,739
That was an hour ago.

494
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,459
Right before I came here to
see you for the last time.

495
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,639
For months, you and I
have been debating.

496
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,000
Are people good or bad?

497
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,842
But as I watched those three people

498
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,302
pick themselves up and
dust themselves off,

499
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:03,053
I realized we've been
asking the wrong question.

500
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:06,119
What matters isn't if
people are good or bad.

501
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,179
What matters is if they're
trying to be better today

502
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,299
than they were yesterday.

503
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,608
You asked me where my hope comes from.

504
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:17,236
That's your answer.

505
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:21,823
- What are you doing?
- Sending you home.

506
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,869
I'm not marbelizing you,
Janet. I'm letting you go.

507
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,919
I tried to win you over to our side,

508
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,410
and it hasn't worked.

509
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:31,501
So keeping you as a
prisoner just seems cruel.

510
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:34,699
Letting you go home is how I've decided

511
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,339
to be a little better today
than I was yesterday.

512
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,429
Here's your phone.

513
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,839
And a parting gift.

514
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,851
Oh, sweet, is that Brent's book?

515
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:49,979
No, I didn't have any cash on me,

516
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,549
so I couldn't get you a copy.

517
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,279
This is a manifesto detailing

518
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,189
everything that's
happened with the humans.

519
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,779
Janet and I wrote it a while back.

520
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,679
She's been updating it as we go.

521
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,366
- I hope you'll read it.
- Great thinking.

522
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:06,899
People that get books as
gifts always read them.

523
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,449
Bye!

524
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,053

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,301
Let me see.

3
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,097
How are you feeling?

4
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,017
It'll be okay. Don't be afraid.

5
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,195
I'll get you for this, you cheapskate.

6
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,364
Come on, enjoy the experience.

7
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,408
What experience? Getting lynched?

8
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,285
Hello?

9
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,579
You know what they do
to gay people in their countries?

10
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,222
Yoni, chill, nobody's gonna bother you.

11
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,934
I have to get a selfie with one
of these women in black.

12
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,668
- What's that jellabiya called?
- A burqa.

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,878
Don't mess around, Shira.

14
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,441
What do you think, is it nice to ask?

15
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,427
Sorry.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,595
Thank you.

17
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:41,768
Hey!

18
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,895
Take it easy, man.

19
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,063
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- You put it in my face.

20
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,899
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sir.
- Take it easy.

21
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,484
- Yes, yes, okay, sorry.
- Okay.

22
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,819
Allow me to help you.

23
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:51,903
What?

24
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,945
I will help you.

25
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,574
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,700
Excuse me.

27
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,166
Did you see how angry he got at me?

28
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,249
Rightfully so.

29
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,877
Jeez.

30
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,295
We already had tickets for El Al.

31
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,523
They cost a thousand dollars.

32
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,799
These were half,
that's two more months in India.

33
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,719
<i>Shwai, ya zalame</i> is right.
You knocked your bag into his face.

34
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,721
Fine. I can't deal with you anymore, okay?

35
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,306
- Fine.
- Fine.

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,308
Aren't you excited?

37
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,101
- About what?
- Get excited, it's India.

38
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,537
When we get to India I'll be excited.

39
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,063
All right, let's take a selfie.

40
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,488
- Did the lights just go out?
- No, it's probably just turbulence.

41
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,240
What do you mean, turbulence?

42
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,993
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please go to your seats</i>

43
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,327
<i>and fasten your seat belts.</i>

44
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,414
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please put the seat belts. Thank you.</i>

45
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,749
- Do you have your seat belts on?
- This is mine.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,169
You need to put your seat belts on.

47
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,629
Hey, it's fine.

48
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,633
Okay.

49
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,970
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

50
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,349
<i>We are experiencing technical difficulties
with one of our engines at this time.</i>

51
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,978
<i>As a safety precaution,
we will be landing in a half an hour</i>

52
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,564
<i>at the nearest airport of Tehran,</i>

53
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,735
<i>where you and your luggage
will be transferred to another plane</i>

54
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,029
<i>to continue your flight to India.</i>

55
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,657
<i>Our flight staff is at your service
if you have any questions or problems.</i>

56
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,618
- Did he say "Tehran"?
<i>- Thank you.</i>

57
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:06,997
No way.

58
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,292
Excuse me.

59
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,375
Sorry.

60
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,464
- Sir...
- Sir, you need to take your seat, please.

61
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,966
Please, sir, listen.
I am Israeli. We are Israelis.

62
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,385
We can't land in Tehran.

63
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,429
We have no choice.
Please return to your seat now.

64
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,600
No, no, go tell your captain
you've got two Israelis on board,

65
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,852
that we can't land in Tehran, please.

66
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,107
I can assure you on behalf
of the captain and myself

67
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,211
that all the passengers
will be transferred together

68
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,861
to the replacement aircraft.

69
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,154
They are going to arrest us.

70
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,698
They're gonna arrest us, Shira,
don't you get it?

71
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,784
Israelis don't come back from Iran.

72
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,702
Sir. I will speak with the captain.

73
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,079
Please return to your seat now.

74
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,498
Come on, calm down, let's sit down.

75
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,852
Put your seat belt on.

76
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,915
You think this is Tehran?

77
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,295
I don't know.

78
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,509
I can't breathe, Shira.

79
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,039
You have to leave the airplane.

80
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,292
No, we're not leaving.

81
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,460
You have to.

82
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,256
Otherwise I have to report you,
and you will be forcibly removed.

83
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,842
You don't want that to happen.

84
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,127
Passports, please.

85
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,379
What?

86
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,672
Passports.

87
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,434
Follow me.

88
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,538
Okay. Good luck to you.

89
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,457
God willing, I'll see you soon.

90
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,042
God willing.

91
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,895
Shira...

92
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,689
Yoni, I don't feel well.

93
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,650
Tell my husband I'm sorry.

94
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,486
I had no choice.

95
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,088
Excuse me...

96
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,428
I know you!

97
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,764
We served at the same base, at Glilot.

98
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,659
What is this, what are you doing here?

99
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,523
Sorry...
I don't understand what you're saying.

100
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,955
No, you understand, you do.
Please help me. What's going on here?

101
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,231
What are we doing in Iran?

102
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,816
What is going on here?

103
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,528
Sir, this woman is harassing me.

104
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,611
I don't understand
what the hell she wants from me.

105
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,491
I apologize, ma'am.

106
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,618
Please come.

107
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,079
No, wait. I didn't...

108
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,956
Okay, come.

109
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,039
How are you, Zhila?

110
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,458
Okay.

111
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,378
Did everything go okay?

112
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,632
Good.

113
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,014
Now I need the codes.

114
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,058
I don't have them.

115
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,270
What do you mean?

116
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,316
The codes are changed
every night at 18:00.

117
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,109
I'll only know them at 18:00.

118
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,320
That's not what I know.

119
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,113
You know what I told Masoud.

120
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,158
You'll get the codes
when we land in New Delhi.

121
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,412
Don't lie to me!

122
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,747
I'm not.

123
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,958
Why did you lie in your questioning?

124
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,253
I needed to be sure
I was getting out of Iran.

125
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,548
I'd rather die than stay here.

126
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,969
Let go of my hand or I'll scream.

127
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:21,635
So the Jordanian plane's systems
are still under our control?

128
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,763
Great. Keep me posted.

129
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,058
Just a second.

130
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,018
A call from Tehran Airport.

131
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,068
Good morning, sir.

132
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,695
How are you doing today?

133
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,405
Well, praise God.

134
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,323
We had luck with the weather this morning.

135
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,325
That's good to hear.

136
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,119
Yes, we're with you.

137
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,751
Copy that.

138
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,503
We'll take care of it.

139
00:13:58,964 --> 00:13:59,965
The passenger lied,

140
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,968
we'll only get the codes
when they land in Delhi.

141
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,760
That means we have a four-hour delay.

142
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,324
We don't have four hours.
The pilots are already being briefed.

143
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,515
There are other ways of getting the codes.

144
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,392
I believe Tamar could handle it.

145
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,103
That's why we sent a hacker.

146
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,563
What about the two Israelis?

147
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,064
They were stopped for questioning.

148
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,567
They bought tickets last minute
and boarded the plane.

149
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,195
We only heard about it
15 minutes before takeoff.

150
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,612
Mike,

151
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,573
I want complete profiles
on the both of them.

152
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,537
Have a seat, please.

153
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,338
Put this on. Cover your hair.

154
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,342
And close your jacket, please.

155
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,637
Wait in here, huh?

156
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Come.

157
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,118
I saw an officer from my base
in the restroom.

158
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,823
Have you lost it completely?

159
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,368
I'm telling you, Yoni, I know her.

160
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,788
On Independence Day she got an Outstanding
Officer award from the head of MID.

161
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,349
She's pretty,
I've seen her a million times.

162
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,542
- A million times...
- Enough, I don't want to hear it.

163
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,418
- Yoni, just listen...
- Stop it!

164
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,679
What do you think is gonna happen to us?

165
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,763
I don't know.

166
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,140
What?

167
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,725
I don't know, Yoni. Cut it out.

168
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,272
I knew it.

169
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,942
I knew we shouldn't have boarded
that plane.

170
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,069
Wait a minute.

171
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,865
It's so lovely.

172
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,454
What?

173
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:20,958
What do you mean?

174
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,627
Can't you stop worrying for a minute?

175
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,798
It's okay, dear. Everything will go well.

176
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,007
Me?

177
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,009
I'm not worried about you...

178
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,138
I'm worried about the price
of that necklace you're checking out.

179
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,141
You want it?

180
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,476
Not anymore.

181
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,353
Come on... try it on.

182
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,436
It's okay...

183
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,605
Come on...

184
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,487
Excuse me. I need to take this.

185
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,031
Try it on.

186
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,675
I'm right here. It'll take two minutes.

187
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:56,368
Yes, Ali.

188
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,495
<i>Hello, sir. How are you?</i>

189
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,790
Sorry to bother you.
I know you're at the airport.

190
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,458
What's this about? Get to the point.

191
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,629
A flight from Jordan
made an emergency landing here.

192
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,175
There were two Israelis on board,
they're being held at the special section.

193
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,885
<i>We'll be right there.</i>

194
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,178
No, stay there.

195
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,637
<i>It's not your job.</i>

196
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,139
Yes, sir.

197
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,099
I'm on it. Okay, okay.

198
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,769
Is there anything else I can do?

199
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,397
So?

200
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,274
Very nice!

201
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,526
What is it? Who was that?

202
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,946
Nothing, just Ali. I have to...

203
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,407
There's something
I need to do here at the airport.

204
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,118
It won't be long.
I'll be back in time. Okay?

205
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,370
And if I said it wasn't?

206
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,791
Okay. I'll see you at the gate.

207
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,044
Okay. I won't be long.

208
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,879
Okay, go. Okay.

209
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,014
What do you think about the nuclear deal?

210
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:04,645
Who needs atom bombs when money
loses a quarter of its value in one day?

211
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,272
Right.

212
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,777
I make more every month, but I'm left with
half of what I had the previous month.

213
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,530
But the people at the top
don't care whether we live or die.

214
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,079
Where are you from?
Where did you grow up?

215
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,623
I grew up in Tehran.

216
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,042
Where?

217
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,545
At the Garden.

218
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,880
Oh, what a neighborhood...

219
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,091
I have family there, the Azizi family.

220
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,927
Our neighbors were named Azizi.

221
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,472
Really? Well, it's a large clan...

222
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,140
Khodadad's family.

223
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,143
Their son played soccer
for the national team.

224
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,021
No, not them. A different Azizi family.

225
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,376
But you have a bit of an accent,
if you don't mind my saying so.

226
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,445
My father was in trade,
we went all over the world.

227
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,573
We finally settled in Qatar.

228
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,284
Well, well! Good for you!

229
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:12,838
What's going on?

230
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,090
They're hanging somebody.

231
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,982
What did he do?

232
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,568
He used to be a bank manager.

233
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,280
He was convicted of embezzling oil funds.

234
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,007
Here you go.

235
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,770
Thank you.

236
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,231
Keep it, it's okay.

237
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,987
I can't believe people
come watch these atrocities.

238
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,647
Welcome.

239
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:19,399
Thank you.

240
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,276
How is Zhila?

241
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,320
She's okay.

242
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,822
And how did everything go?

243
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,449
There weren't any problems?

244
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,992
It was all very good.

245
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,744
No problems at all.

246
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,873
Could you please show me to my room?

247
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,251
Of course.

248
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,671
Follow me.

249
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,558
These are the clothes Zhila wears to work.

250
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:53,892
Perfect. Thank you.

251
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,564
You're welcome to eat.
I made dinner for us.

252
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,941
Thank you, I'm really not hungry.

253
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,109
Why? It is good.

254
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:05,362
Thank you. I have to get ready now.

255
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:09,657
Of course.

256
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,309
Is that her?

257
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,435
Put it on speaker.

258
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:38,645
Hello.

259
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,355
Good afternoon.

260
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,732
Hello.

261
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,692
<i>How's the weather?</i>

262
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,819
Clear.

263
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,654
Good, good.

264
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,156
<i>You made it to the house?</i>

265
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,243
Yes.

266
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,704
<i>Is the man there?</i>

267
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,123
Yes, he's a bit nervous.

268
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:01,168
Do you think the Israeli at the airport
realized you switched?

269
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,754
I don't think so, she...

270
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,437
Actually, she was a bit hysterical,
they took her for questioning.

271
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,717
Are we moving forward?

272
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,385
<i>Zhila didn't give us the codes.</i>

273
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,472
Do you have any way of bypassing them?

274
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,353
I need to check...

275
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,104
Maybe. Yes, maybe.

276
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,688
How?

277
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,234
<i>I've got this guy,
this Iranian hacker I know.</i>

278
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,693
<i>Who is he?</i>

279
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:29,321
One of my contacts,
he won't ask questions, only...

280
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:30,489
he'll want money.

281
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,575
Okay, good. Keep us posted.

282
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:43,836
What's going on?

283
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,921
Are you ready for her to hack it?

284
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:46,880
Yes, sir.

285
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,234
Once she establishes communication
with the Iranian anti-aircraft system,

286
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,236
she only has to activate
the connection she created,

287
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,660
and I'll be able to control
Iranian radar around the reactor.

288
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,514
It will see what I tell it to see.

289
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,516
What time frame will the pilots have?

290
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,144
At least five minutes
for bombing with no anti-aircraft fire.

291
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,073
- Separate them.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,157
Here.

293
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,703
Come.

294
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:55,324
So I understand
that you got here by mistake.

295
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:56,825
Yes.

296
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,160
That's okay.

297
00:26:58,702 --> 00:26:59,870
Things like this happen.

298
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:03,332
We have no desire to keep you here
any longer than necessary.

299
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:09,213
But since you are a citizen
of an enemy country...

300
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,677
I'm forced to have a brief conversation
with both of you.

301
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,972
But... the Jordanian plane
will wait for us?

302
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,308
It's okay. They'll wait.

303
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,104
What did you do in the Israeli army?

304
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,193
In Hebrew it calls <i>mashakit tash</i>.

305
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,571
I help soldiers that have problems
at home,

306
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,782
like if they don't have money or...

307
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,617
one of the parents passed away.

308
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,119
Where were you based?

309
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,455
Near my home, in Tel Aviv.

310
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,458
Did you deal
with any classified information?

311
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,835
No, no, no.

312
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:51,380
Nothing more than knowing
whose parents were divorced. You know?

313
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,719
And why did you fly through Jordan?

314
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,265
Because it's much cheaper,
it's half price.

315
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:06,895
Hello.

316
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:09,439
They're closing the gate in 20 minutes.
Are you coming?

317
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:10,774
<i>I'll be there in two minutes.</i>

318
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:16,905
Hold them off, tell them who I am,
tell them there's a security issue.

319
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:18,782
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

320
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:22,911
They don't care who you are.
300 people want to get out of here!

321
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:25,831
I'll be there in two minutes.

322
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:32,838
Thank you.

323
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,175
Here is the translation
of what they were saying, sir.

324
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,173
Shira: I saw an officer from my base
in the restroom.

325
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,580
Yoni: Have you lost it completely?

326
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,018
Okay. Thank you.

327
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:07,581
Shira...

328
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:09,958
Yes?

329
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,544
What happened in the bathroom
with the flight attendant?

330
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:15,756
What?

331
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:19,384
I understand that you had
a little incident earlier,

332
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,637
in the bathroom, with a flight attendant.

333
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:26,517
The security guard saw you talking.

334
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,353
So, what were you talking about?

335
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,233
I was just curious about her uniform.

336
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:41,573
So... you were arrested
in an enemy country...

337
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,953
and a moment ago you were almost
fainting from fear,

338
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:49,581
and all of a sudden you were curious
about the uniform?

339
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:55,337
Yes, sir... I was interested,
and she got a little stressed.

340
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:00,008
And why would she get stressed?

341
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,260
I don't know, ask her.

342
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,766
You weren't talking about the uniform.

343
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,768
What were you talking about?

344
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:11,353
What didn't your friend want to know?

345
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:15,107
- What?
- What happened with the flight attendant?

346
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:17,734
What did you want to tell your friend

347
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,027
that he didn't want to hear?

348
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,990
I'm not from the Mossad or anything,
I was just flying to India.

349
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,534
You keep lying to me...

350
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,413
you're not gonna make it home alive.

351
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:37,129
I thought I knew her.

352
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,715
How?

353
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,104
How did you know her? What's her name?

354
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,693
I don't remember the name...

355
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:01,778
I knew her from the base.

356
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,655
What base did you serve on?

357
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:04,907
What military unit?

358
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:08,243
It's 8200.

359
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,578
It's intelligence unit.

360
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,080
I know what the 8200 is.

361
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,249
What was her job at the 8200?

362
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,960
Why did she get an award
from the head of MID?

363
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,129
I don't know this stuff, 'cause...

364
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,465
I only had to deal with soldiers' welfare.

365
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:25,010
Why would an officer with the 8200

366
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,596
be in a bathroom in Tehran's airport?

367
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,931
I don't know!

368
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,599
You answer me that...

369
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:32,643
I will let you go.

370
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:35,896
I'm not even sure it was her,
'cause... she answered in English,

371
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,398
and she said she don't know
who I was talking about.

372
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:42,069
So maybe I imagined. I got mixed up.

373
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,047
He's so annoying.

374
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:53,056
<i>The issues with the onboard computer
have been resolved.</i>

375
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,895
<i>We are boarding now,
please approach the gate.</i>

376
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,071
<i>Yes, Faraz.</i>

377
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,406
Sir.

378
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,326
I'm at the airport,
concerning the two Israelis

379
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,745
who came in on the Jordanian plane.

380
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,246
Yes. I have the details.

381
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:22,836
<i>The woman thinks she saw
a female Israeli intelligence officer</i>

382
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,423
in a stewardess uniform
for an Iranian airline.

383
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,217
Does that sound likely to you?

384
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,676
I don't know.

385
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,222
This Israeli, does she seem trustworthy?

386
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:39,186
Why would she make that up?

387
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:43,148
And assuming it's true,
do you think she had any part in it?

388
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,943
<i>She wasn't supposed to be there.</i>

389
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:50,864
But if it were up to me,
I'd keep her overnight at least.

390
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,741
She might remember something else.

391
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,117
All right.

392
00:33:56,745 --> 00:34:00,207
I feel like she'll do us
more harm than good.

393
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,335
<i>We don't want
an international incident right now.</i>

394
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,421
Let them go.
Let them board the connecting flight.

395
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,885
You're at the airport with your wife,
heading to Paris, aren't you?

396
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,428
Yes.

397
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:17,099
<i>Well, go back to your wife
and let Ali take care of it.</i>

398
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,809
Good luck.

399
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:19,891
I pray for her.

400
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,271
Thank you.

401
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,701
Saeed.

402
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:42,165
I need the security footage
from the women's restroom

403
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:45,085
from the moment
the Jordanian plane landed.

404
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,837
- Yes, sir.
- Where is it?

405
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,762
You look a little bit like her, you know?

406
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,474
That's a compliment.

407
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,685
Your wife is very beautiful.

408
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,147
This was all her idea.

409
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:51,944
At first I wouldn't listen,
but she insisted.

410
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,114
I'm not doing it for money, you know.

411
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,493
I'm doing it because I love her.

412
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,790
And God willing,
tomorrow you'll see her again.

413
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,084
No, I won't.

414
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,046
She's not coming back, my Zhila.

415
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:14,758
What makes you say that?

416
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:18,929
Because I know...

417
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,434
she's not coming back here anymore.

418
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,359
May God help you.

419
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:35,571
Thank you.

420
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:19,615
Wait. Stop.

421
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:21,575
Rewind, rewind.

422
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,077
Wait.

423
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:31,376
Play this.

424
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:43,764
Look. Here she's using her left hand
and here her right hand.

425
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:45,432
Yes, sir.

426
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,770
Look, this is when she got in.

427
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,773
And this is 6:30 minutes later, going out.

428
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,153
I think it's two different people.

429
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,780
I think it's the same person.

430
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,115
Zoom it.

431
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:15,254
It's two different people.
They switched.

432
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:18,465
Stop the Jordanian connecting flight
to New Delhi immediately!

433
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,592
At any cost! Don't let the plane take off!

434
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:21,885
Yes, sir.

435
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:27,307
When will we fly?

436
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:28,433
I'm dying already.

437
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,103
We'll fly in a few minutes.

438
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:33,522
Stay calm, okay?

439
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,104
Where's your bag?

440
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,689
Nahid...

441
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:17,774
Are you finished?

442
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:18,984
No.

443
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:22,654
There's been a serious incident here.

444
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,823
I have to stay.

445
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,371
Ma'am, ma'am...

446
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:34,041
we have to close the gate,
the whole plane is waiting.

447
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,584
All right. Just a minute, please.

448
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,212
I have to stay.

449
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,589
I'm sorry.

450
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,425
I'll take the first flight tomorrow.

451
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,180
I've arranged everything.

452
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:51,016
I'll stay in touch with you
the entire time.

453
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:56,480
You'll be treated like a queen, I promise.

454
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,374
I'll join you tomorrow or the next day.

455
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,820
I'm sick of all these promises
you can never keep.

456
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,911
It's beautiful!

457
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,705
It looks so good on you.

458
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,585
God is watching over us.

459
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,255
You'll pull through, my dear.

460
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:23,715
God willing.

461
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:31,765
Please hurry.

462
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,559
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

463
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,439
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

464
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,157
So?

465
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,703
<i>I'm sorry, boss,
orders came in to let them leave.</i>

466
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:53,871
<i>It took off.</i>

467
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,360
We've just received confirmation
that the plane has taken off.

468
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:10,721
The two Israelis are on it, as well
as Ashraf and the new woman passenger.

469
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:28,739
It is late.

470
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,657
Do you want me to take you there?

471
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,285
No, thank you. I'll be fine.

472
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,997
- May God help you.
- And you.

473
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:52,763
Zhila?

474
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:55,849
I see you finally got the operation.

475
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:59,728
Congratulations! Did you use
the doctor I recommended?

476
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:01,355
Yes.

477
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,024
Good, I'm sure he did an excellent job.

478
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,902
Are you going to work already? This late?

479
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:10,155
- Well, have a good evening, sweetheart.
- Good evening.

480
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:26,523
Zhila...

481
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,818
Nice! I see you finally got the operation?

482
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:33,447
When can you take the bandage off
so we can see it?

483
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:35,616
In a few days.

484
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:42,080
Are you upset with me?

485
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:58,931
He's abusing you, Zhila.

486
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,309
And you're not the first woman
he's done this to.

487
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,812
Someone has to put
that bastard in his place.

488
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,440
If you don't do it, I will.

489
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:17,658
He's here.

490
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:19,993
He got called in because of some problem.

491
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:22,621
He's pissed, watch out.

492
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:35,050
Our agent is in. The estimated time
to access is 40 minutes.

493
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:38,512
Cantor.

494
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,264
Get pilots on standby.

495
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:41,515
Switch to propulsion mode.

496
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,609
<i>Hoshen one through four,
clear to align on 1-8.</i>

497
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:55,779
<i>Hoshen one through four,
aligning and standing by on 1-8.</i>

498
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,168
We have a location from Tehran.

499
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,842
Okay, she successfully used the backdoor

500
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:42,845
in the electric company's backup system
to enter the anti-aircraft system.

501
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,295
She's initiated the physical hack.

502
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,767
They told me you were here.

503
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,606
Hey! I'm talking to you!

504
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:38,775
Wait, what is this?

505
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,201
I don't understand, she's not responding.
See what's going on with her.

506
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:45,240
Come here.

507
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:48,202
Zhila, wait!

508
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:49,786
Zhila!

509
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,373
Honey!

510
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,544
There's no response.

511
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,597
- What's the matter, you whore?
- Hey!

512
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,807
Your husband found out,
so you got nervous?

513
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:12,809
Don't resist.

514
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,397
Come here, sweetheart.

515
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:19,983
Come here and take my cock.

516
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:28,325
What is this? Who are you?

517
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:31,349

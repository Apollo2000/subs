00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,900
"Unknown caller"

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Hello.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Faraz Kamali...

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who is this?

7
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,500
Hello.
-Good morning.

8
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,700
A beautiful day today.

9
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
The sky is clear and bright.

10
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,400
Where are you?

11
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,700
In a safe place.

12
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Still in Tehran?

13
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,610
Yes.

14
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,700
Beautiful.

15
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,900
Call me in a few hours, I'll give you details on the rescue.

16
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,080
I have a plan.

17
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,050
What's that?
-I have a link to get into the secondary station.

18
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,000
-If it's not too late, we can try getting in from there.

19
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,250
I have a contact in a dissident group.

20
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
He is reliable. I made sure before I flew.

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,250
Is he with you now?

22
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Are you with him, "Shakira"? Are you with "Sick Boy"?

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
What does he know about you?

24
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,000
He doesn't know anything. He thinks I'm opposed to the regime like him, but...

25
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,050
He knows someone on the inside, but that doesn't matter does it?

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,250
Can you be there in 48 hours?

27
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,450
Yes.

28
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,350
Ok.

29
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,500
For starters, put a tracker on the hacker's phone.

30
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,780
And send me everything you have on him, as well as his contact at the station.

31
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,750
What his name is, and what his role will be.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have to go.

33
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,000
Come here, going to put it at the front.

34
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,550
Look, I added some features to the "Gershad" app.

35
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,590
The app isn't worth shit.

36
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
The regime reports lies to confuse you.

37
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,000
No way?
-In the end it leads you to bullshit.

38
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,400
Next stop:

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,850
Hell.
-Hell.

40
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Crazy son of a bitch!

41
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,000
Tell me where she is.

42
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,700
Tell me where she is.

43
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,350
Get up! Get up!

44
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,250
Tell me where she is. Tell me where she is!

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,780
Tell me where she is!

46
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,490
I don't know anything... I swear to God.

47
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
Come.

48
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Come.

49
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,050
Are you taking him, commander?

50
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,500
I need to answer to you?!

51
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,600
Sorry, sir.

52
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,075
Where?

53
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,100
Brother...

54
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,250
Where are you taking me?

55
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,330
I swear to you I know nothing.

56
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,000
Lying dog!

57
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,700
Do you have children?

58
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,700
I have two little girls.

59
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,290
Masoud, I told you to shut up!

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Israeli Air Force Base

61
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Sir, Dr. Ben-Artzi here,

62
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,000
we'll be in the hospital for another half hour.

63
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,000
How is she?

64
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,570
Her vitals are fine but she's anesthetized.

65
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,300
I'll update you later.

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
No!

67
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,000
Tell the girls to come, not the boys. More girls will come that way!

68
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,750
Tell Parisa, Langar.

69
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,300
Dude I need to drive. I'll call you later. Bye.

70
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,450
I told you this app is shit.

71
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,800
There's no way around this checkpoint.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Good afternoon. How are you, sir?

73
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,250
Where are you going?

74
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
We're going to hike in the mountains. We're on break from university.

75
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Licenses.

76
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Yeah.

77
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,200
Here you go.

78
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,000
Why do you look like that, sister?

79
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,750
Arrange your head covering.

80
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you pointing your finger at me?

81
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,550
Now you're going to get it!

82
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,950
Officer...

83
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,290
Come on, get out!

84
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,890
Come on!
-Officer.

85
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,220
You're not ashamed?

86
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,000
Officer, that's my step sister.

87
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,200
She's from abroad. She doesn't understand what it means.

88
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,000
What do I care that she came from abroad?

89
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,480
I ask forgiveness. It wasn't out of disrespect.

90
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,200
She learned in school that the hand sign means everything is fine.

91
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,790
Where is her identification?

92
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,000
I apologize, officer.

93
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,680
She came to visit her homeland and go for a hike in the mountains.

94
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,000
Explain to her that this sign is done abroad, not in Iran.

95
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,000
Absolutely.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
What about the car? Is it clean?

97
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,850
Let's take a good look to be sure.

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,385
Is there a problem, sir?

99
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,950
Open up the back.

100
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,900
The door is stuck, but don't worry.

101
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,690
There's nothing there.

102
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,000
And what about him?

103
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,000
Drive carefully.

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you.

105
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,950
A month's work! A month's work gone, damn it!

106
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,500
Tell me, did you want to get us arrested or are you just an idiot?

107
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,780
Leave her alone. It happens.
-Shut the fuck up!

108
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,250
Why did you even bring her? Did you think we were going on a picnic?

109
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,100
Where are we going?

110
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,300
You really don't know where we're going?

111
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,390
To a party?

112
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,300
A party where? What are we going to do there?

113
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,450
Why did she even come with us? Where did you find her?

114
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,600
What is this talk?

115
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,200
I could've ditched you both at the checkpoint and driven off.

116
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,000
How do you know each other?

117
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,000
From the Internet.

118
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We met on the darknet.

119
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,700
Darknet...?

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
How long have you known each other?
-A year.

121
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,600
And how do you know it's really her?
-I know. Trust me.

122
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,100
What the hell are you doing on the darknet?

123
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,250
I'm a hacker.

124
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,650
I make money from it.

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I needed help from him on something. We started talking...

126
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm really sorry for what happened.

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
It was stupid.

128
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Let's go.

129
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,200
You owe me that money.

130
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,550
A million tomans gone from your mistake.

131
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,740
Get the hell out.

132
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
Out!

133
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Over there.

134
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,000
On your knees.

135
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,000
On your knees!

136
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,000
You sold out to the Zionists.

137
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You betrayed your homeland.

138
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,150
A traitorous dog like you

139
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,600
doesn't deserve to live for even one day.

140
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,790
Even one day!

141
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,800
You're leaving Iran tonight.

142
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
And will never return.

143
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,000
If you come back, I will visit your family myself.

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,200
Only then...

145
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,790
I'll have a full magazine.

146
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,300
Your Zionist friends are waiting for you in Istanbul.

147
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:32,570
Go hug your wife and daughters.

148
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Because you will not see them again.

149
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,200
Understand? You will not see them again!

150
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,900
Yes.

151
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

152
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,800
Hey! What's up?

153
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Shahin!

154
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,800
You took the merchandise and went for a walk.

155
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,790
Where is this place? We got a flat tire. We had to haul ass the rest of the way.

156
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,390
Let's smoke something and fly.

157
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
Go, I'm right behind you.

158
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,730
Milad, come.

159
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,250
Will she be following us around all night?
-What's the problem?

160
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,080
What's the problem? As if that stuff with the cops never happened?

161
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,390
Let's go in here and talk.

162
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,500
You're just being polite.

163
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,800
Yeah.

164
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
"The Eagle" is on the line.

165
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,200
Put him through.

166
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Hey, cutie.

167
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,000
Have fun, sweetheart.

168
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,000
Hello.
-Hello.

169
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,690
Can you make me happy?

170
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,500
Hurry up.

171
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,500
You should have counted first.

172
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
Don't rush me, sweetheart.

173
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,000
What's your name?

174
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Yasmine.

175
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Who do you work for here, Yasmine?

176
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,700
I want to be sure you're not playing me.

177
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,700
Can you point them out?

178
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,000
I'll buy a million tomans worth if it's good.

179
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,000
Do you know what the penalty is for selling drugs? Do you know?!

180
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,200
I didn't sell anything.

181
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,100
You have two options.

182
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,800
Either you go to jail or you tell me who your dealer is.

183
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,950
There is no dealer.

184
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,000
Ok, come with me.

185
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,550
What did she do to you?

186
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,700
Nothing, she kicked me in the balls. Nothing serious.

187
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,490
Did she say anything?
-No.

188
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,300
Didn't snitch on anyone.

189
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,620
Why the face?

190
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,180
You still owe me money.

191
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,600
Karim, enough.

192
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,000
Hello.

193
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,760
My dear.

194
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,500
My love, how are you feeling?

195
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,000
Thank God.

196
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,500
Where are you?

197
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know.

198
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,400
In the hospital. Don't know which country.

199
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,590
It has to do with your job, where could it be?

200
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,690
The Israelis kidnapped you, my dear.

201
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,950
I thought so.

202
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,300
I'm fine. They're taking care of me.

203
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,100
You can relax.

204
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
Forgive me.

205
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,900
It's not your fault.

206
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It is my fault.

207
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,500
I was supposed to fly with you, I was supposed to take care of you.

208
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,000
Me and my damn job.

209
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,800
This isn't the time for that.

210
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,900
I was told to tell you that you made the right decision

211
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,900
and that if you follow through, we'll see each other soon.

212
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,400
I need to go.

213
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,500
Be strong.

214
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,260
I swear I'll bring you home.

215
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,800
God willing.

216
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,100
Hello, commander.
-Faraz, how are you?

217
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,600
Very good. I was just about to update you.

218
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,550
Come to my office please and we'll talk face to face.

219
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,500
I'm on my way, sir.

220
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Hello, ma'am.

221
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,590
Go on in, please

222
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,850
Thank you.

223
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,000
Faraz, how are you?

224
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Good to see you.

225
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,350
You too. Thanks.

226
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,590
Come, please sit.

227
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,650
Thank you.

228
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
What did you want to update me on?

229
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,500
Information pertaining to the investigation.

230
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Yeah?

231
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Get something out of Tabrizi?

232
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,100
Not yet.

233
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,500
But I released him.

234
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
I heard about that.

235
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,350
I didn't believe it at first.

236
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,500
Faraz Kamali makes such a sensitive decision on his own?

237
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,000
There was a narrow window of opportunity.

238
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,000
I received information

239
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,650
that he is going to meet with a senior Mossad official in Istanbul tomorrow morning.

240
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,000
So why didn't you update me?

241
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,600
Would you have approved of it?

242
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,000
I wanted to come to you with all the information.

243
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,680
How do you know he won't run away?

244
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,270
He wouldn't leave his wife and daughters here.

245
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,100
Such traitors would sell out their family to escape the rope.

246
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,250
Family is more important than the fear of death.

247
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,800
I released him to see if he would make a mistake.

248
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,400
No matter what we tried,

249
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,200
he denied any connection to Mossad.

250
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,500
Look, you should have informed me!

251
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,590
I'm sorry, I messed up.

252
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,850
How's your wife?

253
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,800
She's fine, fine...

254
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,000
Recovering after her surgery.

255
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,200
She's still in France?

256
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,275
Yes.

257
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,770
When is she supposed to return?

258
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,290
In a few days.

259
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,500
Maybe your wife's situation impacted your judgement.

260
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,000
Certainly.

261
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,000
Certainly.

262
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,100
I haven't touched a cigarette in five years.

263
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,200
This is my tenth one today.

264
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,050
Nahid, my wife, forced me to quit.

265
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,000
Once when I went to get a cigarette out of the box,

266
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,150
I noticed that in place of cigarettes she had put rolled up notes.

267
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,900
Pictures of me, her, the kids, all of us on vacation.

268
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
She told me:

269
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,600
"I can handle the dangers of your work

270
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,600
but I don't want you dying of an illness.

271
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,100
Your death should have a purpose."

272
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,550
Why are you telling me this?

273
00:33:43,275 --> 00:33:47,000
Nahid flew to France a week ago to have brain surgery.

274
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,780
The surgery was a success.

275
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,700
Last night she boarded a return flight. And I...

276
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,890
You have no idea what this is about, do you?

277
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,290
No, I'm sorry.

278
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,000
Is she OK?

279
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,500
God knows where the Israeli bastards took her.

280
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,400
They want you in return.

281
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,800
But I can not let you leave.

282
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,300
This is already too complicated a story,

283
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,390
to bury it.

284
00:34:26,540 --> 00:32:28,900
But you said I need to leave.

285
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,400
Things have changed.

286
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,850
What do you want me to do now?

287
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,580
You have to stay.

288
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,900
Everything will remain as it was.

289
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,900
Your beautiful home, your business,

290
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,550
Your wife and daughters will know nothing.

291
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But from now on, you work for me.

292
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,900
What are you thinking about?

293
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,800
You have no choice.

294
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,800
But I have nothing to give you.

295
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,600
You don't know what I want from you.

296
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,000
And what about your wife?

297
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,195
They wouldn't dare touch her.

298
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,000
Your name is flagged at all border stations,

299
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,000
and even if you somehow manage to get out,

300
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,900
once you set foot outside of Iran,

301
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,670
my first stop will be this house.

302
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,850
You know what I'm getting at, right?

303
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,200
What do you think?

304
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,800
That it's fun to be a fugitive? That it's pleasant and nice?

305
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,490
I love my homeland more than you think.

306
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,090
I'm willing to die for my homeland. Is that clear?

307
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,900
Perfectly.

308
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,300
Excellent.

309
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,700
You're an idiot. You have a great life here.

310
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,520
And if you do a good job, it will stay that way.

311
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,500
Yes,

312
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,300
until they put a bullet in my head.

313
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,600
Bring me Tamar Rabinyan.

314
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,490
And no one will touch you.

315
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,550
Tomorrow at noon,

316
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,000
Meeting with the chief of staff...

317
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,400
Milad Kahani, 25 years old, originally from Shiraz,

318
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:23,150
lived in Tehran for five years,

319
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,950
arrested twice during protests, in 2011 and in 2014, released after a few days,

320
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,800
besides that, clean criminal record.

321
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,000
Do we know where they are now?

322
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,650
In the mountains, outside Tehran.

323
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,390
Rave is illegal, apparently.

324
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,700
Stay on him for now.

325
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Hello.

326
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,050
Is this Mr. Masoud Tabrizi?

327
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,250
Who's asking?

328
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,000
My name is Ellie and I'm with Turkish Airlines. I'm calling you about the flight that left this morning,

329
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,240
I understand you didn't make it in time, is that correct?

330
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,800
That's right. I apologize for not telling you in advance.

331
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,650
No worries, it happens. Are you getting another flight today?

332
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,180
Because if so, I wanted to let you know that you can get up to 50% credit on the ticket you purchased.

333
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,000
Really?

334
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,000
I did not know that.

335
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,100
Would you look at that.

336
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,890
Twenty years in the business and still learning new things every day.

337
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:45,390
Would you like to set an alternative date for today, sir?

338
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,550
No, thank you. I'll fly another day.

339
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,900
Of course.

340
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,550
Have a nice day sir.

341
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Freeze!

342
00:46:47,410 --> 00:48:01,000
Previews not subtitled.

343

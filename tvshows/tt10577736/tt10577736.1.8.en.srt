2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,079
The force went to carry out action tonight,
ahead of the shutdown of the Iranian radar system.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,079
I want to circulate this photo
as much as possible.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,319
Keep looking for her but
do not spread the word.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,519
Let the fish get closer to the rod.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,959
We have a black spot in the area of ​​the sewer.
Satellite observations probably missed it.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,239
Let me go out there.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,279
How could you do this to me?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,479
-Hello
- When you reach the safe house ...

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,839
... activate the evacuation procedure ...

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,919
Good morning, Tamar. How are you?

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,199
... and ask Muhammad to get rid of the Iranian guy.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,839
In the meantime, you are suspended
from your position until further notice.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,319
I hope you join us back soon.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,679
Ali,

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,079
keep working on the case.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,719
And do not listen to anyone.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,479
I want to report to the Prime Minister ...

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,599
... that the planes can stealthily
carry out their mission tonight.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,239
That the pilots have been told to take care.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,759
It will be fine, sir.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,919
Come on team, we have to move.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,359
Gem, Emerald, Ruby, Jade.
"Heaven's Gates" command is activated.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,559
Jade aligns and takes off.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,439
Jade is allowed, good luck to everyone.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,239
Durban One, this is Two
I'm on the road behind you.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,399
One here.
Understood, over.

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,279
How long before they unload?

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,879
Another one and half hour for them to reach. 45 minutes to unload.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,439
Stick the charges and cut off contact.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,399
The pilots will cross the Alpha Point in five minutes.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,279
Ready for further action.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,074

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,239
What was that?

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,519
What is this flash?

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,359
Durban One, you read me?

37
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,599
So, are you going to kill him?

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,919
Kadosh, don't do that.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,239
Those are the procedures.

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,439
He helped us.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,119
He knows too much.  He heard things.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,759
He will not speak.
He will not say anything.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,239
If you had done your task,
then you could have talked.

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,319
But that did not happen.

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,799
Go back to packing.

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,919
Yes?

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,839
Nevo's operation is off.

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,959
What happened?

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,759
It doesn't matter now.

50
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,119
In any case, the planes have taken off.

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,239
I promised the Prime Minister that I would ensure
a clear sky, and that is what it will be.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,519
What do you suggest?

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
You will now contact your source

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,119
and convince him to let us inside the base tonight.

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,279
Whatever he wants in return, you have approval from me.

56
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,319
I will try.

57
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,839
We are not prepared for a nuclear Iran.

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,079
This operation and the lives of the pilots
are in your hands, Yael.

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,799
And you only report to me directly.

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,599
They may have been waiting for Nevo.

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,559
Maybe we have a leak.

62
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,559
Understood.

63
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,599
Hello dear, how are you?

64
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,719
I'm fine.

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,599
Glad to hear your voice.

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,759
We return to our original plan.

67
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,439
But we talked about it.

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,239
It's impossible.  A lot of people
will start asking questions.

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,319
It's a strategic compound.

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,119
Trust me.  I have tried every other way.

71
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,919
Let's mutually find something workable.

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,879
This is our opportunity.

73
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,879
It's going to be very diificult to do,
at such a short notice.

74
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,799
Your girl will have to try very hard to get in.

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,719
We will succeed.

TEHRAN

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,239
Go.

92
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,159
What are you doing here?

93
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,119
 Nothing.  I came to buy a suit...

94
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,359
Anything new on the Israeli agent?

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,359
I cannot talk to you about it.

96
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,479
Why?

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,039
They say you are working with the Israelis.

98
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,759
They are said to have paid for Mrs. Nahid's treatment.

99
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,799
And do you believe that?

100
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,559
Ali, how long have you known me?

101
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,959
Why didn't you report this to Mohammadi first?

102
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,319
Why?

103
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,679
Because he doesn't let us work.

104
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,319
Every time we went to him with full hands,
he waved us away.

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,039
I wanted to circulate the picture of the Israeli agent,

106
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,759
but he did not agree.

107
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,719
He told me to work "secretly."

108
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,559
Why would Muhammadi sabotage us?

109
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,079
Think, Ali.

110
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,679
Get out, please.

111
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,279
Just because of the respect I have for you,
this conversation will remain between us.

112
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,279
If there is anything new,

113
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,158
update me, please.

114
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,199
Every hour.

115
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,799
This is Hayat al-Anbiya.

116
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,799
The command base of the Iranian Air Force.

117
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,679
We have fake credentials and
badges to enter the base.

118
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,839
The problem is, the building.

119
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,279
Upstairs is the server farm.

120
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,199
The login code is changed every 24 hours.

121
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,079
Suppose we manage to get inside,

122
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,759
how long do I have to work inside?

123
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,799
Not much.

124
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,199
The place is manned 24/7, there are technicians there.

125
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,879
I can insert a dongle there and connect,
and then the hack into the system from here.

126
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,559
So, but what about gaining entry into the building?

127
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,119
External security systems are not exactly my domain.

128
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,919
But the military is working with "Iran Security", isn't it?

129
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,159
Yes.

130
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,839
Then we have got Millad.

131
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,919
That's his specialty.

132
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,679
Are you doing this so that I may
have a reason to keep him alive?

133
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,559
I am doing this because I don't have
any other way to get in without him.

134
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,359
And if he helps us, then we should not kill him.

135
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,039
Promise me.

136
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,719
Your weapon.

137
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,839
Thanks.

138
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,679
Either way, it seems impossible to me.

139
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,599
Why?

140
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,839
Only the highest ranking techs were
exposed to military projects.

141
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
God knows what defence systems they have set up there.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,519
I was never exposed to those things.

143
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,999
Let's try.  I'll help you.

144
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,759
It's got nothing to do with that.

145
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,799
So what.. I should tell them you can't do it?

146
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,599
Because if this is where we are, it's the end.

147
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,959
I could try to put the
fingerprints into the system...

148
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,839
... through the computer at the commune.

149
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,079
Great.

150
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,879
Just so you know, I do not cooperate with the Israelis...

151
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,159
... because I love them or because of money.

152
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,519
It's just for us.

153
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,919
These clerics have destroyed the most beautiful country in the world.

154
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,039
You and I can agree on that.

155
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,039
But do not be mistaken,

156
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,319
I do not lower my eyes even for a second.

157
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,559
The smallest mistake...

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,279
... and you will end up like your friend.

159
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,279
Did you check the guy's name and address?

160
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,919
We checked.

161
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,959
I request permission to investigate the commune.

162
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,039
Does that make sense to you?

163
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,039
Do all Israelis work with anarchists?

164
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,679
The engineer from the power company recognized the girl.

165
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,279
I'm telling you this dude is making it all up.

166
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,959
He got involved with a group of conspirators
and is trying to get out of it.

167
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,519
Do you know how many such stories I hear every day?

168
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,999
Send me a detailed report

169
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,919
... and the case will be transferred to the Law Department,

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,199
Let them take care of it.

171
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,799
Ali.

172
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,519
Hope your previous boss will
not serve as a role model for you.

173
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,799
Do not act on your own in such cases.

174
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,679
Yes, sir.

175
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,039
"Ali: Check 13 Istiklal Street."

176
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,559
There are people inside.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,119
Come.

178
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,319
Give me access.

179
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,999
"Shakira: sickboy! from now on I need you to do whatever i tell u."

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,759
"OK ???"

181
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,919
"Sickboy: What do you mean?"

182
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,679
"Shakira: if you want to stay alive, u need to trust me."

183
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,639
"ERROR AB3598733- SSLERROR"

184
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,919

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,519

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,599
"Shakira: what is wrong?"

187
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,239
"Sickboy: Keep getting this error message.
need 2 bypass it.

188
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,279
"ERROR AB3598733- SSLERROR"

189
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,879
What are you writing there?

190
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,279
It's okay. He is working.

191
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,359
I'm on him.

192
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,359
Do not fan.  Everything will burn.
- Rotate it.

193
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,159
I'm in charge of the kebabs, I know what needs to be done.

194
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,559
You forgot.
- I do not like them too roasted.

195
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,039
Do you want it medium?
- He's a great butcher. He's the best.

196
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,959
Who is it?

197
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,119
<i>Salaam</i>, my son.
- Where did he come from?

198
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,999
<i>Salaam</i> sir, what do you need?

199
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,039
I'm looking for my daughter.

200
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,199
I heard that probably she's here.

201
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,599
No way

202
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,479
All the guys here know each other.
We don't allow anyone else in here.

203
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,039
It appears you are here by mistake.
Come, I'll escort you out.

204
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,919
Her name is Zahara.

205
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,399
I already told you.
I said a thousand times I haven't see her.

206
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,239
Shaheen, what's going on here?

207
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,199
<i>Salaam</i>, my daughter.
- <i>Salaam</i>.  Go away..

208
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,318
Go back there, I'll talk to him.

209
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,639
Yes, please.

210
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,039
I'm looking for my daughter.

211
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,879
Her name is Zahara.

212
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,839
But she is known as Zhila Ghorbanifar.

213
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,959
Please...

214
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,559
I just want to talk to her.
See that she's fine.

215
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,959
I want to see how she is..

216
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,279
See, my life has changed since she went missing.

217
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,039
I cannot live, cannot eat.

218
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,079
You can calm down.

219
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,999
I met her. She's fine.

220
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,279
She hooked up with one of the guys.

221
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,479
Really? Is she here?

222
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,119
Did you meet her?

223
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,639
The truth is I haven't seen her in two days.

224
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,519
They are on a trip or something.

225
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,399
One of our friends went missing yesterday.

226
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,959
Maybe they're together.

227
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,439
Try using the old version of the SSL.

228
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,119
"ACCESS GRANTED"

229
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,199
It worked.

230
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,519
Good. Now get the scanner out.

231
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,479
Come with me, please. It's right here.
- Thanks.

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,199
There. He caught her in his net.

233
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,319
Dude, your crocodile tears were
just for the girl? Isn't it?

234
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,839
Don't do this to us. Brother!

235
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,079
Please.

236
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,799
What's the matter with him?

237
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,599
What a strange person. One can
only imagine what all he has in his room.

238
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,439
Does anyone else has a key to his room?

239
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,239
I just want to see that nothing has happened to her.

240
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,479
Maybe one of the guys has a key.
-Thanks.

241
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,199
Come with me, please.

242
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,879
Sure, sure.

243
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,359
Does anyone in the commune have a key to your room?

244
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,119
Go ahead, get this done.

245
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,079
"Shakira: Let me take care of the third scan."

246
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,359
I'm done.

247
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,239
Let's go.
- I need one more second.

248
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,959
No time. Run it.

249
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,599
God bless you for your help.

250
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,119
It's nothing.

251
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,879
I wish my parents
would come to visit me.

252
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,039
Why don't they come?

253
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,199
Why? They don't like to see me like that.

254
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,279
I am not comfortable talking to them.

255
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,839
They are very conservative.

256
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,719
Maybe, a bit like you.

257
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,679
I'm really sorry.

258
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,279
The light is on.

259
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,799
It's Milad.

260
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,599
His room is tidy, for a change.

261
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,999
Milad is a computer man.
-Really?

262
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,039
He has a master's degree in computer science
from Tehran University.

263
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,799
He's a stunning.

264
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,199
Did you see anything?

265
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,719
No, no, it's nothing.
I thought I recognized her handwriting.

266
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,959
OK, shall we go?

267
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,319
Yes, yes, after you.

268
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,799
Please, after you.

269
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,639
What is the situation?

270
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,799
He did it. The records are in the system.

271
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,359
Can he not remain in the vehicle?
It's dangerous to let him inside the military base.

272
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,119
Here's the situation.

273
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,399
I need him in the server room.

274
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,239
If he makes one mistake,

275
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,199
He gets a bullet in the head.

276
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,279
Give me a time estimate.

277
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,679
In another 42 minutes, they will reach
the Kurdish border with Iran

278
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,279
And from there, 31 minutes to action.

279
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,999
They will be enough.

280
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,973
Air Defence Headquarters, Tehran

281
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,719
Yes, please.

282
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,639
We have come for a review and software update.

283
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,039
IDs, please.

284
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,559
Please, go to the end and then turn left,
there is parking.

285
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,679
Thank you.

286
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,439
"Iran Security". Yes, please?

287
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,759
I received an error message on my computer.

288
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,239
Please tell me what that means.

289
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,759
Let me read you the number:

290
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,279
IB-3598733.

291
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,639
What does this mean?

292
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,839
Just a moment sir, I'll check.

293
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,879
You're calling me from Tehran Air Defence
Headquarters, right?

294
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,319
Yes, of course.

295
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,399
Are you a network engineer?

296
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,399
No.

297
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,759
I got it. So please ask one of
Ababil's technicians to contact me.

298
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,639
"Ababil"?

299
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,599
Yes, sir. The error code is related to them.

300
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,279
Hello?

301
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,007
Ababil Technical Headquarters, Tehran

302
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,399
Great game. Liverpool are extremely strong this year.

303
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,719
Barcelona are also strong. Really.

304
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,039
Please come.

305
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Fingerprint.

306
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,239
Please come.

307
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,639
Wait.

308
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,959
Now a fingerprint.

309
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,919
I have to go in.

310
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,359
Sorry, but you're not authorized.

311
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,599
Do me a favor, please.
There's a problem with my fingerprint.

312
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,479
Sorry, I can not let you pass.
- I was specially called at home to come.

313
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,799
I cannot let you pass.

314
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,879
Please, sir.
-Impossible.

315
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,519
At the end of this hallway...

316
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,919
...there is an emergency exit.

317
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,879
Go there now,

318
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,839
And leave.

319
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,039
What do you mean?

320
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,959
I mean you're free to go.

321
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,439
Use the emergency exit,
then take the back gate.

322
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,679
Keep your eyes open at all times.

323
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,559
I'm sorry for everything I did to you.

324
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,079
You didn't deserve it.

325
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,799
I hope you don't remember me as
the worst thing that ever happened to you.

326
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,199
Okay.

327
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,399
Hey, wait.

328
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,759
Listen.

329
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,759
The fact that we got in here so quickly
doesn't make any sense to me.

330
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,999
I wasn't going to say anything, but...

331
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,399
There is no way I could have
got in our fingerprints so quickly.

332
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,879
What could it be?

333
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,759
I don't know.  But it was too easy.

334
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,279
We are inside the building,
on our way to the server room.

335
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,799
Muhammad remained outside, he had
some problem with his fingerprint.

336
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,719
He updated me.

337
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,679
Do you think Milad planned this?

338
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,199
Not possible.

339
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,879
Everything needs to be updated every day.

340
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,959
We're inside.

341
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,039
Excellent. Which row are you at?

342
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,879
AR-4.

343
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,439
Go to row R-6. It's at the southern end.

344
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,759
Are you sure?

345
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,679
It should be in the northern area.
The servers are arranged geographically.

346
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,559
I'm sure, go there.

347
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,599
Kadosh, it looks like a row of backup servers.

348
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,599
This is the sack.  Go to Y-112.

349
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,759
Open the gate.

350
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,559
Wait a minute, sorry.

351
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,039
Sorry, sir.
I need you for a moment please.

352
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,719
Come on!

353
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,199
Come on!

354
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,399
Open the gate.

355
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,999
Sir, what business do you have here?

356
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,119
It is classified.

357
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,759
Open.

358
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,279
But at this time at night,
you must have an entry permit.

359
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,759
You will not face any problem because of this.
Rest assured.

360
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,679
Go open the gate now.

361
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,319
I need a permit.
I'm just following orders.

362
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,919
Can I convey your identity?

363
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,799
No.

364
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,759
No one should know I'm here.

365
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,279
Tell them it's Revolutionary Guards Intelligence.

366
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,159
That should be enough, go.

367
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,279
Go. That's enough.
- Please wait a minute.

368
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,519
Ma'am, stop!

369
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,839
Your bucket.

370
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,679
Where's Milad?

371
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,719
Tower, do you copy?
- Copy.

372
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,759
The princess is out. The hacker is gone.

373
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,119
Send her to the entrance and find him.

374
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,039
Check the base's back exit. He didn't come from here.

375
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,119
Copy that.

376
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,359
Go.

377
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,879
Come, come, come!

378
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,159
Yes.
-We are done at the base,

379
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,359
We're on our way to the apartment.

380
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,319
How long?

381
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,519
Five minutes.

382
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,799
Tamar just needs to run a protocol from home,
and transfer control to you.

383
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,479
I could not wait for you to let him go.

384
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,399
You let your feelings jeopardize this whole operation.

385
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,439
Hallelujah, let the Air Force Command know
that they will continue, we are on schedule.

386
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,999
Air Force Command, you can continue.  We're on schedule.

387
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,039
Yes,

388
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,199
Ali.

389
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,239
<i>Salaam.</i>

390
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,879
I found Tamar.

391
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,319
She and another agent are in
an apartment in northern Tehran.

392
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,239
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

393
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,359
All right.

394
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,159
Send your team.

395
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,519
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

396
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,959
Fast!  Fast!

397
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,959
We have ping from Tehran.
Stabilize it for me.

398
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,999
Status?
-We are stabilizing the connection now.

399
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,039
Route it via satellites.
-How long before we have control of the radar?

400
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,399
It's up to her, if she
routes it to us in parallel.

401
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,039
"Connection established"

402
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,799
That's it. I'm done.

403
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,359
We have control?

404
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,759
Here, that's it.

405
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,279
We did it!

406
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,199
In the left screen you see the real
aerial picture, ours.

407
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,639
On the right screen, this is what the Iranian radar sees.

408
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,079
The Iranian radar is blind.

409
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,639
Hallelujah, report it to the Air Force.

410
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,999
Headquarters, the Iranian radar is disabled.

411
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,559
I repeat, the Iranian radar is disabled.
It is possible to carry out an air assault.

412
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,679
Hello, dear.

413
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,559
Beta, what's the situation?

414
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,439
The mission is complete.

415
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,239
Bye.

416
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,799
Take care of it.

417
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,839
Move on.

418
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,479
The fish took the bait.

419
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,119
The Israeli planes are on their way to the reactor.

420
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,199
Thanks.

421
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,839
The Israeli planes are on their way.
Pay attention and monitor them.

422
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,959
There's a problem.

423
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,719
What?
-Take a look, quickly.

424
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,519
This picture is what the Israel Defense
Forces transmits to Israel.

425
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,919
Now, look at this.

426
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,399
This is the picture of the Iranian radar.

427
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,399
They see the planes.

428
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,439
I thought you had hacked it.

429
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,039
I hacked into the server you told me to,
but it's probably not the right server.

430
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,319
What do you think?

431
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,439
I also connected to another rack
on my own, just in case.

432
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,559
I didn't have time to break into it,
so I only get a signal.

433
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,159
I ran a test now.

434
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,439
We broke into a dummy server.

435
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,399
They tricked us, Kadosh.

436
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,559
No way.

437
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,639
I have no other explanation.

438
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,519
It's your source that directed us to this server, right?

439
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,199
Did he direct you there?

440
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,119
He's a traitor.

441
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,799
I must send it to the country,
so they can get the planes back.

442
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,999
Leave the computer.

443
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,719
Don't say a word about it to anyone.

444
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,559
Kadosh, the planes will be shot down.

445
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,999
Let them fall.

446
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,759
Are you sure the Israelis do not know?

447
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,439
My agent is very reliable.

448
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,199
Do not worry at all.  We will succeed.
There is no need to worry.

449
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,079
We're here.

450
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,199
Entering the apartment.

451
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,519
Stop!

452
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,119
Drop the gun, put your hands on the table.

453
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,599
Hands on the table!

454
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,439
Muhammad, did you hear that?

455
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,279
Muhammad?

456
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,399
Yes.

457
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,799
Call the planes back.
They will be ambushed by missiles.

458
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,519
Why, what has happened? Where is Kadosh?

459
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,519
Kadosh is neutralized. The planes
must return. They are completely exposed.

460
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,519
How is it possible?

461
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,519
I have sent you the real picture of the radar.

462
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,079
Sorry, sir, they knew we were coming.

463
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,599
O God, inform the IAF that the planes
are exposed to the Iranian defence.

464
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,479
Wait a moment. wait a moment.

465
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,559
Wait a moment.

466
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,359
Yesterday...

467
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,319
...just like you, now,

468
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,679
I stood ..

469
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,279
...with a gun, ...

470
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,799
... over your dad's head.

471
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,199
Mordechai.

472
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,439
But I did not kill him.

473
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,559
He is a noble man.

474
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,999
A good man. A good man.

475
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,159
Tamar!

476
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,079
My wife's life ...

477
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,079
... is in your hands.

478
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,999
So ...

479
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,519
please.

480
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,399
Please.

481
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,039
It's time.

482
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,359
One is under attack

483
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,119
Coral One is under attack

484
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,399
We're compromised!  Cancelling radio silence.

485
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,439
We have flown into an ambush.

486
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,959
Aborting operation.

487
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,439
We are under attack Coral One, straight ahead

488
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,076
We are compromised

489
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,079
Operation aborted

490
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,919
Two, break off. Unlock SKA.

491
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,919

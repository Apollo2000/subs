1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,239
Who sent you her? The Guards?

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,439
Engage, engage.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,159
Who is it?

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,039
This is Arezoo

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,119
I need help.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,239
Milad, what's going on?

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,279
With one click, I can pass it on to your boss.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,519
Go ahead, start a fault

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,279
I know, I made a mistake. It was a serious mistake.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,839
In the meantime, you are suspended
from your post until further notice.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,639
Keep working on the case.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,199
We'll find her.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,119
There is a situation where we will get a green light tomorrow.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,279
What happened to Plan A?

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,119
We have a black spot in the sewer canal.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,199
Satellite observations have apparently missed the area.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,559
You promised me some lanes
and they were all supposed to be clean!

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,879
Let me go out there.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,679
"Dear Mordechai. Thank you so much for coming
despite everything. I'm in Room 114."

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,119
Hello, good morning.
-Good Morning.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,679
What is the situation?

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,719
Hello. Good morning to you too.
All is well.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,679
OK, do you have the bag?

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,079
Yes, yes.
-Just a moment.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,759
Hello, Amir. How are you?

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,999
How are you, Ali?

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,719
You know. Anything new?

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,639
I went through the whole country.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,799
There is only one more station with a telemetric connection to the army.

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,399
Secondary station.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,799
I'm now sending you contact details of some senior engineers there.

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,879
Talk to them.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,919
Absolutely. Well done, Amir. Thanks.

Don't touch me, Milad.

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,799
Good morning.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,519
Any news?

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,399
We wait.

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,679
What about him?

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,199
He's fine.

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,119
I want to talk to him.

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,519
That's not a good idea.

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,439
That was'nt a question.

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,279
I'm the only one who goes in to see him. Those are the orders.

61
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,119
Who gave these orders?

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,999
My commanders... and yours.

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,719
Is he OK?

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,279
Is he eating, drinking?

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,159
I'm talking to you!

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,359
We should have killed him back at the apartment.

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,839
We have no need for him.

68
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,079
You should be grateful he is still alive.

69
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,559
Is it you saying that or the commanders?

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,279
I see.

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,078
So I'm telling you:

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,959
If anythin happens to him, it's on you.

73
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,239
Hello, Muhammad.
-Hello.

74
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,279
Good morning, Tamar. How are you?

75
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,519
What are you doing here?

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,679
Come, come, give me a hug.

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,439
Are we doing it?

78
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,359
We'll discuss everything soon, okay?

79
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,359
God, I'm so glad that you're here.

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,119
This is the picture we got from Paris in mail this morning.

81
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,399
This is Mordechai Rabinyan, Tamar's father.

82
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,719
Mordechai landed at Ataturk...

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,119
...three hours and forty minutes
before this picture was taken.

84
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,319
We're still trying to find out
where he went from the airport

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,759
But we assume that it is
one of the hotels in Istanbul.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,079
We can determine this by,
for example, here, on the carpet.

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,959
These are rugs that come from
a large retailer in the north of the city...

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,799
...who works with many hotels in Istanbul.

89
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,319
Therefore, it is our main target.

90
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,399
What about the woman?
- I talked to Dr. Ben Artzi.

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,439
It is too big a risk to put her
on a plane in the next few days

92
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,839
Well, let's talk to Faraz,

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,759
We will the pulse, to decide how to proceed.

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,599
I have already updated Kadosh
regarding the abduction of Mordechai.

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,919
Sir, my daughter is into computers in general.

96
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,599
She is a very good girl, a little cowardly.

97
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,599
A spy of Mossad?

98
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,879
Never!

99
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,879
It's the quality of agents to look innocent.

100
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,159
Because of this they are chosen.

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,399
And what sin have I committed?

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,719
I don't know the world of espionage,

103
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,399
but I thought it also had ethics and humanity.

104
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,599
I get it.

105
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,719
I forgot I was talking to a Revolutionary Guard.

106
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,399
You have long since lost your conscience.

107
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,479
You have destroyed our wonderful country.

108
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,559
I do not want to hear another word from you.

109
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,039
One word!

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,919
Eat your food.

111
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,839
Blessed be the Lord, our God, the King of the world,
the Creator of the earth. Amen"

112
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,879
Behave well. Don't shout and create a mess.

113
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,959
Do you understand?

114
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,439
Hello

115
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,199
You shouldn't have done that.

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,359
This is the only language you people understand.

117
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,359
Faraz, we are giving your wife
the best medical treatment she can get.

118
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,479
We have no interest in hurting her.

119
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,479
We were gonna release her in the next few days.

120
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,239
I don't believe you.

121
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,119
You kidnapped my wife.

122
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,439
Let me talk to her.

123
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
I'm afraid that's not possible right now.

124
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,279
Why not?

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,679
Did something happen to her?

126
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,959
Nothing happened to her. She's getting tests done.

127
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,519
When she stabilizes, we will contact you.

128
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,359
In the meantime, we want to talk to you
about the terms of her release.

129
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,919
The terms are clear.

130
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,239
If my wife doesn't land in Istanbul by midnight...

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,359
...I will execute Mordechai.

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,199
Please, control your emotions.

133
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,959
You have till midnight.

134
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,919
Do not test me.

135
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,079
Well, he managed our cell phone, scrambled the signal, ...

136
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,279
... connecting via a remote exchange in the Stockholm area.

137
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,359
I want us to act on two fronts.

138
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,319
We will strive for the exchange of prisoners
and at the same time try to locate him.

139
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,400
Secondary Power Station, Tehran

140
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,559
Farham Kasrai?

141
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,039
Pleased to meet you.
Can I have a few words?

142
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,079
Very pleasant.
Will I agree to exchange a few words with them?

143
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,439
I'm sorry, did we have an appointment?

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,599
In such matters it is better that it be off the record.

145
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,799
May I?

146
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,599
Well, Mr. Farham,

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,799
How long have you been working at the station?

148
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,639
Fifteen years or so.

149
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,839
Fifteen years?
-Yes.

150
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,199
A long time.

151
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,959
You probably know the systems here
better than you know your wife.

152
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,239
Is everything okay?

153
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,759
Yes. Yes.

154
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,359
Today is a busy day,
and in a few minutes I have another meeting.

155
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,879
Oh, sorry. So let's get down to business.

156
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,239
We recently discovered a serious
security breach in your servers.

157
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,039
It turns out that some of the servers at
the station are connected to military systems.

158
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,519
Could there be such a thing?

159
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,159
Yes, can be.

160
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,839
But this did not crash sir.
There are backup systems.

161
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,359
Is there something that can be disconnected?

162
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,439
I'm not your man.
I will give you the phone of the relevant person.

163
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,599
Would he know which are these servers?

164
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,159
I think he should know.

165
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,079
This is something you should be sure about!

166
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,479
Mr. Sarham ...

167
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,079
What I'm telling you must remain between us.

168
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,919
It seems that foreign agencies are 
trying to hack into these servers...

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,159
...and access military systems.

170
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,519
This should not happen, right?

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,119
Yes.

172
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,119
Come on, let's talk to the security officer.
We'll make sure he does his job properly.

173
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:11,643
OK.

174
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,999
Just let me make a short phone call
and postpone the meeting.

175
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,759
I'll join you after that.

176
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,959
I'll be outside.

177
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,479
What do you say?
He's acting very weird, isn't he?

178
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,919
Milad, this is Farham. Where are you?

179
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,959
Listen, you can 't come in. It's risky now.

180
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,399
I have called off the malfunction.

181
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,479
Do not circulate that video.

182
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,199
Please, you're like my brother.

183
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,239
He has really called it off.

184
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,239
Can you try to get in again?

185
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,919
You have all his details.

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,759
It will take me a while to break through such a thing.

187
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,799
This is the classified area of the station, need a code for it.
He will also immediately receive an alert.

188
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,959
He must do it himself.

189
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,239
You sat with him in the room.
Do you think it is possible to force him again?

190
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,599
If any of us talks to Sarham it will only drive him away.

191
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,439
I saw how he looked at me at the meeting,
he was not exactly in a hurry to trust me.

192
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,639
Milad is our key.

193
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,679
Let me talk to Milad.

194
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,479
I can get him to do it, Kadosh.

195
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,119
Good.

196
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,039
How are you feeling?

197
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,719
Get out.

198
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,879
You should drink.

199
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,319
What's the point?

200
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,759
You're going to kill me
in a second anyway, right?

201
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,839
No one is gonna kill you.

202
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,119
So this is what you are?

203
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,319
An agent?

204
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,239
An Israeli?

205
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,279
I see

206
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,719
And for months you had been setting me up for this.

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,559
All of our chats on the Darknet,
everything we did together.

208
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,119
It was all an act?

209
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,519
It's irrelevant right now.

210
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,119
How could I not see it?

211
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,039
How could you do this to me?

212
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,119
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,799
It was not supposed to hurt you.

214
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,039
If Karim hadn't shown up,
he hadn't threatened me,

215
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,239
Everything would have been alright.
- But that's not what happened! Was it?

216
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,719
No.

217
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,359
That's not what happened.

218
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,799
We have a problem.

219
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,879
Farham called off the malfunction. We can't get in.

220
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,919
Does sounds like your problem.

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,999
And yours, and his.

222
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,679
Why? So you are going to kill us.

223
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,079
Enough. I'm out.

224
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,679
You can do whatever you want.

225
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,679
Milad.
- You don't hear what I am saying?

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,719
I don't believe a single word coming out of your mouth,

227
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,679
And there's no way I'm helping you with anything anymore!

228
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,599
I'd rather die before I help you.

229
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,799
Get out!

230
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,559
You're making a mistake.

231
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,839
It felt so good.

232
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,559
I felt so fucking good.

233
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,030
Istanbul, Turkey

234
00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:59,154
DIVANI CARAVEL

235
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,119
I swear to you that my wife was also my whole world.

236
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,679
Cancer.

237
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,279
So Arezoo told you everything.

238
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,799
My wife's cancer was the symptom,
it was not the cause of her death.

239
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,639
Her difficulties, our difficulties.

240
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
Far from our dear country,

241
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,919
in a new country.

242
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,799
These are the things that killed her.

243
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,319
She died of grief, poor thing.

244
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,879
What were you missing there?

245
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,039
You did not have us on your head.

246
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,559
It was a dream to
immigrate to the Holy Land.

247
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,719
To reach Jerusalem,

248
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,199
To pave in front of the Western Wall.

249
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,439
When I first came to Jerusalem

250
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,759
And I saw the holy wall and
the walls that the Muslims built,

251
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,318
I burst into tears.

252
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,839
What about it?

253
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,759
I'm like an exile there.

254
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,999
The longing for Iran has only intensified year after year.

255
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,519
You do not know how hard it was for me.

256
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,479
If so,why did you leave at all?

257
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,079
I did it just for our daughter.

258
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,999
You succeeded, your daughter, ...

259
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,719
Look what she has done to you.

260
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,159
How are you feeling?

261
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,359
When do I go home?

262
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,799
As soon as we know it's safe for you.

263
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,319
I want to talk to my husband.

264
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,759
In a minute.

265
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,239
I want to talk to you before that.

266
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,879
Your husband kidnapped an innocent Israeli citizen,

267
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,559
And threatening to kill if we don't let you go.

268
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,719
I want this story to be over.
It's unpleasant for me too.

269
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,879
But you can't get on a plane in your condition.
You have to believe me.

270
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,359
If you say so.

271
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,839
Nahid, you have to believe him and explain to your husband.

272
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,879
I do'nt want him to do something he will regret later on.

273
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,759
Calm him down.
Make sure he does not hurt anyone.

274
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,919
He is mentally unstable.

275
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,599
"Mentally unstable"? What choice did you leave him?

276
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,479
What would you do if your wife was kidnapped?

277
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,519
To tell you the truth ...

278
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,679
I don't know if I'd do waht he did.

279
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,799
He loves you too much.

280
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,239
Don't tell your wife that.

281
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,119
No need to worry about.

282
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,719
My wife passed away two years ago.

283
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,439
I don't think that I can help you.

284
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,039
You don't know him.

285
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,639
When he sets his mind on something,

286
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,959
there is no talking to him.

287
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,359
I think you can.

288
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,879
He loves you, he'll listen to you.

289
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,159
You know, many years ago

290
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,479
when I was still working in the field ...

291
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,639
I was in a very bad situation.

292
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,039
I was sure that was it.

293
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,119
My story was over.

294
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,759
I called my wife, even though it was against all orders.

295
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,359
I called her to say goodbye, to say my last words.

296
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,479
I wrote a speech and everything,

297
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,199
But she wouldn't let me read it to her.

298
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,039
She stopped me.

299
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,359
Told me that she doesn't want to hear,
that there is no way that I'm gonna die.

300
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,599
I told her she didn't understand. That was it.

301
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,479
It was over.

302
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,919
Then, instead of arguing with me,

303
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,279
She just started singing me a song.

304
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,999
It was our song.

305
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,679
Sing it.

306
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,759
Better if I don't.

307
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,719
If I have strings, they are playing vibrantly,

308
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,759
If I have a concern - it is almost exposed,

309
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,479
If I have love within myself, it will be uttered quietly,

310
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,759
If I have roots, they will slowly get longer.

311
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,919
You have a terrible singing voice.

312
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,959
Thank you.

313
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,879
What does it mean?

314
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,359
It's about simple love.

315
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,719
Day-to-day love.

316
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,999
Regular things in life.

317
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,319
It's beautiful.

318
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,879
Hello.

319
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,559
How are you?
- How are you?

320
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,439
Thank God. All is well.

321
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,319
I was a little weak and they did not want to take risks.

322
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,359
But now I feel better.

323
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,039
What about you?

324
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,879
I'm worried.

325
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,599
They are treating me well.

326
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,159
Inshallah, we will meet again.

327
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,199
My dear.

328
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,199
They told me you were harassing someone,

329
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,439
An Israeli citizen,

330
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,999
and that you intend to kill him.

331
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,119
Do not believe their lies.

332
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,199
So it's not true?

333
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,839
Are you in our house now watching "Gem TV"?

334
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,239
You know I hate those programs.

335
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,559
Do you see?
So there are benefits of not having me there.

336
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,879
You do not have to sit and watch my Turkish series with me.

337
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,959
My dear.

338
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,479
You promise me
that you did not go too far for me?

339
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,319
God will not return you of His good will.

340
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,839
Release him.

341
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,719
Nahid ...

342
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,239
I'm not in the position of boarding a plane right now.

343
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,159
His jammer is turned,
there is no ID on his location yet.

344
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,639
It will take a few days. Be patient.

345
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,559
My dear, do not be as cruel as them.

346
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,879
Do not hurt him.

347
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,999
I can not make such a promise.

348
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,319
I swear to you that I will bring you home.

349
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,759
Nahid.

350
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,279
My dear.

351
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,639
It hurts me that you are speaking on their behalf.

352
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,639
Promise me you'll not talk to them anymore.

353
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,239
Nahid?

354
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,159
I'm serious.

355
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,039
Hello.

356
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,719
I have no stregth left to talk now...

357
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,599
I miss you,

358
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,799
your voice, your hug.

359
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,559
Let's talk about ourselves.

360
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,439
Let them listen. Damn them.

361
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,639
I just want to hear your voice.

362
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,479
What do you want me to say?

363
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,439
I want you to sing.

364
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,199
Faraz, I'm very tired. I just want to sleep.

365
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,519
WIll you sing to me?

366
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,319
My dear, I'm not in a position to sing.

367
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,119
If you still want

368
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,159
"Let's be friends

369
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,719
"And as in days gone by

370
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,999
We will sit together and rise together at dawn

371
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,039
"Your heart needs to be refreshed

372
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,839
"Adopt a new tune

373
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,719
OK, he's using a jammer,

374
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,999
But the algorithm will recognize the song among
all the conversations going on in Istanbul.

375
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,839
"If you want to stay with me

376
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,999
"Come as long as we're young

377
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,119
"Come as long as there is skin left on the bones

378
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,119
“Do not let my heart be left alone

379
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,359
"Let my night get a new color

380
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,999
"Get a new tune

381
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,999
"Get the color of the country

382
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,199
"Where you will not leave me alone"

383
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,479
Bingo.

384
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,759
Be strong, my love.

385
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,319
I love you.

386
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,359
See you soon.

387
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,679
I promise.

388
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,839
Excuse me, may I?

389
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,519
Is she OK?

390
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,239
Did you talk to her?

391
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,439
Go back inside.

392
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,759
It's a little hard for me to sit there.

393
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,799
I told you to get inside!

394
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,279
Go inside traitor Zionist Dog! Go in!

395
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,439
You immigrated at age 6. I immigrated at age 15.

396
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,839
All my childhood / adolescence, was spent here.

397
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,479
I studied in a Muslim school.

398
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,999
But the moment I immigrated to Israel,

399
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,559
I felt like a foreigner.

400
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,599
About a year ago I came back here for the first time.

401
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,199
I was sent to contact ...

402
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,959
.. a senior officer. To lure him in,
to let us inside a classified base.

403
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,759
Air Force Headquarters.

404
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,959
Yes, I heard about it.

405
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,119
We were in a relationship for a few months,

406
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,279
Then the relation slipped to ..

407
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,479
places he was not supposed to.

408
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,839
Every time I looked at him,

409
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,679
I felt like I was looking at
one of the boys in the neighborhood.

410
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,359
I had a relationship with him
that I did not have with any Israeli.

411
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,359
Tamar,

412
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,319
I'm the first person to understand you and 
know how easy it is to get carried away.

413
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,639
Do not make that mistake.

414
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,879
Do not forget who you rally are.

415
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,719
Now, go to him.

416
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,359
Speak to his heart, but not from your heart.

417
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,119
From your head.

418
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,439
Kadosh...

419
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,839
That officer you talked about

420
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,599
Where is he now?

421
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,839
It does not matter.

422
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,079
For me, he is dead.

423
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,999
You just don't understand the situation you're in.

424
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,799
What the organization behind me is capable of.

425
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,559
What is that supposed to mean?

426
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,119
Do you think you're the only one they've got a target on?

427
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,279
They want to hurt your family.

428
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,239
Bullshit.

429
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,679
You want me to show you the
background check they ran on you?

430
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,359
Do not let your ego cause you harm.

431
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,239
Ego?

432
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,039
My friend was murdered right in front me.

433
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,879
And they will hurt the others.

434
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,239
What are you protecting here anyway?

435
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,439
The regime you hate?

436
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,239
I'm trying to save you here.
How can you not see that?

437
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,919
If it was up to them,
they would have killed you back at the commune.

438
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,519
If this mission is a success, they'll let you go.

439
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,759
But you have to help us.

440
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,479
Call Farham.

441
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,599
Calm him down.

442
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,319
Tell him everything is going to be OK,
because it really <i>is</i> going to be OK..

443
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,519
Hello.

444
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,359
How are you, friend?

445
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,799
Why have you called me?

446
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,039
You have called off the malfunction.

447
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,559
I had no choice.

448
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,479
Did not get my message?

449
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,279
Farham, you must relax.

450
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,839
Enough of that.

451
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,199
I can not do this for you

452
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,439
Farham ...

453
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,839
Your video is just the beginning.

454
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,879
We'll tell your wife
about all the girls you caressed.

455
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,239
And also sent to the Revolutionary Guards
your agreement to cooperate with us.

456
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,999
Everything is documented. Make no mistake.

457
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,679
Do not play with us.

458
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,220
I beg of you.

459
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,359
Don't do this.

460
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,999
Reinitiate the malfunction.

461
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,999
I've opened.

462
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,479
We got it.

463
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,999
Farham ...

464
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,479
Do not worry, bro.

465
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,639
You did a good job.

466
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,599
Khusru, take him with us.

467
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,399
What?
- Get up, traitor.

468
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,959
You promised me I'm going to be fine.

469
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,239
I did not promise anything.

470
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,959
Sir, we must talk about this more.
- Move.

471
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,839
You did the smart thing.

472
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,879
You know, I feel sorry for you.

473
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,399
Although I'm the one tied to this bed,

474
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,839
between the two of us,

475
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,559
I'm the free one.

476
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,399
You're the prisoner.

477
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,639
Your soul is black.

478
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,759
And I'm sure that if you were in my position,

479
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,199
you would give up you whole family, wouldn't you?

480
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,399
Because that's how it works in your world, right?

481
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,879
Anything you touch, is doomed to die.

482
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,599
Are you satisfied with your action?

483
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,599
Totally.

484
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,439
We'll do it.

485
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,119
The planes will be able to take off.

486
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,199
Good.

487
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,519
Take care of yourself.

488
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,919
Good luck.

489
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,159
We got a green light.

490
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,199
Come on, go get ready.
We leave in another 50 minutes.

491
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,079
"Your father is in the hands of the the Revolutionary Guards."

492
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,479
"Surrender yourself by tonight or else
he will pay for your crimes."

493
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,759
Tamar, what's going on?

494
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,879
Tamar?

495
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,159
Is this true?

496
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,239
How did this reach you?
-Answer me.

497
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,359
He is not a member of the Revolutionary Guards,
nor is he in Iran.

498
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,719
So where is he? What...?

499
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,239
It happened this morning.
We'll deal with it with all our might.

500
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,479
Why did you not tell me this?
-Tamar...

501
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,439
I know it's impossible but I'm asking you
to step up and put it aside for now.

502
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,559
Look at me.

503
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,999
Our best people are on it.

504
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,039
They'll bring him back, I swear to you.
- They'll kill him ...

505
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,839
He's going to die, I know how it works.
-They will not.

506
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,599
They will not.

507
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,439
I ask you to disconnect.

508
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,959
By the time we return,
he will already be in safe hands.

509
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,479
I can not.
I can not.

510
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,759
The alternative? We wait?

511
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,399
We have already come this far, it is the right thing to do.

512
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,679
Let's do it.

513
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,439
Let's go.

514
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,479
Come on.

515
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,239
Let's do it.

516
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,439
Come on.

517
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,439
Wait for my command.

518
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,519
Hi, good evening.
-Hello, good evening.

519
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,039
We just called from the road.
We booked a room with a queen size bed.

520
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,439
Tina and Paul Richardson.

521
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,519
Passports, please.

522
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,159
OK, they have connected to the hotel's network.
Now you'll find me his room.

523
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,319
Team 3.

524
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,199
What is the situationn at the back entrance?

525
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,239
Nothing at the back entrance.

526
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,519
Where the hell are they?

527
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,319
Come back, log in, check if the malfunction is still closed.

528
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,039
Tamar ...

529
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,279
What's going on?

530
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,879
I cannot find it.

531
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,199
The malfunction?

532
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,959
The system. I cannot find it.

533
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,839
It's there. Look properly.

534
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,999
I'm not feeling well.
-Hey!

535
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,119
Ali, look there.

536
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,319
There's a commercial vehicle there
that's probably been waiting for a long time.

537
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,239
Omid, wait for two or three minutes,

538
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,439
And if it does not move, we will go to it .

539
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,159
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

540
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,759
Hello

541
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,439
They're coming.

542
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,999
When did they arrive?

543
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,919
Just now.

544
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,359
They're on their way up.

545
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,479
Thank you.

546
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,799
Get up.

547
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,759
What happened?
-Get up.

548
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,999
What happened?
- Kneel down.

549
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,239
Go inside.

550
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,119
Go inside slowly.

551
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,919
Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, one Lord

552
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,199
She knows about her father.

553
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,519
Apparently she had left a channel open with him.

554
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,199
She is not able to settle down.

555
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,159
Why did you not report this to me?

556
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,159
This is a one-time opportunity.
I thought it would be fine, that it would succeed.

557
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,879
Well, Yael, your story is over.

558
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,399
Put her in the vehicle and drive away.

559
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,159
The planes take off immediately
and I take Nevo off.

560
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,919
Go.

561
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,799
They're moving. It's not them.

562
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,599
Clear.

563
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,359
Find him.

564
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,879
Did you hear that?

565
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,079
Gem, Emerald, Ruby, Jade.
"Heaven's Gates" command is activated.

566
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,359
Ruth. Gem lining up and taking off. Ruth.

567
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,159
Ruby and Emerald align! Take off at the same time.

568
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,519
Permission to cross over after takeoff.

569
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,119
Ruby and Emerald are allowed to take off
and cross over me on the left turn.

570
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,839
Jade aligns and takes off.

571
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,999
Jade is allowed, good luck to everyone.

572
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,519
Get me Nevo please.

573
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,599
Nevo, Nevo, you hear?

574
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,279
How are you, Nevo?

575
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,039
Excellent.
- The planes just took off.

576
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,359
I want to report to the Prime Minister

577
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,359
that the planes can carry out
their mission tonight, quietly.

578
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,039
That the pilots have been told to take care.

579
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,559
It will be fine, Sir.

580
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,719
Come on team, we move.

581
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,319
What's going on?

582
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,799
Yossi. Pass it on to me, please.

583
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,839
Tamar.

584
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,799
I'm handing you your dad.

585
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,039
They released him now.

586
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,679
Dad?

587
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,039
My soul?

588
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,599
My dear.

589
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,239
Are you crying for me? Do not cry.

590
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,039
Do not cry.

591
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,039
My soul. Do not cry.

592
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,679
My dear.

593
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,319
Do not cry.

594
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,319
Hello.
-When you arrive at a safe house,

595
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,839
initiate evacuation procedure,
and ask Muhammad to get rid of the Iranian guy.

596
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,720
This is Hatem al-Anbiya.

597
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,260
The command base of the Iranian Air Force.

598
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,920
We have fake credentials and badges

599
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,040
to get us into the base

600
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,420
The problem is entry into the building.

601
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,140
There is a fingerprint ID system at the gate.

602
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,100
Any ideas?

603
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Another 42 minutes

604
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,180
and they reach the Kurdish border with Iran.

605
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:16,604
And from there 31 minutes to action.

606
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,160
Please. I can save you.

607
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,560
Have you checked the guy's name and address?

608
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,000
We checked.

609
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,880
I need permission to investigate the commune.

610
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,400
I'm looking for my daughter.

611
00:45:36,305 --> 00:46:36,243

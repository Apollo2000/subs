2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,159
Make sure Mr. Tabrizi gets to Istanbul unharmed

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,119
within the next 24 hours.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,719
In return, your wife will be brought
back to Iran, alive and well.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,159
Hi Mordechai. I'm Noya, Tamar's commander.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,279
Could you get things out of Tabrizi?

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,199
Not yet.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,639
In the meantime, I released him.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,399
Faraz Kamali makes a decision
in such a sensitive matter on his own?

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,039
I have a plan for action.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,279
What is it?
- I have a contact to enter the secondary station.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,639
If it's not too late,
we can try to get in from there.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,759
I've made contact with a group opposed to the regime.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,879
Do not try to get her out of Iran
until the planes return to Israel.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,439
Will they continue without us?

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,599
No.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,916
Then...

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,479
When Plan A fails,
we move to Plan B, Kadosh.

Stop!

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,639
Please leave your message after the tone...

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,879
I know you shot Masoud Tabrizi.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,359
The deal was that I let him go.

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,919
You gave me your word.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,639
Give her back to me.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,639
Or, I swear... One day

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,879
I'll look you into your eye
and blow your head off.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,479
I promise.

TEHRAN

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,239
Nahid's surgery is an expensive affair, right?

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,439
Specially abroad.

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,559
As you paymaster, I know
it can be quite expensive.

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,719
There are things on which no expenses should be spared.

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,679
But what if there is no money?

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,639
We might get help from someone.

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,159
Groups that can offer
financial or medical assistance

51
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,319
Sir,  I'm sorry, but I hope this is
not what you're thinking.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,959
After all, I have given my life for the country!

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,039
I know, I made a mistake, a serious mistake.

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,759
Maybe because ...

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,879
My wife's condition interfered with my thinking.

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,239
I really hope for your sake that it was the only that.

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,159
In the meantime, you are suspended
from his post till further notice.

58
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,479
I will personally investigate what happened here.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,519
You can go.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,239
If you'll excuse me.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,559
This is Tehran's secondary power station.

62
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,559
This is Sahran's secondary power station.

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,039
Once we had tried to operate through it,
but we did not find a reliable enough contact.

64
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,879
This is Farham Kasrai, the chief engineer

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,159
And this is Milad Kahani, opposes the Regime
and is a middle agent that Tamar is handling.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,159
Milad has expressed his intent
to carry out an act of protest at the station.

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,959
We have a reasonable basis to believe
that Farham is going to help him.

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,078
So Tamar can seize the opportunity to
inject the virus into the system and paralyze the radars.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,039
Same action. Another station.
A strong backstory.

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,799
The difference is that your agent is burned, Yael.

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,599
She is on the run.
- I know, but still ...

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,319
Besides, I have an active team in Shasach.
I cannot endanger it.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,959
Nevo's operation is highly risk.
- Also our agent-.

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,519
We know that Faraz Kamali's department
is looking for Tamar,

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,119
and yet no officer of the Revolutionary Guards
has issued an official statement,

76
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,279
or released a picture of hers.

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,479
In addition to all this, we have a direct
connection to Tamar and Milad's mobiles

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,719
And we know, at any given moment, what her situation is.

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,119
Gorev, we have a real opportunity here
to execute to repeat the action plan.

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,439
Thank you.

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,279
Next time on me.
Goodbye.

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,159
Wow.

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,039
You think that's funny?

84
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,079
Think we're the only ones in here.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,399
I need to take a shower.

86
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,839
Hello, get here.

87
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,199
No, no...

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,359
No.

89
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,879
Listen, we're meeting him in half an hour.

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,679
I have to take a shower.

91
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,759
You smell like a dog.

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,079
Stay! stay.

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,239
Spin.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,279
Good boy.
- Yeah?

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,759
You're cute.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,839
And I'm going to take a shower.

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,719
Okay.

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,239
Hello.

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,279
We have permission to move ahead

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,639
OK.

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,679
We need the consent of the engineer,
it is critical.

102
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,039
Do you think Milad will do the work for us?

103
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,439
Yes, I trust him.

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,159
OK. In another 20 minutes you must find
a way to go down without Millad knowing.

105
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,759
A white commercial vehicle will be waiting for you there.

106
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,079
We'll move forward from there.

107
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,799
How are you, boss?

108
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,399
All right.

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,479
I heard just now.
I'm really sorry.

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,679
I needed some vacation.

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,079
Did you want something?

112
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,279
Just wanted to see that you're fine.

113
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,119
Why did you release him?
I know you.

114
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,879
It was not appropriate for you to do such a thing.

115
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,799
I had my reasons.

116
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,519
I made a mistake.

117
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,799
Still, why?

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,759
I hope you are back with us soon.

119
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,279
Thanks.

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,879
Ali.

121
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,199
Keep working on the case.

122
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,759
And do not listen to anyone.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,519
The agent is still in Tehran. She continues to operate.

124
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,879
Talk Cyber guys about IEC data.

125
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,479
We'll find her.

126
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,239
Hello.

127
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,519
Peace and blessings.

128
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,639
Do you know how to wear it?

129
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,199
Yeah

130
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,759
Hello.

131
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,919
Tamr, the plan is like this

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,159
For you to physically enter the compound,
the engineer must report a fault in one of the air conditioners.

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,039
Obviously.

134
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,199
You better let Milad do it for you.

135
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,239
Muhammad will be within listening distance of you,
and you need to listen continuous.

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,439
I got it.

137
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,919
Good luck, Tamar.

138
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,879
I trust you.

139
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,479
"Detention rooms"

140
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,839
Hello Mr. Manushar, how are you?

141
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,359
Good. how are you?

142
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,559
In what are you watching?
- Esteghlal's game against Persepolis.

143
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,239
Ya Allah. This year Esteghlal messed up.

144
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,919
You fans of Persepolis, always say that.

145
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,639
No way? This year they ...

146
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,039
Well dear, thanks.

147
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,799
Don't mention it.

148
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,719
Who is it?
- It's Karim.

149
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,679
Call him back later.

150
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,319
I can't.

151
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,999
Hello brother.

152
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,159
Where are you? Did you return to Tehran?

153
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,039
Jilla did not feel well. She was down seriously.

154
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,279
Where are you?

155
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,679
Why are you fucked up?!

156
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,839
You ruined all our sales.

157
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,599
I did not ruin anything.
I explained everything to Raza.

158
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,319
You have to do things
your own way.

159
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,679
And don't let this fuck
hold you by the balls.

160
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,799
You know what? Drink a glass of water,
relax and then call me.

161
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,479
What did he want?

162
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,439
Nothing. Fuck him.
He thinks I work for him.

163
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,799
You know...

164
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,359
We're doing something great.

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,279
I know.

166
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,519
Something this country will never forget.

167
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,079
Yeah.

168
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,879
Come on.

169
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,679
Shaheen.

170
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,879
Something happened?

171
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,159
Say, Milad said his girlfriend
worked for the electricity company?

172
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,479
Dude, I do not remember my name now.

173
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,919
Shaheen, think for a moment.

174
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,879
Dude, leave me alone, come on.

175
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,879
Ask Mohsin, he worked there.

176
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,719
He knows all the glasses that were there.

177
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,799
Right, absolutely. Thanks.

178
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,119
Good luck

179
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,399
There he is.

180
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,879
Hi.

181
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,279
What does it sound like, honey?

182
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,039
This is the first time I see you like a
businessman. Everything is fine?

183
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,319
Cheers. I'm fine.

184
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,799
Like it? Do you like it?

185
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,159
This is Zahara, a good friend, one of our own.

186
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,599
What a beauty. Hello.
- Very nice.

187
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,039
And, so what is the secret work
that you had with me?

188
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,359
If it's the commune's electricity bill,
consider it done. I'll fix it.

189
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,599
Thanks, bro

190
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,479
They are wasting electricity like
a Bitcoin rig.

191
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,879
Well, what?

192
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,399
Dude, you're one of us.
Your heart is in the right place.

193
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,799
And so we know
that we can trust you.

194
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,199
Farham.

195
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,359
Zahara and I have planned something.

196
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,959
We need you to let us inside your workplace.

197
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,839
We guarantee we will cover you completely.
Nothing will come back to you.

198
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,519
Where do you want to go?
-To the server farm.

199
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,319
What's there?

200
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,559
We want to black out
The Broadcasting Authority complex.

201
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,159
You've gone completely crazy.

202
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,439
Not exactly. Gradually we want them to hear us.
That's the only way.

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,919
Entire Iran will hear us.
Through television and radio.

204
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,679
Man, this is the most classified place in the building.
If we get caught, we'll all go to jail!

205
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,279
I just promised you, didn't I?

206
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,959
I said no one would trace it to you.

207
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,599
You only have to do one thing
Report a technical glitch.

208
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,679
No, no. Forget it.

209
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,719
This is not a good idea at all. Forget it!

210
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,559
Farham.

211
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,079
Trust us.

212
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,919
Trust Milad. He loves you.

213
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,439
He will never let anything happen to you.

214
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,119
He told me you're one of us.

215
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,719
That you also do not want your children
to grow in these existing conditions.

216
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,079
And you think it's going to change anything?
- It'll change, bro.

217
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,119
This way, you will burn yourself-.
- Do not be cynical.

218
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,959
These protests help. If we keep up the pressure,
something will eventually change in this country.

219
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,479
All we ask is that you open a fault
in the air conditioner in the server room.

220
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,559
That's all.

221
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,719
It will have nothing to do with you. No connection.

222
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,519
It does not work that way.
We cannot work with any company that comes to us.

223
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,399
This company "Hava Paradise" Company.
They work with you.

224
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,319
Come on, give us a "yes."

225
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,959
Farham dude, one day you can narrate this
to your children. What do you say?

226
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,439
You are devastating.
- Do not spray me!

227
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,279
I was pregnant with you.
-Do not lace 0s me!

228
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,879
I'm devastated at you.
- Don't make me all wet!

229
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,439
When you return, report
a technical fault. OK?

230
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,719
Let me go back first.
I'll call you later.

231
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,399
Milad, when will you leave me alone?

232
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,479
Love you to death.

233
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,479
You think he's gonna do it?

234
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,999
Yes. He's in.

235
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:29,823
But Yam, Israel

236
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,959
Hello.

237
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,479
Hello, who is this?

238
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,119
Mordechai?

239
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,119
Who is it?

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,639
This is Arezoo.

241
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,999
Who is it?

242
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,599
It's really me, Kolocha.

243
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Kolocha?

244
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,999
What?

245
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,999
How are you?

246
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,959
Not good. Not good at all.

247
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,919
I need help.

248
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,159
Mordechai, do you hear?

249
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,399
Say, do you need help?

250
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,119
Are you not ashamed?

251
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,159
Where have you been all these years?

252
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,519
Your sister lay dying of cancer
and you did not answer her phone

253
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,639
For months cancer ate her beautiful body.

254
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,999
And you did not answer!

255
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,679
What happened?
What do you want?

256
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,759
Arezoo?

257
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,119
You have every right to be angry with me.

258
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,519
I'm sorry for what I did but

259
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,999
you're the only person in the world who can help me.

260
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,159
I have to get out of Iran.

261
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,719
Otherwise ...

262
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,039
What happened?

263
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,999
I have to get out of here.

264
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,159
I want to come to you, to Israel,

265
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,159
But they said at the embassy
that I am not a Jew.

266
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,839
You have to come to Turkey
and to testify that I am a Jew.

267
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,279
Otherwise they will not let me into Israel.

268
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,599
What about your family?

269
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,799
I have no other family left.

270
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,919
I'll explain everything to you when we meet, okay?

271
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,559
Too bad you did it, Arezoo.

272
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,399
I'm not a healthy person.

273
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,759
Mordechai, I need you.

274
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,199
I have to finish now, but

275
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,439
I will send you all the details later.

276
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,959
I mean, what certificates do I need.

277
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,519
I pray that you find a place in your
heart to forgive me and come.

278
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,639
One word to someone,

279
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,919
and you will never see the sunlight.

280
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,999
Clear?

281
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,159
O my God ...

282
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,079
Have you cooked?

283
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,479
Don't touch it.
- What?

284
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,239
Hey, whoa, whoa, don't touch it. Stop. Be patient.

285
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,559
Thank you.

286
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,399
- Either you leave or you help.

287
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,759
Where you learned to cook like that?

288
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,119
My mom. She was an amazing cook.

289
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,559
Was?

290
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,559
Has she passed or something?

291
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,879
No. No, she just ...

292
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,439
...  doesn't cook as much any more.

293
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,359
She'd think this was funny, see me like this?

294
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,159
Funny? What do you mean?

295
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,759
I don't know. Here, cooking.

296
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,399
She'd laugh.

297
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,559
Was it weird for he that you came back?

298
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,439
No.

299
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,799
No, she and my father, they never
really settled in over there.

300
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,559
I mean, there're still totally Persian.
They just have a different passport.

301
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,199
Yeah.

302
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,839
It's not easy to be an immigrant
and still they did it, for us.

303
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,359
Yeah leaving is hard.

304
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,639
You know, I consider it sometimes, but ...

305
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,439
I think I love this country too much.

306
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,519
Hey, what's up?

307
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,079
Nothing, just..

308
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,879
What's wrong?
- I just miss them.

309
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,839
Hey, hey, come here. Come here.

310
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,479
You'll see them soon.
-Yes.

311
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,199
Hi, what's going on with Farham?

312
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,999
I don't know. I haven't heard from him.
- You should talk to him.

313
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,399
I don't want to pressure him.
-So don't pressure, just ...

314
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,439
... ask him what's up.

315
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,079
May be, even invite him over for dinner.

316
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,319
You said he is softer when he is high.

317
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,879
Yeah, he is.

318
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,599
Ah, alright. I'll call him, okay?

319
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,839
Hello, Dude.

320
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,359
Kadosh: Dear, you are progressing excellently

321
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,919
Koach Nevo is located in the hiding place here.

322
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,839
He is 27 miles from the radar base, which protects the miners in Barak.

323
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,639
The force will go tonight in advance,
and the Iranian customs system will be shut down.

324
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,919
The action tonight includes a scan
of the final access routes to the destination,

325
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,519
And implanting technological means
towards the laying of explosives, tomorrow.

326
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,999
Nevo.

327
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,479
We have two security rings around the facility.
Three shifts a day.

328
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,159
The dead zones correspond to the route
of the terrain  and time shifts alternate.

329
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,199
What about the cargo
-Correct.

330
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,999
The transformers also arrived safely.
Tomorrow before entry we will wire them.

331
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,119
Meyer?

332
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,919
Let's advance to the entrance lane.

333
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,159
Fine.

334
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,919
So we are operating through the I-301 route.

335
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,039
I have an hour and fifty minutes for quiet action.
Simple land route.

336
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,399
What about 401?

337
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,879
What, the sewer pipe?

338
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,839
No, no, it's more complicated and longer,
and it leads to a brighter area as well.

339
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,959
Well, then we should actually go in through there.
That's less predictable, isn't it?

340
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,479
Eran.

341
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,599
I agree. This is a possibility.

342
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,359
The updates you requested.
-Thank you.

343
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,759
Magnify.

344
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,559
It seems better to me.

345
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,079
Wait, zoom in.

346
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,799
How are you, Amir?

347
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,959
Blessed be God.

348
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,239
Say, what's up with the IEC protocols?

349
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,959
This is not a simple case, this is a serious hacker.
He managed to hide many of his actions.

350
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,719
So much so that an entire department
can't figure out what happened there?

351
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,679
I understand this is urgent.

352
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,439
We do not yet have an unequivocal answer,
but we have a hypothesis.

353
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,839
What is that?

354
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,039
There are old connections of emergency backup
systems between the IEC and military units.

355
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,519
This means that there is a chance that ...

356
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,919
...that he was trying to break into the military system?

357
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,199
Exactly.

358
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,519
Which system, to be exact?

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,759
We have not been able to find that.

360
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,399
You are telling me that a hacker
who enters a civilian power station...

361
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,919
...can also break into the army?

362
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,719
No. Only from the main station.
I do not think it is possible from the small stations.

363
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,399
Are you sure?
-No.

364
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,079
OK, OK, OK.

365
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,799
Run a check on all the stations in the country.

366
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,199
If there is a problem with any of them, let me know.

367
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,599
All right.
-Urgently, Amir

368
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,039
All right.

369
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,919
So, what shall we drink to?

370
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,959
Our mission?

371
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,719
Let's drink to us.

372
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,039
To us.
- Yeah.

373
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,159
Wait, wait, wait. I have a little surprise.

374
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,999
For you.

375
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,399
Wow.
- Yeah?

376
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,159
Let me put it on.

377
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,439
When did you buy it?
- I didn't.

378
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,119
It was my mother's.

379
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,159
Not exactly my mother's. She made it.

380
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,919
She came from a family of jewelers.

381
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,759
And I think she would have wanted me to give this to you too.

382
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,879
I'm sure there would be someone...
- No, look, ...

383
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,639
I know what you're going to say, I'm ...

384
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,599
I'm not trying to make you stay.

385
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,879
I understand your situation.

386
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,519
But I don't want you to forget me.

387
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,279
So you like it?

388
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,559
Very much.
-Yeah?

389
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,279
Thank you.
- Alright.

390
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,119
Let's eat before Farham comes.

391
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,399
Bon appetite!

392
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,559
Wow!

393
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,399
Looks amazing.

394
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,599
You cook all this?

395
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,279
Karim, what're you doing here?
I thought you would be at the rave.

396
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,239
I missed you guys.

397
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,759
Do you mind if I join?
I'm so hungry.

398
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,199
You guys... celebrating something

399
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,319
Jilla is leaving tomorrow.

400
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,199
Leaving? Where to?

401
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,479
Back to her family in Qatar.

402
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,999
But you only just got here.

403
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,439
Is everything okay between you two?

404
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,679
Everything is great.

405
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,919
Then why are you leaving?

406
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,839
It's none of your business.

407
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,140
It's very much my business.

408
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,959
There are no secrets in our commune.

409
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,319
Isn't that right, Milad?

410
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,319
Your name is Jilla Gorbanifer, right?

411
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,559
Yes.

412
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,199
Then, how come I can't find you on any social media?

413
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,679
Nothing. Zero.

414
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,999
I don't go on any of those.

415
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,159
But you're on the DarkNet.

416
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,479
You are starting with that again?
-Milad, shut up.

417
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,399
You gave her a test, she passed it, right?
-Milad, shut up.

418
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,839
She passed it, right!
- Millad shut your mouth and stop stroking your cock.

419
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,559
I want to understand who the girl sitting here is.

420
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,319
What's her story?

421
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,799
From the start she seemed suspicious to me.

422
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,719
Muhammad, approach the building.

423
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,799
Is it about the electric company?

424
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,319
We are all freedom fighters.

425
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,319
The Regime is dying to plant its agents in here.

426
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,239
I want answers now,
or she's not going anywhere!

427
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,719
I'm not an agent.

428
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,879
I did work for the electric company but I quit.

429
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,519
And I'm leaving Iran, so...

430
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,919
That's it.

431
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,959
OK.

432
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,079
Then, who's this?

433
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,319
This is the real Jilla Gorbanifer.

434
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,319
Her boss was murdered and her husband committed suicide.

435
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,479
But this is not Jilla Gorbanifer, you dickhead.

436
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,239
Is this true?

437
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,399
Eh?

438
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,399
Listen, I can explain ...

439
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,799
Who sent you here, the guards?
-Karim!

440
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,759
Engage, engage!

441
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,759
Tell me your name?

442
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,199
My brother, calm down.

443
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,159
Where are you going?

444
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,319
Shit!

445
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,999
Put the knife down.

446
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,359
No! Don't touch him!

447
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,079
Don't touch Millad, I need him.

448
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,559
Trust me.

449
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,839
Kadosh, we need him.

450
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,919
Muhammad, don't shoot.

451
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,639
Take care of the scene.
The contact will arrive in a few minutes.

452
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,639
Give me your phone.

453
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,119
Give me your phone!

454
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,159
Milad: "Are you coming here? When?"
Farham: "Reaching in 20 minutes."

455
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,559
When he gets here,

456
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,759
do exactly what I tell you.

457
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,919
Both your lives depend on it.

458
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,639
Hi, Bro.
- Hello, man.

459
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,879
What's going on? Everything is fine?

460
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,639
Hello.
- Hello.

461
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,879
Come here.

462
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,239
Hello - come to me.

463
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,599
I see you started without me.

464
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,959
Come on, come on, we've left  for you too.
- Really?

465
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,479
Can i arrange for myself?

466
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,879
Can I get a line?

467
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,119
Anyone interested?

468
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,199
Nah, I had enough.

469
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,359
As you wish.

470
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,599
Millad.

471
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,839
What's up with you, bro?

472
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,919
What happened?

473
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,039
OK, Muhammad, if Milad betrays us,
you go in and you do what you have to do.

474
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,559
What's the matter with your friend?

475
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,719
I don't know.

476
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,559
I haven't slept in a few days.

477
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,039
Did not sleep?

478
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,759
Too much fun, huh?
May you be healthy.

479
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,599
Did you think about what we discussed?
Opening the malfunction.

480
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,079
Yes. I thought

481
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,519
Look...

482
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,119
I'm burned on you.

483
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,599
How did you say? My heart is with you.

484
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,839
But I need courage for that, no?

485
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,719
I have a family.

486
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,199
I have status.

487
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,919
I can 't risk it.

488
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,279
Look, do not worry. Nothing will happen.

489
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,239
Honey, I do not know you.

490
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,879
Do you expect me to entrust my life into your hands?

491
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,919
Milad, bro. Tell me that at least you understand.

492
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,759
What's with him?
What did you do to him?

493
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,199
Farham Kasrai.

494
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,359
I'm telling you to listen calmly.

495
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,079
Calmly?

496
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,479
Are you threatening me?

497
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,039
Milad, what's going on here?

498
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,999
With one click,
I'm will send this to our boss.

499
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,359
As you wish.

500
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,279
Are you a part of it?

501
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,079
I didn't have a choice, Farham.

502
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,919
You will do what we tell you.

503
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,479
Come on!

504
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,679
You'll start a malfunction.

505
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,119
Come on!

506
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,599
I do not have everything I need here.

507
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,519
What do you need?

508
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,559
Serial number of the air conditioner.

509
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,479
Do not play dumb.

510
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,719
Fill in the rest.

511
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,639
I will take care of the serial number.

512
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,919
Thank you really, Farham.

513
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,959
As if I had a choice.

514
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,319
You tell me that you are pro-people
and anti-Regime,

515
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,980
yet you blackmail me?

516
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,959
You're just like the criminal Revolutionary Guards.

517
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,119
Here, right here, at the end of 401,
just before contact with the fence,

518
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,039
the force observed this unusual patrol,
and had to pull back.

519
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,399
How did we not know about this Iranian patrol?

520
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,919
We have black spots in the Sewer Canal area.
Satellite observations probably missed the area.

521
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,399
And the equipment in the field?

522
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,119
Ditto.

523
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,279
I take full responsibility.

524
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,159
In any case, Nevo did not engage.

525
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,559
The entire path is now networked with cameras.

526
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,119
If this patrol is found to return at night,
we will operate through an alternative route.

527
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,479
Without checking it first?

528
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,839
Listen, the original path
that we wanted to operate through, is clean.

529
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,319
How can you be sure, Nevo?

530
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,719
You promised me some passages,
and each one was supposed to be clean!

531
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,439
Well, we do not have time for trials and errors.

532
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,479
Elan, I want a full report on this incident
by the morning.

533
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,199
Then we'll see how to proceed.
Thank you very much!

534
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,679
Yael, stay.

535
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,279
Hello.
- Have you reached?

536
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,616
Yes.

537
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,839
Are you ok

538
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,599
You should not have killed him.
He did nothing to me.

539
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,319
He knew too much, Tamar.
He threatened your life.

540
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,799
We could have solved it differently.

541
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,159
That is a decision one has to make.

542
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,919
Let's try to put it aside and go rest.

543
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,519
There is a situation where we will get a green light tomorrow.
You should be at your peak.

544
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,439
What happened to Plan A?

545
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,679
Nothing.

546
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,959
In any case, we must be
ready for action at any time.

547
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,559
Right?

548
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,159
OK.
- Great.

549
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,999
We'll talk in the morning. Good night.

550
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,559
She does not sound good.

551
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,039
Give her a few hours, she'll be fine.
She is strong.

552
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,719
I gave you a chance, it ended in a total loss.

553
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,079
You saw Nevo's operation.

554
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,759
We need an alternative.

555
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,479
Gorev...

556
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,839
Let me go out there.

557
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,799
By tomorrow night you will have an option.

558
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,439
I promise you clear skies.

559
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,919
Hello, my girl.
I've not heard from you in a few days.

560
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,679
I understand you're very busy
in your new role in the Army.

561
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,399
I'm so proud of you.

562
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,239
I just miss hearing your voice, dear.

563
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,239
Call when you can.

564
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,999
I love you, my life. Lots of kisses.

565
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,199
Babik.

566
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,159
I miss you.

567
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,199
I had a really long day. so ...

568
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,319
I'll call tomorrow.

569
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,479
I want to hear everything and also...
and also how you are feeling.

570
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,999
I love you.

571
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,319
My Nahid.

572
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,079
I miss you.

573
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,039
I hope you're feeling good, and that you are taken care of.

574
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,879
I'm sorry. I have nothing more to give them.

575
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,359
I have been suspended from the job.

576
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,719
That's why ...

577
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,519
I ask them to release you.

578
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,119
I beg.

579
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,119
Thanks.

580
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,680
ISTANBUL, TURKEY

581
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,279
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning..

582
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,119
I ordered a room. I am Mordechai Rabinian.

583
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,279
Let me check.

584
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,279
There you go, sir. And I have a message for you as well.

585
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,399
Dear Mordechai.
Thank you so much for coming, despite everything.

586
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,279
I'm in Room 114.

587
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,319
Mordechai? <i>Salaam</i>.

588
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,359
Who are you?

589
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,159
I'm Abraham, a good friend of the family.
Very pleased to meet you.

590
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,599
Where is Arezoo?

591
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,959
You mean Kolocha?

592
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,119
She went out for a short trip and will be back soon.
Please, come in.

593
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,839
Peace be with you..

594
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,839
Welcome.

595
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,359
Thank you very much.

596
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,300
If my wife doesn't land in Istanbul by midnight,

597
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,640
I will execute Mordechai.

598
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Good morning, Tamar.

599
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,760
What are you doing here?

600
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,140
Farham Karsai?

601
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,200
Yes please.

602
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,040
Is he OK?

603
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,600
Is he eating, drinking?

604
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,892
We should have killed him back at the apartment.

605
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
We have no need for him to live.

606
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,133
He should be grateful he is still alive.

606
00:45:41,305 --> 00:46:41,717

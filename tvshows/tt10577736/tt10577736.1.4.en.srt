3
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Razieh...

4
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,000
Filthy traitor!

5
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,150
Razieh...
-Ungrateful!

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,890
What are you doing? ... Leave her alone! HELP!

7
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,380
You got lucky, whore!

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Help! Help! ... Leave her alone!

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,200
Come on!

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Wow, baby, I want to taste you.

11
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,550
Go, drive, brother. Drive, go.

12
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
Wow. Zahara...

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Come.

14
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,200
Son of a bitch! ...

15
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Hello, dear.

16
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,000
Hello.

17
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,750
Well, how was it?

18
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,400
The doctors say it went well. I didn't feel a thing.

19
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000
They got everything?

20
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,000
Half an hour and I was out.

21
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,400
Well done to them.

22
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,350
Believe me, another night without you and I'd hang myself.

23
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
Well, you'll have to become a patient then.

24
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,200
First of all the doctors need to make sure

25
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:35,850
that they got everything,

26
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,450
that I can move, and that I can get on a plane and go home.

27
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Don't hang yourself, for now.

28
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,450
As long as they left your sense of humor, I have no objections.

29
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,580
I told you everything would be fine.

30
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,600
God willing, we'll see each other tomorrow and hug.

31
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,000
God willing. God willing.

32
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,000
Take care of yourself.

33
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,000
Israel - Mossad

34
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
What about Tamar?
-Act according to procedure.

35
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Is participating in a protest "following procedure"?

36
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,680
I don't know what she did during the protest,

37
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,600
all I know is that she saw Tabrizi and he almost got her arrested.

38
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,000
What about her rescue?
-No, it's too dangerous now.

39
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,800
I don't know which agents Tabrizi burned under interrogation.
-Understood.

40
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,390
Everyone breaks in the end.

41
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,900
I hope that he holds out.

42
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,200
Many Israelis owe their lives to him.

43
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,050
Masoud...

44
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,350
Sleep well?

45
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,500
Thank you. Yes.

46
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Shall we begin?

47
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
I am at your service.

48
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,800
A few days ago, a Mossad agent entered Iran.

49
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,900
Did you get to see her?

50
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:32,250
No. I've never met that woman.

51
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,400
Take a good look.

52
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,850
If you've met, it would simplify the whole story for us.

53
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
So there's a story?

54
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,000
Interesting. Because so far no one has told me why I'm here.

55
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,280
Look again please.

56
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
Have you seen her?

57
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,200
Sorry. Doesn't look familiar to me.

58
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,000
She impersonated an employee of the Central Electric Company.

59
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,250
Someone named Zhila Ghorbanifar.

60
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
Do you know that name?

61
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,250
Honestly, no.

62
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,050
Maybe you know her husband?

63
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,800
Kaisar Ghorbanifar.

64
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,600
Familiar?

65
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,400
Don't know him.

66
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,700
What about Ashkan Sharifi?

67
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,850
Zhila's boss.

68
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,800
Brother, are you accusing me of murder?

69
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,450
I didn't accuse you of anything.

70
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
I asked if you knew them?

71
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,100
I don't know them.

72
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,800
Is this your vehicle?

73
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,400
Yes, it's my company car.

74
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,700
Explain to me:

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What were you doing at these two murder scenes,

76
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,600
that evening,

77
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
two hours apart?

78
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,900
Near the electric company

79
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,100
the evening of Ashkan's death

80
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,250
and two streets away from Kaisar's house at the time he was murdered.

81
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,800
We are sure there is a connection between these two murders and the agent.

82
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
What's your connection?

83
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,290
Man, I told you. I don't recognize her, let alone have a connection to her, sir.

84
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can check if any of my employees had a meeting at the electric company that evening.

85
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,800
It makes sense.

86
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,050
Is that you?

87
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,000
That? ...

88
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,400
What address is that?

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
5 Nastaran Street.

90
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,600
5 Nastaran Street ...

91
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,550
Mrs. Salome Sultani.

92
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,250
My client. I went there to plan her trip.

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,550
At one o'clock in the morning?

94
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes, that's right, it was late...

95
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
But she's an old client of mine.

96
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,300
Brother.

97
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Brother...

98
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,300
Can I please use the bathroom?

99
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,300
Sir.

100
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Dr. Torbati to the Pediatrics Department.

101
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Dr. Torbati to the Pediatrics Department.

102
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,200
You want something to drink?

103
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,100
I'm fine. You don't have to babysit me here.

104
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,200
Thanks.

105
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,100
How's your hand?

106
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,050
Less painful.

107
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,680
Say...

108
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,075
Have you thought about reporting it?

109
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,500
She was a guest at our house.

110
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,700
But your mother kicked her out after hearing she was at the protest, right?

111
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,550
From the beatings she gave, it's clear that she's a professional.

112
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,450
This must be reported.

113
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,390
Don't worry, I'll send you to my acquaintance. He's in Revolutionary Guard intelligence.

114
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,300
He will take care of your parents.

115
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,750
But it's very important that they catch her.

116
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,300
For our country.

117
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,800
Give me your hand.

118
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,700
I want to write something.

119
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Careful, careful, slowly...

120
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,000
"A girl of the revolution"

121
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Brothers, please...

122
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,200
Sit please.

123
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,100
Salome.

124
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
From now on, eyes only on me.

125
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,450
Tell me...

126
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,450
Where do you know Mr. Masoud Tabrizi from?

127
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,600
He has a travel agency. I booked a trip to Shiraz through it.

128
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,700
For what dates?

129
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
Next month.

130
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,350
From the 11th, if I'm not mistaken... until the 15th.

131
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
Four days, anyway.

132
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,550
Please tell me...

133
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
What were you doing on August 13th

134
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,300
at one-thirty at night?

135
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,300
One-thirty at night? I guess I was at home.

136
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
You were at home? Alone?

137
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,000
Look at me!

138
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,190
Sorry... he was with me.

139
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Masoud was with you.

140
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,750
Why?

141
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He helped me with booking the hotel.

142
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,700
At one-thirty at night?

143
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,080
I... I'm sorry, Masoud.

144
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,900
Masoud?

145
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,900
I'll warn you one last time.

146
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
Look at me.

147
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,000
Sorry, it's not easy for me...

148
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,400
Masoud and I, we... we have a connection.

149
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm married to him in a "temporary marriage".

150
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,500
Mrs. Sultani ...

151
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,780
You're a whore?

152
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,800
Watch what you say!
-Shut the fuck up!

153
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,250
Shut the fuck up!

154
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,650
Mrs. Sultani ...

155
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,000
If you're not a whore, what are you?

156
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm married to him in a "temporary marriage".

157
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,150
You know very well what I am.

158
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,300
You, the men, have arranged your lives very nicely...

159
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,590
Where are you taking me?

160
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,250
Come on! Move yourself.

161
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,850
Yeah.

162
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,690
Boss?
-Yes, speaking. What's the matter?

163
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,480
I think we have a breakthrough.

164
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,700
What?
-There's someone here who saw our agent.

165
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Do nothing until I get there. Thank you.

166
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,350
Hey! Mr. Milad!

167
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,400
I was just talking to Bizhan,

168
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,490
I noticed you erased our debt. Well done.

169
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,250
Now's not a good time, brother.

170
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,520
Cool.

171
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,320
Just bring out the goods you bought for tomorrow.

172
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,390
Can't I get it for you later?

173
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,800
Milad. Well, is it in here?

174
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,800
It's here.

175
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,400
You're a king.

176
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,700
Damn it...

177
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,490
It's an honor, sir.

178
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,780
Good work.

179
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
Wait for me outside please.

180
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,190
Hello.

181
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Your name is Razieh, right?

182
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes.

183
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,190
Razieh...

184
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,700
Before we continue, I just want to make sure

185
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,200
that you have no doubts that this is the woman who was at your home.

186
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,690
And then attacked you.

187
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,200
Yes. It's her.

188
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,340
Excellent. Beautiful.

189
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,450
I will speak in person with your commander, Hassan,

190
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll tell him and those under me about it.

191
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,600
Thank you.

192
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,250
Not everyone could do what you did.

193
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,590
Proof that you love your country.

194
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,800
Well done.

195
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,000
What the? No!

196
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,200
Hassan told me they would not do anything to them.

197
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,100
Quiet!
-Believe me, they didn't do anything!

198
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,550
I told you to be quiet!

199
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm the only one talking here.

200
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,690
I want your sworn testimony in the presence of your parents

201
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,400
that the girl you pointed out

202
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,810
stayed with you.

203
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,750
Razieh.

204
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,190
If you want to help your parents

205
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,550
it's time to tell the truth.

206
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Yes.

207
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,000
She stayed with us for one night, they kicked her out when they heard...

208
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,700
Ok. That's enough.

209
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,850
This is a foreign agent.

210
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,340
A foreign agent you brought into your home.

211
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,550
Darius...

212
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,100
You are a respectable man.

213
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,500
You have a senior position in the justice system.

214
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know what the punishment is for such a thing.

215
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
Hanging.

216
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,840
Yes.

217
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hanging in prison,

218
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,000
in a crummy little room at the end of the hall.

219
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,780
Please...

220
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,800
Let my family go.

221
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,500
They knew nothing.

222
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,900
I'm to blame for everything.

223
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,700
I brought her into our home.

224
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,100
I knew her.

225
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,300
Take the father and daughter out. Leave the woman.

226
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,450
Khosrow.
-Yes.

227
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,590
Search the house. Even places you wouldn't normally think of.

228
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,300
If Faraz comes here and finds something we missed, he'll hang the three of us.

229
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,200
Look in these drawers.

230
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,500
Take a look at the balcony as well.

231
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,890
Khosrow... come with me.

232
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,500
Wait here.

233
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,900
Hello, sir.
-Yes, hello.

234
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,800
My name is Ahmadi. I'm with "Iran-Rent".

235
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,640
What's the deal?

236
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,850
We had a meeting scheduled.

237
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,700
You submitted your home to "Iran-Rent".

238
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,100
If you want, leave your details and we'll call you.

239
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,690
Sorry, sir, but it's not that simple.

240
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,790
I am obligated by the company to take a tour of the home,

241
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,440
to see that the photos you uploaded are accurate.

242
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,600
We're busy right now.

243
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,420
I'll just do a quick round.

244
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,400
Get the fuck out of here!

245
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:07,790
Vermin...

246
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,400
Sorry.

247
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,300
I'm sure...

248
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,450
that the Mossad put a lot of mental and emotional pressure on you.

249
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,340
I swear to you that the Mossad did not talk to me.

250
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,900
My niece just suddenly showed up at our home and asked for help.

251
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,600
What kind of help? 

252
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,800
Just a place to hide, to put her head down. Nothing more than that.

253
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,550
She said it was just for the night.

254
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
After the protest, we kicked her out.

255
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,900
At no point did I think she was a Mossad agent.

256
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,600
I never imagined such a thing.

257
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,400
Arezoo... you are naive.

258
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,100
I made a big mistake. I'm really sorry.

259
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,000
What is your niece's name?

260
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,800
Sally.

261
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,800
Sally?

262
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,450
Sally is not an Israeli name.

263
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,910
What is her name now?

264
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,390
Her name is...

265
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Tamar.

266
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,750
Tamar Rabinyan.

267
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,620
And where is "Tamar Rabinyan" now?

268
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,510
I swear I don't know.

269
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,200
How is that possible?

270
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,700
You just told her to go and she went?

271
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,790
Yes. She respected me.

272
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,300
How did she leave?

273
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,200
On foot.

274
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,800
Even though a taxi driver rang our bell and...

275
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,750
He probably came to pick her up but she had already left.

276
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,490
Did he introduce himself?

277
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,625
No.

278
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,800
Do you remember his face?

279
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,850
Would you recognize them?

280
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,420
I think so.

281
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,900
Name: Razieh Nakomard
Passport #: 03426144

282
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,800
"Zhila Ghorbanifar, wanted by police"

283
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,270
Bring him in.

284
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,200
Our sketch artist drew,

285
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,800
according to Arezoo's descriptions,

286
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
this facial composite here.

287
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,000
Rashid gets it.

288
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,210
He understood very well...

289
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,900
that loyalty to his people is more important than money from the Zionists.

290
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,580
He worked for me at the company.

291
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,850
I fired him.

292
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,390
Because he stole.

293
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,500
A small, lowly thief.

294
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,410
For a few tomans he'll say his own mother is a Zionist.

295
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,600
Take him out.

296
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:33,550
Masoud...

297
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,000
You know perfectly well.

298
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,900
Why are you dragging this out?

299
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,400
For your life and the life of your wife and children...

300
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,900
Find her for me.

301
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,300
Find Tamar Rabinyan for me.

302
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,200
Brother...

303
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,500
You can force me to eat the shit I now have in my pants.

304
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,210
You can kill my wife and daughters before my eyes.

305
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,900
But I'll tell you one more time, I do not know her.

306
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,800
Why do you not understand what you're being told?

307
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Darling,

308
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,700
I beg you... give me some good news.

309
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,100
Three out of three.

310
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,650
What? They got all three of them?!

311
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,000
Nothing is left of them.

312
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,400
Thank God.

313
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,000
So that's it, we're done with the seizures?

314
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,300
God willing.

315
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,050
Does that mean you can get on a plane?

316
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Yes.

317
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,050
Thank God... thank God.

318
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,560
I hope that you at least get to the airport.

319
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,600
Me?!

320
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,550
I'll sleep in the airport...

321
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,000
Believe me. I promise.

322
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,600
I'll turn off my phone and take the day off. I swear on my life.

323
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,150
Excellent! Well, I'm still making arrangements here.

324
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,200
Kisses.

325
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Kisses. Kisses.

326
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,500
See you later. See you, my dear.

327
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,750
Was that Mrs. Nahid? She's OK?

328
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,750
Everything went smoothly.

329
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,600
God willing. I'm happy for you.

330
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,690
Right...

331
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,720
Ali, what do you have for us?

332
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's from the power company.

333
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,090
I wonder what she did there?

334
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,510
These are records from their servers. It's Chinese to us.

335
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,800
I also sent a copy to the cyber department,

336
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,790
And in a few hours we'll find out what she was trying to do there.

337
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,800
Good work. Thank you.

338
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,250
From time to time the leaders of the Zionist regime

339
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:56,800
threaten us with a military confrontation.

340
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,200
In my opinion, they know for themselves,

341
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,000
and if they don't know, they should know,

342
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,480
that if they make a mistake, even the smallest,

343
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,000
the Islamic Republic

344
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:10,000
will turn Tel Aviv and Haifa into ruins.

345
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,100
"The ability to manufacture missiles is not negotiable"

346
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,000
Allahu Ackbar!

347
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,000
Allahu Ackbar!

348
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,700
Paris, France
Please, Madam Kamali, your carriage has arrived.

349
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
An entire ambulance at your disposal.

350
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,600
What service.

351
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,850
If this weren't a hospital I promise I would come back next year.

352
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You must promise me you'll never come back here.

353
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,100
Hello, Mrs. Kamali. My name is Salim.

354
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm responsible for transporting you to the airport.

355
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,200
How are you feeling?

356
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,000
Praise the Lord.
-Very good.

357
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,100
Goodbye Mrs. Kamali, safe trip.

358
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,600
Goodbye. And again, thank you for everything.

359
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,000
Good morning, miss.

360
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,000
Good morning.

361
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,250
The patient is with me.

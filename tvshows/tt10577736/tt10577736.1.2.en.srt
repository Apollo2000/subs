3
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,650
I'm sorry.

4
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,600
No need to apologize, you had no choice.

5
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,000
I couldn't escape.

6
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,300
It doesn't matter now.

7
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,600
Do you think you can get back inside?

8
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,500
Yeah.

9
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,000
Take a moment to breathe.

10
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,740
I can do it.

11
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,500
We have less than 50 minutes.

12
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,600
That's enough.

13
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,450
Continue.

14
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,200
Rashid, where are you?

15
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,200
We'll be with you in three minutes.

16
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,850
The connection to Tehran is back.
-Status?

17
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,550
She hasn't transmitted the radar data yet.

18
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,120
20 minutes to Shin, sir. What about your agent?

19
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,550
She needs time to get upstairs and set up before she can finish the job.

20
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,700
Choshen here, 20 minutes until take off.

21
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a dead body!

22
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,470
Blood all over the place.

23
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,700
We're here, coming in.

24
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,100
No, no, no, no. It's called off. Go back.

25
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,900
We're already here.

26
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Drive away!

27
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,500
It's called off Rashid, get out of here!

28
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,610
Yes, boss. Drive, drive it's been called off.

29
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,100
Tehran
Counter Intelligence, Iranian Revolutionary Guard

30
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Excellent.
-What's happening?

31
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,210
She established the connection for us. That's it, she's done.

32
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,600
She just needs to deploy the worm and I'll take it from there.

33
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,600
Attention, attention.

34
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,390
All workers must report to the main lobby.

35
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,700
You coming, Jila?

36
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,100
What?

37
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,580
They said everyone needs to go down.

38
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,350
Yes, go. Don't wait for me.

39
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,375
What are you doing?

40
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,150
Turn it off please. You hear what I said?

41
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,680
I'm in the middle of something.

42
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,850
I'll be finished in a minute. Ok?

43
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,150
The next one goes upside your head.

44
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,900
Get up and come now.

45
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,120
Can I just get my bag?

46
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,000
Hurry!

47
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,200
Protocols have been deleted. Check things on your side.

48
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,100
For me as well.

49
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,850
What?
-She ran "Fox on the Run".

50
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,700
It reverted all her changes.

51
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,750
Sit here.

52
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,500
Sit here.

53
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,000
No talking to the person next to you.

54
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,900
If you do there will be consequences.

55
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,150
You will be charged with obstructing an investigation.

56
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,700
Keep an eye on them.

57
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,650
Cancel the planes.

58
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,390
Ramshalat, accept cancellation.

59
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,180
Mr. Prime Minister

60
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,850
We're calling it off.

61
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,800
These are all the passengers who were on the flight.

62
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,200
None of them are Iranian citizens. We checked it twice.

63
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,100
These are the same passengers that came to Jordan?

64
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Yes.

65
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,100
They're the ones that are not supposed to land in India.

66
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,600
The plane hasn't landed yet.

67
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,500
But I put our best man on it.

68
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,190
He's supposed to get us the pictures of the passengers who landed in India.

69
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,850
Drive to the airport, see if you can find something.

70
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,700
Where did they both come from? Where did they go?

71
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,000
Check the security cameras as well.

72
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,500
What's your assessment?

73
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,100
Two or three hours.

74
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,950
Go get some rest if you want. I'll keep you informed.

75
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,400
Thank you, Ali.

76
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
I told you to hold it.

77
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
I can't, officer.

78
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,100
It's not...

79
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,700
something ordinary.

80
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What?

81
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,900
It's...

82
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,050
I have to replace...

83
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,410
Do it fast.

84
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:39,700
Thank you so much, officer. God bless you.

85
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,200
Quickly, finish up!

86
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm coming out.

87
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,300
"Don't say anything about what happened between me and him."

88
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Sarah Frehman!

89
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Hello good sir. Excuse me.

90
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Are you alright?

91
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,100
Yes.

92
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,790
Something happened?
-No, good sir.

93
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,850
I wanted to talk to you.

94
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,300
May I come in?

95
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,600
Yes. Please.

96
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,300
Thank you very much, good sir.

97
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,200
Thank you.

98
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,020
Hello, Ali.

99
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Hello, boss.

100
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,500
What did you find?

101
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,000
I spoke to the Taxi driver who took her.

102
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,950
He said she had very good Persian. Almost at a native level.

103
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,500
But he also said that she had a bit of a foreign accent.

104
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,700
The last thing he said was that he took her to Revolution Street.

105
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,150
And what else?

106
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,100 
He also said...

107
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,250
That she was very beautiful.

108
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,500
Good. We will wait for answers from India.

109
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
Absolutely. Good night.

110
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,950
Kamali speaking.

111
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,850
I'd already forgotten how serious you are.

112
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,850
Most people just say "hello".

113
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,750
I'm a serious person.

114
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,820
Too serious.

115
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
Even when I'm with you?

116
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,000
Let's say it wouldn't hurt you to smile more.

117
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,050
My smile is ugly. But I have good jokes.

118
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,275
Sometimes.

119
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,000
How are you my love?

120
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,100
I'm fine. I've arrived at the hotel.

121
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,740
What does the doctor say?

122
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,200
He's optimistic.

123
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Fortunately, he's optimistic.

124
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,800
Good.

125
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
Can you tell me one of your jokes?

126
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,700
What can I tell... you've heard all my jokes.

127
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,380
Don't be silly. Tell me one.

128
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,200
Ok, ok, ok.. here's a new joke. I heard it today.

129
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,200
A young man says to his mother:

130
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,100
"Mother, mother, I found a bride!"

131
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,300
The mother says: "Really?"
The boy says: "Really."

132
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:18,900
"Tomorrow I will bring three girls to dinner."

133
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
"And you guess who it is."

134
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,250
The next day the son brings the girls to dinner, numbers them in a row,

135
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
and says: "Mother, guess which one is the bride?"

136
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,900
The mother takes a look and says:

137
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,300
"The right."

138
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,200
He says: "Wow Mom, how did you know?"

139
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,950
"Because I already hate her!"

140
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,200
It's good, right?

141
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,480
Oh, my head is starting to hurt.

142
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,880
I'm so sorry I'm not there with you.

143
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
Forgive me.

144
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,300
The surgery will go well tomorrow, God willing.

145
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm only thinking of you.

146
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,700
No need to talk about it. All is well.

147
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,100
My dear, say your prayers and sleep well.

148
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,800
Absolutely. You too.

149
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,900
Good night dear, good night.

150
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,150
Kisses.

151
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,100
Jila Ghorbanifar!

152
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,900
Get inside.

153
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,300
Sit.

154
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,700
Jila Ghorbanifar, right?

155
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes, officer.

156
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:15,020
Tell me, why did your boss, Ashkan, yell at you and chase you out?

157
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,400
What did he want from you?

158
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,660
I went downstairs to work,

159
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,800
then he came out and shouted at me.

160
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I was scared of him, so I ran.

161
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,500
Why did he shout at you?

162
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,500
I don't know.

163
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Maybe he was stressed because he had to do a night shift.

164
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,600
But your friend, Sarah, told us something else.

165
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,900
She told us that he was mad at you.

166
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,400
He thought that you were quitting and were making secret phone calls.

167
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,700
That's what she said?

168
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,570
Are you saying she's lying? She doesn't seem like a liar to me.

169
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,500
She's not a liar, but she should mind her own business. 

170
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,600
Play these games elsewhere!

171
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,000
A man was killed here!

172
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,500
Now tell me,

173
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,600
is that how he would behave when he was upset?

174
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,390
Yes, officer.

175
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,190
That's how he would behave. With everyone.

176
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,600
When did you do the nose surgery?

177
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,400
The day before yesterday.

178
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,600
What is that accent of yours?

179
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,500
I was born in Tehran, but my father was a businessman.

180
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,890
He worked in the Emirates.

181
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,550
And I grew up in Qatar.

182
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I met my husband there.

183
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,800
We got married and decided to move back to Tehran.

184
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,000
How long have you guys been living here?

185
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,000
It's been just over two years since we returned.

186
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,650
So what was that out there? You continued to argue?

187
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,500
He kept shouting. I didn't respond.

188
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,500
So I went somewhere quiet, calmed down a bit, then went back inside.

189
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
And him?

190
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,200
I don't know. I think he went back inside.

191
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
Now tell me,

192
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,600
could it be that the quarrel between you two has turned physical?

193
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,600
No, officer.

194
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,700
Explain to me how it could have transpired,

195
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
that he chased you out, shouted at you,

196
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,350
you did not answer, you went,

197
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,800
then suddenly someone broke his wrist and left?

198
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,100
You think that I could break a person's wrist?

199
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,000
I'll tell you what I think. I think that you're lying.

200
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,900
Something about this story isn't right. A dispute over a job doesn't look like that.

201
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,300
There was something between you two.

202
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,150
Either you tell me or we'll find out for ourselves!

203
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:57,600
I swear to you. There was nothing.

204
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,900
You can check. Ask everyone.

205
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,500
You'll have time to think.

206
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,900
You'll remain in custody tonight, there you will have plenty of time to think.

207
00:28:06,000 --> 00:27:07,100
Get her out of here.

208
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,300
Come on. Get up and come with me.

209
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,100
Sit back down.

210
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,200
And does it all appear in the protocol?

211
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What's her situation?

212
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,100
Still at the station, held with several workers.

213
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,300
Eagle contacted her regarding the rescue.

214
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Don't try to get her out of Iran until the planes return to Israel.

215
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,600
They're continuing without us?

216
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,100
When plan A fails, move to plan B, Kadosh.

217
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,190
We've been in dangerous situations like this many times before.

218
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
I went with you and your agent,

219
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
because you convinced me that it could be done much quieter and more efficiently,

220
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,500
but now it's collapsed before our eyes.

221
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,250
The prime minister is not ready for us to bomb the reactor if the pilots fall.

222
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
I promised him a clear sky,

223
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,000
and that means that from this moment on, we are using Eran's plan.

224
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,800
Kamali speaking.

225
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,600
Sorry to wake you up. Jila Ghorbanifar.

226
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,820
What?
-The Jordanian plane landed in New Delhi.

227
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,800
You were right, boss. There were exchanges.

228
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,350
Travelling with a Jordanian passport under the name Ibtisam Badran.

229
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,700
Landed in Tehran with one image, and another in Delhi.

230
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,100
But I've already run her photo against our database.

231
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,900
And the one that landed in India,

232
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,400
she is an Iranian citizen named Jila Ghorbanifar.

233
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,900
What do we know about her?

234
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,950
She works for the electric company.

235
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,800
The other girl is probably the agent we're looking for.

236
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,620
Send me everything!

237
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
You already have it in your e-mail.

238
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,800
Thank you.

239
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,550
Come on...

240
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,400
Come on, you need to go. Come on!

241
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,680
Go.

242
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,880
Faster.

243
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,480
Samad, go up stairs. You, get inside.

244
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,200
What happened ma'am?

245
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,000
My soul, my dear...
-Please.

246
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,300
My door is open, if you need anything.

247
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,100
Darling, Jila dear, come with me.

248
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
How are you feeling?

249
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,900
Come on sweetheart, come sit down.

250
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
Why are the police here?

251
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,950
Sit my dear. Sit.

252
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,200
Where's Kaiser?

253
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,700
Sit down a moment.

254
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,000
Jila dear, my name is Mojgan. I'm a social worker.

255
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,400
It has to do with your husband.

256
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,900
How is he? Has something happened to him?

257
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,900
Your husband passed away an hour ago.

258
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,700
How? What happened?

259
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,220
He committed suicide.

260
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,390
Jila dear, I want you to take a deep breath and process this.

261
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,200
Maybe drink a glass of water?
-Why?

262
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,000
Why did he do that?

263
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,500
He left you a letter explaining why he did it.

264
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,800
He killed someone

265
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,100
and the guilt was too much for him.

266
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,800
Kaiser also knew. Her husband.

267
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,650
Kaiser? Are you sure?

268
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
Jila dear...

269
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,450
Close the door!
-Jila dear, look at me.

270
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,950
Jila, look at me.

271
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,990
Hello.
-Boss, where are you?

272
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm on my way to her house. I'll be there in a few minutes.

273
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:12,400
The police took her home. Her husband committed suicide.

274
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,300
What? What did he do?

275
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,900
He left a letter in which he admitted to killing her boss.

276
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,400
Ok. I'm on my way there.

277
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,400
Sure thing, boss.
-Bye.

278
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,400
I'm here for you.

279
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,550
Jila dear...

280
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,100
Come, sit with me for a minute.

281
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,600
Sit for a moment.

282
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,300
Come, come here.

283
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Stop. My dear, stop for a minute.

284
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,550
Look. Look. Wait a second.

285
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,390 
Jila... wait a minute.

286
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,500
All the neighbors are out. Jila!

287
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
Jila, stop!

288
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:16,150
Don't jump!

289
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,780
Don't jump!

290
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Don't jump! Jila!

291
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,000
Why did she do that? Jila, stop!

292
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,700
She's probably dead.
-She ran away. 

293
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,800
What happened here?
-Someone jumped down.

294
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,500
What are you doing?

295
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Help!

296
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,500
Help!

297
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,800
Jila!

298
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,720
Jila!

299
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,200
Grab her!

300
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,000
Jila!

301
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,350
Jila!

302
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,400
Jila!

303
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Jila!

304
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,000
Hello.

305
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,500
It's me. Weather...

306
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,500
The weather is fine.

307
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,200
I'm really happy to hear your voice.

308
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,600
Where are you?

309
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,800
I'm fine, I...

310
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm on my way to a safe place.

311
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,800
With the Eagle.

312
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,195
No. I cut off contact with him.

313
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,550
Why?

314
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,970
He screwed up, I don't trust him. I'll manage on my own and get home.

315
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,200
Tamar, you need to keep a low profile.

316
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,580
The Eagle will keep you hidden for a few days

317
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,050
until we know you can cross the border safely, alright?

318
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,000
No, Kadosh, it's not alright.

319
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,000
He messed up, exposed himself and got involved in a murder.

320
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,000
They're looking for him. He puts me at risk.

321
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,790
Leave the assessments to us.

322
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,800
No.

323
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,450
I cut off contact.

324
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,600
I did what you taught me to do in these situations.

325
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,895
This is her?

326
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,200
Yes.

327
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,200
Very good. You're a true professional, Faraz.

328
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,900
Thank you, sir.

329
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,150
Really.

330
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,000
With you, loyalty to the people always comes first.

331
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,900
Even before family.

332
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,600
How is your wife?

333
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,500
They're operating on her in two hours.

334
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,400
Then it will no longer suffice...

335
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,900
May the good and humble God save her.

336
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,000
She will be fine. I'm sure of it.

337
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,800
Right. So what else?

338
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,700
I want to mass distribute this image everywhere possible.

339
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,500
I want to catch her today.

340
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,890
Keep looking for her, but do not spread the image.

341
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,700
Leave the police to look for her in connection with the murder-suicide.

342
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:51,900
But they are looking for Jila Ghorbanifar, not her.

343
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,100
The Israelis have eyes and ears here in Tehran.

344
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't want them to know we're looking for their agent.

345
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,000
Let them think we are looking for an Iranian citizen.

346
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,600
The Zionists are probably planning something big.

347
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,480
I want to fuck them on all fours.

348
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,700
Something the whole world will see.

349
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,900
It's not because I want to make waves.

350
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
On the contrary.

351
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,500
I want quiet water.

352
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,500
Let the fish get close to the rod.

353
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,000
Hello. Yes welcome.

354
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,000
Arezoo...

355
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,790
Look.

356
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm your sister Jasmine's daughter.

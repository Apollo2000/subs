2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,853
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,106
Can I come in?

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,817
Please.

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,653
Arezoo...

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,737
Wait.

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,031
- Who is that?
- No one.

8
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,326
I'm going to take a little walk, okay?

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,286
Didn't you say we were eating now?

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,456
Just a few minutes. It's so nice out.

11
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,336
Come.

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,934
What are you doing here?
How did you get to Iran?

13
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,395
You don't need to concern yourself
with that.

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,358
I'm sorry, but I can't.

15
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,570
You're a Jew, an Israeli.

16
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,448
I have a family, I have a daughter.

17
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,784
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,578
Arezoo, I'm begging you.

19
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,455
I have nowhere to go.

20
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,124
I'll only stay one night.

21
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,877
My daughter doesn't know.

22
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,462
I can't do this to them.

23
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:31,091
Lie to them, put their lives in danger.

24
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,677
Do you know what happens
if you aid an Israeli?

25
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,804
I won't say a thing.

26
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,307
It makes no difference.

27
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:50,861
I was in the room when she talked to you.

28
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,658
She begged to see you, just before she...

29
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,037
You owe it to my mother.

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,374
She honored your request
to cut off contact, but...

31
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,170
she never stopped thinking of you.

32
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,718
She loved you till her dying day.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,722
You have to help me.

34
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,642
For her sake.

35
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,283
This was my sister's necklace.

36
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,207
You need to hide it.

37
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,352
Wait here.

38
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,238
Where were you? You said a few minutes.

39
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,574
I'm sorry, I ran a bit long.

40
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,452
Is everything okay?
Anything wrong?

41
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,734
Excuse me, who are you?

42
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,612
Hello.

43
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,198
You must be Arezoo's daughter.

44
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,034
It's nice to meet you.

45
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,038
Make yourself at home.

46
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,414
- Hello.
- Hello.

47
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,960
This is Zahra, a former student of mine.

48
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,921
This is my dear husband, Dariush.

49
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,299
And this beautiful girl, the student,
that's Razieh, our daughter.

50
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,343
Nice to meet you.

51
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,015
Zahra's having problems
with her husband at home.

52
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:10,853
She asked me if she could spend the night,
until things settled down.

53
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,691
I promised we'd welcome her
with kindness and love.

54
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,110
Like she was family.

55
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,697
Welcome. Our home is your home.

56
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,326
Thank you.

57
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,794
Your place is wonderful.

58
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,798
Much more beautiful than I imagined.

59
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,633
Thank you, that's kind of you.

60
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,644
These are Razieh's old clothes,
if you need anything.

61
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,399
You can put yours in the hamper,
I'll wash them.

62
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,194
Thank you so much for everything.

63
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,739
You need to know, this whole thing
wasn't easy for me either.

64
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,200
It tore me up inside.

65
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,870
I loved my sister very much.

66
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,791
But I made the decision to stay here
with my husband and my daughter.

67
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,252
I knew there would be a cost.

68
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,047
I understand.

69
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,674
Look.

70
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,470
Dariush's brother was killed in the war.

71
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,349
Dariush has a senior position
in the judiciary system.

72
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,019
We have deep roots here.

73
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,146
Do you understand?

74
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,237
How's your father? Is he all right?

75
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,450
He's fine. Just fine.

76
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,329
His health? Work?

77
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,921
He had a very hard time
after Mom passed away.

78
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,800
You know how much he loved her.

79
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:12,099
But he managed
to pull himself together somehow.

80
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,395
For my sake.

81
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,110
Thank God. I'm glad to hear that.

82
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,613
May we always stay healthy, God willing.

83
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,619
- Good night.
- Good night.

84
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,058
Hi, Mordechai. I'm Noa, Tamar's CO.

85
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,020
Yes, hello. Please, come in.

86
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,650
I called you earlier,
I'm here for Tamar's laptop.

87
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,902
I hope I'm not intruding.

88
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,613
No, it's fine. I'll get the computer.

89
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,375
"One eye looks out to Jerusalem,
and the other to Isfahan."

90
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,878
I'll never forget that phrase.

91
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,215
My father, rest his soul,
used to say that all the time.

92
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,345
Are there more photos like these?

93
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,639
Maybe we can find my family.

94
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,058
Do I have photos from Iran? Of course.

95
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,062
Please. Please, come.

96
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,946
They're good people, Iranians.

97
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,739
Kind.

98
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,533
A wonderful people.

99
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,702
It's a tragedy, what happened to us.

100
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,998
You know, we should have resisted
those Muslim zealots back then,

101
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,959
when Khomeini was on the rise.

102
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,711
No one thought it would go this far.

103
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,715
This revolution changed people.

104
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:15,097
They used to be happy and kind,
now they live in fear, live a lie.

105
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,932
How long did you stay after?

106
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,267
15 years.

107
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,478
Did any of your family stay behind?

108
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:28,235
No. We all left together.

109
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:33,490
Me and my family
and Yasamin and her brother.

110
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,452
Who's this good-looking girl?

111
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,253
That's Arezoo.

112
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,257
My wife's sister.

113
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,552
And that's Dariush with her.

114
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,596
He's Muslim.

115
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,432
They went to school together.
Fell in love.

116
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,436
They got married,
and she converted to Islam.

117
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,146
So she stayed there?

118
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,273
They went to Tehran.

119
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,694
Nobody knew them there.
They changed their last name.

120
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,654
He's made a career for himself.

121
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,531
In the judiciary.

122
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,366
He's a big shot.

123
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,619
Dariush and Arezoo.

124
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,829
How romantic.

125
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,626
Dariush and Arezoo from Tehran.

126
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,295
Dariush has a senior position
in the judiciary.

127
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,296
Last name?

128
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,465
I don't know. They changed it.

129
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,469
Someone named Dariush
who works in the judiciary...

130
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,722
<i>in a city of 10 million people.</i>

131
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,225
That'll take time.

132
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:45,562
His wife's name is Arezoo,
they're in their 50s.

133
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,314
<i>Originally from Isfahan.</i>

134
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,650
You've got things to go on.

135
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,778
All right. I'll keep you posted.

136
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,764
That was quick.

137
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,058
Yeah.

138
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,103
Do you prefer English?

139
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,397
Yeah. English is better.

140
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,484
I was born here, but I grew up in Qatar
and I came back here two years ago.

141
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,904
<i>Really. You came back here?</i>

142
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,948
- <i>Why?</i>
- It's a complicated story.

143
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,367
You'll tell me when we meet?

144
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,243
Yeah.

145
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,122
So, maybe tomorrow?

146
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,459
Let me check my calendar, okay?

147
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,422
<i>No, tomorrow I'm busy.</i>

148
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,134
I'm kidding.

149
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,929
You think I'd miss out on meeting
the mysterious Shakira?

150
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,349
<i>How's 13:00?</i>

151
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,351
Yeah, good.

152
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,684
<i>Great.</i>

153
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,271
<i>I will send you the location.</i>

154
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,688
<i>See you soon.</i>

155
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,233
Sick-Boy.

156
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,236
I have a question.

157
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,364
I need your help.

158
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,366
What is it?

159
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,077
I need a passport.

160
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,039
Just tell me if you can get one or not.

161
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,708
I trust you to be discreet.

162
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,508
How about we make a deal, Shakira.

163
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,052
If you help me with something tomorrow,

164
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,388
I'll get you the passport.

165
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,889
What do you need?

166
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,850
<i>Tomorrow, 13:00.</i>

167
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,269
<i>Good night, Shakira.</i>

168
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,096
Are you with the police?

169
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,055
Excuse me?

170
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,850
I see you're looking for evidence.
Are you a policeman?

171
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,644
- What do you mean?
- I'm Salome, I live across the hall.

172
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,148
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No, no. Please come in.

173
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,274
Oh.

174
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,945
Who would have thought Gheysar
would do something like this.

175
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,906
Poor Zhila.

176
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,407
Did you know them well?

177
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,658
As well as one could.

178
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:32,122
Gheysar was very devout, a quiet type.

179
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:37,044
Zhila's a kind soul.
She always smiles, she's nice.

180
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,379
Does Zhila have any friends?

181
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:43,592
Anyone who comes here often?

182
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:44,843
- No.
- No.

183
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,971
No friends or family.
Her whole family lives in Qatar.

184
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,975
Excuse me, where do you live, again?

185
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,228
Across the hall.

186
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,355
The apartment Zhila jumped out of?

187
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,438
That's right.

188
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,441
How did that even happen?

189
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,235
- She just walked in and jumped?
- Yes.

190
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,072
You didn't think
she was trying to kill herself?

191
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,866
Why didn't you try to stop her?

192
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,161
It all happened so fast,
I didn't have the chance to do anything.

193
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,289
I was in shock
from Gheysar's death as it was.

194
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,290
Excuse me.

195
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,292
Hello.

196
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,508
All right, all right, I'm coming.

197
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,219
I'm coming. I'll just wrap things up here.

198
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,388
Excuse me, ma'am. I have to go.

199
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,722
Of course.

200
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:36,311
Sir, can I ask you something?

201
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,439
- Go ahead.
- Only, we already spoke with the police,

202
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,607
and now you're here...

203
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,734
If anything happens,
who should we contact?

204
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,196
Call me directly. Here's my card.

205
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,657
- Contact me.
- Thank you.

206
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,825
Thank you, ma'am.

207
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,715
Did you crack her laptop?

208
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,717
Yeah. I've been at it all night.

209
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,219
You're the best, Omri. What's this site?

210
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,847
Tamar used it several times
in the past few months.

211
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,892
It's offering hacking services in Iran.

212
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,227
They're using our chat software.

213
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,229
Here, conversations
with one of the hackers.

214
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,148
Shakira is Tamar?

215
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,983
Shakira...

216
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,486
When did they talk?

217
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,280
21:30, yesterday.

218
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,365
They're meeting by the university.

219
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,576
Iran's an hour and a half ahead of us,

220
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,870
so we have two hours and 15 minutes.

221
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,999
Be serious, I want to show him.

222
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,960
Here he comes.

223
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,046
- How are you, Ali?
- Hello, sir.

224
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,632
Good morning.

225
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,719
Find anything at the apartment?

226
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,056
Nothing. It was perfectly clean.

227
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,558
Too clean.

228
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,270
So, did you find anything?

229
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,564
- If you will.
- Come.

230
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,151
May God grant us luck.

231
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,569
Hang on.

232
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,905
Okay.

233
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,867
This is footage from the streets
by the entrance to the electric company.

234
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,203
Watch this car.

235
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,039
Look where he's going.

236
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,375
This is a different camera.

237
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,045
This is the alley
where they found the body

238
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,172
at the time of the murder.

239
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:31,093
Here he goes back to the car and waits.

240
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,012
Here he drives off...

241
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,139
Now, watch this.

242
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:43,230
From a camera several blocks away from
Zhila and Gheysar Ghorbanifar's residence,

243
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,857
about 40 minutes later.

244
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,108
Hang on.

245
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,986
The plate can't be made out
in both videos.

246
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,069
What do you think?

247
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,991
Play it again.

248
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,244
- Pause.
- Pausing.

249
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,620
Now play the second video.

250
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,250
It's the same car.

251
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,252
See the logo on the side?

252
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,005
A black bird of some kind.

253
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,174
I saw that logo once...

254
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,844
It's some kind of a bird of prey.

255
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,389
A vulture or an eagle.

256
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,603
It's a travel agency logo.

257
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,774
Search for travel agency logos in Tehran.

258
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,699
"Tabrizi Tours."

259
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,994
A travel agency.

260
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,000
Masoud Tabrizi, the owner.

261
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,544
I'll bet the Zionists recruited him.

262
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,755
Don't be so sure.

263
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,216
He's got a lot to lose.

264
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,720
Have two teams follow him.

265
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,556
But don't come anywhere near him.

266
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,350
Okay.

267
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,476
Good job.

268
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,240
It's leaving on the 15th,
it's 3 million toman.

269
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,616
Hello, ma'am.

270
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,369
- One second.
- Is Mr. Tabrizi here?

271
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,579
He's inside, come in.
He's expecting you.

272
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:23,705
Thank you.

273
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,333
Afternoon...

274
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,376
Sorry?

275
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,090
Amir Pourmand.

276
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,885
He said to contact him directly.

277
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,429
What else?

278
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,891
Nothing. The apartment was empty, dark.

279
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,105
All right. Try to lay low now.

280
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,528
Any news about Arezoo and Dariush?
Did you find them?

281
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,114
No, but we're narrowing down our options.

282
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,449
I'll have an answer today.

283
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,202
Thank you.

284
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,706
Mrs. Soltani.

285
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,208
- Have a pleasant trip.
- Thank you.

286
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,835
Here you go, ma'am.

287
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,715
Thank you, Mr. Tabrizi.

288
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,133
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye.

289
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,218
- Goodbye. Have a pleasant trip.
- Thank you.

290
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:32,232
"AMIR POURMAND"

291
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,277
Did you find the house?

292
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>Not yet.</i>

293
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:40,115
I wanted to let you know we weren't
the only ones looking for the princess.

294
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,722
That's one of Faraz Kamali's aliases.

295
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,474
<i>I'm sending you a photo.</i>

296
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,321
He was in Gheysar's apartment today.

297
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,990
<i>Questioned the neighbors.</i>

298
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,826
I saw him last night too,
chasing the princess.

299
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,036
<i>Okay.</i>

300
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,454
We'll look into it.

301
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:32,543
But listen, I'm sending you coordinates,
a place near the university.

302
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,795
<i>The princess will be there at 13:00.</i>

303
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:39,424
You have the authorization to do whatever
it takes to get her to a safe house.

304
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,050
Copy that.

305
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,595
Goodbye.

306
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:55,858
Hi.

307
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,025
Good morning.

308
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,571
Are those my clothes?

309
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,491
Your mother let me have them, thank you.

310
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,410
She could have asked me first.

311
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,957
"I LOVE MY HIJAB"

312
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,669
What's this? Is there a protest?

313
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,880
Yes. Today.

314
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,966
Against immodest dress at the university.

315
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,886
Against all the anarchists.

316
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:30,475
Would you like to come?
I'm part of the student Basij.

317
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,936
We need every person we can get.

318
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,607
We can't give those
meddling lowlifes any slack.

319
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,235
I have a hard time at protests.
Too many people.

320
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,237
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

321
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,616
Can you come help me in the kitchen?

322
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,325
Sure.

323
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:49,786
Do you need my help too?

324
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,331
No, it's fine. I'll call you
when it's ready.

325
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,461
Good luck at the protest.

326
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:07,679
I'm sorry about Razieh.

327
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,517
I don't know how she got
involved with this craziness

328
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,686
with the Muslim students.

329
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,771
It'll pass.

330
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,023
She's just at that age.

331
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:20,984
Let me help you.

332
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,278
No, I don't need any help.

333
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:25,614
Please.

334
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,534
Don't make me feel like I'm only a guest.

335
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,119
All right, let me show you.

336
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:34,664
I can do it.

337
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,834
Go ahead.

338
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,764
Wow. Very nice. Good job.

339
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:55,977
So...

340
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,397
you're leaving today, right?

341
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,148
Yes.

342
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,776
Like I promised.

343
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:08,991
I'll go out in a bit and come back around
evening time to get my things.

344
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,243
Listen...

345
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,497
if you want to stay another night...

346
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,750
Thank you so much, Auntie.

347
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,337
I'll figure something out.

348
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,777
Hello, how are you?

349
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,030
- How's it going?
- Hi, how are you?

350
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,619
- When are the rest coming?
- I don't know. They're late.

351
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,329
Great look!

352
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:17,976
Sick-Boy?

353
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,563
Shakira.

354
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,151
Yeah, Zahra.

355
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,822
It's nice to finally meet you in person.

356
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:33,449
You too.

357
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,247
I'm happy you came today.
I think it's going to get pretty wild.

358
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,960
So, what's going on?

359
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,461
Do we have a deal?

360
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,587
Yeah.

361
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:48,298
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

362
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,260
Come on.

363
00:25:56,014 --> 00:26:00,018
So, this is the city's control systems
for all the cameras in the area.

364
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,862
I have to get control of it
and shut it down,

365
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,314
otherwise half the people here
will get arrested by tomorrow.

366
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:08,235
This is the wall that I can't bypass
for some reason, so...

367
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,487
- over to you.
- Okay, let's see.

368
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,343
<i>Heavy traffic reported ahead.</i>

369
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:34,928
How much longer?

370
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,640
In ten minutes,
but the ETA keeps increasing.

371
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,893
<i>Heavy traffic reported ahead.</i>

372
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,436
Goddamn this thing.

373
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:43,729
Hello.

374
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,355
<i>We're stuck in traffic.</i>

375
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,150
The subject is headed
towards the student protest.

376
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,568
Don't lose him.

377
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,404
<i>He might meet the agent.</i>

378
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,948
Don't worry. We have all eyes on him.

379
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,074
Good job.

380
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,075
I'm on him, boss.

381
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,159
Thank you.

382
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,472
Damn it!

383
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,141
Hey, that's it. It's working.

384
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,061
I found a way
into the traffic light system.

385
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,604
I'll take them out too.

386
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,980
Bonus, just for you.

387
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:29,775
Hello.

388
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,861
Surveillance cameras
around the university aren't working.

389
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,696
Look into it immediately.

390
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,032
Wow.

391
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,786
Shahin, Karim!

392
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,037
It's all set, man.

393
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,996
- All set?
- All set.

394
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
You're the best.

395
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,667
Come on, people, come on. I need you.

396
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,046
Parviz was arrested a week ago.

397
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,589
Right, right.

398
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,634
And Pegah was sentenced to six years.

399
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,469
Six years!

400
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,473
This regime is shitting
all over the country.

401
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,767
Enough!

402
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,895
We have no money, no work.

403
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:10,941
So many problems,
and they want people on campus

404
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,485
to check how modestly we dress.

405
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,487
Boo!

406
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,448
This world is ours, enough is enough!

407
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:19,366
Enough!

408
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,035
This is a world of love,
a world of freedom!

409
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,830
Freedom! Love! Freedom and love!

410
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,666
Love you, Karim.

411
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,127
Let's show them what we can do.

412
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:34,089
Hand in hand. Groups linked together.

413
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,300
Standing as one against oppression,

414
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,969
against lies, against degradation,

415
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,971
discrimination, against all of it.

416
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,056
That's right!

417
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,558
We'll show them!

418
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:52,024
The freedom of thought
is our fundamental right...

419
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,107
Hey!

420
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,572
- So, I'll stay here.
- What?

421
00:28:58,989 --> 00:28:59,990
Don't worry, let's go.

422
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,575
No. We could get arrested.

423
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,786
You honestly want to go home?
Don't you see how great this is?

424
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,276
Where can I meet you after this?

425
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,458
No.

426
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,460
Come on, Shakira,
don't be scared. I'm here.

427
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:18,675
The freedom of thought
is our fundamental right...

428
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:28,060
<i>The freedom of thought
is our fundamental right...</i>

429
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:32,105
The freedom of thought
is our fundamental right...

430
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:36,151
The freedom of thought
is our fundamental right...

431
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:40,113
The freedom of thought
is our fundamental right...

432
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:43,742
The freedom of thought
is our fundamental right...

433
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,328
Stay here and make sure
I can reach you by phone.

434
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,268
Brothers and sisters.

435
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:14,731
We won't let anarchists, infidels,

436
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:18,360
traitors and nouveau riche drunks

437
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,529
enter our university.

438
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:26,243
Those who want to turn the university
into a lavatory for capitalists.

439
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:31,123
Those who serve
the Great Satan and the Little Satan,

440
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,417
America and the Zionists.

441
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,379
Basij out!

442
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:42,009
We will stand up to them and will not
let them defile Tehran's pure streets.

443
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:48,098
We will not let women walk around
the university without hijabs.

444
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,022
Basij out!

445
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,150
We won't let traitors
steal our revolution.

446
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,736
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>
- Basij out!

447
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,237
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

448
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:11,705
Women were made by God,
but not to hide away.

449
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:16,668
We're not only here because of hijabs.

450
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,670
There are bigger problems here.

451
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:22,716
Unemployment,
workers whose salaries are delayed,

452
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,760
students who are imprisoned.

453
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:31,975
If Khamenei orders me to go on jihad
against our enemies, they'll be finished!

454
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,230
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

455
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,941
Reformists, conservatives,
it's all over for you!

456
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,402
Reformists, conservatives,
it's all over for you!

457
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:46,782
Khamenei is our leader,
he is the Prophet's successor.

458
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,159
Where's the oil money you promised?

459
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:52,579
Free water and electricity?
Where's the oil money you promised?

460
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:56,250
Anarchist traitors, go back in your holes!

461
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:02,297
A student would rather die
than accept debasement.

462
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:06,051
A student would rather die
than accept debasement!

463
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:11,265
Traitor, get down! Get down!

464
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,931
Traitors! Infidels!

465
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:57,913
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Sorry. Are you okay?

466
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:01,875
- I'm sorry!
- Get off me, damn it!

467
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,878
God damn it! Are you blind?

468
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,172
I'm sorry.

469
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:08,382
Your time will come.

470
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:18,641
Mom.

471
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:19,726
Mom!

472
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,311
What's the matter?

473
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:25,190
You're kicking that hypocrite out! Today!
You hear me?

474
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,942
- What's wrong?
- Get off my back!

475
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,443
I'm talking to you!

476
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:31,029
She was at the protest.
On the conspirators' side!

477
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,155
She's a traitor!

478
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:33,907
Watch your mouth!

479
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,993
What's going on?

480
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,534
Dad.

481
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,371
Let me see.

482
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,581
She saw Zahra
at the riot in the university.

483
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:43,083
What was she doing there?

484
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,960
- I don't know.
- You know very well!

485
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,422
She's a dissident and you knew that!

486
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,632
Let me see.

487
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:58,182
You're crazy! You're out of your mind!

488
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:02,227
What were you thinking? She's Israeli!

489
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,813
Haven't you heard of the Mossad?

490
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,649
She would never put us at risk,
I know that.

491
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:10,485
Her hiding out here is putting us at risk!

492
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:15,574
You know the kind of trouble I'll have
at work if anyone knew she was ever here?

493
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,710
She was more important to you
than our family.

494
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:28,336
That's what this is.

495
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:33,550
The day they left, you swore you'd
break contact with them forever.

496
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,011
- And I did.
- So how did she find us?

497
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,471
I swear, I don't know.

498
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,433
She's not staying here a minute longer!

499
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:42,809
Not one minute!

500
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,870
I hit him and he dropped.

501
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,418
Did you see the fat Basij guy
we got with the stick?

502
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:10,045
That was great.

503
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:14,049
- I said, "Stay down, Basij asshole."
- I hit him some more.

504
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,009
He didn't stand a chance.

505
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,853
"Brothers and sisters...

506
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:32,734
we will not let
Tehran's pure streets be defiled."

507
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,112
Come on, let's go!

508
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,824
Go upstairs, tell them
to turn the music down.

509
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,367
Thank you.

510
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:47,958
What is this place?

511
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:54,548
It started off as an artists' commune,
but everybody just lives here now.

512
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,217
But they're great.
Look, we have parties, live shows.

513
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,261
That's my room, over there.

514
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:01,596
Come on.

515
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,170
To your health!

516
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,506
- I'm good.
- Oh, come on...

517
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,176
For me you are the star of the day.

518
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,346
That thing with the cameras,
I was going crazy for it.

519
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:48,018
- Cheers.
- To your health.

520
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,899
Hope it's not denatured
and we don't go blind.

521
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:58,362
Milad, brother!

522
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,533
Let's dance.

523
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:03,992
- No.
- Come on.

524
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,744
- No, no, no...
- Come on.

525
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,663
I have to get going.

526
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:09,956
Where you going?

527
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:10,999
I'll see you tomorrow.

528
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,626
Tomorrow?

529
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:13,919
Why?

530
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,255
It's your time to come through now.

531
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:18,549
Is it?

532
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,970
You promised me a passport.

533
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:26,807
I see.

534
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,105
Done.

535
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,537
This is how she keeps a low profile?

536
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,873
A student protest in front of the police?

537
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,959
<i>He was one meter away from her! One meter!</i>

538
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,878
- Tabrizi.
- <i>I'm sick and tired of her!</i>

539
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:57,754
She's irresponsible!

540
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,173
<i>First she runs away from me,</i>

541
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:01,842
and then she shows up
in the worst place possible!

542
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,177
Worst place!

543
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,637
What would have happened to her
if I hadn't been there?

544
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:07,222
Gorev, tell me.

545
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,141
What was she looking for out there?

546
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,559
It doesn't matter now.

547
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,937
Masoud, I'm asking this very carefully.

548
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,066
Is there a chance Faraz's men
were there because of you?

549
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:20,736
<i>That you were followed?</i>

550
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,197
What makes you think that?

551
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,617
You were in both places,
the power station and the apartment.

552
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,412
<i>I don't know. It's...</i>

553
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:31,829
<i>It's possible.</i>

554
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,376
What about the aunt?
Do you have the address?

555
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,046
Yes.

556
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:42,132
We have found them. We have an address.

557
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:45,344
Then you have to take her out of there
with your people tonight!

558
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,806
<i>But take into account that
they might be following you, okay?</i>

559
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,059
I always take that into account.

560
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:53,519
<i>I trust you.</i>

561
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:06,739
Come in.

562
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,294
What were you thinking?

563
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:20,963
What if you had gotten arrested?

564
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,131
Where would you be?

565
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,843
What would have happened to my family?

566
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,512
Never mind me,

567
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,639
I would never put your family at risk.

568
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,016
My family's already at risk.

569
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,775
I'm going now.

570
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,114
I'm sorry.

571
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,825
I'm very sorry.

572
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,996
I never should have come here.

573
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,044
It's good that you came.

574
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,965
It was written in the heavens.

575
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,759
My sister sent you to me.

576
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:15,684
And I'm sure she was watching and saw
the great sacrifice you made for me.

577
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:34,161
Do you ever regret not going to Israel
with her and the family?

578
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,665
My father, your grandfather...

579
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:42,336
there was something he always used to say.

580
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,839
"One eye looks out to Jerusalem,
and the other to Isfahan."

581
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:51,386
I chose to keep one of them closed.

582
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:04,858
Go down here.

583
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,869
May God protect you.

584
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:19,808
Masoud Tabrizi,
come out with your hands up!

585
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,061
Or do I need to get you?

586
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,404
Hands on the car.

587
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,032
Out, you too!

588
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:48,837
Who is she?

589
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,380
A client of mine.

590
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,092
I'm here to give her plane tickets
and a hotel reservation.

591
00:43:54,176 --> 00:43:56,261
Don't you have people who do that for you?

592
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:00,724
I like to maintain a personal relationship
with my clients.

593
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:04,520
Arrest him.

594
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:07,355
Your hands.

595
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:09,191
Quickly.

596
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:44,560
Yes...

597
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:47,229
<i>Hello, ma'am. You called a cab?</i>

598
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:50,190
A cab? I think there's some mistake.

599
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,693
<i>Isn't this the Nekoomard residence?</i>

600
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:54,235
Yes.

601
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:56,864
<i>I got a call under your name.</i>

602
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:58,448
<i>Maybe you have a visitor?</i>

603
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,368
She's gone.

604
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,287
She just left.

605
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:06,415
<i>Okay, thank you. Have a good night, ma'am.</i>

606
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:08,439

2
00:00:01,954 --> 00:00:04,440
This filth hurt your woman.

3
00:00:04,476 --> 00:00:05,795
Tell me.

4
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,584
We know this guy.

5
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:10,995
You want to be police?
Why don't y'all find my sister?

6
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:16,455
The reputation of this clinic rests
on its discretion, officers.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,898
Your patient was murdered.

8
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:19,864
Pitlor?
He was around for a time--

9
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,861
part of Chessani's lodge,
I think.

10
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:24,050
- That's Pitlor.
- Some coincidence.

11
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:25,324
I'm pregnant.

12
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:29,205
This is the best thing
it could happen.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,619
Just like that,
you're back here--

14
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:33,299
Am I somehow giving you the impression
I've got a choice?

15
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,155
Congratulations.
We're club owners again.

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,071
I wanted to give you this.
Remember me with.

17
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,238
Are you going away?

18
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:42,928
Ledo Amarilla.

19
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:46,780
Our job now is to locate and arrest
on the charges or murder.

who used the conference to announce
his candidacy for governor.

54
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:17,950
Benjamin Caspere was

Help you with something?

65
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:30,690
Security, hmm?

66
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:32,441
Frank Semyon.

67
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:35,778
Stick with what you know.

68
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:38,948
You didn't have to quit.
I told you that.

69
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:42,318
None of that went down right.

70
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,787
State came in.

71
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:46,789
Better to walk
before they make you run.

72
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,908
We'd have helped you with that.

73
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,876
Geldof closed the case.
You're clear.

74
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,245
He's saying the
Mexicans did Caspere?

75
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,551
Anybody come to you
asking about that?

76
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,219
Caspere, the Mexicans?

77
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:03,389
You and Teague, he talk to you much
when you were working together?

78
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:05,424
What did you come
here for, Lieutenant?

79
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:07,977
Learned some things
about Dixon.

80
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:09,261
Wondered if you knew anything.

81
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,731
Anything about what things?

82
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:15,518
He had a lot of photographs,
some other stuff.

83
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,270
Might've been into some people.

84
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,530
Bought another Charger.

85
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,198
Yeah.

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,785
I appreciate a good rut.

87
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:35,671
Well, I gotta tell you--
sorry about this--

88
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:37,757
but these row houses

89
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,376
are reserved
for municipal employees.

90
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,295
And now that you're not one...

91
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,181
You fucking evicting me?

92
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:47,516
Hey, I got them
to give you 60 days.

93
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,602
And I wanted to come
tell you myself.

94
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:50,886
Come on, Ray,

95
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:53,522
you don't want
to live here anymore.

96
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,864
I gotta go to work.

97
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,315
Sure.

98
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:19,882
<i>Thank you.</i>

99
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:37,349
This is short 200.

100
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:41,559
I told you about this.
What do I tell Mr. Frank?

101
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,670
He can buy beer,
he can pay the rent.

102
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:57,870
Tell him to have it tomorrow
or I'll put you on an ICE bus.

103
00:06:57,922 --> 00:07:00,039
<i>Immigration, do you understand?</i>

104
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,041
Okay.

105
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:09,465
Jesus Christ.

106
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:14,887
Sexual harassment's
a political tool.

107
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,223
You pay a compliment,
a chick lawyers up.

108
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:19,308
That shit's about looks, too.

109
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:22,144
Difference between something like
what I'm here for and flirting

110
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:23,479
is how good-looking
a dude is.

111
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,114
How's that fucking fair?

112
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,734
Now, this reflex to project
blame upon the victim

113
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:32,705
is going against the sorts of
habits we want to encourage.

114
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,876
Detective Bezzerides, how do
you feel about your actions?

115
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:40,629
Can I just ask, what the
fuck are you doing here?

116
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,300
Who wouldn't want her sexually
harassing you? Am I right?

117
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:46,418
See, that kind of thing there

118
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:48,804
could be considered
inappropriate.

119
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,006
What?
It was a compliment.

120
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:53,476
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.

121
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:56,479
I understand.

122
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:58,931
But I don't know.

123
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:01,517
I mean, what can I say?

124
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,936
I...

125
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:07,740
just really like big dicks.

126
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,993
Yeah.

127
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,661
It's not just length.

128
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:16,248
Everybody's always
talking length, but-- it's fine.

129
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,536
I mean, girth, too.

130
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:24,423
I really want to have trouble
handcuffing the thing, like.

131
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,876
Um, I'm not sure--

132
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,295
you know,
that might be taken--

133
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:31,263
What?

134
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:33,299
I thought you wanted
me to share.

135
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,885
This is a safe circle, right?

136
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:37,887
- Hell, yes, it is.
- Hey, let her share, man.

137
00:08:37,939 --> 00:08:39,555
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- <i> Yeah.</i>

138
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,611
<i>This man just received
a commendation for bravery</i>

139
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,897
<i>for one of the worst firefights
in LA County history.</i>

140
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:51,534
I don't think anyone would argue
Mr. Woodrugh's facility for killing.

141
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:52,488
All right, damn it--

142
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,846
We're amenable to putting
this entire matter behind us.

143
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:58,157
I just want to forget that this
terrible thing ever happened

144
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,125
and get on with
getting my life back.

145
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:03,963
I did not do anything.

146
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:06,131
And I am innocent.

147
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:09,251
Black Mountain.
Pandhar village.

148
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:12,171
I wasn't there.

149
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:13,839
I wasn't at Pandhar.

150
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,925
How many men did you kill then?

151
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,677
How many at Vinci?

152
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,514
<i>We want any violation
involving this incident dropped.</i>

153
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:26,518
And we want Miss Lindel's earlier
probation violation expunged.

154
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,687
That was your publicist, right?

155
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,941
Got the tabloids
to try smearing him?

156
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:35,027
And now you feel okay
about dropping the allegation?

157
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,696
I've learned a lot in therapy.

158
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:39,365
I'm listening
to my higher power.

159
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:41,367
I saved lives in Vinci.

160
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,869
Oh, and did they fully account

161
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,288
for whose bullets
killed those civilians?

162
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,258
Yeah, they did.

163
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,595
I just don't want what happened
to me to happen to anybody else.

164
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,598
Detective Woodrugh works
insurance fraud now.

165
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,933
So you got him off the street.

166
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:59,518
Congratulations.

167
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:01,770
<i>Are we still talking?</i>

168
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:03,889
<i>You're going for the
deal, so take it.</i>

169
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:05,524
She is a fucking liar.

170
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,310
<i>I think we're past
all the name-calling.</i>

171
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:12,481
<i>We could still pursue</i>
<i>a civil case, Mr. Woodrugh.</i>

172
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,818
Detective Woodrugh.

173
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:19,038
Rate's changed.

174
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:21,573
I need you to offer me
an old-times'-sake price.

175
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:24,243
Frank, man, this economy?

176
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,128
Start me a tab, Lloyd.

177
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:34,887
Frank Semyon?

178
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,556
Who are you?

179
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:40,759
Our name is Gonzales.
We work here.

180
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:46,231
How's that, friend?

181
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,984
We had an arrangement
with Santos.

182
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:52,938
Nobody's seen him.

183
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,606
Long time now.

184
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,359
We heard.

185
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:59,445
So it is time to ratify
our arrangement.

186
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:06,368
We never had one.

187
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:11,090
And I don't need partners.

188
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:16,545
Door's in
the same place, amigo.

189
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:28,640
Can I help you, Cisco Kid?

190
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,542
The fuck?

191
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,994
Frank, what the fuck
are you doing in here?

192
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:51,213
Ship seems a little
loose today.

193
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,134
Micro naps, Frank.

194
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:56,969
Michelangelo took 'em.

195
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:00,305
You remember Archeron
Waste Management?

196
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:01,840
You sold it off.

197
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:05,177
After we sprinkled that corridor
valley with heavy metals.

198
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,812
So?

199
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,815
So it's closed.

200
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,851
The guy I sold it to,
Ali Komunyakaa,

201
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:15,437
who I never saw finish a beer,

202
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:19,191
gets drunk and drives
off a hillside in Ventura.

203
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:22,795
All of a sudden.

204
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:25,871
Not everyone has our
physical fortitude, Frank.

205
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,352
Like Caspere.

206
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:31,921
Ben was king fuck
of pad pulling.

207
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:34,007
You deal with pimps,

208
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,926
you get pimpish results, Frank.

209
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:40,847
Couple months back,

210
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,601
you said that there were outside
interests looking at the poker room.

211
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:47,437
Who?

212
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,439
Foreign interests.

213
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:54,110
Some fuck.
I don't remember.

214
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:57,614
I haven't been in touch since.

215
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,782
Your boy hasn't
moved to Oakland.

216
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,034
I've noticed.

217
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,036
No.

218
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:05,121
But you moved to Glendale.

219
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,623
Shame, that.

220
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:08,458
Mm-hmm.

221
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:10,627
And your kid Tony.

222
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,297
My family ain't
your concern, boychik.

223
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:17,433
You've been running girls
through the poker room.

224
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:20,303
<i>Not so much</i>
<i>as a heads up to me.</i>

225
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,525
Penance is an extra
five a month.

226
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,027
Get out of my office, Frank.

227
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:30,280
Next time, wait
for an invitation.

228
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,950
I'll let you get back
to your process, then,

229
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,818
Michelangelo.

230
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:40,123
Mr. Semyon.

231
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:43,376
You don't direct me,
Khe Sanh motherfucker.

232
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:44,866
I'm Chinese.

233
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:47,630
Ben, go stand in front
of the fucking tank.

234
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,799
Mr. Velcoro
was a person of interest

235
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,668
in a state investigation
into corruption.

236
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,169
<i>Which yielded nothing.</i>

237
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:55,421
And after the firefight
in Vinci, he resigned

238
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:57,757
<i>under scrutiny and pending</i>
<i>a charge on substance abuse.</i>

239
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,475
<i>That's anecdotal hearsay.</i>

240
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,512
There's no record of my client
being reprimanded for drug use.

241
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:04,709
Would you submit
to a blood test, Mr. Velcoro?

242
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,279
Absolutely, Your Honor.

243
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:07,233
Finally, Your Honor,

244
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,736
we are contesting
Mr. Velcoro's paternity

245
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:12,605
<i>and wish to establish whether he
even qualifies for father's rights.</i>

246
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,407
<i>- Objection.</i>
- Fucking assholes.

247
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:15,942
<i>You're not helping
your case, Mr. Velcoro.</i>

248
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,110
<i>Mrs. Brune was the victim</i>
<i>of an assault</i>

249
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:18,778
<i>during the period</i>
<i>of conception.</i>

250
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,614
<i>She believes the rapist to be the
biological father of her child.</i>

251
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,617
I raised that boy.
Am raising him.

252
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,419
It doesn't matter
where he comes--

253
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,204
Our position is that
it matters a great deal.

254
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,292
I trusted you.

255
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,427
- I trusted<i> you.</i>
- What does that mean?

256
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:37,463
I'll instruct the parties to refrain
from addressing one another.

257
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,098
Period.

258
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,851
<i>Now, I'm going to order a
paternity and toxicology test.</i>

259
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:43,353
<i>I'm ordering</i>
<i>supervised visitation</i>

260
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:46,389
<i>until both the paternity and
toxicology results are in.</i>

261
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:49,058
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

262
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,227
What, I gotta get a stranger
to chaperone me and my son?

263
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:54,447
<i>I've delivered my verdict.
Don't push me, Mr. Velcoro.</i>

264
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:57,734
Any revision at this point
would not be in your favor.

265
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,836
She never looked at me
like that before.

266
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,805
Like she hated me.

267
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,473
You really gonna test clean?

268
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,175
Yeah.

269
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:24,594
Yeah, 60 days now.

270
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:28,064
I want to fight this
however I can.

271
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:30,350
Then pull some more
cash together.

272
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:33,269
Tax-free or not, this
is gonna get expensive.

273
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,414
<i>You need more money?</i>

274
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,283
<i>I need more money.</i>

275
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:49,285
We're war rationing.

276
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:51,087
More work, then.

277
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:54,123
I can, you know, do
double shifts at the Lux.

278
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:55,958
This is for your kid?

279
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,593
Mm-hmm.

280
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:00,880
I might have a job for you.

281
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,715
The guy who bought
the waste company

282
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,218
we used in the corridor died.

283
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,804
Place has been cleaned out.

284
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:09,889
I'm gonna start listening
to the hot feeling

285
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:12,692
I got in the back of my neck.

286
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,143
I want you to tail Blake.

287
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:16,362
<i>I want to know what his
life is outside of me.</i>

288
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:18,698
I can do that.

289
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:22,402
What's your feeling?

290
00:16:22,454 --> 00:16:24,153
Running girls?

291
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,039
Am I in confession?

292
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,908
No.

293
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,461
Just, um, never
seemed like you.

294
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:33,413
Maybe you're just not
very perceptive.

295
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,717
Ask you something?

296
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:42,054
You think those Mexes
really did Caspere?

297
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,175
I don't know.

298
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:49,595
It was bullshit
surveillance and...

299
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:54,066
the crash pad was a
fucking meth factory.

300
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,861
Caspere died

301
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:08,030
with five million
of my dollars cash.

302
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,368
Stan's killed.

303
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,171
I'm squeezed out
of the rail corridor.

304
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:18,708
The enemy won't
reveal itself, Raymond.

305
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:23,045
Stymies my retribution.

306
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:26,015
It's like, uh...

307
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,885
blue balls in your heart.

308
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,440
I'll see about
some shifts at the Lux.

309
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,058
But follow Blake.

310
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,611
He's gotten too smooth
for my peace of mind.

311
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:56,579
Oh, Paulie.
Oh, no.

312
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:59,048
I'm getting married.

313
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,250
I love her.

314
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:12,845
Her name is Emily.

315
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,680
How pregnant is she?

316
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:16,766
Almost four months.

317
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:20,152
Mother of God.

318
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,859
Of all the stupid...

319
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:32,281
You're a good-looking
white man.

320
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,284
And you want to get
in shoot-outs and...

321
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:38,287
become somebody's husband.

322
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,623
You could do anything you want.

323
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,593
Okay.

324
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:51,017
If I was a man,
I'd have had the world.

325
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:54,470
Dumb bastard.

326
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:12,288
No, no.

327
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:14,156
No, no, no.

328
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:16,125
No. Fuck.

329
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,716
You took it.

330
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,468
How the fuck could you?

331
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:27,169
Took what, Paulie?

332
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:29,672
You know what!

333
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:32,675
The money!

334
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:35,177
The money I brought back
from Afghanistan.

335
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,180
20 fucking thousand
dollars, Cynthia.

336
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:42,351
That bag?
Oh, Paulie.

337
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,937
You've been back four years.

338
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,739
I thought that was
something you left for me.

339
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:50,576
Something I--
I hid for, what, you to find?

340
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:53,863
That's my stake.

341
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:55,448
I'm having a kid.

342
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,416
Well, how would I know that?

343
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,753
I fucking bled for that money.

344
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:03,539
What did you do with it, slots?

345
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,626
Now listen.

346
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:08,844
You knew I was out of work.

347
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,464
I had every reason
to expect a little help.

348
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:13,132
I'm making a family.

349
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:15,017
I know that don't mean shit
to somebody like you,

350
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,886
but it fucking matters to me!

351
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:21,107
Don't you fucking tell me
I don't care about family.

352
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:23,142
I was a dancer,

353
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:25,311
but I carried you.

354
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:29,065
And I brought you up alone.

355
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:32,284
You could have been
a scrape job.

356
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,121
You wouldn't even know
whose it was.

357
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:41,210
You ruined my career,

358
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:44,580
you ungrateful asshole.

359
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:49,418
I carried you for nine months

360
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,922
and I've been
carrying you ever since

361
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:54,974
with your weirdness.

362
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:58,728
You're strange.

363
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:01,897
All your good friends,
the boys.

364
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:06,485
Yeah, I know about you, Paulie.

365
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah, I know.

366
00:21:09,774 --> 00:21:12,608
You shut your fucking mouth.

367
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,662
You fucking poisoned cooze.

368
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:25,087
Paul.

369
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:28,124
Paulie?

370
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,376
Wait.

371
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:36,432
I got this last week. The
police never found anything.

372
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:39,385
And you-- you said
you'd look into it.

373
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:42,438
She left this,
what, at a PO box?

374
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,306
Attached to my old address.

375
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:46,308
The bill took a while
to find us here.

376
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,311
<i>When I paid it,</i>
<i>they gave me the contents.</i>

377
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:51,397
You settling in okay?

378
00:21:58,406 --> 00:22:00,122
<i>What's it mean?</i>

379
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:01,574
Looks like a party.

380
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,459
Did you follow up
with Sheriff's?

381
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:08,047
They got nothing.
I hear nothing.

382
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:10,633
I didn't want
to hand this over.

383
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:13,669
I thought--
when we talked,

384
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:16,555
I thought I could trust you.

385
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:26,732
Shit.

386
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,953
Fuck me.

387
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:49,505
Ain't you been warned
about that kind of talk?

388
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:00,466
Sorry you're down here.

389
00:23:00,518 --> 00:23:04,220
And I know you don't believe it, but
I never put you under that bus.

390
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:06,605
Sheriff already knew
about you and me.

391
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,224
I took full responsibility.

392
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,943
Yeah, sure.
You're a real prince.

393
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:13,395
You'll be out of here
in a few months.

394
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,117
Look, somebody was trying
to do you, girl.

395
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:20,986
And if you had a few more friends, it
might have been harder to get done.

396
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,242
Hey, hey.

397
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:29,829
You remember that foreclosure
we served a couple months back?

398
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:31,747
The missing girl, Vera.

399
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:33,249
Yeah.

400
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,968
You said you had looked into her
old roommate's phone records,

401
00:23:36,003 --> 00:23:38,420
found an address where
Vera last called from?

402
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:41,724
Yeah, it was up north.

403
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,093
Could you get me that?

404
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:46,478
You're here now.

405
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,016
Help me out with this
and I promise

406
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:54,153
to do a fearless and
searching moral inventory.

407
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:59,074
All right.

408
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:33,058
Loyalty's important

409
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,811
and usually painful.

410
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:39,782
One day you might find
cause to ask yourself

411
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:42,952
what the limit is to some
pain you're experiencing

412
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:45,404
and...

413
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:48,407
you'll find out
there is no limit at all.

414
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:52,328
<i>Pain is inexhaustible.</i>

415
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:56,832
It's only people
that get exhausted.

416
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:45,407
- Tony, how are you?
- Osip.

417
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:47,576
Always a pleasure.

418
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:49,945
Approval is most essential.

419
00:26:49,997 --> 00:26:51,997
Let me see.

420
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:52,808
These books are bullshit.

421
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:56,145
Whatever they were actually making
here, I can't figure it out.

422
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,181
<i>That's expected.</i>
<i>We can wipe that clear.</i>

423
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:02,768
How about you?
How are you doing?

424
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,020
Where is this Santos character?

425
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,522
Used to own the place.

426
00:28:06,524 --> 00:28:08,740
Wherever he is,
he ain't coming back.

427
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:11,610
This is backslide city, Frank.

428
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:15,664
<i>I know what's going on out
there in the poker room now.</i>

429
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,833
We're not just running some club.
Come on.

430
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:22,588
What's happening now
is we are surviving.

431
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,207
All right?
We are rebuilding.

432
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:28,260
You were almost out of this
kind of thing when we met.

433
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:30,512
It was like you had a design.

434
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:34,383
That design does not work

435
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:38,470
once someone has stolen
all of our money.

436
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:42,024
The design does not work
when I am knee-deep in dirt.

437
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,443
You don't bring a kid
into a situation like this.

438
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:47,229
To what?
Where is this going?

439
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:49,314
Excuse me?

440
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,733
I thought this was a you
and me thing, first off.

441
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:54,903
It is, but it has to be about
something more than this.

442
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:56,488
God, Frank, I helped, I know,

443
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,907
but I don't want to be some
fucking gangster's wife.

444
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:01,543
You know that word bothers me.

445
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:04,329
Because, me, I didn't
ask for this world.

446
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:08,333
I took it as--
"gangster"?

447
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:12,754
I was born drafted on the
wrong side of a class war.

448
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:14,806
So fuck that gangster shit.

449
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:18,143
You're a pimp now, Frank.
A dealer.

450
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:19,978
I don't mix with those people.

451
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,980
You know that.

452
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:25,434
I'm trying to stay above water
long enough so that we can--

453
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:28,770
those people, everything they
do, they would do anyway.

454
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:31,773
Crime exists contingent
on human desire.

455
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,825
These were the avenues left me.

456
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:36,278
And what's the expiration
date for all this?

457
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,613
Our child?

458
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:39,414
Our child is part
of the design.

459
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,617
And being legitimate
is part of the design.

460
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:44,453
Right now it's on hold.
You love me?

461
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:46,922
Then you're with me.

462
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:50,175
And maybe...

463
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:52,878
you love me
if you're not with me.

464
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,964
I understand.

465
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:58,133
But say so

466
00:29:58,135 --> 00:30:00,886
so we don't have to be
on these goddamn eggshells.

467
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:03,689
Like I'm not me
and you're not you.

468
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:13,899
I don't think
I can have kids, Frank.

469
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:17,486
<i>I've been pretending that
it might not be that way.</i>

470
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,705
<i>I thought maybe--</i>

471
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,659
but I went to the doctor alone.

472
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,661
<i>I had more than one.</i>

473
00:30:25,663 --> 00:30:27,963
I had more than
one operation, I mean.

474
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:29,665
- I had three.
- Three?

475
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,166
- The fuck are you--
- <i> In my 20s.</i>

476
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:35,053
We don't think I can have one, a child.
I can't.

477
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:37,422
You--

478
00:30:37,474 --> 00:30:40,559
You.
But why now, huh?

479
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:44,096
Maybe I'm less appealing
in current circumstances.

480
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:47,015
Why not tell me this when
I'm on top of the world?

481
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:49,351
Well, now I'm me.

482
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:52,154
And you're you.

483
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:55,357
And here we both are
out in the open.

484
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,192
So who loves who?

485
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,503
<i>This chicken looks good.</i>

486
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,789
<i>Did you use that recipe or...?</i>

487
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:13,208
- I did, yeah.
- Carlotta's recipe?

488
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,928
I did. I hope it comes out
as well as she makes it.

489
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:18,714
- Here.
- Very nice.

490
00:31:18,716 --> 00:31:21,350
- Oh.
- Thank you.

491
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:23,051
Thank you.

492
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:26,305
You know, we were just saying
that it'd be a good idea

493
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:29,024
for Mami to come stay with us
a while after the baby comes.

494
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,943
<i>And the wedding?
Speed up, I say.</i>

495
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:33,812
<i>You're doing it,</i>
<i>get on with it.</i>

496
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:35,564
<i>And you're gonna want me here.</i>

497
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,366
You have no idea
what you're in for.

498
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,568
Long nights.
No sleep.

499
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,403
Might get kind of cramped.

500
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:44,489
<i>I'll take the sofa in the living room.
I don't complain.</i>

501
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:48,410
An entire week on a boat, I'm four.
I don't complain.

502
00:31:48,412 --> 00:31:51,163
Down in the hull eight days.

503
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:52,998
- Mama.
- What?

504
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,966
Is he gonna arrest me?

505
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:58,086
Thank Jesus they got you
off that motorcycle.

506
00:31:58,088 --> 00:32:01,256
Much better.
And you wear a suit now.

507
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:03,258
He's very handsome.

508
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:14,603
A couple of months back.

509
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:16,938
When I talked about adoption.

510
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,106
Jordan, I don't want--

511
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:20,942
I was thinking
about you as a kid,

512
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:23,495
what it would have meant

513
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,747
if somebody had
looked out for you.

514
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:28,417
If somebody had
taken care of you.

515
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:30,085
There's no bandwidth
for that right now.

516
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,454
I'm with you, Frank.

517
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:34,456
I love you.

518
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:38,126
But I don't want to see you
lose who you've become.

519
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:40,128
And I don't mean the money.

520
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:44,433
And I want to thank you
for seeing me like that.

521
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:47,302
It fucking tears me up the way
you're having to live now.

522
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:49,438
My problem is with you
not coming to bed.

523
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:53,725
With both of us being half
in the bag each night.

524
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:55,894
I will find a way out.

525
00:32:55,946 --> 00:32:59,648
The adoption,
you were so definite.

526
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,486
I think you were saying no
to the kid that you once were.

527
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:07,489
You were saying he was
somebody else's problem.

528
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:19,668
I'm going home.

529
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:25,390
You should make
some time to join me.

530
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:53,752
♪ waking up is harder... ♪

531
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:56,955
Spent all day in state's
evidence control.

532
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:59,674
Then Vinci PD.

533
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,543
Nobody had an answer.

534
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:03,345
<i>They just vanished.</i>

535
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,881
Well, looks like them.

536
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:08,717
But these would have to be
taken before Caspere died.

537
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,554
How you been?

538
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,523
Drinking more.

539
00:34:15,726 --> 00:34:18,727
My hands get fucked up.

540
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:21,146
Shake, like.
You?

541
00:34:21,198 --> 00:34:23,315
Talking to myself a lot.

542
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,951
Sticking to booze, though.
That's new.

543
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:34,526
So the diamonds from Caspere's safe
deposit went missing from evidence.

544
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:37,896
It ain't exactly unheard of.

545
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:41,032
This girl's missing.

546
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:44,903
Disappeared shortly before
Caspere's body turned up.

547
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:47,489
What did we keep hearing
about escort parties?

548
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,574
Powerful men.

549
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:52,961
I couldn't make them all,
but that's a state senator.

550
00:34:52,996 --> 00:34:54,830
Look at this one.

551
00:34:54,882 --> 00:34:56,631
Caspere.

552
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,834
This ain't the type of
party allows cameras.

553
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:01,386
What do you think?
Some kind of blackmail?

554
00:35:01,421 --> 00:35:04,723
You really think
we cleared the Caspere case?

555
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:07,475
Those Mexicans?

556
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:10,145
They had items from
Caspere's house there.

557
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,813
Fingerprints.
What do you care?

558
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,649
These people put you
in a cage, Bezzerides.

559
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:17,903
This girl's gone missing.

560
00:35:17,938 --> 00:35:20,272
Nobody cares.

561
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:24,075
The interior's poisoned
and suddenly worth billions,

562
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:26,111
nobody cares.

563
00:35:26,113 --> 00:35:28,747
Bunch of people
got shot to shit,

564
00:35:28,782 --> 00:35:31,333
nobody fucking cares.

565
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:37,873
Well, I'm not a cop anymore.

566
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,292
And you're not
a detective last I heard.

567
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:46,131
Nope, you do security
for some comeback mobster

568
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,465
and I log evidence.

569
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:49,801
I do consultation.

570
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:53,605
And you should get out.
You're too good for 'em.

571
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,807
You hear about the kid?

572
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,810
I mean, fraud investigations?

573
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:01,730
He was a fucking
god warrior that day.

574
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:04,566
Yeah.
I talked to him.

575
00:36:04,618 --> 00:36:07,152
He's miserable.

576
00:36:07,154 --> 00:36:08,320
Belongs in the field.

577
00:36:08,322 --> 00:36:10,372
Then he should quit, too.

578
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:15,543
Why didn't Dixon make that
place for a cookhouse, huh?

579
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,579
I don't know.

580
00:36:17,631 --> 00:36:19,214
'Cause he's a wet brain alky.

581
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:22,384
I have this new program, see.

582
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:24,552
Because my powers of influence

583
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:27,923
are so meager in this
sublunar world of ours,

584
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:31,309
I try to limit the people
I can disappoint.

585
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:32,727
And I make sure
to know the difference

586
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:35,313
between my obligations
and somebody else's.

590
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:54,499
it was good seeing you.

591
00:36:54,534 --> 00:36:56,701

00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:33,655
Maybe something light.

598
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:36,041
I don't care what we watch.

599
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:09,024
What's it matter?

600
00:38:09,076 --> 00:38:11,076
Your boss moved off all this.

601
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:13,495
- Pretty cleanly, too.
- That's my point.

602
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,697
We closed the Vinci investigation
and Geldof announces

603
00:38:15,749 --> 00:38:18,283
a governor's run with a
suddenly massive war chest.

604
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:20,118
So he had his hand out.
That what this is?

605
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,620
You holding your hand out?
Where's my cut?

606
00:38:22,672 --> 00:38:25,457
A real attorney general could
do a lot of good in this state.

607
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:26,791
Has she got to you
with her missing girl?

608
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:29,711
And you, what, are you
just looking for trouble?

609
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,965
I need to be in the field.

610
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:35,967
I'm not happy either
how things played.

611
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:39,220
<i>Geldof's actions are the
clearest indication of collusion</i>

612
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:42,357
between the Vinci power structure
and the larger state institutions.

613
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:44,526
And it wouldn't hurt
your job prospects

614
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:46,644
having dirt
on the future governor.

615
00:38:46,646 --> 00:38:50,815
I'm putting together a confidential
special investigation.

616
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:53,485
Stated goal is to track
down Irina Rulfo,

617
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:55,403
the girl who pawned that shit,
brought you all to this place.

618
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,489
You know she was
never brought in.

619
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:58,990
What's the real purpose?

620
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:01,576
Finding out who killed Caspere.

621
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:03,328
<i>Uncovering evidence</i>
<i>of collusion</i>

622
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,130
<i>between Vinci PD,</i>
<i>mayor's office,</i>

623
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:06,915
AG, and any other state bodies.

624
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,633
You know I'm not a cop anymore.

625
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:10,502
You have your PI license.
I checked.

626
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:12,087
I could detail you
as a state attorney's

627
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:14,005
investigator
into a missing person.

628
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:17,175
I need people who aren't
gonna ping on our radar.

629
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:18,343
Word gets out
what we're looking for,

630
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:19,928
they could shut it down
like last time.

631
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,480
I got a job.

632
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:26,518
Thanks, but no.

633
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,521
That job gonna get you
your kid back?

634
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:34,859
What do you know about him?

635
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:37,162
I know it's not
looking good for you.

636
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:40,031
State Attorney's office
could intercede

637
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:42,417
on your behalf
with Family Services.

638
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:44,536
Recommendations, testimony.

639
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:48,039
I could make sure
you keep your boy.

640
00:39:53,547 --> 00:39:56,214
Well, they never found
the camera and the hard drive.

641
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:00,718
I don't think the person
who shotgunned me

642
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,189
was one of those maniacs
at the shoot-out either.

643
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:06,224
While we're talking...

644
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:12,063
I want to look at some
of this land up north.

645
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:14,365
Might have a line on those
hooker parties, too.

646
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:16,651
A lot of money there.

647
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:19,571
If it's a place, deals go
down, we need to look at it.

648
00:40:19,573 --> 00:40:20,989
You can't be cleared for this.

649
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,490
<i>She's taking vacation time.</i>

650
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:25,126
I'm placing her as a
confidential investigator.

651
00:40:25,162 --> 00:40:27,078
Means I don't have
to register her.

652
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,830
I can follow up
on the diamonds.

653
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:31,216
Why Caspere had them.
Why they're missing.

654
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:33,051
Why the girl had
photographs of them.

655
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:35,803
I guess my million-dollar
question is why me?

656
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,889
You're out of the system.

657
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:40,675
You know Vinci PD.

658
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:43,428
Properly motivated, you're a
good bet to get the dirt.

659
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:47,398
<i>Think it over, Velcoro.</i>

660
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:51,486
Never too late
to start all over again.

661
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:05,867
You let me keep my kid,

662
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,669
I'm in.

663
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:11,539
Get started.
You're on the clock.

664
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:13,124
I want daily reports.

665
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:18,012
Wasn't it you who thought I was
the worst of these people?

666
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:23,017
Saw that rumor about you
killing a guy was bullshit.

667
00:41:23,053 --> 00:41:25,053
Figured maybe
the rest of it was, too.

668
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:27,305
How'd you decide
it was just a rumor?

669
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:29,474
I thought you knew.

670
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,143
They caught the guy.

671
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:35,647
<i>I assumed maybe</i>
<i>your ex told you.</i>

672
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:41,035
What do you mean
caught the guy?

673
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:42,487
A few weeks back,

674
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:45,540
guy got pulled in for
sexual assault in Venice.

675
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:47,659
DNA matched six unsolved rapes,

676
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:50,828
<i>including</i>
<i>your ex-wife's kit.</i>

677
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:54,332
<i>He'll get life, sounds like.</i>

678
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,007
Get results.

679
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:05,343
I'll make sure
you keep your kid.

680
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:35,835
<i>Frank, thanks for coming.</i>

681
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:38,705
My position is you
people owe me some land.

682
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,174
I'd have a hard time
convincing my board of that.

683
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,345
Imagine word
of how that corridor's

684
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,214
gotten bought up
over the past five years.

685
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,633
How exactly it came
to be so cheap.

686
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,475
I can't see that
being of any interest.

687
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:04,480
A waste removal service poisons park and
farmland along the central valleys.

688
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:06,866
A major California landowner

689
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:09,652
<i>committed to real estate</i>
<i>development steps in.</i>

690
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,821
You're reaching.

691
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:15,875
Archeron Waste Management
is dissolved.

692
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:19,545
The guy I sold it to
ran himself off the road.

693
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:21,881
You know anything about that?

694
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:25,134
There might still be
something for you.

695
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,836
Why I called.

696
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,339
Let me ask, have you
ever heard of Caspere

697
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:33,810
possessing
a collection of films?

698
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,062
Home movies.

699
00:43:36,097 --> 00:43:37,897
A hard drive full of them.

700
00:43:39,401 --> 00:43:42,151
If you're interested
in doing something for us...

701
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:45,905
it could put you
back in the corridor.

702
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,527
Somebody's got that hard drive.

703
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:55,164
I know the police never found
it in either of his houses.

704
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,866
What about the Mexicans?

705
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,201
Did Caspere?

706
00:43:58,203 --> 00:43:59,502
I'm no detective,

707
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,838
but it might be
a good place to start.

708
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,207
If you believe they're
the ones that did it.

709
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:13,383
Five parcels,

710
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:15,218
gifted,

711
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,353
I find that hard drive.

712
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:48,418
Oh, yes, I remember you.

713
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,721
Correct?
How can I help you?

714
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:54,557
I'm here to help you, Doc.

715
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:58,177
I'm here to help you keep all
that cosmetic work intact.

716
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,981
I can't imagine we have
anything to talk about, sir.

717
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,434
I fully cooperated
with you last we spoke.

718
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,569
Well, maybe that's on me

719
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:08,821
not asking the right questions.

720
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:16,112
You and Chessani, girls,
human trafficking.

721
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:18,031
You do their implants,
nose jobs.

722
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:21,250
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

723
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:22,869
I'm a psychiatrist.

724
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:26,039
With a secondary concentration
in reconstructive surgery.

725
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,957
You, Chessani, Caspere,

726
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:30,426
you went back farther
than you made out.

727
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:33,796
The girls, spill.

728
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:37,050
Your compensatory
projection of menace

729
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:38,968
is a guarantor of its lack.

730
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,021
And it says something
about the depths

731
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:44,140
of your misperceptions.

732
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:03,376
Kind of day I've had,

733
00:46:03,411 --> 00:46:06,496
seeing you pop a few stitches
might start to make up for it.

734
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:09,465
<i>Pin-eyed motherfucker.</i>

735
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,717
Hooker parties.

736
00:46:11,753 --> 00:46:15,138
What you'd call affluent men.

737
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,839
Caspere attended.

738
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:19,392
Go.

739
00:46:19,427 --> 00:46:22,595
I just--
I just do work on girls.

740
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:24,347
Make eights into 10s.

741
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:26,766
Make sure they have the proper
prescriptions, that's it.

742
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:36,242
The parties are a safe place,

743
00:46:36,277 --> 00:46:37,860
a conclave
for men of influence.

744
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:41,614
Talk motivations or I'll dig
into that face-lift and yank.

745
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,088
Caspere concocted the idea of
the parties with Tony Chessani.

746
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:52,041
<i>Tony's a pimp</i>
<i>with political ambition.</i>

747
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:55,294
His father doesn't participate
in the gatherings.

748
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:57,046
Tony's service
makes him friends

749
00:46:57,098 --> 00:46:59,265
with those men of affluence
you mentioned.

750
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,218
Lays the groundwork for deals
that Caspere facilitated.

751
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,436
What else?

752
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:06,055
I th-- I think both men
used the occasions

753
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:09,392
to compile potential blackmail
material on their guests.

754
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:12,612
Rumored Ben had footage

755
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:14,730
of various important people.

756
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,065
<i>McCandless.</i>

757
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:17,733
Who?

758
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,652
He's the president of Santa
Clara Railroad Company.

759
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,121
It's smaller now.
Called Catalast.

760
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,963
You go back with the Chessanis.

761
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:36,135
You put his first wife
in a mental hospital.

762
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:38,921
Yeah, I did every--

763
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:41,257
I did everything--

764
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:45,728
I did everything
I could for Helene.

765
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:49,398
Certain traditions
of the Chessani patriarchs

766
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:52,185
she had a difficult time with.

767
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,270
They are...

768
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:58,274
you might say,
a highly inventive family.

769
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:11,671
Might be tough to
get back into that scene.

770
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:14,957
But not impossible, right?

771
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,376
Look for the pieces
that are solid,

772
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:18,628
that haven't been
hollowed out yet

773
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,630
with, like, a smooth surface.

774
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,350
Say you lost
your job, whatever.

775
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:27,136
Just some story. You need
to work the next party.

776
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:31,023
I don't-- I don't know if I can get
in touch with those girls.

777
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:34,060
They weren't exactly stable.

778
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:36,362
I'm getting
really good at this.

779
00:48:36,397 --> 00:48:37,947
Not like hers.

780
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:41,150
If you can get a line
on an invite,

781
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:43,569
I need to look into it.

782
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,621
This girl's missing.

783
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:47,323
There's other stuff.

784
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,408
Something else?

785
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,043
After that shooting?

786
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:53,079
You haven't talked about it.

787
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:56,332
Dad asks and says that
you won't call him back.

788
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,501
I'm busy.
Work.

789
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:03,673
I wondered why you were so
hot to hit the beach today.

790
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:08,644
I tried weighing if it was
worth the price of a lecture.

791
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:12,982
I'm not in a spot
to give those.

792
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,769
Did I tell you
I got into CalArts?

793
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:20,523
You--
that's great.

794
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:22,024
Awesome.

795
00:49:22,076 --> 00:49:23,526
Thank you.

796
00:49:23,578 --> 00:49:26,329
- Congratulations. Jeez.
- Thanks.

797
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:31,367
I should, uh--
I should buy you dinner.

798
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:38,207
Maybe I can reach out to a couple
of the girls that I knew before.

799
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:43,596
For the straight up purpose of
getting<i> me</i> into that party, okay?

800
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:46,849
Aren't you supposed
to be behind a desk?

801
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,435
I just started my vacation.

802
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,271
Going anywhere special?

803
00:49:52,307 --> 00:49:54,390
Yep. Guerneville.

804
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:56,025
You homesick?

805
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,895
For a place you hate, you never
really got that far away.

806
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,917
<i>An excess of boron
produces the color.</i>

807
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:24,420
<i>Now, most of your colored</i>
<i>diamonds are of low quality,</i>

808
00:50:24,472 --> 00:50:27,757
<i>but something like these</i>
<i>with such a rich hue,</i>

809
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,759
it's just very rare.

810
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,260
And the cut, octahedron,

811
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:33,646
these must almost
certainly be stolen.

812
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:35,264
I told the other
policeman the same.

813
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:38,651
What other policeman?

814
00:50:38,686 --> 00:50:40,603
Oh, a few months back,
a detective came by

815
00:50:40,655 --> 00:50:42,321
with pictures
of identical diamonds.

816
00:50:42,357 --> 00:50:46,275
Wanted to know if anybody had come
around maybe trying to sell them.

817
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,943
I told him I read
the pawn sheets regular

818
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:49,445
and I haven't seen them listed.

819
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:52,365
He tells me they don't want
the stolens on any sheets.

820
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,201
So he gives me his card,

821
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:56,952
says to let him know
if I hear anything.

822
00:50:57,004 --> 00:50:59,422
- You still have that card?
- Yeah.

823
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:05,044
He was a portly man.
Smelled like bourbon.

824
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:09,598
<i>Flatulent, too.</i>

825
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,467
Hmm.

826
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:17,840
<i>The thing is, when Dixon
came around about the diamonds,</i>

827
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:21,094
it would have been before we
found the safety deposit box.

828
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:23,646
So he knew about the diamonds
before we found them.

829
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,315
And in which case, why not
put them on the hot sheets?

830
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:29,152
My ex-partner
got this address

831
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,521
where the missing girl
last called from.

832
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:35,358
Spot was on Caspere's GPS, too.

833
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:37,910
Mmm.

834
00:51:37,946 --> 00:51:40,413
Seems like a happening place.

835
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:45,251
Used to be this commune here

836
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:47,703
on the River Valley.

837
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,850
Why did you say--

838
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,637
so that man that you tracked
down, that was a lie?

839
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:08,191
No, I--
I don't understand.

840
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,560
They caught him weeks ago.

841
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:13,146
Called me in.

842
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,897
Richard came with me.

843
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:18,117
He's a serial rapist.

844
00:52:18,153 --> 00:52:21,204
DNA matched the kit that
they took on me back then.

845
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,207
Did you just make it up?

846
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:26,742
What you said?

847
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,414
I...

848
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:33,549
Why?

849
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:36,219
Why would you do that?

850
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,087
So-- so, what?

851
00:52:38,139 --> 00:52:41,974
So you can make me think that you
were protecting me or something?

852
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,427
It's--

853
00:52:44,479 --> 00:52:46,812
it's not--
it's not what I--

854
00:52:46,848 --> 00:52:49,765
That ruined everything, Ray.

855
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:53,486
That ruined you.

856
00:52:53,521 --> 00:52:58,157
That's why I have to have
the paternity test.

857
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:02,111
I have to know.

858
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:05,948
I have to know so I can...

859
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,833
put it all where
it's supposed to be.

860
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:10,953
I don't want to live
this fantasy

861
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:13,172
about Chad with you anymore.

862
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:15,958
He should have the truth

863
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,793
when he's ready.

864
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:19,879
This--

865
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,714
this fake story

866
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,466
where we made
a family has to end.

867
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,312
He set me up.

868
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:37,980
Frank.

869
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,700
I don't know
what that means, Ray.

870
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,999
You serious?

871
00:53:57,051 --> 00:53:59,001
About the adoption?

872
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:04,173
It meant something
to me, what you said.

873
00:54:07,895 --> 00:54:10,096
I want to thank you
for telling me that.

874
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:17,069
We both could have used
different parents.

875
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:34,537
Don't worry about kids now.

876
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,956
This is between you and me.

877
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:58,444
Seems like nobody's been home.

878
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:17,830
Want to call local?

879
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:19,548
<i>Get us in here?</i>

880
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:33,596
Now we're following birds.

881
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:36,098
Carrion birds.

882
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:52,581
You smell that?

883
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:54,667
What, bird shit?

884
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:32,621
It's arterial spray.

885
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:37,209
<i>Jesus.</i>

886
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,668
The ceiling's clean.

887
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,672
No water stains.

888
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,231
I like it here.

889
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:03,269
Really.

890
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,071
We didn't need all that room.

891
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:08,407
Don't talk like that.
Come on.

892
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:14,163
There's a guy,
McCandless, Catalast...

893
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:16,332
Leave business.

894
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:22,838
We should sell the clubs.

895
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:29,011
Buy a farm.

896
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:33,048
Grow organic produce.

897
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,184
I could see us as farmers.

898
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,102
Mmm.

899
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:38,971
You would run for a plane

900
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:40,890
the first time
you smelled shit.

901
00:57:40,942 --> 00:57:43,192
Trust me.

902
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:47,229
I worked as a picker.

903
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:52,201
I was 14.

904
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:53,986
15.

905
00:57:56,123 --> 00:57:57,957
You don't want
to grow anything.

906
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:20,980
What about this guy?

907
00:58:22,316 --> 00:58:25,768
There's something I might
be able to do for him.

908
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,736
If I can,

909
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:30,356
we can get it all back.

910
00:58:30,408 --> 00:58:32,441
Do you trust him?

911
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:34,443
I trust self-interest.

912
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:42,618
Stay here.

913
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:47,456
I'm fucking coming!
Shut the fuck up!

914
00:59:14,735 --> 00:59:15,901
Got a fucking problem?

915
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:17,653
You alone?

916
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:20,155
Yeah. Why?

917
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,827
You and me need to talk.

918
00:59:32,996 --> 00:59:36,003

_

2
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,679
What is it you think happened?

3
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,963
Someone killed this girl,
made a big show of it...

4
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:06,649
left a painting
of the crime scene

5
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,257
on one of your old churches.

6
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:09,453
You're obsessive.

7
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:12,588
You're obsessive, too,
just not about the job.

8
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:14,002
Are you gonna go home
with this guy?

9
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:15,638
Really none of your business.

10
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,332
Stop!

11
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:18,570
You know if it's true?

12
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:20,017
I didn't hear anything.

13
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:22,166
What have you been
doing, Marty?

14
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,468
I found another girl.

15
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:26,262
She was positive for
meth and LSD.

16
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,670
You ever think maybe

17
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:30,486
he tried to push things
where he wanted them to go?

18
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,232
Hey, we caught a break
in the case, boss.

19
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,856
I thought you were
handing that off.

20
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,842
She had a boyfriend
you know about?

21
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:37,042
Reggie.

22
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,508
Reggie Ledoux.

23
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,964
Reggie Ledoux skipped
parole 8 months ago.

24
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,971
He's busted in connection
to a narcotics lab

25
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,013
used to make meth and LSD,

26
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,641
did two years at Avoyelles,

27
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:50,685
and guess who his cellmate was
the last 4 months.

28
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:51,771
Charlie Lange.

29
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,843
What Dori do?

30
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,122
Dori's dead.

31
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:58,302
I need an all-state APB
on one Reginald Ledoux.

51
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,043
What you doing?

52
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,549
You fucked with us, Charlie.

53
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,587
I did not, sir.

54
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,417
Reggie Ledoux.

55
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,323
Hey, I don't even want
to know that freak, man.

56
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:54,526
Y'all ain't asked
nothin' about Reggie.

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,465
Fuck, man, my--
my wife just died--

58
00:02:57,498 --> 00:03:00,065
Ex-wife!

59
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,895
You had Reggie Ledoux
take her out,

60
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,864
didn't you?

61
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:04,904
- No.
- Hmm?

62
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:06,335
- What are you talking about, man?
- Hmm?

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,700
Reggie? Put her out there
with them antlers on? I--

64
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,172
You have Reggie do it?

65
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:11,539
- What are you talking about?
- Hmm?

66
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:13,075
Reggie Ledoux did this?

67
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:15,108
Reggie Ledoux?

68
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,906
Reggie motherfuckin'
Ledoux did this?!

69
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,915
Fuck, man! Shit!
Let me out, man!

70
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,454
Let me out!
Fuck, man!

71
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:23,455
Hey, Charlie?

72
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:27,053
We're not gonna give you the Oscar
no matter how hard you try.

73
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:29,755
Oh, fuck you, man.
You don't know me.

74
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:33,026
You don't know
what I been through.

75
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,290
And what are you talking
about? You talk to me!

76
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,665
Ledoux knew about her, right?

77
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:41,401
You talk about her to him?

78
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,800
Yeah, man-- yeah, the way
you do sharing a house.

79
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,734
Yeah, you talk pussy,
talk scores.

80
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,607
That's what you do.

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,503
Showed him pictures
of her, hmm?

82
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:50,703
Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

83
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,838
I had some she give me
when I first went down,

84
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,941
stuff for me to look at.

85
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,340
You know, like Polaroids.

86
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,318
He was a big guy--

87
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:01,984
a lot bigger than you.

88
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:04,192
Do you tell me you
didn't get along?

89
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,320
Nah, I mean, I did, most part.

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,888
You've got to,
you're sharing a house,

91
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:09,297
like I'm saying.

92
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,465
I mean, he gets you high, man, but he's creep.
I ain't want to know him.

93
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,803
Tell me about Ledoux.

94
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,067
How is he creep?

95
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:19,845
He's a cook, you know,
like a chemist?

96
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:22,216
He used to, uh, make shit
out of kitchen stuff--

97
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:25,247
cook down cleansers
and whatnot.

98
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,552
Used tater skins and fry grease
to make high-test sour mash.

99
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,596
He got mad knowledge for that shit,
but, like, I don't know, man,

100
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,061
he talk like a short-eyes,
like something.

101
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:36,235
How you mean? He wouldn't
talk that shit up in here.

102
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,529
No, man, he didn't. Like,
me and him at night,

103
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,030
blasted up on one of his mixes.

104
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,199
I mean, he could
brew some shit up

105
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:44,567
put you up out your head, man.

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,207
That's a big deal in here.

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,103
I mean, fuck, man, it's a
big deal out there, too.

108
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,943
So, uh, what kind
of shit was he talking?

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,016
He said that there's
this place down south

110
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:59,619
where all these rich men
go to, uh, devil-worship.

111
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,985
He said that, uh...

112
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,990
they-- they sacrifice
kids and whatnot.

113
00:05:05,023 --> 00:05:06,528
Women and children
all got--

114
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,795
all got murdered there,
and, um,

115
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,467
something about someplace
called Carcosa

116
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,971
and the Yellow King.

117
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:16,541
He said there's all these, like,
old stones out in the woods,

118
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:20,180
people go to, like, worship.

119
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:22,381
He said, uh...

120
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,212
He said there's just so much
good killin' down there.

121
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,517
Reggie got this
brand on his back,

122
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,589
like in a spiral?

123
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:32,093
He says that's their sign.

124
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,589
What the fuck ever,
you understand?

125
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,230
I don't listen
to the man, but he's big,

126
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:37,765
so I don't tell him to
shut the fuck up, neither!

127
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:41,229
You remember any buddies
he ever talked about?

128
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,564
So we checked the records here,

129
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:45,003
and he hadn't ever
had any visitors.

130
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:47,371
We both know Tyro Weems.

131
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:51,272
Tyrone like to tell you
where he's at.

132
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:54,641
Look, man, Reggie's
crazy, like, for real.

133
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,519
Had to be tough,

134
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,221
living with somebody
spouting insane shit

135
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:12,354
in your ear all day long.

136
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,984
You gonna give me something
for what I told you just now?

137
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,191
Parole board nod.

138
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:19,123
Fair's fair.

139
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,523
Hey. Hey!

140
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:35,503
You think 'cause I talked
to him about Dori that...

141
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:38,398
I might have got her killed?

142
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:42,636
You probably had
something to do with it.

143
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,879
I don't think you should have
shown him those pictures.

144
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:50,916
Do you?

145
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:10,955
We need to find
this Tyrone Weems,

146
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:12,859
see what he knows about Ledoux.

147
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,730
Yeah.

148
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:16,361
Ahem.

149
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:22,290
You didn't have to tell
him it was his fault.

150
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,627
Guy was already low.

151
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:27,930
Yeah, he asked
about his end first.

152
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:30,539
Parole board.

153
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:32,677
So?

154
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,541
So fuck him.

155
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,454
You're funny, Marty--

156
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:45,422
the shit you get soft about.

157
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,820
I wanted every member
of that family that I could find.

158
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:50,693
Turns out...

159
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:52,600
there weren't any.

160
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:56,368
You know how weird
that is in Louisiana?

161
00:07:56,401 --> 00:08:00,436
A cousin, what was it,
Dewall, was

162
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,939
not on paper except
for a, uh, trucker's license.

163
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:09,076
Ledoux had turned into a ghost

164
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:12,411
from the time he skipped
parole check.

165
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,482
Tell me, young studs,

166
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:20,519
what would you do
when you hit a wall like that?

167
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:25,716
Responding to the complaint,
I approached the house.

168
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:31,755
Seeing that the screen door
was broken and the inner door...

169
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,163
ajar, I-- I felt that entrance

170
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:38,362
complied with standard
procedure.

171
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:43,034
Upon entering
the domicile, I noticed

172
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:47,444
what appeared to be marijuana
and a white powder

173
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:50,111
on the coffee table.

174
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:57,288
Hey, Martin.

175
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:58,320
We don't have to talk, Lisa.

176
00:08:58,353 --> 00:08:59,520
The hell we don't.

177
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,560
You don't get to do what
you did to me last week.

178
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:05,265
Look, I'm sorry. I was
hurt and real drunk.

179
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:08,296
Talk to me now.

180
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:11,136
Okay. Ah, I wish you
a great life

181
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:14,137
and good luck with
your new friend.

182
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,176
You philandering
fucking asshole.

183
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,145
Hey, look.

184
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:20,345
There is no pageant
to perform, okay, and

185
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:23,016
your disappointment
is irrelevant.

186
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,618
You don't get to act
like that, Marty,

187
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,416
or like this.

188
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:28,816
The fact is it's nice
to know you got him,

189
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:31,121
and I don't want to have
this conversation with you.

190
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,391
You need to respect me, Marty.

191
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:35,759
This is respect.

192
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,374
Rust figured a connection with
an earlier death, suspicious--

193
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:44,079
Rianne Olivier.

194
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:48,583
Led us to the DB's old
boyfriend, Reginald Ledoux, 35.

195
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:51,276
Statch rape charge
against a 12-year-old,

196
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,283
acquitted for lack of testimony.

197
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:57,117
Did a bit for manufacturing
meth and LSD,

198
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,525
which fits the tox screen
for Lange.

199
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,987
His old cellmate
was Lange's ex-husband.

200
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:06,367
He showed him some
cheesecake pictures of her.

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,768
Uh, from what we
know about him,

202
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:08,832
the way he talked,

203
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:11,409
he sounds like he's
real good for it.

204
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:13,178
No line on any of his people.

205
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,272
Swamp folk, dug in
off the grid.

206
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:19,218
We are tracking
a KA, Tyrone Weems.

207
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,315
He's in the sheets
that we passed out.

208
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,650
Any questions?

209
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:26,089
I didn't think so.
Let's get to work.

210
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you Theresa Weems,

211
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,871
Tyrone Weems' mom?

212
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:02,101
Tyrone ain't been around
in a while.

213
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:03,500
You know, a few months.

214
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,840
We got in a fight 'cause
he sold my microwave.

215
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,849
And what about his friends?

216
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:11,849
You know where they hang out?

217
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:13,449
I don't know, he dated
this girl Kelsey

218
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:15,353
for a little while.

219
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:18,353
Kelsey, when's the
last time you saw Tyrone?

220
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:21,363
Months.
We've been broke up.

221
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:23,828
I don't ever hear from him.
I don't want to.

222
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,835
I heard he got
Shawnda Miller pregnant.

223
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:30,302
So do you have his
address, phone number?

224
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,566
Look. I really wish I could
help you, but I can't.

225
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,837
I have to get back to work.

226
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:01,992
Hey.

227
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,928
You know that gal back there?

228
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:06,358
She got a man, manager?

229
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:17,900
Hey, do I got to pull my badge?

230
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,404
Hey, we run clean here.

231
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,646
How you gonna run
when you're shut down

232
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,087
6 months for
a grand jury inquiry?

233
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,316
Why are you making me
say this shit, man?

234
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:34,084
Do you know her old man?

235
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:36,357
Yeah, he came around,
collecting from her.

236
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,828
Boss kicked him out for trying
to sell christie, the girls.

237
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,998
That was about a month ago.

238
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:44,597
Look familiar?

239
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,132
- Yeah, that's him.
- He ever pick her up?

240
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,701
Yeah.

241
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,741
Went to work on Tyro
Weems, known associates, family.

242
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:55,277
Had a little leeway
with Quesada

243
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,749
now that we had our suspect.

244
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,656
Fuck!

245
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,825
Fuck! Fuck!
Goddamn it!

246
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,962
- Lisa?
- How does it feel?

247
00:13:57,995 --> 00:14:00,329
I told you you can't
treat people like this.

248
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:03,167
Listen, I just need to know

249
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,333
exactly what you told her.

250
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,166
You think it's okay
what you do?

251
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,668
All of you think it's okay
to treat your wives

252
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,667
the way you do,
to treat women the way--

253
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,709
fucking liars and bullies,
and this is what you get!

254
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,373
This is what you get!

255
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:18,380
I have children.

256
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:20,379
You blew up my life,

257
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,011
you fucking whore!

258
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,652
What did you just call me?!

259
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:28,020
What did you just call me, you fucking
wet-noodle, whiskey-dick faggot fuck?!

260
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:30,351
I will skull-fuck you,
you bitch!

261
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,856
Hello, Jake?

262
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,928
- Jake, is this you?
- Marty?

263
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,966
- Is Maggie there?
- That's none of your goddamn business.

264
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,964
Jake, I know she's there,

265
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:47,629
I know she's there,
so just put her

266
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,470
on the phone,
would you, please?

267
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:52,470
Leave her alone,
you fuckin' asshole.

268
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,436
- Jake, I--
- You're not hearing me.

269
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,476
- I don't know what she told you.
- Leave her alone.

270
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:58,447
And I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye--

271
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,449
- You're goddamn right, we haven't
seen eye to eye. - Just please,

272
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,154
- put her on the phone
for me. Just please-- - No, no.

273
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,648
You are no damn good, Marty,

274
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:05,823
she deserves better,
and don't call here again.

275
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,989
Jake.

276
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:14,392
How many exes you guys have?

277
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,265
I mean, that's what
I'm talking about.

278
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:20,471
Did I make some mistakes?

279
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,438
Yes.

280
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,902
You know the detective's curse?

281
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:28,945
Solution was right under my nose, but I
was paying attention to the wrong clues?

282
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,593
- See you later.
- Bye, hon.

283
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,989
Fuck.

284
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,464
Reggie Ledoux.
Where is he? Now.

285
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:28,368
That's what this is about? Yo,
man, why didn't you say so?

286
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:29,831
Where the fuck is he?

287
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:31,703
I-- I heard
he still cook.

288
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,841
I heard he stopped selling
after he did his bit,

289
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,872
that he only cook
for one client now.

290
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,374
Who?

291
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,006
Some bike gang.

292
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,014
They buy all his product.
Bulk order, no mess.

293
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,014
I heard this
at the clubs is all.

294
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,045
Reggie don't
distribute no more.

295
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,380
Which bike club?

296
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:50,418
Iron Heroes or some shit.

297
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:54,218
Iron-- Iron Crusaders.

298
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:58,024
I don't keep up
with them gearheads.

299
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:01,559
Iron Crusaders?
You sure?

300
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,023
Yup. Them ones.

301
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:07,232
What I heard, Reggie cook
their loads and that's all.

302
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,735
Close your eyes and
count to a hundred,

303
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,734
if you can.

304
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,237
Go.

305
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,205
1... 2...

306
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,738
- Louder.
- 3!

307
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:20,338
4... 5...

308
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:23,337
Listen I-- I talked to Weems and, uh,

309
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:28,247
the dude is cooking for some
motorcycle gang out of Texas.

310
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,215
Iron Crusaders.

311
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,478
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
but-- Iron-- Iron Crusaders?

312
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,718
You're sure he said
Iron Crusaders?

313
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:37,121
I'm sure he said
Iron Crusaders.

314
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:39,595
So we'll, uh,

315
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,826
we'll chase that
tomorrow, yeah?

316
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,758
- What are you doing right now?
- Right now I'm busy.

317
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:54,608
And, as I recall, I...

318
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:57,971
I had to take
some personal time,

319
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:00,106
see my dad.

320
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:05,439
I mean, this is like,
what, 17 years ago?

321
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:09,445
Yeah, you'll have to understand

322
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:11,977
if my memory hasn't
sharpened in the interim.

323
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,578
Ahem.

324
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,355
Fran, stay by the phone.

325
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,817
I will.

326
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,119
Maggie, can I talk to
you for just a second?

327
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:28,063
No. I'm working graveyard.

328
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,804
Girls are with my mom and dad.
It's all in the note, Marty.

329
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:31,327
Okay, will you give me
a chance to--

330
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,127
She came to my home.

331
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,629
Our daughters saw her.
You lying fuck.

332
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:38,133
You stupid, lying fuck.

333
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,098
Jesus Christ.
Listen to me, Mags.

334
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:44,633
I meant everything I said the
other night, every word.

335
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,769
- I-- I stopped.
- Oh, my God.

336
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:49,639
You think your betrayal's
removed by its interruption?

337
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:52,105
She was disgusting.
You're disgusting.

338
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:54,144
- You can't fix this.
- Listen to me. God, listen--

339
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:56,145
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay.

340
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:58,680
I-- I've been--
I've been a mess.

341
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:01,645
Rattled. My...

342
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,685
Just...
my dad dying--

343
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:06,621
- Oh, my God. That was a year ago.
- And drinking and--

344
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:09,113
I don't give a shit about
your goddamn feelings.

345
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:12,286
You need to get out of our
lives, Marty, me and the girls'.

346
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,152
- Read the note. It's all there and you
can't come home. - You don't mean that.

347
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:17,358
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- You don't mean that.

348
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,790
Listen, I...

349
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:22,991
You are not gonna break up
my fuckin' family, okay?

350
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,927
- Get out of here right now!
- No.

351
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,030
Excuse me.
You all right, Maggie?

352
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:28,629
Sir, I suggest you leave.

353
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,100
Everything's fine, Doc.
I'm State Police.

354
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:35,174
I appreciate that, but are you
here in that capacity now,

355
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,140
as-- as law enforcement?

356
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,911
You don't want to do this.

357
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:34,975
Get your hands
off me, goddamn it,

358
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,575
and call your
commanding officer.

359
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,110
- You're making a scene, Marty!
- No!

360
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:41,146
There is no scene, unless
Mall Patrol here makes one.

361
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,483
I am calmly discussing
a private matter

362
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:45,547
with my wife!

363
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:48,482
Private in a pretty public way, man.
Easy, easy.

364
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:50,522
- This is none of your fuckin' business.
- No, no.

365
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:52,489
It's none of my business,
but we got to work.

366
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:54,024
You hear me, Marty?

367
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:55,487
I got a line on Ledoux.

368
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,190
I got it right fuckin' now.

369
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:59,787
I need you to come in,
leave this shit till later.

370
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,761
I love you, honey,

371
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:05,927
and I ain't givin' up.

372
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:11,027
Come on.

373
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,196
We can get to Ledoux.
Marty, it's gonna be dirty.

374
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:18,204
I just need her
to give me another shot.

375
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:20,706
If I could just get
another shot--

376
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:23,241
Listen, can I
tell you something?

377
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:24,705
Yeah.

378
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,704
This is none of my business.

379
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,242
I don't want to hear it.

380
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,713
All right. I'm sorry.

381
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:38,715
You total shit.

382
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:41,883
You know, this is part
on you, you know?

383
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,884
You can't just slide
into my life,

384
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:45,851
creating tensions,
judging me--

385
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:48,889
What, I make you tap some bimbo,
looks like a young Maggie?

386
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:51,222
I make you flaunt that shit?

387
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:53,284
Fuck, that night
at the Longhorn,

388
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:55,587
you were so obvious,
man, checking her out,

389
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,593
and she looked crazy enough
to have followed you there.

390
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:02,791
With all the dick swagger you
roll, you can't spot crazy pussy?

391
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:06,159
I fucked up.

392
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,167
I just...

393
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,997
I like something wild.
I always did.

394
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:14,971
I just...
it feels like it--

395
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,969
it smoothes out the other
parts of my life most of--

396
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:21,207
Listen, Marty, one more time.
It's none of my fuckin' business.

397
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,176
Ah, fuck.

398
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,145
Look, we got a job to do.

399
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:29,142
Off-book. That's the only
play I can think of.

400
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:33,045
I-- I got to straighten out things
with the family. I got to fix it.

401
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:35,483
That bike club.
I know 'em.

402
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,019
I had deals with 'em when
I was working narco.

403
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:41,521
We can get to that
motherfucker Ledoux.

404
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:44,517
So, enough with this
self-improvement,

405
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,687
penance,
hand-wringing shit.

406
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,191
Let's go to work.

407
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,694
Do you think you're...

408
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,661
Fuck!

409
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,626
Hell of a bedside manner
you got, Rust.

410
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,634
Ah, you know being stupid's
different than callin' in sick,

411
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,365
and this is a bar,
not a fuckin' bedside.

412
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:05,493
Friend in need.

413
00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:08,839
Every time I think
you hit a ceiling,

414
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,806
you just keep raising the bar.

415
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,970
You are like the Michael Jordan
of being a son of a bitch.

416
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:16,538
Let's go. Come on. Really
gonna love this jacket I got.

417
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:24,374
Holy shit.

418
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,615
You visit a lot of gun shows?

419
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:30,315
Ah, it's just some stuff I kept in
case some work came back on me.

420
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:36,419
These boys Ledoux deals to,

421
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,855
they're out of east Texas.

422
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:41,992
I worked 'em when I
was DEA task force.

423
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,629
They know you're 5-0?

424
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,068
No.

425
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:49,225
I wasn't sure,

426
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:51,728
so I checked with
my old handler.

427
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,736
As far as my cover goes,

428
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,767
I took 3 slugs
in a DEA shootout

429
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,203
in Port Houston.

430
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:02,771
Anybody that gives a
shit figures I'm dead.

431
00:26:02,804 --> 00:26:05,242
Major said

432
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:08,906
the task force used
to call you Crash.

433
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,745
I'm gonna have to take
some personal time

434
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:15,218
on this, Marty,
a couple of weeks.

435
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:18,279
Got to get out there and
get seen, drop some lines.

436
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,982
I mean, badges ain't gonna
get us near these people,

437
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:25,488
so the plan is
we make 'em an offer...

438
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,528
we get a line
on their supplier,

439
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,528
confirm it's Ledoux,

440
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:32,002
bring him in.

441
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:34,370
And then, once we're out there,

442
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,704
all right, it's just
you and me on this.

443
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:39,706
I don't like that.

444
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:42,907
What happens, they clock
you're not you?

445
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:45,343
Mmm.

446
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,381
No, I can't do what I need
to do if we got watchdogs.

447
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:52,379
Besides, like you said,
Quesada'd pull me.

448
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:55,048
The stakes ain't
that high anyway.

449
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,848
I get found, I take
a bullet to the head.

450
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,348
This cartel I worked
on the border,

451
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,517
they, uh, they had
this routine.

452
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:09,220
They'd duct-tape you to a chair
that was bolted to the floor,

453
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,188
use a couple rolls,

454
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,198
make sure you couldn't
budge a fuckin' inch.

455
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:17,700
And they'd cut
around your face,

456
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:20,732
grip your scalp, yank down,

457
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,375
rip your face off.

458
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,238
Hmm.

459
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,507
And they'd put a mirror
in front of you

460
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,348
so you could get
a good look at yourself.

461
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:37,849
And they'd cut your dick
and your balls off...

462
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,690
shove 'em down your throat

463
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:44,783
until you bled and choked out,

464
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:46,917
while you were watching.

465
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,263
So...

466
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,960
as far as high stakes go,

467
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,968
bullet to the head?

468
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:58,435
It ain't that.

469
00:27:58,476 --> 00:27:59,875
Hey.

470
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:04,212
You sure you want to do this?

471
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:07,412
Not exactly.

472
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:32,231
Realize you got
a upstairs here, right?

473
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:44,813
What is that?

474
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,782
Ink and cayenne.

475
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:50,747
Irritates the skin,
looks contused.

476
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:54,819
How long they have you out
there, working the corridor?

477
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:57,324
Almost 4 years.

478
00:28:57,357 --> 00:29:00,259
4? What the hell?

479
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:03,699
UCs ain't supposed to
do more than 11 months.

480
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,530
Yeah, but I-- I'd
fucked up on the job,

481
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:11,710
and to make it better,
they went with me.

482
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,214
That's a long time,
being like that.

483
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:26,990
I need a good story to move
fast, and I think I got one.

484
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:31,830
All we need now is
some good coke.

485
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:34,491
Where you gonna get that?

486
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,497
Don't worry about it.

487
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,735
So you got a suspect,

488
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:45,167
and you take a leave
of absence?

489
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:46,503
Yup.

490
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,579
Like I said, to see my pops.

491
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:51,714
Had leukemia.

492
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:01,551
Favre. Ahem. I get the
evidence key from you?

493
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:04,054
Yeah. Heard you
were taking time.

494
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:06,557
- Thank you.
- Leaving tonight.

495
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,218
- Sign the log.
- Yep.

496
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:27,658
You supposed to see
both eyes in this one?

497
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:00,477
They really should have
a better system for this.

498
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,149
We looked at your
old partner's history.

499
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:06,053
And coincidences
keep mounting, Detective.

500
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:09,522
Oh, coincidences like what?

501
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:12,385
Well, I don't know if it would
qualify as coincidence, but,

502
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:15,057
near as we could tell, his
pops never had leukemia.

503
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,461
- No hospital records of that.
- Fact, nobody in that town in Alaska's

504
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:21,967
seen Travis Cohle
in more than 30 years.

505
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,070
That it?

506
00:32:24,103 --> 00:32:26,502
You still angry
at him, your pops?

507
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:28,007
No.

508
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,006
He's dead.

509
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,982
You were, though.

510
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:34,349
I mean, why you two
didn't talk.

511
00:32:34,382 --> 00:32:37,384
We never really liked
each other.

512
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:40,025
There's a difference.

513
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,292
He was in 'Nam.

514
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:48,226
Met my mother on leave
in Galveston.

515
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,490
Time he came back, I was two.

516
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,457
She dumped me on him,

517
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:55,601
then she hauled ass,
and he and I moved to Alaska.

518
00:32:55,634 --> 00:33:00,105
He was a survivalist,
I guess you'd call it.

519
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:03,771
Had some very fucking
strange ideas.

520
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,775
Oh, there's nothing like
the night sky out there, though.

521
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:16,351
But I couldn't handle
the cold, so...

522
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:19,252
I headed back to south Texas
'cause all I could remember

523
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:22,420
was at least it never got cold.

524
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:28,923
My old man always made like
I let him down that way.

525
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:33,930
Said I had no loyalty.

526
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:39,370
A clean break is best now,
while they're still young.

527
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:41,867
Look, that's none
of my business.

528
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:44,370
I mean, but I do need him
to watch my back on this.

529
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:46,872
This is how you all get warped.

530
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,913
You always short-change
the wrong things.

531
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,410
Short-change?

532
00:33:51,451 --> 00:33:52,914
Mm-hmm.

533
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,545
What else?

534
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:58,419
He wanted me to pass
a tide of apologies

535
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,894
of which I'll skip...

536
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:03,398
and he wants to see the girls,

537
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:06,062
if you can make time for it.

538
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:15,747
Kids are the only thing
that matter, Maggie.

539
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,312
They're the only reason for
this whole man-woman drama.

540
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:21,319
I'm sorry.

541
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,780
What are you
suggesting, exactly?

542
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,653
Just that people fuck up.

543
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:29,125
We age.

544
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:31,660
Men, women-- it's not
supposed to work

545
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:34,660
except to make kids.

546
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:37,133
So, if you can imagine

547
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,672
Marty's behavior
as an expression

548
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,608
of weakness, pain,

549
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:45,073
you'd see that it's
not about you.

550
00:34:45,107 --> 00:34:47,643
So, end of the day, you
duck under rationalization,

551
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:50,115
same as any of them.

552
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:53,682
You must have been
a great husband.

553
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:31,852
People have been seeing me
around for about a week.

554
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:35,324
Guy I used to run with, he
wants to meet me tonight.

555
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:37,821
Now, if I can get him
alone, we snatch him up,

556
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:40,862
work him over,
maybe get to Ledoux.

557
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:42,327
Okay.

558
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:43,864
- All right?
- Great.

559
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:45,432
Listen--

560
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:48,107
Phone's fully charged. And
remember, it's real simple.

561
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,443
Green-- answers,
red-- hangs up.

562
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:52,812
- All right.
- I'm the only one that's gonna be calling.

563
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:54,980
- Yeah.
- And keep it charged.

564
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,854
Listen, uh, how was she?

565
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:03,061
What'd she say?

566
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:07,798
She was better. I could
see her softening.

567
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,302
She didn't use the "D" word.

568
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:14,131
My odds, I could see you two back
together within a couple months.

569
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:16,734
That your honest read?

570
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:20,273
That's my honest read, Marty.

571
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:45,558
Look, I don't know

572
00:36:45,592 --> 00:36:48,129
how this guy I'm meeting
tonight feels about me.

573
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,907
- Okay?
- What does that mean?

574
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,405
It means, if you lose track of me
tonight, keep this fucker handy

575
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:56,446
and be listening to
Beaumont police channels.

576
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,078
- Yeah.
- You got it?

577
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,549
Yeah.

578
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:01,012
You got it?

579
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,113
I got it. Are you
gonna be all right?

580
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:04,817
Yeah.

581
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:44,353
Crash, here for Ginger.

582
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:15,849
Well, after Houston,

583
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:18,354
I got to a doc in Eagle Pass,

584
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:21,854
then a coyote got me
across the border.

585
00:38:21,895 --> 00:38:24,356
Past two years, I been
working security

586
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,892
for a group in San Miguel.

587
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:31,304
Feds never ID'd me,
you know, so I figured,

588
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:34,777
hell, two years pass,
things chill down,

589
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,545
it's cool for me to come
back, stick my head up.

590
00:38:37,578 --> 00:38:40,513
That'll be tough, man...

591
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:43,510
thinkin' you been dead
this whole time.

592
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:45,515
I look dead, motherfucker?

593
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:49,548
I'm lookin' to get with you.

594
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,591
You or Miles.

595
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:54,057
Miles ain't gonna want
to see you, Crash.

596
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,527
- Oh, I think he might.
- Well, yeah.

597
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,893
Then I'd say

598
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:01,496
I don't think
you want to see Miles.

599
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:04,034
Man, I ain't here to start
a thing, all right?

600
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,505
Boys I been running
with in Mexico,

601
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:09,042
there could be a hell of
a deal for both sides,

602
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:11,085
fuckin' money to be made.

603
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:12,950
Real money.

604
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,655
What kind of money?

605
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,173
Goddamn Rust.

606
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:26,301
What the fuck?

607
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,006
My boys are looking
to trade, all right?

608
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,311
Coke for meth.

609
00:40:07,678 --> 00:40:09,648
What you got there?
Ahem.

610
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:11,657
- This one's just for you.
- Just for me?

611
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,656
Uh-huh.

612
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,690
What'd you cut it with?

613
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:17,195
Oh, you'll see.

614
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:19,330
You'll dig it.

615
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,339
After all I meant to you, huh?

616
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,857
Now, who exactly
are these guys?

617
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:44,223
Uh, they, uh...

618
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:46,159
ex-Mex Army.

619
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,694
They got a Colombian connection.

620
00:40:48,735 --> 00:40:52,193
They need meth for
the maquiladoras.

621
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:54,866
Yeah, they could
cook it themselves,

622
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,699
but then the cartels
would take notice,

623
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,738
and that ain't what
they're lookin' for.

624
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:00,370
Hmm.

625
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:06,241
Here.

626
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:08,880
Taste that, homie.

627
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:18,258
That ain't no
fuck-around shit.

628
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,394
Goddamn.

629
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:28,770
Whew.

630
00:41:28,803 --> 00:41:30,708
You keep it.

631
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:34,406
I've got bulldozers' worth of
that shit where I came from.

632
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:39,784
The thing is...

633
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:42,259
we got one cook.

634
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,755
Does all our work,
exclusive-like.

635
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,733
He's real specific about that.

636
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:51,763
Now, what's this worth to you,
Crash, me selling Miles on this?

637
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:55,300
Well, I'd go you one
better, brother.

638
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:58,310
We don't take that shit
to Miles at all.

639
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:00,614
You and me work the supplier,

640
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:02,646
the cut's whatever the
fuck we want it to be.

641
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,648
Now, now, that's
tricky shit, bro,

642
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:06,657
and I don't know you
like I used to.

643
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,425
Yeah, I don't know you
like I used to, either.

644
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:09,920
That's why the fuck I'm here.

645
00:42:09,953 --> 00:42:11,928
Well, let me tell you
why I came, Crash.

646
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:14,096
I need something
from you, tonight.

647
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:16,634
I had a 4-man team
for a big grab,

648
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,602
lost one to smokies.

649
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:20,297
I came looking to replace him,

650
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,801
if you're still
a bad-ass.

651
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,970
I don't do A&R, man,
no fuckin' bank jobs.

652
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:25,675
It ain't nothin' like that.

653
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,178
I need a good soldier.

654
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,642
Now, you do this with us,

655
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,649
we talk about
puttin' you with my man.

656
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,648
Look.

657
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:35,681
I don't ride cowboy
no more, Ginger.

658
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:37,620
- Oh.
- I don't do this small-time shit

659
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,661
like this thing you're
talking about, all right?

660
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,660
What, you get neutered
down south, huh?

661
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:46,165
I embrace the outlaw life.

662
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:49,331
Now, you dress the part still.

663
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:52,698
That just an act?

664
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:55,171
When in Rome, brother,

665
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:57,709
but I do clean up
real fuckin' pretty.

666
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:02,178
Motherfucker,
I need a gunslinger.

667
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:05,683
Now, you ain't too timid,
get on this shit with me.

668
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:08,849
Then we can talk
about doin' business.

669
00:43:12,254 --> 00:43:14,349
Where?

670
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,853
My place.

671
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:22,752
Down the bayou.

672
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:24,759
All right.
I got my truck.

673
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:26,790
It'll be safe here.

674
00:43:31,556 --> 00:43:32,995
Members only.

675
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,660
I'm just lookin' for a friend.

676
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,410
Hey. What the fuck?

677
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,377
Look, look, look,
my buddy's not here.

678
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,410
- You ain't listening!
- I'm his sponsor, and

679
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:20,681
I'm worried that he might
have started drinking again.

680
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:22,711
You better worry that we
don't pull your head off

681
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:24,215
and shit down your neck!

682
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:25,718
He's been 20 years sober.

683
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:27,350
Just give me one second.

684
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:35,059
What the hell!

685
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:37,091
- I'm leaving, sir.
- A guy can just come in here and say,

686
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:40,092
"Lookin' for a fuckin' friend"?!

687
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:43,102
Ought to worry more
about your balls, faggot!

688
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,135
Get the fuck outta here!

689
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:47,141
I'm leaving.

690
00:44:47,174 --> 00:44:48,637
Jesus Christ.

691
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,407
Run, motherfucker!

692
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,413
That's good.

693
00:45:19,276 --> 00:45:21,714
Son of a bitch, man!

694
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:23,481
- Fuck is that?
- That there?

695
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:26,947
- That's Tigger the nigger.
- Name's Tiger Thomas.

696
00:45:26,988 --> 00:45:30,449
Dealer in them Hoston Projects.
You know them?

697
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:33,184
That's like them bungalowed,
flat-like joints, right?

698
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:34,659
Yeah.

699
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:36,629
They keep a stash house there.

700
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:39,132
I'll get you, you fucking dicks!

701
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:41,698
Hey, why don't you shut
the fuck up, nigger?

702
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:43,162
Fuck you!

703
00:45:43,203 --> 00:45:45,667
So you all gonna
take a stash house

704
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,435
in coon country, huh, 4 guys?

705
00:45:48,476 --> 00:45:51,139
Well, how big's the projects,
man, like square block-wise?

706
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:56,781
Get the gear, mates.

707
00:45:59,688 --> 00:46:03,526
Wait till you see this.
You're gonna love it.

708
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:16,670
Oh, you're going in
as cops, huh?

709
00:46:16,703 --> 00:46:19,206
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

710
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,511
You know where
the stash house is?

711
00:46:21,544 --> 00:46:24,244
Tiger's gonna take us there.

712
00:46:24,277 --> 00:46:26,782
Well, you got an exit plan?

713
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,279
Hmm?

714
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,751
Timetable?

715
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:33,720
The real cops come,
then what, huh?

716
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:36,420
I mean, you say you're going
in the one fuckin' car?

717
00:46:36,453 --> 00:46:37,587
Uh-huh.

718
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,723
Far as I remember, man,

719
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:41,892
the place is blocked in.

720
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,428
That is one way in,
one way out.

721
00:46:43,461 --> 00:46:46,364
It could be fuckin'
Mogadishu, man.

722
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:48,364
We hit trouble,

723
00:46:48,398 --> 00:46:50,901
you're just gonna
fuck it in the ass.

724
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:53,911
You scoop out the soft brains

725
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,911
inside the skull.

726
00:46:57,912 --> 00:47:01,413
Well, so you have
thought it out.

727
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:03,716
My bad.

728
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:23,068
I come through
for you on this tonight,

729
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:25,542
I got to know you're
gonna hook me up,

730
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:29,110
'cause I got a real job I
was supposed to be doing.

731
00:47:29,143 --> 00:47:30,678
Hmm?

732
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:34,888
You got my word. You back
me on this, I'll back you.

733
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,370
Fuck it. Let's go.

734
00:47:48,404 --> 00:47:50,267
Up and at 'em, eggplant.

735
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,837
Motherfuckers.

736
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,837
- Fuck you!
- Come on.

737
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,836
I'll kill you, motherfuckers!

738
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,011
Y'all are dead!
Y'all are dead!

739
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:13,449
406 reported on Fullington Street...

740
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,931
Air 3, Dispatch.

741
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:27,930
Go ahead, Air 3.

742
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:31,434
Over Zone 6, Hoston Projects.

743
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:34,477
Pretty quiet, possible 507s.

744
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,941
Everything's Code 4.

745
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:40,118
Copy that.
10-4, Air 3.

746
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:45,656
Man, you got two ways
of lookin' at it, Tiger.

747
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,189
You can die and lose your shit,

748
00:48:48,222 --> 00:48:50,155
or you could live,

749
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,829
go make some more shit.

750
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:50,417
- What's up? - Y'all get back
in your house, now. Police.

751
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,952
Sheriff's Department! Get
back in your house. Do it.

752
00:49:52,985 --> 00:49:54,817
There's nothin' to see here.

753
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,255
Sorry son of a bitch.

754
00:49:57,288 --> 00:50:00,286
- Fuck out of here and start going...
- Fucker, start moving.

755
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,788
Tiger, man, yo.
What's up, man? What's this?

756
00:50:02,822 --> 00:50:04,586
- Yo! Fuck! Lamar!
- Sheriff's Department.

757
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,624
- Lamar!
- Freeze, motherfucker.

758
00:50:06,658 --> 00:50:08,121
Come on...

759
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:09,593
Aah!

760
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:11,393
Get up there, big boy.
Get on the door.

761
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,730
- Tell them that it's safe.
- Lamar.

762
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:14,404
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come open the door, Lamar.

763
00:50:14,437 --> 00:50:16,972
- Tell them who you are.
- Fuckin' door, man. It's Tiger.

764
00:50:17,005 --> 00:50:19,434
Get up here. Get back!

765
00:50:19,468 --> 00:50:21,971
Police!

766
00:50:22,004 --> 00:50:23,940
Fuck!

767
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:25,948
Everybody down, now!

768
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,947
Sheriffs!
Hands behind your head!

769
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,947
Shut up!
Get the fuck down!

770
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,634
Don't move.

771
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:56,988
Get in the tub.
Listen, listen.

772
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:59,990
You lay down.
Don't you move.

773
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:03,530
Got no shit!
Let me outta here!

774
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:05,466
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

775
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,467
Look on the left.
It's right there.

776
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,510
No, no, no, no. Ginger, no.
Don't touch it.

777
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:11,405
- It's in there.
- You open it, motherfucker.

778
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:13,477
- Get that gun out of my face.
- I'll put something else

779
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:14,845
in your face,
you don't shut up.

780
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:17,382
Get your fuckin' ass
over there! Start movin'!

781
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:18,886
Come on!

782
00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:20,852
Ginger.

783
00:51:20,886 --> 00:51:23,315
You motherfucker!
Get that shit off of there!

784
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:25,889
- Come on! Hurry your ass up!
- Fuck.

785
00:51:25,922 --> 00:51:27,352
- Fuck you!
- Watch your fucking mouth.

786
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:28,856
All right, 30 seconds,
in and out.

787
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:30,888
30 seconds, in and out, Ginger.

788
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,328
Get that safe open.

789
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:34,427
Watch it, watch it. I'll
nuke you, motherfucker.

790
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,363
Keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

791
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:38,362
I'm gonna fire on you,
motherfucker.

792
00:51:38,403 --> 00:51:39,866
Get the fuck off my dawg!

793
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:42,405
- Fuck!
- Easy, easy.

794
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:44,877
Just get in and get
the fuck out, Ginger.

795
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,706
It's Christmastime, Crash!

796
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:48,209
- We got this shit!
- Easy.

797
00:51:48,242 --> 00:51:50,683
Fuck that fake-ass po-po!

798
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:53,380
Stay calm. Get it, Ginger.
Get the fuck out of here.

799
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:55,419
Ginger, man, they're
gathering out there--

800
00:51:57,452 --> 00:51:58,419
Aah!

801
00:51:58,452 --> 00:51:59,555
Come on, Ginger!

802
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:01,893
- They're animals out there, man.
- Easy, easy.

803
00:52:01,926 --> 00:52:03,894
Easy, motherfucker.

804
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:05,860
Easy. Easy.

805
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:08,333
Ginger, let's fuckin' go!

806
00:52:08,366 --> 00:52:09,869
- You sorry-ass motherfucker!
- Easy.

807
00:52:09,902 --> 00:52:12,372
I told your cracker ass!
You're dead!

808
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:14,706
Don't fucking
fire! Do not--

809
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:16,203
Goddamn it.

810
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:17,675
Lamar!

811
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:20,841
Ginger! Ginger!
Stop fuckin' around!

812
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:24,710
Fuck!

813
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:29,212
Fuck!

814
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:34,220
- What the fuck!
- Ginger!

815
00:52:34,253 --> 00:52:36,346
I fuckin' knew it!

816
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,154
Aah!

817
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:43,223
Wish I could have done this from
the start, you fucking moron!

818
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:47,460
Oh, fuck! What the fuck
are you doin', man?

819
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,396
Shut the fuck up.

820
00:52:49,429 --> 00:52:51,405
Motherfucker!

821
00:52:56,945 --> 00:52:58,375
Hey!

822
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:04,049
Freeze. Who else
is in the house?

823
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:06,056
- Nobody.
- Okay. Get in the bathroom.

824
00:53:06,089 --> 00:53:07,923
In the bathroom.
Lay down.

825
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:24,242
Marty, okay.

826
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:26,243
I need you to meet me
at Amelia Street

827
00:53:26,276 --> 00:53:28,278
between 18th and 19th
in 90 seconds.

828
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,748
You got it?
You got it?

829
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:32,284
Amelia!

830

Ooh, one right there!

834
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:45,935
Aah!

Get your ass up!
Come on!

836
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:55,479
Aah!

837
00:53:57,545 --> 00:53:58,984
Ginger.

838
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,354
You stupid mother--

839
00:54:02,388 --> 00:54:03,651
The neighborhood--

840
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:10,459
Come on, man!
Police behind us, man!

841
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:12,993
Come on.

842
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:21,509
Keep going, man!
Come on! Hurry up, man!

843
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,790
Put the weapon down!

844
00:54:31,823 --> 00:54:33,821
You motherfucker!

845
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,252
I'll get you!

846
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:38,827
You'll get yours, fuckin'
Crash, you motherfucker.

847
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,799
You'll get-- aah!

848
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,334
Come out
with your hands raised!

849
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,330
Get down on your knees!

850
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,779
Quick, hide. Here.

851
00:55:07,812 --> 00:55:09,410
Oh!

852
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,420
Oh, shit!

853
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,924
Hey!

854
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:28,810
Go!

855
00:55:57,861 --> 00:55:59,826
Go, go, go!

856
00:56:04,338 --> 00:56:07,105
What the fuck happened?

857
00:56:07,138 --> 00:56:09,602
Remember that meth contact now?

858
00:56:09,643 --> 00:56:11,612
You rat motherfucker!

859
00:56:11,645 --> 00:56:14,115
You're gonna give me
the location for Ledoux,

860
00:56:14,148 --> 00:56:16,482
I'm gonna let you
slide, Ginger.

861
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:18,452
Bullshit.

862
00:56:18,485 --> 00:56:20,823
What the fuck you think
I want with you, huh?

863
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:24,295
Oh, goddamn.

864
00:56:24,328 --> 00:56:27,495
I am so done talking
to you like a man.

865
00:56:30,297 --> 00:56:32,269
Go, go, go.

866
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:34,333
We have multiple gunshots.

867
00:56:34,366 --> 00:56:36,807
217, multiple suspects...

Trees.

38
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:52,347
That little place
in the rock

39
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,482
in the trees.

40
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,902
A cave

41
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,738
is how I remember it.

42
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:03,241
It's like a fairy tale.

43
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,330
Four days?

44
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:13,668
No, maybe he gave me
something.

45
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,372
Maybe I blocked it out.

46
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:23,011
It's a black hole.

47
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,679
This empty space,

48
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:27,599
<i>those four days.</i>

49
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,051
And what I remember
when I got...

50
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,776
I got in the car.

52
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,403
He didn't force me.

53
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:52,073
<i>He didn't even get</i>
<i>near me.</i>

54
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:56,294
He called me pretty.

55
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:04,919
<i>I remember.</i>

56
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:10,341
I remember
it made me feel...

57
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:13,561
I liked...

58
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:24,572
<i>I got in the van</i>
<i>with a stranger.</i>

59
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:31,112
<i>Every time I remember</i>

60
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:33,448
<i>that feeling,</i>

61
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,167
<i>like pride,</i>

62
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:39,454
<i>I get sick to my stomach.</i>

63
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,673
<i>I could lie to myself,</i>

64
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,425
but I felt proud.

65
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:47,846
I was proud
that he thought

66
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,431
I was pretty.

67
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:02,977
Makes me sick.

68
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:07,699
None of that
was your fault.

69
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:47,071
Ray:
<i>I walk up behind him.</i>

70
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,825
It's him.
It's the guy.

71
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,694
I've been thinking
about him.

72
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,030
<i>I've been picturing him</i>
<i>for months.</i>

73
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:59,167
<i>I'm not sleeping.</i>

74
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,669
<i>Passing strangers</i>
<i>who was wondering.</i>

75
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,123
He turned his head

76
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,175
right as I was
up on him.

77
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,796
<i>I planned to say it...</i>

78
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,383
but I didn't say anything.

79
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:18,052
I got sick,
and to keep from being sick,

80
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:19,637
I raised up...

81
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,199
right when
he was turning.

82
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:38,656
And I...

83
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,998
<i>It didn't make</i>
<i>anything better.</i>

84
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,585
<i>It made it worse.</i>

85
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:55,723
<i>And I know now,</i>

86
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,425
you know, the act,

87
00:05:57,427 --> 00:06:02,597
it described
a trajectory.

88
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,767
People...

89
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,355
whole cultures

90
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:12,607
<i>wouldn't blame you.</i>

91
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,994
I don't.

92
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:25,119
It wasn't him.

93
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,458
They got the real guy.

94
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,261
Something in Venice,
you know?

95
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,296
Weeks ago.

96
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,389
Ani:
<i>Who was he?</i>

97
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,776
I don't even know
if it matters.

98
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,829
So I haven't been
like this in a long time.

99
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,550
Years.

100
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,586
I could tell.

101
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:19,640
Why?

102
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:26,481
You seemed like

103
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,983
you were making up
for lost time.

104
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:42,363
<i>( train whistle blows )</i>

105
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,498
I'd do anything
for 10 more years.

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,167
We should have met
when we were young.

107
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,337
We said we wouldn't
regret the past.

108
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,423
Anyway, who said we don't
have 10 more years?

109
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,894
There's 100,000 there.

110
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,979
You're gonna go
with Nails.

111
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:01,182
I'll meet you
in two weeks or less.

112
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:04,018
Like hell.
I'm not leaving you.

113
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,822
I know about the clubs.
I saw Blake.

114
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:10,358
- I'm not--
- You don't have a choice.

115
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,244
I always have a choice.

116
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:17,081
And I'm not
going anywhere.

117
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:24,839
It's not gonna work,
the you and me thing.

118
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,876
The way I see it is you
weren't up front with me.

119
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,712
If you can't have a kid, then
what good is the design, see?

120
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,848
You had me on
the fairy tale for a while,

121
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,217
and it was good,

122
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,768
but now it's time to go.

123
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,438
You can't act for shit.

124
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,606
Take it from me.

125
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,892
Where one goes, the other goes.
That's what we said.

126
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:48,979
That's not acting. Now take your
payout and get the fuck on.

127
00:08:57,206 --> 00:09:00,708
Your ring?
What is that?

128
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,127
You think that I--
here.

129
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,997
You think I give
a fuck about rings?

130
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:11,001
- That was a big diamond.
- Fuck you.

131
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:14,088
I am not leaving you. I know
what you're doing, Frank.

132
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,807
Stop reading into things.
Listen to what I'm saying.

133
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,143
I am listening
and you're not convincing.

134
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,978
So you listen to me.

135
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Whatever they do to you,
they do to me.

136
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,933
Do you understand?
There's us.

137
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:29,854
There's us, and everything
else is in the gray.

138
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,606
So fuck your martyrdom.

139
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:35,609
I came in this with my
eyes open, same as you.

140
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:47,004
You have to go.

141
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:50,791
I got us new cars. Nails is
gonna watch out for you.

142
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,960
No.

143
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,962
You come with me.

144
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:57,465
100,000 is more
than enough.

145
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:00,468
- To start over?
- To hold on to what's ours.

146
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,269
I can't run.

147
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,939
They'll come for me
and they'll keep coming.

148
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,524
I need to finish this.

149
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,309
You can't finish this.

150
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,312
They made sure of that before
they threw the first punch.

151
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:14,198
I have a play.
One thing they don't know.

152
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
It's not worth it.

153
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:20,070
I cannot run.
It'll never stop.

154
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:22,406
If I do that
and I come home

155
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:25,075
and I find you, no.

156
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,745
No.

157
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,501
I'm not--
I'm not leaving you.

158
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:39,807
Baby, you made it all
mean something.

159
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,761
Everything before we met.

160
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,849
If they came to me
through you,

161
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,235
if they hurt you,

162
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,654
I couldn't,

163
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:56,240
I wouldn't
deserve to live.

164
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,692
If you love me,

165
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,328
I cannot do the things
I have to do

166
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,781
unless I know
you're safe.

167
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,866
If I don't think
you're safe,

168
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,535
I'm lost.

169
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:08,702
They got me.

170
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:11,372
Nails has two tickets.

171
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:14,375
Venezuela
out of Oregon.

172
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:16,460
Not unless you're with me.

173
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:19,046
Otherwise the last
six years are nothing.

174
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:21,382
No, they weren't.

175
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:23,467
Never nothing.

176
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,886
I know.

177
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:29,273
I know. That was
never our story.

178
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:33,694
I got my ticket out.

179
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:36,780
I'll meet you inside of
two weeks, I promise.

180
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,404
Two weeks.

181
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:45,406
Or less.

182
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:46,624
Barquisimeto.

183
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:49,460
You'll meet me
in two weeks

184
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,579
or less.

185
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:53,964
El Obelisco.

186
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,549
There's a park there.

187
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:59,920
Wear a white dress.

188
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:06,477
You wear a white suit with
a red rose in your jacket.

189
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,598
I'll wear a red rose
in my jacket.

190
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,235
I'll see you coming
out of the crowd,

191
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,605
a head higher
than everybody else.

192
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,825
At first I'm worried.

193
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,611
I can't see you.

194
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:28,499
But then you do.

195
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,000
( chuckles )

196
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,585
I see the white dress.

197
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:45,849
You don't have
to do that, Frank.

198
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,801
I mean the money.

199
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,720
Couldn't see.

200
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:51,138
Blood in my eyes.

201
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,857
Nail in my fucking head.

202
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:55,693
I heard him saying
leave me.

203
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,228
Fucking teamster.
A nail gun.

204
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,815
Slung me over your shoulder.
I don't forget that.

205
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:04,068
I know you don't.

206
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,823
Nobody's gonna
get near her.

207
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:11,792
I promise.

208
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,494
We'll see you
in two weeks.

209
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:14,745
Or less.

210
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,008
( mouths words ) _

211
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:31,145
<i>( engine starts )</i>

212
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:53,500
Man: <i>The security camera
right down the street.</i>

213
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,035
Burris:
<i>Yeah, he, uh--</i>

214
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:58,038
he worked under the prosecutor
for the AG that got murdered.

215
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,874
- ( phone buzzing )
- Excuse me.

216
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,461
Burris:<i> - Yeah?</i>
- Woodrugh?

217
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,930
He's no longer with us,
I'm afraid.

218
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:09,183
<i>Hello, Ray.</i>

219
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,388
Ray: - What happened?
- <i> Why don't you tell me, Ray?</i>

220
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,192
Hmm?
Davis, Woodrugh.

221
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:19,727
It's all you, right?

222
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,397
You know I know, right?

223
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,783
<i>The robbery in '92.</i>

224
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,985
<i>Caspere kept</i>
<i>some diamonds.</i>

225
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:30,788
He was holding them
over you, yeah?

226
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:35,492
We should meet.
Let's talk this over.

227
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,628
You could come out
of this good, Ray.

228
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,748
I can make it go away.

229
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,468
Put you right.
Get you paid.

230
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,720
Sure.

231
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:50,841
Yeah, I'll drop by
PD later today.

232
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:54,344
Where are you?

233
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:57,014
Come on, Ray.
You're one of us.

234
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:01,101
Why Woodrugh?
There was no reason.

235
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:04,571
Why do you care? You know
the guy was a fag, right?

236
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,190
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>you're a player, Ray.</i>

237
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,108
<i>Let's talk.</i>
<i>We can work this out.</i>

238
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,777
Yeah, sure thing,
Lieutenant.

239
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:15,032
What was that?

240
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,418
Woodrugh.

241
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,672
He's dead.

242
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:26,977
<i>( crying )</i>

243
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:33,434
Who?

244
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,352
Why? What--

245
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:39,156
Jesus Christ. He was gonna
have a fucking kid.

246
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:41,358
It was Burris.

247
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>They're putting it</i>
<i>on me.</i>

248
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,696
First Davis, now--
fuck!

249
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:48,115
I can't-- I can't--

250
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:50,250
Jesus, he was--

251
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:54,705
after everything else.

252
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:58,926
( groans )
Fuck.

253
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,970
He was better than us.

254
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,359
He saved our asses.

255
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,145
Twice.

256
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,482
Three times.

257
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:24,735
Now.

258
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:31,992
He deserved better.

259
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,466
Who do we have now?

260
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,587
The girl Erica,
she's in the wind.

261
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,762
There was two of them.

262
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:54,815
- The kids-- boy, girl.
- What?

263
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,017
Field interviews,
that movie set.

264
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,404
We had a crew list. There was a guy there.
Set photographer.

265
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,190
She talked to him.
The ages are right.

266
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:05,743
Fuck, they even
kind of looked alike.

267
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:08,529
Set photographer.
Lenny Tyler.

268
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,331
That's the brother.
Laura and Leonard.

269
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,450
They might have
the hard drive.

270
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:14,918
Caspere's hidden camera.

271
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,538
Caspere's murder,
if it was them,

272
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
it just opened up
all this other stuff.

273
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,292
We were always set up.

274
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,594
So was Frank.

275
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:24,762
Your gangster buddy.

276
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,213
Yeah, he's actually
not a bad guy,

277
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:29,183
but, yeah,
Caspere was playing him.

278
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:31,885
So we find Osterman.
Tyler.

279
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:34,221
Says here Lenny's
with the union.

280
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:36,190
They'd have
some kind of address.

281
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,732
Unless you just want
to take off.

282
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,037
I'm pretty sure

283
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,239
I can get us
out of the country.

284
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:57,911
If there's a chance to get
them, I want to take it.

285
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:05,252
I was never big
on running myself.

286
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,757
Woodrugh wasn't.

287
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,764
( whistles )

288
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,270
Hello.

289
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:13,453
Veronica:
<i>Austin?</i>

290
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:17,491
<i>Tony?</i>

291
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:21,745
Where is he?
Tony.

292
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,748
I don't know.

293
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,667
What-- what day is it?

294
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:31,138
- There was yelling.
- Yelling about what?

295
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,008
A Russian man.
Tony's parties.

296
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,344
His new business
or something.

297
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:38,645
Hard to remember.

298
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,764
How did you meet
Austin the mayor?

299
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,400
Tony introduced us.

300
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,820
He say his father lonely
since mother got sick.

301
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,858
But you were
Tony's friend first?

302
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,949
( screams )

303
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,752
Shh, shh.

304
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:04,037
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

305
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:09,877
How did this--

306
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:12,546
I-- I don't--
he kill himself?

307
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,181
Where's the daughter Betty?

308
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:17,718
Betty?
She was there, I think.

309
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,469
With the yelling.

310
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,188
They talk about me.
I hear them.

311
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,807
She's sick
like her mother.

312
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:26,693
I can't believe
Austin would do this.

313
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:29,146
Are you fucking dense?

314
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:31,231
This is your boy Tony.

315
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,400
Made it look like
some half-ass suicide.

316
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:36,653
And my guess is you'll
be taking the fall.

317
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:39,122
Where's Tony now?
Think.

318
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,407
Where would he be?

319
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,993
I-- I don't know.
He's cold to me now.

320
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,747
Is there a safe
in the house?

321
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,632
Do you have access
to bank accounts?

322
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:50,167
Austin handles
those things.

323
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,502
I have allowance.

324
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:55,222
Then I hope you saved some
of that Miss Ukraine money.

325
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:48,035
Erica:
<i>Len?</i>

326
00:22:56,595 --> 00:22:58,261
<i>Len?</i>

327
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,357
You?

328
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,537
Erica:
<i>They split us up after.</i>

329
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,489
<i>I had a foster family,</i>

330
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:27,741
but Len went
into a group home.

331
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:32,579
I ran away at 16.

332
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:34,498
Started working
the streets.

333
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,967
How did you meet
Caspere?

334
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:39,469
Through Tascha.

335
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:41,755
She introduced
me to Tony.

336
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:44,174
Brought me
into the parties.

337
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:47,094
Then she told me
about his diamonds.

338
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:50,931
Then I met him...

339
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:54,434
and I knew.

340
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:57,237
He used to visit
my mother.

341
00:23:58,357 --> 00:24:00,273
I remembered him.

342
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:05,112
And you got him
to hire you?

343
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:07,664
I changed my name.

344
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,583
Dyed my hair red.

345
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:12,119
He didn't recognize me
from the parties.

346
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:15,372
I started digging
into all of his stuff.

347
00:24:15,374 --> 00:24:18,008
And Len,
your brother?

348
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,178
We found each other
years back.

349
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:25,966
He'd been through a lot.

350
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:29,102
The places he grew up.

351
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:32,472
I got him a job
on the movie set.

352
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:37,277
And what happened
with Caspere exactly?

353
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,229
I went to his place.

354
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:42,449
His other place. I left
the door unlocked.

355
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:44,234
Put a pill in his drink.

356
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:47,954
Len came in. He saw
inside the house.

357
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:52,492
He knew what
I'd been doing.

358
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:55,795
He went bad.

359
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:59,499
He was gonna use the
acid to get Ben to talk,

360
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:01,384
to tell us who else
had robbed us,

361
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:05,255
who had killed our parents,
but he got carried away.

362
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:07,474
He was too angry.

363
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:11,311
He put him
out there on the road.

364
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:13,346
- Why?
- I don't know.

365
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,566
I think...

366
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:20,353
he thought it was funny.

367
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:23,073
Caspere was confessing
everything.

368
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:25,108
Begging.
( sniffles )

369
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,495
<i>He told him about</i>
<i>the rail corridor.</i>

370
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:32,365
<i>He drove around with Ben's
body through all those places.</i>

371
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:35,202
Why'd he leave you
like this?

372
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:39,506
Because I was trying
to stop them.

373
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,041
From what?

374
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:44,044
He's gonna meet up with
that chief, Holloway.

375
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:45,845
He's gonna trade him
the hard drive

376
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:47,631
from Ben's place
for the diamonds.

377
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,715
What's on the hard drive?

378
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,885
Would have been footage
of important men.

379
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:55,388
- You said would have.
- We didn't have the password.

380
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:58,308
And the hard drive
erased itself.

381
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,944
Some kind of
security feature.

382
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:04,231
- It's blank.
- He's going there to kill Holloway.

383
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,484
Where's he meeting
Holloway?

384
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:09,069
How long ago
did he leave?

385
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:11,738
A couple of hours. He
wanted to get there early.

386
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,823
- Where?
- The train station here.

387
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:16,910
The big new one.
He wanted a public place.

388
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:20,413
We got her testimony. You stay with her
until we can walk her into a precinct.

389
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:22,132
Ray. Ray, wait.

390
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:40,684
Saw the mayor went for a swim.
Thought I should say good-bye.

391
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:44,487
Osip: <i>What are you doing, Frank?
This was very unlike you.</i>

392
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:48,775
Lashing out, childish.
Now I have to answer.

393
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:51,778
Like I had to answer this,
you patronizing old fuck?

394
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,497
Are you still
in LA, Frank?

395
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:58,118
Oh, I'm long gone,
cue ball.

396
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,536
But we'll settle up later.

397
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:01,621
We certainly will.

398
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:05,125
Good luck with that,
you KGB kike motherfucker.

399
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,460
I'll only need
the one bullet.

400
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:09,796
Maybe not today
and maybe not tomorrow,

401
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:12,215
but, Osip,
when the lights go out,

402
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:14,434
that's me.

403
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,019
<i>( beeps )</i>

404
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:23,193
<i>( phone rings )</i>

405
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,362
- <i> ( beeps )</i>
- Who is this?

406
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:28,982
- <i> Velcoro.</i>
- Ray.

407
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:31,484
I was just
thinking about you.

408
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,458
Where are you
taking me?

409
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,043
Me? Nowhere.

410
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:42,162
This bus goes
to Seattle.

411
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:44,497
Hits a couple stops
in between.

412
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:48,335
You get out of here.
Forget this.

413
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:49,803
Maybe it can
blow over for you.

414
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:53,139
This is never
gonna blow over.

415
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,008
My life ended that day.

416
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,227
Except it didn't.

417
00:27:57,229 --> 00:28:00,597
You can lay it down.
I'm giving you that.

418
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,600
Why?

419
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:07,737
Because...

420
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,272
whatever debt there was,

421
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:12,525
you're not the person who
needs to be punished now.

422
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:14,277
What about Len?

423
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:19,366
Lay him to rest.

424
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:21,584
Sounds like you
lost him years ago.

425
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:26,956
What am I supposed to do?

426
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,878
I don't know.

427
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:08,965
Nobody is here right now.

428
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,167
I just move
a group through.

429
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:14,587
Anybody come around
asking about me?

430
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,389
No.

431
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:24,981
What are you doing, Frank?

432
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:26,182
Taking off soon.

433
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:29,018
And I'm signing
the place over to you.

434
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
All the way.

435
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:33,106
It's yours.

436
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:34,774
Thank you.

437
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:37,327
I was always grateful
for your help.

438
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:44,167
You heard about Ray?

439
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:47,170
It's a frame-up.

440
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,622
He'll be back here,
everything goes all right.

441
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,541
They're gonna need
transport to Mexico.

442
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:54,711
They?

443
00:29:54,713 --> 00:29:56,796
Him and a woman.

444
00:29:58,183 --> 00:30:00,717
What is going on? I heard
about the poker room.

445
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:03,686
Everything's ending.

446
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,305
Time to wake up.

447

Don't turn around or I'll cut you in
half before the show even starts.

462
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:11,731
Just listen closely.

463
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,316
You're fucking
this up, kid.

464
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:15,101
Who are you?

465
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:17,437
The guy you blasted
with a fucking shotgun

466
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,988
in your little bird mask.

467
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,941
That was Caspere's.
Sick fuck.

468
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:23,159
Could have killed you.

469
00:32:23,161 --> 00:32:25,278
Well, you don't need to
worry about that right now.

470
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:29,449
I know what they did.

471
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:31,701
- Why you're here.
- You know what they did?

472
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:36,789
To my father?
To me and my sister?

473
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,126
Executed.

474
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:42,679
Turned my sister
into a whore.

475
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:45,348
I know everything.

476
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,933
I want them, too.

477
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:49,469
But suicide ain't
gonna get that.

478
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:50,937
You want revenge?

479
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,472
Drag their shit out
into the light.

480
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,974
They won't get punished.

481
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:57,944
I am the blade
and the bullet.

482
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:04,150
Then listen
carefully to me.

483
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:43,573

484

00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:30,203
What?

488
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:32,238
What, a wire?

489
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,706
See, I don't need
a wire, Chief.

490
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,291
I got plenty
of insurance.

491
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:38,377
What I need
is a payout.

492
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,413
The land documents.

493
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:42,465
They're in the bag, too.

494
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:46,085
The man who wanted to
meet, he killed Caspere?

495
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:47,587
Correct.

496
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:49,672
One of the Osterman kids.

497
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:51,891
All grown up.

498
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,309
Where is he now?

499
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:55,928
In a Vinci landfill.

500
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:59,515
I got copies
of everything.

501
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:04,020
Something happens
to me on the way out,

502
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,521
that shit hits the cloud.

503
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:08,241
News agencies.

504
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:09,609
What do you want?

505
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:12,111
Any chance
you brought the stones?

506
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:19,001
Plastic. Had I known
you were coming,

507
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:22,622
we could have made
different arrangements.

508
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:25,758
I want out from under.

509
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,927
I want my name cleared.

510
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:31,714
For the hard drive
and land documents?

511
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:33,716
Mm-hmm.

512
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,969
And Bezzerides?

513
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,638
Where is she?

514
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,807
Fuck should I know?

515
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:44,610
She and that Woodrugh guy
both thought I did Davis.

516
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,730
Think I've been working
for you the whole time.

517
00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:50,032
Too bad you weren't.

518
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:54,487
Honestly, Ray, nobody had an
idea you were this competent.

519
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:59,208
You all bought your way
into Vinci with the stones.

520
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,328
Caspere made a deal
with Chessani.

521
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,664
Ben had a talent
for dissembling.

522
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,798
And Dixon?

523
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,717
He wasted his part
of the take, yeah?

524
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,169
He was looking to, what, blackmail
you guys for a new piece?

525
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,838
Where is this going, Ray?

526
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,173
Amarilla.
The shoot-out.

527
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:15,675
How did that happen?

528
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:18,561
He may have gotten
a tip about the raid.

529
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:22,932
Closed everything out,
didn't it?

530
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,353
Now you got a piece
of that central corridor.

531
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:33,693
You know
Chessani's dead, right?

532
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,778
Not the Chessani
I work for.

533
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,866
Cut the shit, Ray.

534
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:42,702
Whatever happened in '92
isn't the issue.

535
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:46,005
You want clear,
we put this on Bezzerides.

536
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:48,257
Geldof is already
on board.

537
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:55,381
No sudden movements, son.

538
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,934
You're public enemy
number one.

539
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,853
Don't even need a reason
to vaporize you.

540
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:09,478
Couldn't you have
just taken the stones?

541
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,314
Way back?

542
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,450
Did you have to kill
those people?

543
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:17,904
The Osterman woman had
been seeing Ben for years.

544
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:21,073
She was pregnant
and she knew things.

545
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,742
When he tried to break it
off, she threatened him.

546
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:25,828
Ben didn't even want the first
kid, much less another one.

547
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,630
The first one?

548
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,382
The girl.
The little one.

549
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:32,001
That was Ben's
illegitimate daughter.

550

You have dignity.

Sure that means
a lot to him.

00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:23,255
You take this Venezuela
deal we're talking,

585
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,724
you make it

Her name is Jordan.

590

If she's there
and I'm not,

591

maybe you can give
her a message.

593

Tell her I wanted
to be there.

00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:58,207
And that story we told,
it's still true.

595

Well, I guess we saved
each other's lives.

651
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:01,450
Tony and Betty. Pitlor, I
want him on the record.

652
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:04,370
His files. We can
get confessions.

653
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:08,006
I've heard enough
confessions today.

654
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:15,714
Venezuela?

655
00:45:18,102 --> 00:45:19,852
We got nothing
to run on.

656
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:24,807
And I owe these filth.

657
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,945
I owe Woodrugh.

658
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:45,577
Would you run?

659
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,965
Now?

660
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:52,751
If I asked,
would you?

661
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,803
I might.

662
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:00,259
I just might.

...a very strong foundation
on which to build a future.

665
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,508
There's a point
to the waltzing in.

666
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,462
I do not like beginning
something unfinished.

667
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:04,266
Mr. Agronov, have you
ever heard of moderation?

668
00:48:18,532 --> 00:48:19,948

669
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:23,569

<i>( man coughing )</i>

675
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:29,968
Guess I was wrong.

676
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,520
It was today.

677
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,723
Old times, Frank.

678
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:37,526
<i>I saved you.</i>

679
00:49:37,528 --> 00:49:39,645
You're like my son.

680
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:44,282
( gunshot )

681
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,891
- Stay down south.
- Yeah.

682
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:04,029
You're going, right?
We got to get out.

683
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:06,231
Yeah, that's the plan.

684
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,400
Thinking about
your boy?

685
00:51:10,738 --> 00:51:12,571
Now you can
send him to Yale.

686
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:14,906
Sure.

687
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:17,909
You taking the boat?

688
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,828
I made other arrangements.

689
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,798
- But I'll be there.
- All right.

690
00:52:07,678 --> 00:52:10,095
They suicided Pitlor.

691
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:12,430
Loose ends.

692
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,266
No sign of Betty
or Tony anywhere.

693
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:16,051
Fuck it.
Later for them.

694
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:17,886
Maybe one day
we get it to the press.

695
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:21,857
Maybe that "Times" guy
who wrote about Vinci.

696
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:24,309
We got a hell
of a retirement bonus.

697
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:28,313
I'm on my way now.
You understand?

698
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:30,866
Yeah.

699
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:32,234
I understand.

700
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,153
Ray: <i>All right. You packed?</i>

701
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,155
Yeah, I'm all set.

702
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:38,540
Boat leaves at 3:00.

703
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:43,078
All right. I'm 40 miles out.
Plenty of time.

704
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,497
Well, hurry anyway.

705
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:48,416
All right.

706
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,385
I, uh...

707
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,509
I'll see you
in a bit.

708
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:59,594
Yeah.

709
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:02,647
Yeah.

710
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,357
He's okay.
He's on his way.

711
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:26,421
Thanks.

712
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:47,225
They have a total valuation
of $3.5 million.

713
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:49,311
I will stand by their grading
anywhere in the world.

You're even a premium club
member in United and American.

716
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:42,530
That's your two
plus five.

717
00:54:49,673 --> 00:54:52,958
Frank, you're full
of surprises.

718
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:55,710
The Russians?

719
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:59,347
I wonder when we will hear
about what you've done.

720
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:04,386
Another 500 when
I'm where I need to be.

721
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:23,738
Safe travels.

<i>There's a transponder</i>

And you're better
than me.

I was already gone.

808
01:06:41,551 --> 01:06:43,501
What the fuck
did you come out to say?

809
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:45,469
You made a deal.

810
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:47,755
No clubs,
no locations for us.

811
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:51,475
The clubs burned down.
What was I supposed to do?

812
01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:53,644
Armenians, Russians,
this is their thing.

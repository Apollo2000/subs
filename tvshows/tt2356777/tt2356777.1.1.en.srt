3
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:20,203
What'd you think, you
paired up with him?

4
00:02:20,236 --> 00:02:24,167
What'd I think?

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,302
Well, you don't pick
your parents,

6
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:29,770
and you don't pick
your partner.

7
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:35,439
You know, they used to call
him The Tax Man for a while?

8
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:39,073
He'd come out of Texas,
so nobody knew him.

9
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:41,407
Seemed a bit...

10
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,004
raw-boned to me, edgy.

11
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:46,476
Took 3 months till we got him

12
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:49,380
over to the house for dinner.

13
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:51,211
Around our big 419.

14
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:53,683
That's what y'all want
to hear about, right,

15
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,484
Dora Lange, kids in the woods?

16
00:02:56,517 --> 00:03:00,215
Yeah, sure,
but, uh, talk about Cohle.

17
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,886
We heard some stories.

18
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,320
Kind of a strange guy, huh?

19
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:09,220
Strange. Uh-- heh, heh, heh.

20
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:11,061
Yeah.

21
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:14,592
Rust would pick a fight
with the sky

22
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:19,396
if he didn't like
its shade of blue,

23
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:22,333
but when we finally got
him over to the house--

24
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,467
this is when that case
was hot--

25
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,664
poor bastard looked like
he was on his way

26
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:30,202
to the firing squad.

27
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,737
Dora Lange.

28
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,344
Yeah. Occult ritual murder.

29
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:39,710
You can thank
the "Advertiser" for that.

30
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:41,015
Could you, uh,
hold off on that?

31
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:43,216
All right. Yeah. You can't
do that here no more.

32
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:46,249
- Huh?
- Uh-uh.

33
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,688
Don't be assholes.

34
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:49,793
You want to hear this or not?

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,765
Vermillion sheriff requested
assistance with a 419,

36
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:14,869
cane fields outside of Erath.

37
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,870
I'd been on the job
about 3 months till then.

38
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,676
Two previous cases
were open and shut.

39
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:28,258
It was January 3, 1995,
my daughter's birthday.

40
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,555
I remember.

41
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:58,231
Hart and Cohle, State CID.

42
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,272
Who found her?

43
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:01,432
Farmer and his son.

44
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:03,471
This spread wasn't
scheduled for a burn.

45
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,836
Let's keep them here, and
let's tape off this road,

46
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:10,845
and give me your log.

47
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,275
You take the log.

48
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,513
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:18,879
Make sure you get
everything down.

50
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,097
Go ahead.

51
00:05:57,497 --> 00:05:59,263
You ever see
something like this?

52
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:03,769
No, sir, in 8 years of CID.

53
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:07,399
Them symbols, they's Satanic.

54
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,070
They had a "20/20"
on it a few years back.

55
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,506
ID?

56
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,372
No, sir.

57
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:19,679
We're gonna need
more men for a grid search,

58
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,520
set up a perimeter wide as
possible on those 3 roads,

59
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:25,424
post up, take license plates

60
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:28,392
of anything that passes.

61
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:29,527
I-23.

62
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,959
Go ahead,
I-23.

63
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:36,125
We're gonna need investigator
assist on that 419,

64
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,368
all you can spare
for a canvass.

65
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,768
Roger that, Detective.

66
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,474
CID is taking over. Get
anybody who's free up here.

67
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:45,547
Okay. Tell me
what you see.

68
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,820
Ligature marks on her
wrists, ankles, and knees.

69
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:53,115
Multiple shallow
stab wounds to the abdomen.

70
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:55,250
Hemorrhaging around throat,

71
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:59,861
lividity at the shoulders,
thighs, and torso.

72
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:03,764
She'd been on her back a while

73
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:06,066
before he moved her.

74
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:16,108
That's why
they called him The Tax Man.

75
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:19,348
The rest of us had these
little note pads or something.

76
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:22,012
He had this big ledger.

77
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:26,956
Looked funny walking door to
door with it like the tax man,

78
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:31,626
which ain't bad
as far as nicknames go.

79
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,160
Yeah. Of course
I've always taken a lot of notes.

80
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:38,930
I mean, you never know what
the thing's gonna be, do you?

81
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,697
A little detail
somewhere way down the line

82
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,101
makes you say, "Ohh!"
breaks the case.

83
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,470
You know, I've seen
all the different types.

84
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,911
We all fit
a certain category--

85
00:07:52,944 --> 00:08:00,418
the bully, the charmer,
the, uh, surrogate dad,

86
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:04,893
the man possessed
by ungovernable rage,

87
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:06,430
the brain--

88
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:12,236
and any of those types
could be a good detective,

89
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:16,972
and any of those types could be
an incompetent shitheel.

90
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,243
Which type were you?

91
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:24,716
Oh, I was just
a regular type dude

92
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,451
with a big-ass dick.

93
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:32,618
A lot of it had to do
with how they manage authority.

94
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:40,825
There can be a burden
in authority, in vigilance,

95
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:44,833
like a father's burden.

96
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,402
It was too much for some men.

97
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:51,803
A smart guy who's steady
is hard to find.

98
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:54,274
I was all right,
better than some,

99
00:08:54,307 --> 00:09:01,346
but, you know, I knew how to talk
to people, and I was steady.

100
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:05,956
Rust-- now his
Texas files were classified

101
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:10,559
or redacted,
and he wasn't big on talking

102
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,169
except when you wanted
him to shut up,

103
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,842
but he was smart.

104
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:24,213
Yeah. Second week
we were together,

105
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,948
I saw where he was living.

106
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,316
Kind of made me feel
for the guy.

107
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:43,637
I'd offer you a seat,

108
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,342
but, uh...

109
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,246
Don't mention it.
I, uh-- I can't stay.

110
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:55,349
Yeah, I'll tell you guys--

111
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,952
and believe me,
past a certain age,

112
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:02,655
a man without a family
can be a bad thing.

113
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:36,294
We'd
encountered a meta-psychotic,

114
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,995
which I had to
explain to Marty,

115
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:42,468
what meta-psychotic was.

116
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,735
This is gonna happen again,

117
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:54,744
or it's happened before, both.

118
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,847
Go on.

119
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,849
It's fantasy enactment, ritual,

120
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:05,189
fetishization, iconography.

121
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,998
This is his vision.

122
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:10,902
Her body is
a paraphilic love map.

123
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,569
How's that?

124
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,811
An attachment of physical lust

125
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:18,514
to fantasies and practices
forbidden by society.

126
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:23,487
You get that from one
of your books?

127
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,128
I did.

128
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:30,865
Her knees are abraded,
rug burns on her back.

129
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,663
Cold sores, gum line recession,

130
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:33,895
bad teeth.

131
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:36,998
There's decent odds
she was a prost.

132
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,301
He might not have
known her, but...

133
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:46,406
this idea goes
way back with him.

134
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:48,940
You-- you got a chapter
in one of those books

135
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:52,346
on jumping to conclusions?

136
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,051
You attach an assumption
to a piece of evidence,

137
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:59,680
you start to bend the
narrative to support it,

138
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:02,017
prejudice yourself.

139
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,391
Wait and see on the ID.

140
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,558
All right.

141
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:17,301
This kind of thing does
not happen in a vacuum.

142
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:21,038
I guarantee this
wasn't his first.

143
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,701
It's too specific.

144
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:31,951
Uh...

145
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:38,956
listen, uh-- ahem,
this is

146
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:41,158
a...

147
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,724
stupid time to mention this,

148
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:47,061
but...

149
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:50,499
you've got to come to dinner.

150
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:52,163
Can't put Maggie off anymore,

151
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:55,133
so you just got to.

152
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:03,382
All right.

153
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,589
Gordon, thanks for coming.

154
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,092
Marty.

155
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,155
Yeah. So...

156
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:18,493
Anyway, that
evening, wasn't even sundown,

157
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:22,059
he decided it was a good time
to invite me over for dinner,

158
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,026
which I got a problem with,

159
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,731
all right, because I'm
thinking about Marty's wife

160
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:30,468
and this two kids and how
it's my daughter's birthday,

161
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,972
and I know...

162
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,474
there's nothing I can
do about it,

163
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:41,012
maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but...

164
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,717
I'm gonna have a drink.

165
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,957
Let me get up!
Heh, heh!

166
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,451
Daddy!

167
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,723
You're gonna meet him.
I got to get the door.

168
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:55,627
Hey.

169
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,002
Santa Claus is coming!

170
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,535
Aah! Jump!
Ha, ha, ha!

171
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:13,278
People out here,

172
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:19,281
it's like they don't even know
the outside world exists.

173
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:22,152
Might as well be living
on the fucking Moon.

174
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:27,526
There's all kinds
of ghettos in the world.

175
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,094
It's all one ghetto, man,

176
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:34,060
giant gutter in outer space.

177
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:42,008
Today, that scene,

178
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,782
that is the most fucked
up thing I ever caught.

179
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,148
Ask you something?

180
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,990
You're a Christian, yeah?

181
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,559
No.

182
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,060
Well, then what do you got the
cross for in your apartment?

183
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,265
That's a form of meditation.

184
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:06,666
How's that?

185
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:13,470
I contemplate
the moment in the garden,

186
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:18,040
the idea of allowing
your own crucifixion.

187
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,182
But you're not a Christian.

188
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,750
So what do you believe?

189
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,885
I believe that people
shouldn't talk

190
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,852
about this type of shit
at work.

191
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,622
Hold on, hold on.

192
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:35,391
Uh... 3 months
we been together,

193
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,526
I get nothing from you.

194
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,339
Today, what we're into now,

195
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:42,539
do me a courtesy, okay?

196
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,401
I'm not trying to convert you.

197
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,672
Look. I consider myself
a realist, all right,

198
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,209
but in philosophical terms,
I'm what's called a pessimist.

199
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,080
Um, okay.
What's that mean?

200
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:55,649
Means I'm bad at parties.

201
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:58,019
Heh. Let me tell you.

202
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:01,224
You ain't great outside
of parties either.

203
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:09,699
I think human consciousness

204
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:12,204
was a tragic misstep
in evolution.

205
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,742
We became too self-aware.

206
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:18,279
Nature created an aspect of
nature separate from itself.

207
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:22,678
We are creatures that should
not exist by natural law.

208
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:25,549
Huh. That sounds
god-fucking-awful, Rust.

209
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,591
We are things that labor
under the illusion

210
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:30,590
of having a self,

211
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:34,989
this accretion of sensory
experience and feeling,

212
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,334
programmed with total assurance
that we are each somebody

213
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,471
when, in fact,
everybody's nobody.

214
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:45,174
I wouldn't go around spouting
that shit, I was you.

215
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,776
People around here
don't think that way.

216
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,145
I don't think that way.

217
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,479
I think the honorable
thing for species to do

218
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,984
is deny our programming,

219
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:57,186
stop reproducing,

220
00:16:57,219 --> 00:17:00,027
walk hand in hand
into extinction,

221
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,324
one last midnight,
brothers and sisters

222
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:05,498
opting out of a raw deal.

223
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:11,301
So what's the point of getting
out bed in the morning?

224
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:13,309
I tell myself I bear witness,

225
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:17,937
but the real answer is that
it's obviously my programming,

226
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:21,380
and I lack the constitution
for suicide.

227
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:25,581
My luck, I picked today
to get to know you.

228
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:28,457
3 months, I don't hear
a word from you, and--

229
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,760
- You asked.
- Yeah.

230
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:33,326
And now I'm begging you
to shut the fuck up.

231
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:44,298
I get a bad taste
in my mouth out here.

232
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,172
Aluminum, ash,

233
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:51,210
like you can smell
the psychosphere.

234
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,505
I got an idea.

235
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:56,178
Let's make the car a place
of silent reflection

236
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:59,851
from now on, okay?

237
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:06,315
_

238
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:11,823
What should I bring for dinner?

239
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:20,337
A bottle of wine would
be nice, I guess.

240
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,072
I don't drink.

241
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:25,744
Well, no, of course not, Rust.

242
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:27,311
Listen. When you're
at my house,

243
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:29,246
I want you to chill
the fuck out.

244
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,249
Don't even mention any of that
bullshit you just said to me.

245
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:33,712
Of course not, Marty.

246
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:36,517
I'm not some kind
of maniac, all right?

247
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,885
I mean, for fuck's sake.

248
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,070
What'd you hear?

249
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,241
Ask Cohle.

250
00:18:58,274 --> 00:18:59,777
You mean The Tax Man?

251
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,978
You know, he's IA.

252
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:06,783
This is State CID Homicide--
Detective Geraci.

253
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:08,886
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,785
I'm calling to ask
about that night...

255
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:14,160
I mean, you never heard
any shit like this before.

256
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:16,359
She had...

257
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:19,034
antlers. Um...

258
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,268
Fuck.

259
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:22,770
This is-- this is
the real thing,

260
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:26,308
some "Halloween" shit.

261
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,811
Well, we're gonna have to
do a press conference.

262
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,283
What about him?
What do you think?

263
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,426
Smart...

264
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,395
aloof.

265
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:48,933
Doesn't care
about making friends,

266
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:51,166
but he's already
running with it.

267
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:56,941
He's got a real--
real mind for it. Yeah.

268
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:59,144
So you'd keep him on then?

269
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:06,917
Both of us, yeah.
I would.

270
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,049
All right.
You're still lead.

271
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:12,355
The incident room is yours,

272
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:15,386
and, uh, you do
the briefing tomorrow.

273
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,425
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

274
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,265
Hello, sir.

275
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,175
Fuck that prick.

276
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:37,680
Yeah. No. I couldn't
hear you there.

277
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:39,090
Antlers and shit.

278
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,351
That's my point,
I wanted you to see her.

279
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:42,752
Yeah, you don't mark
up a body like that...

280
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,823
She had antlers?
What does that mean?

281
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:49,361
It was a crown.

282
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:52,695
We'll do the briefing
tomorrow, guys, early.

283
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:55,460
My guy does the AP Wire
asked about Satanism.

284
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:58,899
It got Speece here. You're
gonna have his nose up your ass.

285
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,433
Major was saying something
about a press conference.

286
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:04,064
Well, guess I can count
my blessings, fellas.

287
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:05,535
Thanks for that.

288
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,853
Hey. You mind
if I skate? Ahem.

289
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:26,017
I got some names
from Vice, prost farms.

290
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,419
Check around on our DB.

291
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,787
You want me to go with you?

292
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:35,531
Nah. Just something to do.

293
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:39,337
Yeah. You go ahead. I'll
take care of the paperwork.

294
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:44,976
Like I said,
I'm feeling a lot of stuff

295
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,512
hit me at this time--

296
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:51,218
my daughter's birthday,
this dead woman,

297
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,687
and, um...

298
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,552
figured I'd work
the case, you know,

299
00:21:57,593 --> 00:22:02,697
till DiCillo called
or we got an ID.

300
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,329
State Vice gave me
some addresses to follow up on.

301
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,970
So far, nobody'd--
nobody'd talked to me.

302
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,173
Evening, ladies.

303
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:51,533
I was hoping to ask
y'all a few questions.

304
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,396
Oh, come on, man.

305
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:54,699
I'll get the next round.

306
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:57,497
Heh. You making
trouble for us then?

307
00:22:57,538 --> 00:22:59,768
No. I'm just looking to
get some information

308
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,039
on a woman.

309
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:02,303
Might be you know her.

310
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:03,375
Who's that?

311
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:06,743
Hold on.

312
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:10,876
Mmm. We'll take two large
Long Island ice teas, please.

313
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:14,577
Ma'am.

314
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,440
I'm Rust, by the way.

315
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:58,112
I'm Anette, she's Lucy.

316
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,851
Either one of you know a woman

317
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:05,423
about your age,
works the same place,

318
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:09,731
about 5'5", blond like you?

319
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:11,633
What kind of tits she have?

320
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,148
Medium, a little larger
than yours,

321
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,114
proportion to the body natural.

322
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:21,280
Hmm.

323
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:23,112
Gee. I don't know. We
see a lot of girls

324
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:25,879
like that around.

325
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:27,553
Any girls like that

326
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:31,248
you haven't seen around
lately, missing like?

327
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:34,449
People come and go.

328
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:38,013
What do you want them for?

329
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:41,654
I wouldn't bust
somebody for hooking

330
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:43,325
or drugs.

331
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,690
I'm murder police.

332
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:51,795
Somebody got killed.

333
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:53,163
There's a girl named Liza,

334
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:54,427
another called Destiny,

335
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:57,501
but I seen Destiny
yesterday at McDonald's.

336
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:58,870
What about Liza?

337
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:00,007
She's here.

338
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,425
Anette, go get
a couple more drinks

339
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,550
from the bar, will you, please?

340
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:18,855
All right.

341
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:27,158
You get pills pretty easy?

342
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,628
Relax. I want some.

343
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,730
Speed?

344
00:25:36,763 --> 00:25:40,263
No. Quaaludes,
anything-barbital.

345
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:41,536
Uppers are easier to get,

346
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,400
and they last longer, too.

347
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:46,167
Yeah, but it's not like that.

348
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,670
What's it like?

349
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:51,310
I don't sleep.

350
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:26,611
Hey.

351
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:27,875
Oh.

352
00:26:27,908 --> 00:26:29,347
Hey, Lone Ranger.

353
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,485
Hey. Ugh. Dreaming.

354
00:26:34,518 --> 00:26:37,085
Why you out here, huh?

355
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:39,759
Why didn't you come to bed?

356
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,223
Um...

357
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:51,272
Caught a... bad one
yesterday.

358
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,041
Just couldn't sleep.

359
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:55,145
You got that woman from Erath?

360
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,113
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

361
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:58,576
Saw it on the news.

362
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:04,322
Girls will be up soon.

363
00:27:06,786 --> 00:27:09,458
Missed you the last
couple days.

364
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:13,626
Oh, shit.
I got to shower.

365
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,666
Got a debriefing today

366
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:18,232
and maybe
a press conference later.

367
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:25,469
And if Speece calls,

368
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:27,374
tell him I'm debriefing
the squad all morning.

369
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:28,639
Well, Marty said
he was doing that.

370
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:30,078
He is.

371
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,142
Hey, beautiful.

372
00:27:31,175 --> 00:27:33,681
Morning, baby.

373
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:35,384
Marty, how you want
your coffee, doll?

374
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,585
Strong and black just like you.

375
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:40,858
Prints came back.
Dora Kelly Lange.

376
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:44,660
Priors for shoplifting,
possession, and...

377
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:46,397
solicitation.

378
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,195
Address outside
of St. Martinville.

379
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:50,569
Landlord says she hasn't lived
there in almost a year.

380
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,864
She's got an ex Charlie Lange,

381
00:27:51,897 --> 00:27:54,167
who's doing 8 in Avoyelles
for bad checks,

382
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,870
mom's outside of Breaux Bridge,

383
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:58,037
DMV license expired,

384
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,868
and DiCillo called.

385
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:04,674
She was washed clean,

386
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:06,471
not a print on her.

387
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:09,909
We got ligature marks
on the wrists and ankles,

388
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,372
was bound
by a half-inch rope,

389
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,475
maybe 10, 20 hours.

390
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:16,275
Evidence
of vaginal intercourse.

391
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,947
Bound upright,

392
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,547
hadn't eaten in a
day, maybe more.

393
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,723
Toxicology hit for lysergic
acid and methamphetamine.

394
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:27,620
That's crystal and LSD.

395
00:28:27,653 --> 00:28:29,629
How much LSD?

396
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:31,061
Hard to say.

397
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:33,965
Got to wait for a mass spec.

398
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:37,933
So she was drugged, bound,

399
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,670
tortured with a knife,

400
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:45,247
strangled, posed out there.

401
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,480
Yeah.

402
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:51,615
What about this stuff?

403
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,783
Well, the crown, for
lack of a better word,

404
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:59,651
rose thorns, early
cane, switchgrass

405
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:02,490
wrapped around a bent branch,

406
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:05,992
and the horns are deer antlers.

407
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:08,556
Again, no prints on anything.

408
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:11,092
Symbols are painted
with acrylic basic blue

409
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,796
using a thick glove finger.

410
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,799
Ideas what any of this means?

411
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,103
I don't know.

412
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:20,604
And it's all primitive.
It's like cave paintings.

413
00:29:20,637 --> 00:29:23,070
Maybe you ought to talk
to an anthropologist.

414
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,023
Lot of trouble
this guy went to.

415
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:42,525
Seems real personal.

416
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,030
I don't think so.

417
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:48,504
Was iconic, planned...

418
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,040
and in some ways,
it was impersonal.

419
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:53,673
Think of the blindfold.

420
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,016
This place is
like somebody's memory

421
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,952
of the town,
and the memory's fading.

422
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:05,521
It's like there was never
anything here but jungle.

423
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:10,689
Stop saying shit like that.
It's unprofessional.

424
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:13,424
Oh, is that what
I'm going for here?

425
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:16,429
I just want you to stop
saying odd shit,

426
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,428
like you smell a psycho's fear

427
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:20,934
or you're in someone's
faded memory of a town.

428
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:21,936
Just stop.

429
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:23,936
Well, given how long
it's taken for me

430
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:25,935
to reconcile my nature,
I can't figure

431
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:28,406
I'd forgo it
on your account, Marty.

432
00:30:40,454 --> 00:30:42,054
Ahem.

433
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,421
You get any sleep last night?

434
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:49,431
I don't sleep.

435
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:51,568
I just dream.

436
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:55,371
Occult.

437
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:58,373
Now, I don't know if this shit
is anything but crazy,

438
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:00,381
but Speece
and the Superintendent,

439
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:03,782
they're paying attention,
the newspapers are making hay,

440
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:05,783
church groups.

441
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,789
Detective?

442
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,758
Ahem.

443
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,760
All right, here's
what we got so far.

444
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:15,231
Deceased's name is
Dora Kelly Lange, 28...

445
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:17,968
You stay busy now, the business?

446
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,429
Well, yeah,
I got the security firm,

447
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,966
PI stuff. Routine.

448
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,441
Lotta guys leave the job,

449
00:31:25,474 --> 00:31:28,113
cemetery within 10.

450
00:31:28,146 --> 00:31:31,080
No family, idle hands.

451
00:31:31,113 --> 00:31:35,119
Some advice, you make it out,
you stay busy.

452
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:37,086
Hit the corners.

453
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,582
Ask about anybody
she was seeing...

454
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:42,728
regular customers,
meth dealers,

455
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:45,222
and rough johns, anything.

456
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:47,863
Any questions?

457
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:16,821
You believe in ghosts?

458
00:32:19,694 --> 00:32:23,295
What'd we say about
silent reflection?

459
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:35,309
You happen to hear
anything out of the ordinary

460
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:38,581
between 10 and 1 AM, out back?

461
00:32:38,614 --> 00:32:41,517
No, no, but, uh,

462
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,085
sometimes they, uh,
dove-hunt out there.

463
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:46,588
They found a woman?

464
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:49,723
Is it the Fontenot girl?

465
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,154
Who?

466
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,924
- And why would you ask that?
- Don't know.

467
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:56,460
Went missing
around here years back.

468
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,565
Last time something happened.

469
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,564
Just thought maybe it's her.

470
00:33:00,597 --> 00:33:02,563
How old was she, this girl?

471
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,740
I don't know.
Little.

472
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,076
You know where
the family lives?

473
00:33:18,652 --> 00:33:22,249
Had a place
couple streets down.

474
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:26,628
They moved out, though.

475
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:29,194
Do you know the Fontenot
girl, one went missing?

476
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:31,160
Her?

477
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:33,663
Her family come to our service

478
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,167
once or twice,
5 or 6 years back.

479
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,031
Is that the girl?
Oh, Lord.

480
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:41,601
No, sir, it's not.

481
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:44,073
Excuse me.

482
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,946
I want to ask y'all
something. Y'all think

483
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:49,177
maybe this have something
to do with those cats?

484
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,650
What cats?

485
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:52,651
Two of 'em-- one,
and a couple

486
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:54,156
of weeks later, another.

487
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:55,653
Somebody cut 'em up,

488
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:57,661
turned their insides out,
then nailed them

489
00:33:57,694 --> 00:33:59,360
to the front door, twice.

490
00:33:59,393 --> 00:34:01,799
Now, I called
and told the police,

491
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,831
but we're predominantly African
American congregation.

492
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:07,602
I asked for it
to be investigated.

493
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:11,212
We're not those type
of police, sir.

494
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:14,116
Well, who is, then?

495
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,617
Can I ask you something?

496
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:26,289
Any of these look
familiar to you?

497
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:28,287
- Seen them anywheres?
- No.

498
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,292
No, they look like
something that might be

499
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:32,292
carved into a tree
or something.

500
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:34,365
Mm-hmm.
How about these?

501
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,364
Now, that look like
something my old auntie

502
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:39,531
taught us how to make
when I was a tyke.

503
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:41,698
What are they?

504
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:44,203
Some folks call them
bird traps.

505
00:34:44,236 --> 00:34:47,003
Old Auntie told us that
they were devil nets.

506
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:50,339
You put them around the bed, catch
the devil before he get too close.

507
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,306
That's interesting.

508
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:54,744
- Hmm.
- She was a wonderful woman.

509
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:57,814
Loved her some Jesus,
but had a bit

510
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,811
of that Santeria
in her, you know?

511
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:02,809
I always just thought
it was something

512
00:35:02,842 --> 00:35:05,051
for children to do,
keep 'em busy,

513
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:09,520
tell them stories why
they're tying sticks together.

514
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,292
Then that's all
we got on the Fontenot girl.

515
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:14,292
There was nothing in there.

516
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:16,828
Says, "Possible
report made in error."

517
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,230
Now, that was 5 years ago.

518
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:20,198
Ted Childress was
sheriff back then.

519
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,699
He's set up in Gulf Shores
now, I think.

520
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:25,169
Ten-year-old girl goes missing
and that doesn't go state-wide?

521
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:27,170
Now, hold on now.
My understanding,

522
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:29,173
the little girl went off
with her birth daddy.

523
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:31,212
Now, did you check
her mom's record?

524
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,644
Possession, solicitation.

525
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:36,284
I believe Ted knew the family,
and the feeling was

526
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:38,284
the little girl was
better off with her daddy.

527
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:41,083
Mom seemed to agree;
she filed a complaint,

528
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:43,089
then never bothered
with it again,

529
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:44,921
took off with her boyfriend.

530
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:47,423
R&I said you had
a complaint these parts

531
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:49,424
around December--
little girl

532
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,424
getting chased
through the woods.

533
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:54,598
Oh, yeah, I pulled
that one for you, too.

534
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,305
What the hell is this?

535
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:06,808
Little girl said
a green-eared spaghetti monster

536
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:09,313
chased her through some woods.

537
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:12,185
Now, we had her work
with a sketch artist,

538
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,283
and she told us
that looked exactly right.

539
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:18,460
Now, you want to call an APB
on that, you go right ahead.

540
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,460
Listen, boys.

541
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:22,595
I'm gonna have to call
a timeout, make a beer run.

542
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:25,796
Well, why don't you hold
off on that for a while?

543
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:30,639
All right, well,
why don't you get it, then?

544
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:33,141
We really don't want
to do that.

545
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:36,642
Well, is this supposed
to be admissible? Huh?

546
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:40,641
If you want to pick
my brain, work a room,

547
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:43,816
you buy me a cheeseburger
and a Coke, don't you?

548
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:47,682
I'll take a sixer
of Old Milwaukee

549
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:49,722
or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

550
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,089
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

551
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:55,655
'Cause it's Thursday
and it's past noon.

552
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:58,158
Thursday is one of my days off.

553
00:36:58,192 --> 00:37:01,666
On my off days, I start
drinking at noon.

554
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:05,338
You don't get to
interrupt that.

555
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:21,227
Ahem.

556
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:24,596
I'd appreciate a little
hustle up on that.

557
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,573
Yesterday,

558
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:30,742
at approximately 6 AM,

559
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:34,247
civilians came across
the body of a female

560
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,748
in a sugar cane field
outside of Erath.

561
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:40,548
Now, this person,
we believe, was murdered,

562
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:43,249
and we are not yet in
a position to

563
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:46,251
release the identity
of the victim or to offer

564
00:37:46,284 --> 00:37:48,459
details of the crime.

565
00:37:48,492 --> 00:37:51,396
Our investigators

566
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:53,893
have several leads,
and hopefully we'll--

567
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:57,332
we'll have a suspect
for you in custody soon.

568
00:37:57,365 --> 00:37:59,836
Now, this perpetrator

569
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:02,341
will be apprehended,
and he will know

570
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:05,341
swift Louisiana justice.

571
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:07,373
- Charlie?
- Mm-hmm?

572
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:09,980
Let's talk about
your ex, Dora Lange.

573
00:38:10,013 --> 00:38:12,441
You want to talk Dori?

574
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:14,850
What's she said I've done now?

575
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:17,355
Nothing. We're just
curious if you knew

576
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:19,891
what she's been up to and
maybe where she's living.

577
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,491
Nope.

578
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:23,492
Got her divorce papers
pushed through

579
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,492
after I been here about a year.

580
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:28,026
I don't blame the bitch.

581
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,994
She got a habit?

582
00:38:30,027 --> 00:38:32,500
Yeah, a few.

583
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,970
Weed, meth, juice.

584
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:36,676
Name it.

585
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:38,371
Charlie,

586
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:39,842
how'd y'all meet?

587
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,545
Growed up together,
dropped out the same time.

588
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:45,180
Hitched up way too quick.

589
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:48,514
You know how it is-- you want
a wife, but only half the time.

590
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:49,986
Hmm.

591
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:52,493
Why are you saying
you hadn't heard from her?

592
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:55,727
She called up here
for you not too long ago.

593
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,800
She couldn't help me
anyway, man.

594
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,737
She sounded all fucked up.

595
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,738
You see, that's exactly
the kind of thing

596
00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:03,769
that we do want to know
about, though, Charlie.

597
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,335
Oh. All right.

598
00:39:05,368 --> 00:39:08,409
Uh... I needed
some scratch for my store,

599
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:11,542
and Dori owes me money,
she ain't got no fuckin' phone,

600
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:14,183
so got a number to
her friend Carla, got her

601
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:17,186
to call me back, and she ain't
made no fuckin' sense.

602
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,986
Ahem. Carla's full
name and phone number.

603
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,922
What you mean,
she didn't make sense?

604
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:27,025
Like she could duck-hunt
with a rake.

605
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:29,463
High, yeah.

606
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:32,798
Talkin' 'bout
she's gonna become a nun.

607
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:36,072
- Why a nun?
- I don't know, man. She was high.

608
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:38,038
Fucked up, uh,

609
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:41,407
talkin' 'bout...
she met a king.

610
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,910
Shit.

611
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:45,615
Anyway...

612
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:47,785
I don't need no
snitch jacket up in here.

613
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,323
Give me a break.

614
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:52,822
This is Avoyelles.

615
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:55,360
It's a goddamn day camp.

616
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,098
Spend some time in Angola.

617
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:01,029
Surprised you even got
Aryan Nation here.

618
00:40:02,604 --> 00:40:05,205
What'd Dori do?

619
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:10,575
Dori's dead.

620
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:14,446
Thank you, boys.

621
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,116
We almost had a moment there.

622
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,995
Mmm.

623
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:33,396
So you want to talk the whole
case through or just the end?

624
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,332
No, whole story

625
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:36,731
from your end, you don't mind.

626
00:40:36,772 --> 00:40:39,003
You know, like he said,
files got ruined.

627
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,636
Hurricane Rita.

628
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:47,977
What he didn't say is that this
is about something else.

629
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,481
Something new. That one
in Lake Charles, maybe?

630
00:40:52,514 --> 00:40:54,153
Now, why you say that?

631
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:56,690
Get the details
out of the paper.

632
00:40:56,723 --> 00:40:58,661
Yeah, we did.

633
00:40:58,694 --> 00:41:01,523
You know anything about that,
about Lake Charles?

634
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:04,092
Well, let me see

635
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:06,799
what you got, jog my memory.

636
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,767
Well, let's hear
your story first,

637
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:11,941
see how it fit
with what we got.

638
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:16,109
Well, your dime, boss.

639
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,541
Talking Cohle,
what about that dinner

640
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:21,075
you mentioned,
he turn up drunk?

641
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:23,082
Oh. Yeah.

642
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,544
Well, ahem.

643
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:27,984
That dinner,
that was a bit later.

644
00:41:28,017 --> 00:41:30,585
It was kind of funny.

645
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,089
The flowers, you know?

646
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:36,055
Like, he read somewhere that
if you get invited to dinner,

647
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:38,559
you're supposed
to bring flowers?

648
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:40,593
The hell?

649
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,130
You can barely stand up.

650
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:45,095
What is it?

651
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,537
You don't drink
with me or the boys,

652
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,369
and you got to get a load on

653
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,209
before you visit my family?

654
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,776
No, Marty, it's not like that.

655
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,311
And I didn't mean to,

656
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:58,447
all right?

657
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:02,286
And I don't drink
'cause I've had trouble

658
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,453
with it before;
I didn't mean to.

659
00:42:07,855 --> 00:42:10,297
I was checking on a CI.

660
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,465
I ended up hanging
around a bar.

661
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,801
I was sitting there.

662
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,967
I couldn't think
of a good reason not to.

663
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:24,100
Usually I can.

664
00:42:29,143 --> 00:42:31,510
Don't worry about it.

665
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:33,511
Have some more coffee

666
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:36,551
and just try to make 10
minutes of conversation.

667
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:38,288
You got it.

668
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:41,055
I'll call Chris or somebody,

669
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:43,190
get you out of here.

670
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,695
Marty.

671
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:52,459
I'm sorry, man.

672
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,933
Forget it.

673
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:58,102
We'll try this some other time.

674
00:43:08,518 --> 00:43:12,483
Well, uh, Rust, it is
so nice to finally meet you.

675
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:14,985
Sorry it took so long.

676
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:17,984
Well, I tried to tell her
you aren't big on socializing.

677
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:19,486
I said that your life's

678
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,453
in this man's hands, right?

679
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:23,925
Of course you should
meet the family.

680
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:27,927
Well, not quite
as dramatic as that, hon.

681
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,496
I've never fired my gun.

682
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:32,537
Have you fired your gun?

683
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,833
Audrey.

684
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:39,143
Yes.

685
00:43:39,176 --> 00:43:41,007
You shot people?

686
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,345
Macie.

687
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:43,849
Ahem.

688
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:46,351
Dad's never shot anybody.

689
00:43:46,384 --> 00:43:49,485
Well, that's good.

690
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:51,382
You don't want to shoot people.

691
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:53,150
But you have.

692
00:43:54,823 --> 00:43:57,294
Marty says you're from Texas.

693
00:43:57,327 --> 00:43:59,793
Yes, south Texas.

694
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:03,267
I grew up in Alaska.

695
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,033
Just been working here
the last 10, 12 years.

696
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:08,041
What kind of work?

697
00:44:08,074 --> 00:44:10,842
Narcotics, mostly.

698
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,810
Um...

699
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:16,350
was on the Robbery Squad
in Houston until '89.

700
00:44:16,383 --> 00:44:20,190
Ahem. Oh. Be right back.

701
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:22,326
Y'all keep eating.

702
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:29,333
Do you like your job?

703
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:34,404
Not exactly,

704
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:36,605
but it's worthwhile.

705
00:44:36,638 --> 00:44:38,604
I'm good at it.

706
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:40,739
You're not married?

707
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,076
Once.

708
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:46,582
- Uh, not anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

709
00:44:46,615 --> 00:44:50,021
Did you do this
while you were married?

710
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,989
Hey, Chris.

711
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,988
Hey, thanks for the page.

712
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:58,024
Yeah, well,
he'll appreciate it.

713
00:44:58,057 --> 00:45:00,518
Well-- all right,

714
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,254
then I appreciate it.

715
00:45:09,764 --> 00:45:11,699
Children?

716
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:14,197
One.

717
00:45:14,238 --> 00:45:16,672
She passed.

718
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:20,348
Marriage didn't last
long after that.

719
00:45:22,254 --> 00:45:24,351
Sorry.

720
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,793
Ahem. Chris Demma's
on the phone for you.

721
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,991
Something about a CI or...

722
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:34,465
Back there to the left.

723
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,466
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

724
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:42,809
Ahem.

725
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:50,143
What was that?

726
00:45:50,184 --> 00:45:52,185
What were y'all talking about?

727
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:54,154
Your job.

728
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:56,921
What do you know
about him, Marty?

729
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:02,269
Um, not a lot.

730
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:04,764
He could be a good detective.

731
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:08,303
He's running on this
thing, but, uh...

732
00:46:08,344 --> 00:46:09,807
uppity.

733
00:46:11,345 --> 00:46:13,282
What?

734
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:17,253
Jeez. Have you ever
asked him about himself?

735
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:20,594
Baby, trust me.

736
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:23,772
You do not want to pick
this man's brain.

737
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,607
What was that?

738
00:46:29,648 --> 00:46:33,279
Oh, some details
on the CI. Ahem.

739
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:39,225
Thank you for dinner, Maggie.

740
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:42,058
- This looks great.
- My pleasure.

741
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,056
I don't like that broccoli.

742
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:45,591
Mind your manners.

743
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:48,662
So you, uh, need to go or what?

744
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,997
No, it's nothing can't
wait till tomorrow.

745
00:46:54,364 --> 00:46:58,635
Rust, uh, what
you were saying before?

746
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:04,708
Oh, we can find something
nicer to talk about.

747
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:08,182
Marty, I saw
your table in there.

748
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:10,014
You fly-fish?

749
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:12,153
Little bit.

750
00:47:13,592 --> 00:47:17,623
So you
and Cohle went bad in '02, huh?

751
00:47:17,664 --> 00:47:19,926
Heard about that.

752
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:23,265
Yeah, well... what happened
between me and him

753
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,273
don't have nothing to do
with Dora Lange.

754
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:31,642
I worked with Rust Cohle
for 7 years.

755
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:33,642
People change.

756
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:36,914
Relationships change.

757
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:39,420
You stay in touch?

758
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:41,891
No.

759
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:45,923
No, I haven't talked
to Rust in...

760
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:48,431
10 years.

761
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,632
Yeah.

762
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:55,544
Look, however we...

763
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:58,541
he was a good detective,

764
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:02,543
and it don't matter how
he ended it. I mean...

765
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:06,586
I can say that
because it's the truth,

766
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,258
and I don't hold grudges.

767
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:11,926
I believe that's the shit

768
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:14,735
that leads to cancer.

769
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:21,573
But why am I talking
about dinner?

770
00:48:21,606 --> 00:48:26,248
Y'all want to walk through
the Lange case, fine.

771
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:31,924
This other stuff--
well, what's going on?

772
00:48:31,957 --> 00:48:34,826
Sorry. We just heard
some stories.

773
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,858
Well, personally,
I heard he was

774
00:48:36,891 --> 00:48:39,061
an ace case man, right?

775
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:42,236
I'd like to understand
his process.

776
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:46,833
"His process."

777
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:48,474
Sure.

778
00:48:49,908 --> 00:48:51,980
The other landlord
says she trashed the place,

779
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,979
so she lost her deposit.

780
00:48:54,012 --> 00:48:55,979
And the neighbors check out.

781
00:48:56,012 --> 00:48:58,485
Those that remember her
said that she, uh,

782
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,990
used to come in early
in the morning,

783
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:03,991
if she came home at all.

784
00:49:06,024 --> 00:49:09,168
You guys canvass the bars
pretty good today?

785
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:14,137
You know, up your ass, Cohle.

786
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,170
Why don't you do your
own fuckin' leg work,

787
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,305
you rat fuck?

788
00:49:22,883 --> 00:49:24,546
Say it again, rummy.

789
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:26,554
Hey.

790
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:32,061
You know what, man?

791
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:34,227
Fuck you,

792
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,363
Tax Man.

793
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:41,837
What the fuck?

794
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,544
Ahem.
Back to point.

795
00:49:44,576 --> 00:49:46,544
Got 3 hits on working girls.

796
00:49:46,577 --> 00:49:49,048
No one close to her, naturally.

797
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:52,414
A few names recognized
her as occasional.

798
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,415
Like she tricked
now and then, show up

799
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:57,225
at a couple of truck stops
when she needed cash.

800
00:49:57,258 --> 00:49:59,289
You got some names.
Which ones?

801
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:02,793
I heard from my AP guy,
Ray Fontenot.

802
00:50:02,826 --> 00:50:05,330
Said her uncle's
Danny Fontenot--

803
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:06,866
the pitcher, LSU.

804
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:09,834
Yeah, I watched him
play. Great player.

805
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:12,403
- Well, he lives close by.
- Ahem.

806
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:14,539
Well, thanks, guys.

807
00:50:14,572 --> 00:50:17,042
What about you two?
Did you get anything today?

808
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:20,079
- Not much, sir.
- Well...

809
00:50:20,112 --> 00:50:22,911
You might know
the Reverend Tuttle.

810
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:25,079
He runs our state-wide
charity drive.

811
00:50:25,112 --> 00:50:27,088
This is Detective Hart,
Detective Cohle.

812
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:28,583
Pleasure to meet you, Officers.

813
00:50:28,616 --> 00:50:30,086
Nice to meet you.
Cohle.

814
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,086
Your case has a lot
of people taking care,

815
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,126
doors locking where
they used to not.

816
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,092
Eddie's been speaking
to me about it.

817
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,794
Concerned, very concerned.

818
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:42,566
We've been discussing
the viability of a task force

819
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,071
to investigate crimes with
an anti-Christian connotation.

820
00:50:45,104 --> 00:50:47,905
You what?
Really?

821
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:51,914
Yes.

822
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:58,221
I don't mean to tell men
of your positions,

823
00:50:58,254 --> 00:51:01,925
but there is a war
happening behind things.

824
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,858
Thank you for doing your part.

825
00:51:05,891 --> 00:51:08,098
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

826
00:51:08,995 --> 00:51:11,432
Well...

827
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:14,433
Eddie's going to be
very, very pleased

828
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:17,602
to have such good men
working on this.

829
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:22,579
Are you kidding me?

830
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,083
Un-fuckin'-believable.

831
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,549
"Anti-Christian."

832
00:51:27,582 --> 00:51:30,917
Fucks. And who
the fuck's Eddie?

833
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,221
Huh?

834
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:35,064
Is he serious?

835
00:51:35,097 --> 00:51:37,032
Well, he doesn't
have a television.

836
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:38,999
- Who's Eddie?
- And he's from Texas.

837
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:40,965
He's the fuckin'
governor--

838
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,966
- Edwin Tuttle.
- Ah.

839
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,009
They're first cousins.

840
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:46,474
Well, that makes sense.

841
00:51:46,507 --> 00:51:48,473
Yeah, that's the
sound of The Big Machine,

842
00:51:48,514 --> 00:51:50,840
Cohle, that's gearing up
to pound your ass.

843
00:51:50,881 --> 00:51:52,080
Heh!

844
00:51:52,113 --> 00:51:54,249
The sound of a gaggle of hens.

845
00:51:54,282 --> 00:51:56,249
Yeah, you better
watch your mouth

846
00:51:56,282 --> 00:51:58,554
or they're gonna
peck your eyes out.

847
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,551
- Hi.
- Hi.

848
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:03,719
I am looking for
Detective Hart.

849
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,929
I have a stack of
depositions for him.

850
00:52:05,962 --> 00:52:07,424
Judge Sutpen told me to
make sure and give them

851
00:52:07,465 --> 00:52:09,429
to Detective Hart
and no one else, so...

852
00:52:09,462 --> 00:52:11,229
- Oh.
- Is that the, um--

853
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,695
The, uh, depositions.

854
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:14,672
I thought I should
walk you through them.

855
00:52:14,705 --> 00:52:17,937
Oh. Great, great. Let's
just find a place to talk.

856
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,443
Thanks, Cathleen.

857
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:20,948
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

858
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:22,913
Right through here.

859
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:52,543
Your victim was Dora Lange,

860
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:55,080
but you all checked
on Marie Fontenot.

861
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:56,551
Why?

862
00:52:56,584 --> 00:52:58,552
Missing girl, 5 years gone,

863
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:00,058
report made in error?

864
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:03,594
She had an uncle
who lived nearby...

865
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:06,066
and call it intuition.

866
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:11,065
Sometimes he's more responsive.

867
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:13,303
I'd like to help.

868
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:21,279
Mr. Fontenot all the way.

869
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:26,648
Uh, ahem.

870
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:29,723
We met,

871
00:53:29,756 --> 00:53:32,291
oh, maybe 7 years ago.

872
00:53:32,324 --> 00:53:34,797
I was visiting Skip Hays.

873
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,301
I'd played for USL.

874
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:40,667
Thing of beauty, sir,
watching you throw.

875
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,170
Hmm.

876
00:53:42,203 --> 00:53:44,802
Danny, this man's a detective

877
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:46,771
with the police.

878
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:53,482
Uh...

879
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:56,977
I'm actually--
Ahem. Sorry, uh,

880
00:53:57,018 --> 00:54:00,252
we wanted to ask you
about your niece, Marie.

881
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:01,725
Hmm.

882
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:05,157
"How much could You put on
one family?" I ask the Lord.

883
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:08,027
We try to get by.

884
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,562
Did you know Marie's
birth father?

885
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:12,033
Len?

886
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:14,161
Len Stroghes was her daddy.

887
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:15,201
Hmm.

888
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:16,866
It's okay.

889
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:19,375
We're asking because, uh,

890
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:21,878
we had heard that Marie
ran off with him

891
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:25,245
and that... she wasn't
really missing.

892
00:54:27,784 --> 00:54:30,223
That's what Debbie said.

893
00:54:30,256 --> 00:54:34,225
Oh. Well, uh...
anybody heard from Len?

894
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:37,866
Anybody maybe knows
where he's at?

895
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,201
Uh, sorry.
The last thing.

896
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:46,367
Do you know
where Debbie is now?

897
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,374
She married another man.

898
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:51,878
Not the one she's
with when Marie...

899
00:54:51,911 --> 00:54:55,043
She was in Vegas,
last we heard.

900
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:20,070
Marie must have loved it here.

901
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:21,404
Yeah.

902
00:55:21,437 --> 00:55:23,373
All this for her?

903
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,374
Danny loved her so much.

904
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:27,373
We weren't her legal guardians,

905
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:29,907
but she played here
all the time,

906
00:55:29,948 --> 00:55:31,443
more than her Mama's.

907
00:55:31,476 --> 00:55:33,947
I can see why.

908
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,992
What is it Dan has,
if you don't mind my asking?

909
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:41,993
All they ever told us was
"a cerebral event."

910
00:55:42,026 --> 00:55:44,631
Series of strokes, like.

911
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:54,505
Marty?

912
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,450
Excuse me for one sec.

913
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:12,522
Inside on the floor
on the right.

914
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:33,373
I don't know what that is.

915
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:36,478
I haven't looked in there
since the police first came.

916
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,162
Bet you want
to hear the hero shot, huh?

917
00:56:48,467 --> 00:56:51,532
That place we carried
the kids out?

918
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:53,668
Eventually, sure.

919
00:56:55,973 --> 00:56:59,108
So what did she look like...

920
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:01,812
that one in Lake Charles?

921
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:28,751
Can you, uh, tell us

922
00:57:28,784 --> 00:57:30,984
anything about that,
Mr. Cohle?

923
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:37,565
That looks a lot
like the one from '95,

924
00:57:37,598 --> 00:57:40,705
but... well,
you knew that already.

925
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:45,039
Yeah, there are specifics
consistent to the '95 case,

926
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,544
details that weren't
public knowledge.

927
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:51,553
You were off the grid
for 8 years, right?

928
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:54,553
- Show back up here 2010.
- My question is--

929
00:57:54,586 --> 00:57:58,559
How could it be him...

930
00:57:58,593 --> 00:58:02,222
if we already
caught him in '95?

931
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:07,694
How indeed, Detectives?

932
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:11,238
I figured you'd be
the one to know.

933
00:58:19,107 --> 00:58:23,074
Then start asking
the right fuckin' questions.

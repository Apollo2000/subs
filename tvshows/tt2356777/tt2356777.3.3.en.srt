00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,969
It's just like the paperwork says.
Read the report.

3
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,973
Our feeling is that the prosecution
didn't make a full accounting

4
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,100
or mount a suitable case.

5
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,520
So we have to do that now,
get the full accounting.

6
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,568
WEST, Roland,
Lieutenant, Arkansas State Police

7
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,570
Deposition date: 5/17/1990

8
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,538
Round the end of the first week,
family got the note.

9
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,503
Envelope's handwritten,
so this isn't a brainiac.

10
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,924
Processing stamp's from
a post office in Farmington.

11
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,593
Could've been dropped in any mailbox.

12
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,429
We're putting men out there to canvass.

13
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,307
You see this?

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,309
$10,000 reward from
The Ozark Children's Outreach Center.

15
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,437
Twiggs said they been fielding
calls from Martians all day.

16
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,439
What's The Ozark Children's Outreach?

17
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,565
Some charity.

18
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,112
You think it's true, the girl's alive?

19
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,241
I think she is.

20
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,786
And what were you focusing on prior?

21
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,250
Neighborhood surveillance.
Like it says in the report.

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,793
Right, yeah...

23
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,254
All day...

24
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,050
But you guys didn't get to the house
till after everybody else.

25
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,053
You'd got there first if you were
in the neighborhood, wouldn't you?

26
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,931
Well, we mighta taken
the call late, or...

27
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,934
I'm a little fuzzy.

28
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,855
Wayne probably has a better memory.

29
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,859
The picture doesn't show anything new.

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,571
Nothing that suggests the black-out.
That's good.

31
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,032
Since your CT scan looks clean,
I think the concern right now

32
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,618
is the need to adjust your lifestyle
to what's happening.

33
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,995
I wasn't...

34
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,873
He explained it wrong.

35
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,545
I didn't drive in my sleep,
or any kind of state.

36
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,547
I mean...

37
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,758
...at the time...

38
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,220
I believe I did know what I was doing.

39
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,806
It's only I forgot later.

40
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,310
We're just going to have to do some
things differently. Okay, dad?

41
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,813
I went out there for a reason.
I just can't remember.

42
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,982
That's not like I'm losing it...

43
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,277
Do you remember the rest
of dinner at my place?

44
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,114
- Remember me driving you home?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,241
Heather drove you home.

46
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,369
Oh, we're playing "gotcha".

47
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,373
Mr. Hays, your son loves you,
Our only concern is your well-being.

48
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:13,170
I know my son loves me, doctor.
But thanks for walking me through that.

49
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,758
The place you found yourself.

50
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,720
Do you know why you might
have wanted to go there?

51
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,681
Does it have any significance?

52
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,476
Yeah. It did.

53
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,978
He did a couple
interviews for this show,

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,939
been talking about an
old case, took place out there.

55
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,609
- What're you, ratting on me?
- What're you, working a case?

56
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,487
It was never fully solved.

57
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,532
People don't remember being babies.

58
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,785
It's good we get to revisit
that stage at the end.

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,745
Mr. Hays, believe me...

60
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,331
I can understand
your frustration with the disease.

61
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,959
A disease you can't
even say what it is.

62
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,878
We can say what it almost certainly is.

63
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,556
I told you.

64
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,893
You try putting me in a home,
I'll off myself.

65
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,773
Put it outta your head.

66
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,950
Don't you wanna know?

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,120
You do.

68
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,500
And she needs help, doesn't she?

69
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,794
Julie...

70
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,381
Yeah.

71
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,636
You know, it was just a case,
when I caught it.

72
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,932
I didn't know it'd be my last.

73
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,730
You with the book these last years...

74
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,568
I feel like...

75
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,739
...tired of this thing.
Being in our lives.

76
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,410
Like when we met...

77
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:14,541
I mean, it's Saturday night.
Your mom's got the kids.

78
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,505
And there's this thing
sitting between us.

79
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,136
So what do you want to do?

80
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,390
I don't know.

81
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,020
There was a motel back there.

82
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,650
We could just drink
and have sex all night.

83
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,198
Boy, that'd be great.

84
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,664
Alan said so far they
have her prints on a counter

85
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,041
and some shelves in the main area.

86
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,461
Were there any behind the pharmacy?

87
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,047
He didn't know. Sallisaw PD's got it.

88
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,299
Shouldn't you talk to them?

89
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,970
May come back on me.

90
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,099
It's not like if they check,
somebody's gonna have my back.

91
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,647
What if I talked to them?

92
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,774
Sallisaw.

93
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,320
An author with a book about the case.

94
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,365
I have galleys, I'm legitimate.

95
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,868
- I bet I can get 'em to share with me.
- I doubt it.

96
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,704
No, no... I'll get done up.

97
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,957
Bookish but sexy,

98
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,169
intimidated by those big tough cops.

99
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,714
This is like Afro... "Hart to Hart",
that it?

100
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,340
Come on!

101
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,267
You wanna use the payphone,
we're here, check on the kids?

102
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,770
Why don't I call from the motel?

103
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,543
We need to walk it back.

104
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,880
Re-examine it all.

105
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,218
It's like a thing
is staring right at us.

106
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,054
Got that feeling myself.

107
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,526
The Purcells said they were gonna play
with their neighbor, the Boyle kid.

108
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,902
Yeah.

109
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,696
But he said they didn't have any plans.

110
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,454
Why would the Purcell kids lie
about meeting the Boyle kid?

111
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,831
What were they up to?

112
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,335
What were they really doing?

113
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,754
Back to the kids.

114
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,715
Talk to the parents again.
The Boyle kid.

115
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,843
Any others knew 'em.

116
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,972
Go back through
the house again. Right?

117
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,015
Yeah. Right on.

118
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,354
That's good, man...

119
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,483
We get that teacher
to help with the kids.

120
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,075
Wayne had the idea,
them kids were telling stories...

121
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,494
And he was correct.

122
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,081
Y'all fucked a good detective there.

123
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,333
You know that, right?

124
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,171
I wouldn't argue with you.
But it wasn't me.

125
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,924
He probably didn't even give you shit
for it when you saw him, huh?

126
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,677
I can't say he did, no.

127
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,308
Purple Hays. My man.

128
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,063
I tried to get him
transferred over here twice, you know.

129
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,400
Blocked both times
by the major's office.

130
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,485
Told me not to ask again.

131
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,779
Feel like we should stay on point.

132
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,075
I'm making a point, son.

133
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,292
You played with Will
and Julie a lot, huh?

134
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:30,506
Not really. I mean, I hung out
with Will at school a little.

135
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,509
But y'all hung out after school?

136
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,678
His dad said y'all played after school.

137
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,348
Nossir. We didn't play much.

138
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:45,687
I told him he could come over sometime
to see the new puppy, but that's it.

139
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,397
He's home after school.

140
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,359
Or at basketball now.
He don't go out playing much.

141
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,327
You said they played a lot
with that neighbor, Ronnie Boyle.

142
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,455
Yeah...

143
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,626
Three or four times a week...
They're best friends.

144
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,379
Did Ronnie ever come
over here, to the house?

145
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,090
Did you ever see
when kids get together?

146
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,383
No.

147
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,888
No, I guess not. But I knew him
and his parents from school.

148
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,849
They'd go over to his place.

149
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,645
Actually, it looks like they didn't
really play together.

150
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,856
What is this?

151
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,650
What's this mean?

152
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,403
Why aren't you out there
looking for her?

153
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,738
That's where she is... out there...

154
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,366
She's alive, the letter said...
she's out there...

155
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,493
The feds are running a wide search,
Mr. Purcell.

156
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,787
And they have a lot more manpower.

157
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,833
We're trying to focus
on what's personal.

158
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,085
Would you folks be alright

159
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:53,463
if we started going back through
some of their things?

160
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,384
We're afraid now...
we might've overlooked something.

161
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,469
What?

162
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,306
We just don't know, ma'am.

163
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,635
"IT'S OKAY".

164
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,637
"DON'T LISTEN."

165
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:28,100
"I'LL ALWAYS KEEP YOU SAFE."

166
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,161
We'll process this stuff,
get it back to you.

167
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,415
Don't lose it, okay?

168
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,541
We won't.

169
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,837
Say, one of you used to work
at Hoyt Foods?

170
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,632
Yeah, I did.

171
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,510
On the chicken line.

172
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:08,765
Quit a year or two ago. Make better
money in tips at the Sawhorse.

173
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,018
Why?

174
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,478
Just asking.

175
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,273
Thank you, now.

176
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,372
So Wayne opened up that the kids
weren't doing what they said they were.

177
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,668
With that big reward,
brought everybody out the woodwork.

178
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,379
You see Wayne much anymore?

179
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,216
Not at all, really.

180
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,427
An' I don't know why.

181
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,804
No hard feelings, though?

182
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:52,935
Not between him and me.
We were good friends, as I see it.

183
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,147
I think it was...

184
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,110
Once we stopped working together,
we just stopped.

185
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,241
Sometimes it's like that with people.

186
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,166
- Dad, can I get a Transformer?
- No.

187
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,419
Can we get something from the toys,
Dad? If it's cheap?

188
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,880
No. Where the hell's the charcoal?

189
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,508
- How about if it's only a dollar?
- No.

190
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,344
Stores aren't supposed to be this big.

191
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,430
- Can we at least go look at the toys?
- No.

192
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,641
You guys have to stay with me...

193
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,272
So we're trying to update
the book, if possible.

194
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:42,651
Hearing about her prints at the
drugstore is very significant...

195
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,570
How'd you hear about that?

196
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,738
My ex-husband.

197
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,366
He's a cop in Arkansas.

198
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,704
Always had a thing for cops, I guess.

199
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,208
We got a few partials
and a lot of fulls.

200
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,129
We verified it with the state
crime lab... it's definitely a match.

201
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,300
Were any of her prints found
behind the pharmacy?

202
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,762
No. But we didn't get to keep
working the scene, either.

203
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:15,392
End of the day, the store just
wanted to get back to business.

204
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:19,062
- So hers were just the shelves?
- Yes, ma'am.

205
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,691
We only focused on the robbery,
and that was months ago.

206
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,403
I'm about to clock out.

207
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,615
You want to grab a bite
and we can talk more about it?

208
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,960
Alright.

209
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:56,433
Hey... I think we're done.

210
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,603
That was awful, right?

211
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,232
Since you guys were so good,
I'll let you get one thing.

212
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,192
Feel better, sad guy?

213
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,738
Where's your sister?

214
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,116
She was right behind me...
I don't know...

215
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,910
C'mon!

216
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,874
- Becca! Becca!
- Becca!

217
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,597
Becca!

218
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,225
Becca!

219
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,477
Becca!

220
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,730
- Becca!
- Please come to customer service.

221
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,358
Look for the nearest Walmart
representative

222
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:50,362
and ask them to bring you to customer
service Rebecca Hays...

223
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,947
It's been ten minutes.

224
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:56,451
You need to lock down the store.
Shut all the doors. Nobody in or out.

225
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,956
Listen to me. I'm a cop. State Police.
Lock down the store, now.

226
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,332
I'll make an announcement,
Give me the mic...

227
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,043
- Sir, I don't think you...
- Give me the mic!

228
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,881
Where were you?!

229
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,675
I dunno. They were giving
out chips in one place,

230
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,052
and I stopped to eat some,
and y'all were gone...

231
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:18,056
Goddamnit, you can't do that! You hear
me? Don't fucking do that, Rebecca!

232
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,192
Okay.

233
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,028
Let's go. Let's just go home.

234
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,798
We were happy to help.

235
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:55,511
Especially once we heard
she was a former employee of ours.

236
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,765
Just it led to a lot
of false tips, you know,

237
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,519
and it's better to coordinate this kind
of thing between our offices.

238
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,270
But we did.

239
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:09,566
The board cleared it with
the county prosecutor's office...

240
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:15,322
I don't see any pictures of y'all
putting up rewards for anybody.

241
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,533
Up till now, we've tended to help

242
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:20,869
families with children
that needed medical treatment.

243
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,371
But with it all over the news,

244
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:26,458
and knowing the mother used
to be in our family of workers,

245
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,418
the board voted to contribute.

246
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,839
When did this "outreach" start?

247
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,300
Mr. Hoyt endowed the foundation
after they lost their granddaughter

248
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,927
a couple of years ago.

249
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,223
The mother worked on the chicken
line. Where's that building?

250
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,599
Let's see...

251
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,729
It'd be one of... those two.

252
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,109
You know what would help?

253
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,863
Names and dates of hire for every
employee works at this plant.

254
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,740
That's nearly seven hundred people.

255
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,285
Faster we get them back, the better.

256
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:06,999
Alright. Sure, of course. We'll start
getting it together right now.

257
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,419
The big man, Mr. Hoyt, he ever here?

258
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:14,715
Well, hardly, no. Mr. Hoyt's been
an Africa since mid-October.

259
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,008
Safari.

260
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,845
Yeah? My partner's a bit
of a hunter himself...

261
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,523
State PD, task force...

262
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,198
The girl's being held at a snake farm
in Hunstville?

263
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,660
And how you know this, ma'am?

264
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,666
Listen, we closed right now,
but do me a favor:

265
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,211
Call back in the morning, this number,

266
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,589
ask for Agents Bowen or Diller, FBI.

267
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,342
Tell 'em what you telling me.

268
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,096
Alright now.

269
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,764
"IT'S OKAY." "DON'T LISTEN."

270
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,474
"I'LL ALWAYS KEEP YOU SAFE."
"HAVE A GOOD NIGHT"

271
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,061
Lady seen Julie Purcell in a dream.

272
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:55,274
An' she say her dreams
always come true.

273
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,613
All this stuff's about that game.

274
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,616
Couldn't find his dice, but...

275
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,161
I'm not seeing anything.

276
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,917
Except, he played a lot.

277
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,838
And them other kids
didn't play with him, huh?

278
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,933
SECRET FRIEND?

279
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:35,147
Who gave Julie the doll
and met them in the woods?

280
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,149
Who played the game with Will?

281
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:41,695
Where'd they go after school, they
were meant to be with that neighbor?

282
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,739
So what was your next move?

283
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,703
Shut down the park except
for search parties.

284
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:53,749
They were still doing them every day,
mostly volunteer.

285
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,127
State Park's about 2500 acres...

286
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,671
So, how does it work?

287
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,174
You spot patterns.

288
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,512
Disturbance, flattening.

289
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,890
It's there,
you just have to look for it.

290
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:12,976
Bent grass, compressed ground.

291
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,524
You tracked men in the war?

292
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,070
I did.

293
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,074
Did you march?

294
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:29,660
I did.

295
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,165
Funny how the protests stopped
once the draft ended.

296
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,344
Hey, that... poem you were teaching.

297
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,848
Yeah. You had some thoughts about it?

298
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,853
He says you call the story "Time",

299
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,564
but you can't say its name.

300
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,024
Why's that?

301
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,070
I guess because...

302
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:09,283
we're in time, and of time,

303
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,078
but to name...

304
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,624
You separate yourself from
something when you name it.

305
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,751
And I think he means,

306
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:22,629
we can't be separated from time.

307
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:30,304
I thought he meant
it was like the name of God.

308
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:35,184
You know, how the Hebrews weren't
supposed to say God's name.

309
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,506
You think maybe we should
have dinner some time?

310
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,728
- Hey!
- Hi.

311
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,190
Those Sallisaw boys
couldn't stop telling me stuff.

312
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:27,361
I was pretty tremendous.
I think I have a future at this.

313
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,032
You're reading it? Finally?

314
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,617
Not really.

315
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,995
I keep seeing my name.

316
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,212
Are you drunk?

317
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,550
No. I had a drink at dinner.

318
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,803
This detective took me out to eat.

319
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:54,429
Oh, terrific.

320
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,099
No, actually I
got a lot of info from him.

321
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,560
Listen, her fingerprints were found

322
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,854
just on the shelves
in the cosmetics aisle.

323
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,147
Looks like she was probably a customer.

324
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,650
They have the prior week's
surveillance footage.

325
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,777
I think they're gonna
let me look at it.

326
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,488
I didn't get any
of that shit you wanted.

327
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,282
At Walmart.

328
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:16,493
Okay.

329
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,997
Did something happen?

330
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:23,166
- Are the kids alright?
- The kids are fine.

331
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,878
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.

332
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,755
But one thing, one favor.

333
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,884
Do not come bouncing in here

334
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,887
half-in-the-bag,
all giddy about this shit.

335
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,638
Can you do that?

336
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:40,684
Can you summon the mental resolve
to shut up about this shit with me?

337
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:45,439
If you feel this way
you don't have to talk to me like that.

338
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,150
- You could just tell me.
- You've been told.

339
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,945
Whyn't you go check on the kids,
since you haven't seen em all day.

340
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,698
- They're supposed to be in bed.
- Fuck off.

341
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,158
I'm with them five times
the amount you are,

342
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,327
for a job that treats you like shit.

343
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,914
I don't really feel like trading
curses. I said my piece.

344
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,792
I'm not gonna stop, Wayne.

345
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,682
Patrol's got the scene.
Forensics' is on the way.

346
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:10,727
That's where the boy died.
Somebody carried him to the cave.

347
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,856
The office checked the field reports.

348
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,691
Nobody talked to this guy.

349
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,944
The farm road's not on our maps.

350
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,707
I already talked to your people.

351
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,585
Man came here the next day.

352
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:36,628
What man?

353
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,840
Was he police, sheriff's?

354
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:43,218
Man in a suit, showed me a badge.

355
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,431
Asked about those missing kids,
if I'd seen anything.

356
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,516
Can you describe him?

357
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,605
Normal guy. White. Suit.

358
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,733
Showed me a badge.

359
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,778
What'd you tell him?
Did you see anything?

360
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:05,032
I told him I'd seen those kids before.

361
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:09,786
Two or three times. They'd come down
my road, into the woods.

362
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,748
Couple afternoons I've seen 'em.

363
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,709
- You see anybody else?
- Yeah.

364
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,087
I told him I'd seen a car out here
a couple times.

365
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:22,674
Nice one, brown. Man and woman...

366
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,302
But that wasn't the same day.

367
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:28,096
What they looked like,
the man and woman?

368
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,225
Like y'all. Black and white.

369
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,186
Man was Negro.

370
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,313
I couldn't see faces.

371
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:41,568
Most times
you gotta be looking for our place,

372
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,364
but sometimes people come out here.

373
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:48,742
Sir, you mind if we search your
property?

374
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,287
Yessir, I mind.

375
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,415
Don't you need a warrant
for something like that?

376
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,794
If you make us get one.

377
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:02,172
I think you'll have to, son.

378
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:05,551
Can I ask...

379
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,220
do you feel there was sufficient
coverage of the neighborhood

380
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,930
during the canvassing?

381
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:12,057
I guess I do.

382
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,270
We brought whatever we had.

383
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,941
General rule, you start close,
then work your way out.

384
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,861
Did the officers conduct multiple
interviews

385
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,362
with all potential witnesses?

386
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,030
Yes...

387
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:33,036
And I feel like, honestly, everyone
was giving everything they had.

388
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,415
Well, we have people who say they were
never questioned by the police,

389
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,835
although they remembered
the officers going door to door.

390
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:46,717
I don't know...

391
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,762
If anyone got overlooked,
it was a mistake...

392
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,849
We had over a hundred law enforcement
officers out there...

393
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,852
Some residents did get talked to three
or four times.

394
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,146
But nobody spoke to these people.

395
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:02,774
And we found two who both separately
claim to've witnessed

396
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,612
a very nice brown sedan
driving around the neighborhoods

397
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:10,449
and later, away from Devil's Den
on the day of the murder...

398
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,620
Brown sedan?

399
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,457
A witness said police talked to him
once, and he told them about the car,

400
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,958
but they never came back.

401
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:23,086
And there's no mention of the sedan
in field reports.

402
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,506
Another said the police
never took a statement.

403
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,592
But they both noticed the car
because it was new and upscale,

404
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,844
and that was unusual for the area.

405
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,722
And that the vehicle
kept driving around.

406
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:38,894
Treads...

407
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:43,065
I remember, treads...

408
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,442
Another former resident,
Charles Snyder,

409
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:48,403
said two weeks before,
he reported that his boy and a friend

410
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,490
had told of a black man with a scar,
in a suit

411
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:54,618
at the cul-de-sac where
the kids played, near Devil's Den.

412
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,704
No one ever came back to question him.

413
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,294
None of this is mentioned
in the official reports.

414
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:11,343
This alone, don't you think, points
to serious flaws in the investigation,

415
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:12,886
from the beginning?

416
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,852
What's going on, really?

417
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,981
You got some new evidence?
Are you looking for Julie?

418
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:25,399
You find something?

419
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,776
- That's enough for today.
- I'm alright.

420
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,362
- I think we were doing well.
- I'm sure you do.

421
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:33,282
You see his distress?
This man is ill, Elisa.

422
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,492
- Henry...
- That is enough.

423
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,705
For today.

424
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,887
Over there,
'other side of the tree line.

425
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:59,349
It's hard to find, kind of hidden.
That's where they played.

426
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:02,561
We need to process these toys.

427
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:06,106
You can bag the toys, but we need
pictures to show the parents.

428
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,232
Hey!

429
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,404
- Get up!
- What's going on?

430
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:56,990
What're you doing
skulking around here?

431
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,283
What?

432
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:04,081
We got kids playin' out here,
we don't need you lurking around 'em.

433
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:05,457
My kids and two others say

434
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:08,418
you keep coming around that field
where they all play.

435
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:11,421
What're you coming
around the kids for?

436
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,382
I'm not...

437
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:14,842
I don't...

438
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,761
- I have kids.
- No you don't.

439
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,805
We don't want you around here.

440
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,558
I live here. I have rights.

441
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:26,186
I fought for your fucking rights,
you assholes...

442
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,525
You a goddamn bum.

443
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,237
- You stay away from these kids.
- And stay out our neighborhood.

444
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,669
You hear me, now, boy?

445
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,964
You don't come around here no more.

446
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,592
We don't see you.

447
00:36:56,675 --> 00:37:00,804
And God help you,
you talk to another child out here.

448
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,532
Get the fuck outta here!

449
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,846
How's life in charge?

450
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,850
It's got it's good and bad.

451
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:34,481
You talked to 'em, Alan's firm?

452
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,568
Yeah, they approached me.

453
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,238
The guy's kids hired them, he said.

454
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:46,368
But you support it, re-opening it?

455
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,332
They tell you about the fingerprints?

456
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,585
Yeah.

457
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,297
You have any idea
what that means to me?

458
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,675
I have to imagine.

459
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,343
But yessir.

460
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:13,312
You know I... I think of Lucy...

461
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,441
I wish she was still around
to hear this.

462
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,444
Two years ago, now.

463
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,530
Alan had her file.

464
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:27,659
I had the body brought back from Vegas.

465
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,371
What about you?

466
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,334
How you doing with all this, now?

467
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:38,086
Still sober.

468
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,589
Five years.

469
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:42,299
I know.

470
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,177
I'm proud of you, man.

471
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:46,929
So...

472
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:50,098
I got my higher power, and...

473
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:53,101
He's putting this in front of me now...

474
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,898
Cream and extra sugar, still?

475
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,401
Yessir. Like a dessert.

476
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:07,324
How about the other one,
your partner? He still around?

477
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,328
He's on the job.

478
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,874
He hasn't been in major crime
in a long time.

479
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:24,174
Anyways, me and him kinda lost touch.

480
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:29,888
You didn't have to check on me,
Lieutenant West.

481
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:34,059
You done more for me than just about
anybody.

482
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:38,230
You pulled me outta that hole
five years ago...

483
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,815
Naw.

484
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,692
You done good.

485
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:56,081
Can I ask you for something?

486
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,334
You can ask.

487
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,671
Would you pray with me?

488
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:16,268
God, save me from anger.

489
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:22,274
God, save me from resentment.

490
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:28,864
God, save me from my judgments
and prophecies,

491
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:33,202
my need to control...

492
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:39,166
I have known You
by the hawk and the dove,

493
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:43,295
and I live at Your infinite
compassion...

494
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:49,218
Lord, guard what I hold dear,

495
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:54,848
and let me never hold too dearly
anything of this world.

496
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,935
Amen.

497
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:06,527
A brown sedan.

498
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:14,326
A farmer talked about a brown
sedan, '80...

499
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,414
We knew...

500
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,421
Was that who they played with?

501
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:34,096
She wrote a bit how the games we found

502
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:39,768
got people worried that kids
were getting killed playing this stuff

503
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:43,856
or something...

504
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:52,489
Henry was five or six, I think,
when she started writing.

505
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:56,743
And Becca would've been
three or four...

506
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:12,009
Scientists now theorize an infinite
number of dimensions outside our own.

507
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:16,096
Einstein said:

508
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,268
"Past, present and future are all
a stubbornly persistent illusion."

509
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:27,357
Oh God.

510
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:31,069
And are you waking up
to that illusion?

511
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:37,034
Now, while things fall apart,
are you starting to see them clearly?

512
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:43,916
And at the end of all things are you
awakening to what you withheld?

513
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:50,255
Did you confuse reacting with feeling?

514
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:54,134
Did you mistake compulsion
for freedom?

515
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:58,138
Please. Not like this...

516
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,600
And even so...

517
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:05,729
...did you harden your heart
against what loved you most?

518
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,776
Not like this. Not like this.

519
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,945
Sweetheart...

520
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:16,907
Did you think you could just go on,

521
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,868
and never once have to look back?

522
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,789
Please... I don't deserve this.

523
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,251
What's happening?
I don't deserve this.

524
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:31,046
No, you don't.
But it's happening anyway.

525
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,424
I'm so sorry.

526
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,641
Where's it... I...

527
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:48,897
How much do I have to lose?

528
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:52,901
Everything. The same as everybody else.

529
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,450
I lost Becca.

530
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:04,663
No, you didn't. Not the way you think.

531
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,547
You're worried what they'll find.

532
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:16,967
What you left in the woods.

533
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,348
Finish it.

534
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:35,921
Got a message.
A Lieutenant wanted to meet you.

535
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,344
Movin' up in the world.

536
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:17,212
No, I don't recognize them.

537
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:21,049
I think. I mean...

538
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,846
I know I didn't buy any of these...

539
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,931
Ma'am?

540
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:30,851
I don't think so.

541
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:35,898
- I don't really remember.
- I'm the one bought 'em toys.

542
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,066
I don't recognize any of those.

543
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,238
This about the reward?

544
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:45,741
Someone called us.

545
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:51,121
What's it have to do with...

546
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,749
Where'd you find these?

547
00:47:56,084 --> 00:48:00,797
Looks like the kids had this kind
of play area, hidden in the forest.

548
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:06,345
- Found these toys there.
- They could be anybody's.

549
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:09,473
Had the kids' prints on 'em.

550
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,685
Another set of prints we can't ID.

551
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,480
And more of those straw dolls.

552
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:22,361
They were meeting somebody,
some adult?

553
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,072
Maybe. Yessir.

554
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:26,573
What're these?

555
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,119
We haven't see these.

556
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,664
S'old baby albums...

557
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,041
He brought it out. I...

558
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,836
I can't look at it.

559
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,761
Roland.

560
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,529
It's the same.

561
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,597
What's this one from?

562
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:35,058
That's Will's first communion.

563
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,687
He was ten...

564
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:43,400
What?

565
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:51,200
What?

566
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:21,396
Purple Hays. How 'you been, killer?

567
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:28,070
Just making my rounds
of places I'm not wanted.

568
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:32,908
- Dub SoCo.
- You served?

569
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,577
- Every day of my life.
- What war?

570
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:39,081
Motherfucker, get me two fingers
of Southern Comfort.

571
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,625
He's a lieutenant with state police.

572
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:53,345
Coulda told him you fixed Jeeps while
the rest of us were gettin' shot at.

573
00:50:53,512 --> 00:50:56,473
Coulda slapped my dick on the bar, too.

574
00:50:57,808 --> 00:51:00,185
Nine years. You're still
talkin' about your dick.

575
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:03,355
I don't mean to.
It just keeps coming up.

576
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:12,906
New task force.

577
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,951
I'm in charge.

578
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,622
Good for you, Lieutenant.

579
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,751
Say...

580
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,381
That promotion for merit...

581
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:33,093
...or did it come
with the pigmentation?

582
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:38,015
I think, unlike some others,
I lacked a big fucking mouth.

583
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:43,645
Hell, with Affirmative Action,
you coulda been my boss by now.

584
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:47,482
Guess if I'd been clumsy
enough to get shot,

585
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:50,360
I'd be playing golf most days

586
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:53,864
and calling old buddies
like I'm doing them a favor.

587
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,911
I guess you had a few 'fore I got here.

588
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,373
Could be avoiding home.

589
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,424
I was gonna keep goin', some race bit.

590
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:15,052
You never been very funny.

591
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,975
You feel like maybe being
a detective again?

592
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,566
'Cause that, you were okay at.

593
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:33,487
The Purcell case?

594
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:36,532
State's reopening it.

595
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,992
They want me to steer.

596
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:42,746
Lookit you. 'Can't stop this rocket.

597
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:48,168
You want to get back to work or not?

598
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,763
I...

599
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:04,184
I'm sorry about that pigmentation line.

600
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:06,770
No, you're not.

601
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:09,731
Half sorry.

601
00:53:10,305 --> 00:54:10,282

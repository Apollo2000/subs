Okay.

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,260
Okay, here we go.

14
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,217
Come on.

15
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:14,101
Period. Send.

16
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,570
There she goes.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,670
Sustenance.

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,130
"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights."

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,440
The sequel to end all sequels.

20
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:34,117
All right, fellas.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,090
Let's...

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,056
Nora?

23
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,412
I'm naked! Don't come in!
I'm naked. She's naked.

24
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:40,809
Don't come in.

25
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,846
Good morning!

26
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,255
Your hair! Oh, you like it?

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,240
- Yeah.
- I asked the hairdresser,

28
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,550
I said I wanted to look
like Eminem.

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,279
You succeeded.
It looks awesome.

30
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,559
Thank you.

31
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:56,425
You want to go to Atlantic City
with me today?

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,201
We have an extra ticket

33
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,131
because my friend Shu Shu

34
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:02,221
got hit by a Citibike.

35
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,417
Oh, no.

36
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,387
Oh, shattered her pelvis.

37
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,417
It's multiple fragments,

38
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,727
some of them as small
as a mouse tooth.

39
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,317
Jesus. Anyway, we don't want

40
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:14,107
to let her bus ticket
go to waste.

41
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,967
Wanna go? You know, I...

42
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,247
I have a lot of things
to be doing today.

43
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:20,627
And I'm just gonna tie up
some bells and whistles

44
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:22,393
and some mends and looses
and things like that...

45
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:25,277
Okay, I understand.

46
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,867
It's just that Shu Shu,

47
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:30,837
my best best friend
from way back,

48
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:32,627
do you know what she says?

49
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:36,147
"I wish I had
a granddaughter like yours.

50
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:39,657
"She's so well-behaved
and so beautiful.

51
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,997
And she always does everything
for her grandmother."

52
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,097
And now she is paralyzed
from the waist down

53
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,237
and up and all around.

54
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:51,717
And she could really use
some good news,

55
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:54,897
like her bus ticket
not going to waste.

56
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,927
Because it's such a shame
to waste money.

57
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:01,787
But Grandma understands.

58
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:07,137
Oh, Shu Shu...

59
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,122
All right, Grandma,
I'll go with you

60
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,237
to Atlantic City!

61
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,150
Okay, see you downstairs.

62
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,587
And don't embarrass me.

63
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,272
My sweet baby angels...

64
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:27,067
I'm so sorry.

65
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:35,027
Grandma, is this the bus?

66
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,242
Atlantic City, baby!

67
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:40,737
Let me guess,
no AC and no seat belts,

68
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,552
- windows are sealed shut.
- Yep.

69
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,150
Looks like he's dead already.

70
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,566
This is my granddaughter, Nora.

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,530
Oh, Nora, you find
a seat over there.

72
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:15,219
I can't... I can't
sit with you guys?

73
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,158
Oh, you are small.
You can make your own seat.

74
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,459
Excuse, um, can I...?

75
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,739
Oh.

76
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,249
Oh, that's his seat?

77
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,459
Sorry.

78
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:34,119
Sir, do you mind
if I...? Excuse me.

79
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,721
All right.

80
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,441
"Hostel 2"?

81
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,036
Oh, Toto, not in Queens anymore.

82
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,651
Oh.

83
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:08,091
Bye, Toto.

84
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:11,201
The dog's name is Yao Ming!

85
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,091
'Kay.

86
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,821
We're here, Nora.

87
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,107
I've been trying to get him up.

88
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:19,261
Look at this, look.
Sir! Sir! Sir!

89
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,091
Watch this.

90
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,341
Wake up!

91
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,721
Your China wife is here!

92
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,144
They all cheat, you scumbag.

93
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,441
- What is this?
- Free money.

94
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,271
It's a $60 voucher
to gamble, if you want.

95
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:37,441
- What?
- Everybody on the bus

96
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,541
gets a $60 voucher

97
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,008
to go to Atlantic City.

98
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,518
No way.

99
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:46,108
- This is awesome, Grandma!
- Ha-ha.

100
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:49,868
- Atlantic City!
- Yeah!

101
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,813
Oh, Grandma, this is awesome.

102
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,123
What are we gonna do first?
Slots? Roulette?

103
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,183
Oh, my God, baccarat.

104
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:02,053
Video roulette,
video poker, vid...

105
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:03,863
Video blackjack?!

106
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:11,705
Okay, Nora.

107
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,890
You can sit with us if you want,

108
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,055
or you can find your own table

109
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,645
if you'd rather have some space.

110
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:19,129
What?

111
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,329
Oh, this is what
we do in Atlantic City.

112
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,569
We sit in the food court

113
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,569
and we watch K-dramas all day.

114
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,639
Then we turn in our vouchers
for cash.

115
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:29,965
You're gonna come
all the way to Atlantic City

116
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,199
and not gamble?

117
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,725
You could be doubling
your money, Grandma.

118
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:35,089
- The house never wins.
- That is wrong.

119
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,035
I can't believe you guys
come here and just sit here

120
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,499
when there is a million
fun things to do out there.

121
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,779
It's a whole world.

122
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,399
We have craps, slot machines,
Parcheesi tables.

123
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,679
This is awesome!

124
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:47,399
And you guys just
sit here the whole time?

125
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:48,679
Oh, yes.

126
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,539
Except one time
we all pooled our money

127
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,305
to get a male prostitute
for Helen as a joke.

128
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,369
Ha-ha.

129
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,569
They had lunch together,
maybe some light fingering.

130
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,529
But otherwise
we just keep the money.

131
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,235
I'm not... I'm not...
I'm not doing it like this, all right?

132
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,439
I-I-I I wanna do
Atlantic City my way.

133
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,089
Okay, have fun.

134
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,129
If you get hungry,
we'll be here.

135
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,399
I'm not gonna want Sbarro's.

136
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,089
Well, we brought
our own food, too.

137
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,509
We don't need Sbarro.

138
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,569
Helen, proud of you, girl.

139
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,989
Oh-ho, yeah!

140
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:30,369
Oh, I love gambling.
This is awesome.

141
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,639
Honey, that's just chump change.

142
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,888
The real action's at the table.

143
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,749
You know, I don't know
how to play those games.

144
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:39,059
So I figured I'd start small,
graduate to the big tables, you know?

145
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,711
You come to Atlantic City
to be a pussy?

146
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,130
Get out there!
Conquer! Hit the tables!

147
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,790
Say, can I borrow $1,000?

148
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,205
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have
that kind of money on me, but...

149
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,065
Well, how about 300?

150
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,976
300? All I got is $5
on a Best Buy gift card.

151
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,615
Well, you've gotta
share the wealth.

152
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,214
Let me have something!

153
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:06,755
Just gotta saddle up
to you here, buddy.

154
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:07,971
Ow...

155
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:09,239
Blackjack?

156
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,840
Why not call it
blackjill, right?

157
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,895
'Cause of women.
Hey, oh, wow.

158
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,005
Hey.Hi.

159
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:15,375
Can I get you
something to drink?

160
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:17,445
Oh, that's all right.
I just got lost in there.

161
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,065
Somewhere in the deep blues.

162
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,221
Are they green or are they blue?

163
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,175
Thanks. Yeah, okay.

164
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:23,755
Can I... can I get you a drink?

165
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:25,375
Yes, yes, um,

166
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,245
how much is
a Mountain Dew tequila?

167
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:28,617
Everything's free.

168
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:30,345
Was that... what, really?

169
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:32,181
Yeah, as long as you're playing,
everything's free.

170
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:34,105
Then I will be playin', right?

171
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,965
- Mountain Dew tequila.
- Yes.

172
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:37,625
And if you want one...

173
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,424
- You know, I'm good.
- Okay.

174
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:40,904
Right.

175
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,524
You wanna hit or stay?

176
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:44,023
What... what is that?

177
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,734
What does that...
What does that mean?

178
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,803
Hit means you want another card.

179
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,513
Stay means you don't.

180
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,924
21 is the objective of the game.

181
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,926
- You wanna get to 21...
- Okay.

182
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,231
- Without going over.
- So... so the object here then being...

183
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:01,082
get to 21,

184
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,352
stay there, live there,
breathe there, die there.

185
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:04,562
21's a winner.

186
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,082
- 22?
- No good.

187
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:07,842
All right!

188
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:20,282
All right, let's go
get our table.

189
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:26,399
Oh, no.
It's the Koreans.

190
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,042
Should we just
sit somewhere else?

191
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,349
Ah, but we need the outlets,
and that's the only one.

192
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,094
Let's go talk to them.

193
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:46,586
Oh, excuse me.
Hello.

194
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,441
My friends and I
are sitting over there,

195
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,681
but unfortunately
there's no outlet.

196
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,061
Only this one.

197
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:58,131
Would it be okay
if we shared yours?

198
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,130
I was just about
to plug in my iPad.

200
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,060
Well, what percentage
are you at?

201
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,652
89.

202
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,846
I don't like to be under 100.

203
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,866
Well... we will
let you know

204
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,476
when you can come back.

205
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,733
Okay, how 'bout
we check back in 15 minutes?

206
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:27,493
I said we will let you know.

207
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:40,873
Wow!

208
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:42,733
Eights for the Asian girl.

209
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,733
I guess I'm gonna
split those up.

210
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:47,163
- You wanna split those eights?
- I wanna split those eights.

211
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,493
Those are the best split
in the house.

212
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:51,073
Oh, thank you.
They call me Kristi Yamaguchi.

213
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:52,903
Wanna hit?

214
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:55,563
Mm... hit that one.

215
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,432
And hit that one, thank you.

216
00:10:58,113 --> 00:11:00,763
- 21.
- 21! 21!

217
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,073
21 and a what?

218
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:04,873
Hit that up.

219
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:06,733
- Hit it up.
- Yeah.

220
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,453
21!

221
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:10,503
For a total of 43... 42.

222
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:15,213
Go, blackjack, yeah!

223
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:16,493
You know what?

224
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:18,943
That is Sadie's
first semester at Colgate.

225
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,733
And that is your first semester on
an Alaskan cruise ship of your choice

226
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:24,943
because I want you to love you.

227
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,383
And tell Sadie
she better stay off Twitter.

228
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:31,593
By the way, this color on you
is just like a great green.

229
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:35,493
Blackjack! Whoo!

230
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:38,423
Oh, you know, what happens in
AC doesn't have to leave AC.

231
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:39,919
If you're busy later,
I mean all you girls...

232
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:41,563
My husband thinks I'm a virgin.

233
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:43,786
- Are you a virgin?
- Hell no!

234
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,493
Blackjack! Yeah!

235
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:49,709
You know what, and that's why

236
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,493
I'm gonna pledge that to SAE.

237
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:54,143
Yeah!
In the back.

238
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,633
21!

239
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,113
Blackjack!

240
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:00,383
Blackjack!

241
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,113
Yeah!

242
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,253
You guys are hot.

243
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,224
How are you doing this?

244
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,569
It's like Number Bumble.
You ever play Number Bumble?

245
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,323
It's a game I play
on my iPad, too.

246
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:11,299
It's basically you assign a plus
or minus to each of the cards.

247
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:12,763
As the cards get dealt around,

248
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,353
you see, you take
note of the deck

249
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:17,143
and then you realize
which cards are gonna come out

250
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:18,809
based on those number
systems that you assigned.

251
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,073
It's like Number Bumble.

252
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:23,143
Like a Millennial version
of counting cards?

253
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,663
Just a normal version
of counting cards.

254
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,383
Better watch what
you say, you know?

255
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:28,693
What?

256
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:29,943
What's wrong with that?

257
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:32,493
Homestretch.
Oh, yeah!

258
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:33,989
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

259
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:35,213
Excuse me!

260
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,973
- Oh, what?
- I need you to come with me, ma'am.

261
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:39,119
We need you to leave, ma'am.

262
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:40,253
Counting cards is illegal,

263
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:41,663
as is taking selfies at a table,

264
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,693
as is not having shoes on.

265
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,013
Hey, wait.

266
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,866
I'll make you a deal.
Make you a deal.

267
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,523
It's Atlantic City.
I'll make you a deal.

268
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,578
I'm gonna put my shoes on
real quick

269
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,873
so I have my shoes when...

270
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:55,083
Okay, all right?
All right, you good with that?

271
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:57,151
I love you, girl.

272
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,028
Everyone meet me
on the boardwalk!

273
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,754
Oh, no!

274
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,290
That's it.
Grandma mad.

275
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,090
I'm gonna K-pop her face.

276
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,670
Excuse me, for the kinetic
sand bottles,

277
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,290
is it $5 per color
and if I add...?

278
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,810
Oh, my God, Melanie.

279
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,330
Ehh?

280
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,980
N... no.
No, you.

281
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,640
Melanie.Melanie.

282
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,470
It's Nora.
From high school.

283
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,020
So awkward to see you here.

284
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,262
Melanie, hey!

285
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,982
From AP Spanish.

286
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,724
Don't you remember?

287
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,654
Sorry, you must be confused.

288
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:13,034
I don't know who Melanie is.

289
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:14,562
So why are you running?

290
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:16,907
Melanie! Hey!

291
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,878
Oh, Nora!

292
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,904
What the fuck, dude?

293
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,348
What are you, working on the
Atlantic City boardwalk now?

294
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,975
Yeah.

295
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,576
I thought you were like a
video producer or something.

296
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:30,661
Oh, I was.

297
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,606
Yeah, I worked for BuzzFeed
for a few months,

298
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:34,251
but then I got laid off.

299
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:35,583
Oh, my God.

300
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,413
Then I worked at Jamie Lynn
Spears' production company,

301
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,103
but fell down
three flights of stairs.

302
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:41,933
- Three flights?
- Three.

303
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,553
- Almost four.
- Oh, my...

304
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:46,413
I caught myself.
Well, my face caught myself.

305
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,149
And then they thought
I was gonna sue them,

306
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:50,213
- so I got laid off.
- You okay?

307
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,523
Oh, and then I did
a Snapchat series

308
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,523
about a girl that went
missing in a small town,

309
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,909
but the actress playing the girl
that went missing in the small town

310
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,553
actually went missing,

311
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:01,103
so we had to shut down
production.

312
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:03,763
I mean, seems like
you've been busy, though.

313
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,523
Oh, no.
That was all last year.

314
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,189
You've... you've been
living in Atlantic City

315
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,483
for an entire year?

316
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,763
I wouldn't call it living.

317
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,143
A lot has changed
since high school, Nora.

318
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:19,383
Yeah.

319
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:20,963
Can you buy me
something to drink?

320
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:21,963
Yeah.

321
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,963
- I haven't had a drink in three days.
- Sure.

322
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,096
Ah...

323
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:34,125
Melanie, what happened?

324
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,207
Didn't you go to Emerson
on a full ride?

325
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,842
Yeah, but a BFA only
gets you so far

326
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,440
in the content game.

327
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,251
So, after the last time
I got laid off,

328
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,246
I just gave up and came here.

329
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,906
If I do two braids
and two sand bottles a week,

330
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,144
I can afford a funnel cake
and a bunk at the hostel.

331
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,946
But why Atlantic City?

332
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:59,317
Because it's a lot
cheaper than New York.

333
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,295
And what am I supposed to do?

334
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,365
Go home and live
with my parents?

335
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:05,923
I failed.

336
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,443
I deserve to live in the most
depressing place in the world.

337
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,398
Atlantic City is not depressing.

338
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,218
No, it's not.

339
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,218
- There's an ocean.
- Dirty.

340
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,498
- Casino.
- Desperate.

341
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,288
I saw a laser tag sign.

342
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,118
Look, I know what
you're trying to do.

343
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,878
You're trying to find
a positive.

344
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,668
My life sucks.

345
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,328
Melanie, you can't
let a few road bumps

346
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:30,568
force you into exile, all right?

347
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:33,158
I am a loser.
I do live with my parents.

348
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,428
You've lost more jobs
than I've ever had.

349
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,528
And... and if I can make it work,

350
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:39,832
you can make it work,
anyone can make it work.

351
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:42,288
You... you should just
come back to the city.

352
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,908
There's a bus.
It's leaving tonight.

353
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:47,288
- You start over.
- Thanks, Nora, but...

354
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:49,018
I can't.

355
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,978
This is my life now,

356
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:53,088
a sad song of hair and sand.

357
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:54,639
You can play a different song.

358
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:55,972
I should go.

359
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,498
My friend Tillie's teaching me

360
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:00,745
how to write someone's name
on a grain of rice.

361
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,536
Okay, that's... A lot more sanitary
than hair stuff.

362
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,607
- Sure.
- Lice.

363
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,887
That's disgusting, Mel.

364
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,292
Nice seeing you, Nora.

365
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:10,718
Melanie, you left your...

366
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,957
Look, our iPad is dead.

367
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,972
Just let us use the outlet.

368
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,691
Maybe you all should
just read a book.

369
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:28,047
Then you won't need an outlet.

370
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,397
Don't talk to us Chinese
about books, bitch.

371
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,261
We invented paper.

372
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,701
Don't talk to Koreans
about charging, bitch.

373
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,951
We invented Samsung.

374
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,629
Then where are all the Galaxies?

375
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:44,705
All I see are iPhones.

376
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,288
That's what I thought.

377
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,362
What do you think you're doing?

378
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,739
What I shoulda done
this morning!

379
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,367
Don't you have a floor
to spit on somewhere?

380
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,844
Ah, don't mess with me.

381
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,459
I will cut you
and I will bite you.

382
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,892
Chinese teeth are harder
than Korean teeth.

383
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,419
- Really?
- Yeah.

384
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:11,567
Kimchi bitches!

385
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:29,017
What up?

386
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,776
How's your jerk-off day going?

387
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,902
Yo, where you at?

388
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,482
I'm in AC with my grandma.

389
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,862
Had to abort the jerk-off sesh.

390
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:38,868
By the way,
guess who I ran into,

391
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,838
Melanie from high school.

392
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:43,397
Damn!
How's she doin'?

393
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:45,441
You know we 69'ed once.

394
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:46,709
What?

395
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,159
Although technically
it was more of a 96.

396
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,019
We just fell asleep
touching butts.

397
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,989
That's gross, dude.
I gotta go.

398
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:54,539
I gotta meet
my Grandma, all right?

399
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,129
What are you vaping?

400
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,539
What are you vaping right now?

401
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:59,113
So how's Mel lookin'?

402
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,548
Good-bye!

403
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,028
Grandma.

404
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:05,688
What happened?

405
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,408
We got kicked out.

406
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:10,875
Two men in suits
are carrying me away

407
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,888
after I picked a fight
with some Korean bitches.

408
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,238
You started an inter-Asian
race war in there?

409
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:19,238
Well, yeah,
they make good soap operas.

410
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,218
I give them that.

411
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,958
You know I'm half-Korean, right?

412
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,858
Well, yeah, girl.
Yeah.

413
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:27,901
Let's go home.

414
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,998
Look at your arm, bro.

415
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:38,402
Oh, yeah, my posse and me,
we went and beat up

416
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,397
some four-foot-six old lady.

417
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,889
Is her arm in a sling?

418
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,339
No, her face met with my fist.

419
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,059
What a dumbass.

420
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,409
All right.

421
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:48,646
Hey...

422
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,722
where'd you get this from?

423
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:54,719
Melanie!

424
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:56,382
Hey.

425
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:57,792
You came back.

426
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,832
Yeah, I'm coming back
to the city.

427
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:02,382
Thought about what you said,
and you were right.

428
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,762
If you can make it work,
literally anyone can.

429
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:06,832
Okay.

430
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,522
Like anyone on this bus.

431
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,622
All right.

432
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:12,522
I have a confession to make.

433
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:15,622
You dropped this
in the bar, and I took it.

434
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,002
Oh, you can keep that.

435
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:21,011
I am so done with sand.

436
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:23,552
- If you have $5...
-  No.

437
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,582
Okay. Thank you.

438
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:27,482
- Love you, Nora.
- I love you.

439
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:34,400
We will watch "Dirty Dancing 2:
Havana Nights."

440
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,962
"Havana Nights."
It's "Havana Nights."

441
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,031
I just need my space.

442
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,703
Who the fuck is Awkwafina?

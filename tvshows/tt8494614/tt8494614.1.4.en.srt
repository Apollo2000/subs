1
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,167
Hey, Grandma!

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,203
Huh?

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,005
Guess what today is.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,241
Uh, is it National
Spaghetti Day?

5
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,821
The day that the Chinese

6
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,712
gave the recipe to
the white people?

7
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:16,682
They call it Italian?
Aw, man!

8
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,084
No, wait.
That's January the fourth.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,986
No. No, Grandma,
today is when

10
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,721
I get my car outta impound.

11
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,524
Out of the tow yard!
Love after lockup!

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,393
See this?
It's a check from Nancy.

13
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,161
379 big boys.

14
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,498
Oh, bow-bow.
I'm so proud of you.

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,400
Proud like when I won that...

16
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,769
"Magic: The Gathering"
tournament back in 7th grade?

17
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,570
Ah, here we go.

18
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,274
I remember that game
like it was yesterday.

19
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,842
My Loam Dweller was at a 2/2,

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,778
my Villainous Ogre at 3/2.

21
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,080
Oh, I had this
Orochi Sustainer but...

22
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,915
it wasn't enough.

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,250
My Moss Kami,

24
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,585
he was backed by this
removal spell, but...

25
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,789
couldn't have made
a significant impact.

26
00:00:56,824 --> 00:01:00,192
Then...
then, I drew the...

27
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,427
The greatest card of all time,

28
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,729
the Lord of Eiganjo.

29
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,709
My opponent tried to throw
it down with a Glitterfang,

30
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,267
but mmm, my Gibbering Kami

31
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,102
brought the whole house down.

32
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,603
I looked my opponent
in the eyes,

33
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,972
he was shiverin' in his boots.

34
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,707
Didn't he die?

35
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,609
Yeah, that guy...
yeah, he died.

36
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,780
But anyway,
I'm taking you out, girl!

37
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,383
To a fancy place, with this.

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,786
Ha ha!
Yeah!

39
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,888
I'm gonna take you out
for some "cherra"...

40
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,957
"cherraskaree,"
"cherraskaria."

41
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,459
Anyway, I gotta go.

42
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,138
I'm gonna wear my funeral suit!

43
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,462
Whip it out, girl!

44
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,473
Hey, Faruque!

45
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,574
Hi, Nora!

46
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,820
Looks like you're having
a good day.

47
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,910
Oh, I am. I'm gettin'
my car out of jail.

48
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,313
Cool!
You want a free kebab?

49
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,482
They're from yesterday
so they're extra gamy.

50
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,750
Oh, my G... Yes!

51
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,452
Oh, it's a big boy!
Yeah!

52
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,687
Thanks, Faruque.

I'm sorry.
I didn't see you...

76
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,598
come out from there.
Can I help you?

77
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,944
Yeah, I'm just here
actually to...

78
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,579
To get my car out of prison.

79
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,236
Number 3-4-0-2.

80
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,715
Um, so sorry,
I'm a little sweaty.

81
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,940
I just walked all the way
from Elmhurst.

82
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,341

Is your car your baby?

86
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,883
No.
Did you birth it?

00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,886
N-No, I-I bought... Um, you know,

bail my car out.

Do you accept checks?

00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,391
We don't accept checks.

Why?
Because!

00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,595
Checks are annoying.

93
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,929
I have to put it in a ledger,

fill out a ton of paperwork.

95
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700

Hi. Hello.

120
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,071
I would love to...
cash this... here check.

121
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,172
Okay.
If I may?

122
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,085
Thank you.
Name on the account, please.

123
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,543
Yes, it's Nora,
N-O-R-A, no "H."

124
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,245
Lin, L-I-N.

125
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,881
Nora Lin, Forley Road, Elmhurst?

126
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,216
That is correct, yes.

127
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,552
It says here you're dead.

128
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,187
Sorry, what?!

129
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,666
The bank automatically
closes accounts

130
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,368
that have been
inactive for two years.

131
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,092
We assume you died.
No.

132
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,562
No, no. No.
I am... I am alive!

133
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,607
Here's what I can do.

134
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,343
If you want to
reopen your account,

135
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,178
I just need a form
of identification.

136
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,535
Yes. Actually, I can
accommodate with that.

137
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,872
Okay, here we go, that's...

138
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,408
Yes.
Thank you.

139
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,210
This is expired.

140
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,411
Where does it say that?

141
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,912
No, no.

142
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,425
Because this license is expired,

143
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,460
I'm legally obligated
to do this.

144
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,883
Oh. Oh. Oh!

145
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,518
Oh!

146
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,855
Oh... Do you have another
form of identification?

147
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,290
Do you know your
social security number?

148
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,126
Yes!
Yes, I know it.

149
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,261
Um, it's 1-8...

150
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,931
hundred, 5-7-9-6-8-5-9.

151
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,234
Okay, that's too many numbers.

152
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,769
Why do I even need
a bank account?

153
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,148
Well, for starters,
to build up your credit,

154
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,449
apply for a loan, buy a house

155
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,251
and get a mortgage,
not to mention

156
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,053
set up a basic
investment portfolio

157
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,755
and formulate a retirement plan.

158
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,745
But without proper
identification,

159
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,615
I can't verify that a...

160
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,284
Nora Lin actually exists.

161
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,752
Sorry.

162
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,257
Hey.

163
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,591
What if you asked me something

I literally know
nothing about you.

166
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,742
So, I can't cash this check?

167
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,999
Nope.

168
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:18,069
I... look like
a blow-up doll!

169
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,905

I had a question

00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,719
about your, um...
fake IDs.

254
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,221
Your fake IDs.

255
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,223
Is there a
special discount, say,

256
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,592
if I wanted to put, like,
my real information on it?

257

Wait over there!

258
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,802
Oh, man.

259
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,138
So many kids and their fake IDs.

260
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,806
The line is so long.

261
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,876
Actually, that's my bad.
I'm waiting for six IDs.

262
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,778
Six IDs for what?

263
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,980
Oh, for focus groups.
Yeah.

264
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,226
Do you know
what focus groups are?

265
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,228
No. They're groups
where you get paid

266
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,886
to test products before
they go on the market.

267
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,232
Uh-huh.
It's amazing,

268
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,400
and they're always looking
for, like, different demos.

269
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,158
That's inside business
for "demographics."

270
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,071

It's like...

277
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,149
That's how the government
keeps tabs on you.

278
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,806
You don't need checks.

279

You know what?

282
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,423
You should do
a focus group or two.

283
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,757
I think you'd be amazing at it

00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,681
Yeah, I became a Rockefeller,
um, through marriage, obviously.

325
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,749
Yeah, and you know what?

Hi, there.
Hi.

344
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,136
How are ya?
How are you?

345
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,492
Lolo Chen and Nina Winn

346
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,072
here for the Pillow
Princess focus group.

347
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,096
Okay.

348
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,031
Excuse me.

349
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,002
God! We are such
a good team.

350
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,303
We are.

351
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,083
God, I hop... I hope
they have water on this one

352
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,140
'cause I ate so many
Saltines at that last one...

353
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,643
Yeah. my tongue swelled up
to, like, a raisin.

354
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,922
Oh, I thought that's just, like,

355
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,413
what, like, Asian girls'
tongues look like.

356
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,514
No.

357
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,127
I don't know.
What am I, Dr. Oz?

358
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,485
I think you're actually

359
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,320
an enhanced version
of Meghan Markle.

360
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,500
This is amazing.
I'm gonna write a memoir about this.

361
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,458
I'd love to be involved somehow.

362
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,371
Could you be my ghostwriter?

363
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,594
Yeah!

364
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,631
But, um... don't make it
too spooky, you know?

365
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,100
Oh, shit!
Stay right there!

366
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,701
Hey!
Oh, hell, no!

367
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,869
Oh!
Oh, hell, no!

368
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,304
Oh, no!
No!

369
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,973
Help us! Go!
Oh!

370
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,375
Whoa! I can't run!

371
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,410
Nope. Nope, nope, nope.
Fine!

372
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,381
So, Nora, you want to tell us

373
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,327
how long you've been
working with Margaret?

374
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,551
Who is Margaret?

375
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,724
Oh. Oh!
Oh!

376
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,826
Oh.

377
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,862
I do know her.
Yes, I do.

378
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,964
I do know her.
Um...

379
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,999
I-I guess I never got her name.

380
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,068
How long have the two of
you been partners?

381
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,071
Partners? I mean...
it was like one kiss.

382
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,472
Real quick, no tongue.

383
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,808
This is Margaret
Katherine Willincotty.

384
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,410
She's a professional
scam artist,

385
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,479
wanted by the FBI in
four states for fraud,

386
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,548
embezzlement,
money laundering...

387
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,417
No.
No, no, no. No.

388
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,720
No, I... she was...
She seemed real nice.

389
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,068
I met her in line gettin'
fake IDs, all right?

390
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,670
I was in line to get fake IDs

391
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,893
and she was all like,

392
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,928
"I can't tell if
you're 12 or 47."

393
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,708
And I took that as a compliment.

394
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:09,067
So, you weren't in Nashville,
Tennessee on April 23rd?

395
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:12,103
No, no. I've never
left the Tri-State area.

396
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,738
I can believe that.

397
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,876
I just, um...

398
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,845
I just wanted to
make some money.

399
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,848
Wanted to bail my car
out of car jail

400
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,517
and take my grandma to dinner.

401
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,853
I really want to
call her right now.

402
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,192
She's no criminal.
She's nobody.

403
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,695
I heard that.

404
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,064
Okay.
This is depressing.

405
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,703
It's really interesting.

406
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,705
That prostitute with one hand,

407
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,807
I'm glad it didn't
ruin her career.

408
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,542
Yeah.

409
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,411
Grandma, I'm sorry.

410
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,881
Aww.
Just like a sad nobody.

411
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,084
What?! No, no.
Over here, sit down.

412
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,623
You know, it's just...

413
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,925
There are all these things
that I don't know about,

414
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:12,263
and, um... I-I don't
want to get left behind.

415
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,399
Oh, bow-bow.

416
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,068
You were born
the Year of the Monkey.

417
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,171
The monkey is stubborn.

418
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,107
If the monkey
had asked for help,

419
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,744
she would have known that I
have your social security card.

420
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,157
You have my social
security card?

421
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:31,582
Oh, yes! I keep it in
my business box.

422
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,095
I also have a business box, too.

423
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,587
Yes, I know but,
uh, mine is better.

424
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,690
It has documents of
actual purpose inside.

425
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,693
Grandma, I'm sorry that
we weren't able to go

426
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,995
to jazz club rough trade.

427
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,064
Oh, that's okay.

428
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,934
God, you must be
so disappointed.

429
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,335
No, bow-bow.

430
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,172
You could never disappoint me.

431
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:58,109
You are the "Magic:
The Gathering" champion.

432
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,645
Oh, I remember that game
like it was yesterday.

433
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,948
Lord of Eiganjo.
My opponent was like,

434
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,284
"Ooh, ooh no.
Got a Glitterfang."

435
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,286
A what?
Nope!

436
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,189
Because my... my Gibbering Kami
as like do-do-do-do-doo.

437
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,035
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
We brought the whole house down.

438
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,525
Man, he shit his pants.

439
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,800

Go! Go! ♪

440
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,836

441
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,639
Hello.

442
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,341
Hi.
Remember me?

443
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,177
Um, I would like to reopen
my bank account, please.

444
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,880
As you will find here,
I have my birth certificate.

445
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,048
Yes, I was born.

446
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,683
Great.
Social security card, right?

447
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,062
There ya go. All right. Yeah.

448
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,586
Me in elementary school
as a baby.

449
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,832
I went to school when
I was a baby.

450
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,322
Huh.
Yeah.

451
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,534
Actually, we're good
with the IDs.

452
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,724
And, uh, this check here,

453
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,093
that I would love to cash
after I reopen my account.

454
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,696
Thank you very much.

455
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,765
I'm a very important
customer here.

456
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,235
Don't mess with me.
I know people.

457
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,615
I'll... I'll get that taken
care of right away, Mrs. Lin.

458
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,140
Yeah.

459
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,877
Whoa, Grandma, that was...
You're intense.

460
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,289
Uh, Miss Lin.

461
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,547
Your account has been
reactivated

462
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,949
and the check has been deposited.
Cool.

463
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,263
And, because you're technically
opening a new account,

464
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,688
I can offer you
a $25 signing bonus.

465
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,524
I would love that.
Thank you.

466
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,926
Uh, would you like it
deposited into the account?

467
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,227
In cash, please!

468
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,463
Because I would like to use it

469
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,264
to take my grandma to dinner.

470
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,200
Oh, Nora.
You don't have to.

471
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,269
I want to.
Here you go.

472
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,372
I want crispy bills for
my granddaughter,

473
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,542
None of that wrinkly shit that
you pull out of your asshole.

474
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,544
Okay.

475
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,557
Pleasure
doing business with you.

476
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,781
You too, Mrs. Lin.
Always a pleasure.

477
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,416
Bye.

478
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,930
Ahh...
cheers to Nora

479
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,767
for getting her car back.

480
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,613
You know, I actually
enjoyed doing focus groups

481
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,571
and I-I think that
a part of me was...

482
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:07,939
actually pretty good at it.

483
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,074
Yes, you were!

484
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,542
Proud of you.

485
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,978
Thanks, Grandma.
S-speaking of,

486
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,547
what do you think of your,
uh, beef noodle?

487
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,649
You really want to know?

488
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,552
Yeah, a-and expand
on it as well.

489
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:24,589
Well, this looks like spaghetti.

490
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,592
It looks like what
the white people did

491
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:31,762
when they went and traveled the
Silk Road next to the Chinese,

492
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,798
who were so trusting and giving

493
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,933
and sharing their recipe.

494
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,969
And then they come home,
and they put

495
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,104
some stupid tomato
sauce on it and...

496
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,317
You'd be great at focus groups

497
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,818
if you were just, like,
a little less racist.

498
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,308
What racist?
Wha-what do you mean?

499
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,454
What?
What racist?

500
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,089
You're not racist.
No, I'm not racist.

501
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,114
No.
Gee, whiz.

502
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,984
I wish this didn't look
so much like spaghetti.

503
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,852
Anyway, uh,
what a lovely dinner,

504
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,487
and I'm so glad we were
able to eat...

505
00:20:56,522 --> 00:21:04,522
Chinese...
anyway, forget it.

all their families were killed

This is a painting by Claude Monet.

Well, it's not an actual painting.
It's a reproduction.

It's beautiful, isn't it?

Yes. We-- We read about it in the books.

93
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,527
I think you'll find this a bit more
satisfying than reading about it.

Come, Kofun. I'll show you your room.

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,500
They expect us to sleep in these things?

97
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,588
I guess so.

98
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,050
If we're all one big family,
why don't we sleep together?

99
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,678

we're ever gonna be with him again?

I don't know.

107

We just left him on his own...

You were right.

121
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,398
You warned me that sooner or later

122
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:35,445
I would regret supporting
your sister's continued reign.

123
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:47,040
But I doubt even you could have predicted
just how right you'd be.

124
00:11:55,257 --> 00:12:00,429
Each one of these soldiers
lost a parent, child, a sibling, a spouse.

125
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:09,479
Every one of them could become the leader
of the mutiny against her... or us.

126
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,568
If they find out about what she's done...

127
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,571
I fear there'll be no stopping it.

128
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,697
If?

129
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,908
How can it be prevented?

130
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:29,291
The only people here who know the story
are you, me, your witch

131
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,002
and the queen's accomplice,
who is currently under guard.

132
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,962
And the queen herself.

133
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,508
Sooner or later, your men
are gonna want to hear from their queen.

134
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,304
And how do we prevent the story
from coming out then?

135
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,808
She cannot be allowed to emerge
from that building as queen again.

136
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,894
What exactly does that mean?

137
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:53,065
It means there are two outcomes
available to us.

138
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:57,027
Either she emerges having abdicated
the throne willingly,

139
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,907
blessed her sister as her successor
and agreed to be ruled by her...

140
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:06,662
or she does not emerge at all.

141
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,707
She will never give up the throne
no matter what you say to her.

142
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,878
Nothing I can say
would persuade her to do it.

143
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,590
So you will have to try.

144
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,430
You're with Princess Maghra, yes?

145
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,353
The Witchfinder trusts you to guard me.

146
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:35,816
I presume that means you're sworn
either to him or to her.

147
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,943
And I have to assume it's to her,

148
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,655
given the contempt
that he clearly holds for you.

149
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,407
You should be quiet now.

150
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:50,205
Just yesterday I was property
to the most brutal of men.

151
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,876
I acquiesced because it was better
than the alternative...

152
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,673
right up to the moment when it wasn't.

153
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,636
What is it exactly that you owe her?

154
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,681
Huh? Your loyalty perhaps.

155
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,599
But your obedience,

156
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,103
your future, your life?

157
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,023
How can that be?

158
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:23,822
The queen has made it clear what
I stand to gain if I solve this problem.

159
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,991
Let me make it clear to you

160
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:30,370
what you stand to gain
if you help me solve it.

161
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,917
It's good to be lieutenant to a princess,

162
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:42,257
but it's so much better
to be lieutenant to a queen.

00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,594
What's this?

165
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,305
Read it.

166
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,734
There was a time, before all this,

167
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:46,488
where you could still be counted on
to see reason.

168
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,743
I remember that version of my sister.

169
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:57,374
And I'm here in the hopes
that she still exists within you.

170
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,713
And that she'll accept
the reality of her situation

171
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,924
and do the sensible thing.

172
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,928
[gasps]

173
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,098
"Abdicate the throne."

174
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:19,021
Affix your seal. Endorse it.

175
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:24,609
Read it to the men, today, right now.

176
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:32,868
And accept its result that you will live
under my rule as queen.

177
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,414
What a fantasy this must have been.

178
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:42,878
Walking in here, thinking I might
actually do this for you.

179
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,256
For me?

180
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,263
Do it. Don't do it.

181
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:58,101
I offer this to you out of mercy
and for the sake of our father's memory.

182
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,313
Whether you choose
to accept it or not is your choice.

183
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,989
But it isn't my choice, Maghra.

184
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,284
You know that.

185
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,416
It's just not something
that can be bargained away.

186
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,505
Negotiated under duress to save my life

187
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,508
or to impart
some longed-for meaning to yours.

188
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,221
Only the gods decide who's king or queen.

189
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,140
And when they do, Death must be a witness,

190
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:42,437
or there is no succession,
no majesty, no legitimacy.

191
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,732
Just a petty lie agreed upon
by petty people.

192
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,153
If you want my divinity...

193
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,408
one of you must have the courage
to pick up a knife and come take it.

194
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,704
God's law, God's voice, God's words.

195
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,999
It's amazing how they all just align

196
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,711
with whatever it is
that you want at any given moment.

197
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:11,425
It is fitting then that you'll meet
your end in a place like this,

198
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,885
declaring God's will to be on your side

199
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,179
as misfortune strips you
of everything and anything

200
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,391
that you once laid claim to bit by bit.

201
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,353
The offer to abdicate stands.

202
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,483
Do it, don't do it.

203
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,069
It's entirely up to you.

204
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,378
[children shouting]

205
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,843
[children giggling]

206
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,480
Get any sleep?

207
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,649
Not really.

208
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,400
I can imagine.

209
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,611
You've left behind everything
you've ever known.

210
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,989
It's natural to feel a bit lost.

211
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,576
But I promise you, the opposite is true.

212
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,578
[children laughing]

213
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,121
You're with your family now.

214
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,125
Come on. I'll show you around.

215
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,795
This is where we study every day.

216
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,046
A pencil?

217
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,256
We all have so much to learn.

218
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,383
Right?

219
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,096
And here we are, the librarium.

220
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,598
[chuckles]

221
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,017
Took me almost ten years
to get all these books in here.

222
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,438
Science, mathematics, medicine,

223
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:54,611
history, geography, engineering,
literature.

224
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,408
Our ancestors were very meticulous
when it came to documenting

225
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,077
their knowledge and accomplishments
for posterity.

226
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,539
It's almost as if they knew
we would one day need them.

227
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,545
There is so much I'd like to share
with you, this blessing that we have.

228
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:18,719
This blessing can often feel
like a curse, can't it?

229
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,723
Because every day,
we see all the wasted potential

230
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,350
in this world and in ourselves.

231
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:26,852
And you feel alone.

232
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,146
Really?

233
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,982
Kofun, you know what I mean.

234
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:39,323
We've had to hide all of these things
that we can do from everyone.

235
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,199
Exactly.

236
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,829
I've spent most of my life traveling,
searching for others like me.

237
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,416
And I've crossed the Trivantes
all the way to the Western Badlands.

238
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,378
And west of the Payan
all the way to the Atlantic.

239
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,922
I have never found a sighted person.

240
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,466
You've seen the ocean?

241
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,593
I've swum in it.

242
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,179
So, why did you come back?

243
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,389
To build this place.

244
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,641
A citadel of knowledge

245
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,813
and a sanctuary where we could
safely gather and learn.

246
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:17,694
Educating ourselves and eventually others
of the sciences of our forefathers.

247
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,489
But you said you never found
another person with sight.

248
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,785
I didn't. So, I made you.

249
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,161
Are we all your children?

250
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,458
Yes. You, Kofun,

251
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,419
Oloman, Sheva.

252
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,963
Everyone except the two little ones.

253
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,632
They are Oloman's.

254
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,425
And their mothers?

255
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,637
They love their mothers dearly
as you love yours.

256
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,847
And there is always a place for her here.

257
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,224
Our mother is dead.

258
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,977
-What?
-She was killed by the Witchfinders.

259
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,311
Oh.

260
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,856
I am very sorry to hear that.

261
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,734
I was quite fond of her.

262
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,070
Can't have been that fond of her.
You left her alone.

263
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,947
-Kofun.
-Pregnant with your children.

264
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,700
You left us alone our entire lives.

265
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,995
Did you not want to know us?

266
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,580
Who we were, what we were like?

267
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,667
You have every right to be upset.

268
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,295
You know, I would be lying
if I said I didn't regret

269
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,423
the way I handled some of these matters.

270
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,883
I was young. Often unwise.

271
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,678
Being chosen doesn't make me perfect.

272
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,014
No, far from it.

273
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:31,685
But I was chosen, Kofun.
You must see that.

274
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,022
A sighted baby born to blind parents.

275
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,567
I was born to be a bridge
between this dark world

276
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,277
and a better one to come.

277
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:44,740
We've been given a divine mission.
And we will be remembered.

278
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:48,910
Our names will be spoken
for the rest of human history.

279
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,378
Come on. I'll show you the generator.

280
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,007
[Kofun sighs]

281
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,258
What are you doing?

282
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,053
He doesn't even care that Mom is dead.

283
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,971
Of course he cared.

284
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:11,016
He was clearly upset about it,
but she wasn't his wife.

285
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,018
No, she was just there
to carry his babies.

286
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,980
To carry us, Kofun.
I don't think you're being very fair.

287
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:21,526
What, so he believed that we were chosen
to bring light into the world?

288
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,653
Chosen.

289
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,446
Born.

290
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:30,369
Call it what you like. All I know is that
we've lived our lives in fear until now.

291
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:33,205
Hunted by people
who should really be afraid of us.

292
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,708
Wait, you want to be feared?

293
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,754
I'd rather be feared
than burned as a witch.

294
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,798
[Jerlamarel] Ready?

295
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,764
[fire roaring]

296
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,809
Is that all coal?

297
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:57,562
Yes, we have our own mine
just beyond the fence line.

298
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,982
-[Oloman coughing]
-The Payan lands are rich in coal.

299
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,275
That's how you power the lights?

300
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,236
Yeah. I'll show you.

301
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,238
Oloman.

302
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,281
Morning.

303
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:12,703
The burning of the coal in the boiler
creates steam under pressure.

304
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:17,165
Blows into the turbines which spins
the generator to create electricity.

305
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,085
You built this alone?

306
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,005
Yes. I rebuilt it.

307
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,966
But Oloman, he's the one that learned
how to really make it sing.

308
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,050
[Oloman] Ah.

309
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,803
I just added this.
Pressure release valve.

310
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,014
See, you've got to control the pressure,

311
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,433
or you either end up with none
or way too much.

312
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,685
Either way, no power.

313
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:41,315
Imagine what we can accomplish together
once we grow in numbers.

314
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,859
We'll be able to light entire cities.

315
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,029
What are cities for the blind people
gonna do with all that light?

316
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,864
These cities will be for the sighted.

317
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,867
There's about ten of us.
What about everyone else?

318
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,702
Is your plan just to leave them behind?

319
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,038
No. No, of course not, Kofun.

320
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,541
But make no mistake,
in the natural order of things,

321
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,877
the blind are the aberration, not us.

322
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,421
And soon enough, they will come to us,

323
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,007
asking us to father sighted children.

324
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,010
Children that will need
to be educated in a place like this.

325
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,471
And in the future, other places like this.

326
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:17,059
God, nature, whatever you wish to call it,

327
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,728
has elected to restore vision to humanity.

328
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:23,106
And that responsibility
has been given to us.

329
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,027
-Thank you, Oloman.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,324
Kofun.

331
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,333
I know Jerlamarel
can take some getting used to.

332
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,047
Does he think he's some kind of god?
That we're all gods?

333
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,927
No, not gods,
but the first of a new breed.

334
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:56,056
A returning race of humans
that can help realize our true potential

335
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,643
after living like frightened animals
in the darkness for 500 years.

336
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,604
Frightened animals?

337
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,234
I hope that you meet
my real father one day.

338
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,154
Look, I get it, Kofun.

339
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,657
It wasn't any easier for me
when I first got here.

340
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,160
But what you don't realize is that
even though you can see,

341
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,621
you've been living out there
in the darkness your whole life.

342
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,874
Just give it some time.

343
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:26,378
Jerlamarel may not have raised us,
but he made us with purpose.

344
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,172
-To bring light back into the world.
-That's right.

345
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,593
You can start by taking this shovel.

346
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,443
[woman]
The Witchfinders murdered your people.

347
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,695
We grieve for them.

348
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,490
Here, too, the Valeyas have known
the pain of their souls.

349
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:59,661
But my people worry that you
may lead Tamacti Jun back to us.

350
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:05,959
Our child is badly hurt
and in need of healers.

351
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,713
She won't last a day in the wild.

352
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:13,008
Would you turn her away?

353
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,888
You may leave the girl.

354
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,639
[grunts]

355
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:22,809
But you two must agree to make tracks
leading away from here.

356
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,853
You have my word.

357
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:29,024
Brave, Bow Lion. [sniffles]

358
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,568
Where will you go?

359
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,403
God Flame knows.

360
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:38,659
But the Valeya will be good to you.

361
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,373
You must make a life for yourself here.

362
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:49,961
There's nothing for you out there,
Bow Lion.

363
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,220
Your mother is in your spirit.

364
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,429
[sobs]

365
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:05,936
I dream a long life for you, dear girl.

366
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,939
With many journeys yet to come.

367
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,151
-Chet-chet.
-Chet-chet-chet.

368
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,128
My brave lion.

369
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,884
I stand with Baba.

370
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,026
[Baba Voss] We'll never forget you, Bow.

371
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:01,241
[Paris]
It's just you and me now, you big lump.

372
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,662
What gods did you anger to deserve this?

373
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:15,213
My mother taught me very sad days
last no longer than very happy days.

374
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:17,716
She a presage too?

375
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:22,346
-No. She liked to get drunk.
-Oh.

376
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,432
Which makes the lesson
no less valuable on that account.

377
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,310
It's starting to get cold.

378
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,522
We should start a fire.
I'll find something to kill.

379
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,963
[gate door closes]

380
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:13,230
Colonel. This is a surprise.

381
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:15,232
Is it?

382
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,609
I would think
you would've been expecting me

383
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,695
with the arrival of Baba Voss' children.

384
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,197
In fact, I was a little concerned
you didn't contact me

385
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,199
as you promised the general.

386
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,160
Did you think my archers
wouldn't send word?

387
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:30,247
[Jerlamarel] I was getting around to it.
It's been a little hectic around here.

388
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,833
[colonel] Well, we're here now.
Where are my prisoners?

389
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,381
[Jerlamarel] Tell me, why is the general
so fixated on these children specifically?

390
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,675
[colonel] It's my job
to follow the general's orders,

391
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,136
not to question them,
not to understand them.

392
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,930
You might wanna consider that.

393
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:52,185
Well, unlike you, I do not work
for the general. We're partners.

394
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,270
[scoffs]

395
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,397
Tell yourself that if it helps.

396
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:04,364
Are you absolutely certain these are
Baba Voss' children we're getting?

397
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:08,785
It's a long way to Trivantes
and we wouldn't want any mistakes.

398
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,542
You are getting his daughter, Haniwa.

399
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,794
-[colonel] And the son?
-No.

400
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,256
[staff clinking]

401
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:24,009
[colonel]
Are we going to have a problem here?

402
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,806
No problem at all.
As long as the boy stays here.

403
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,730
Might I remind you, my family and I
are armed and you are outnumbered.

404
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,106
[chuckles]

405
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,235
Well, then,
I guess the girl will have to do.

406
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,614
Kofun?

407
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,408
You don't have to sneak around.

408
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:51,286
They're talking about us.
Why are they talking about us?

409
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,412
What?

410
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,487
[gasps]

Let me out!

Open the door! Open the door!

425
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:48,654
Go.

Giddyap.

428
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,121
You all right?

429
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:02,376
She was my daughter. Your sister.

430
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:06,380
I just-- I didn't see another way.

431
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:09,633
It's a shame.
She had such great potential.

432
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,387
What about Kofun?

433
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:15,972
What did he see?

434
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:17,974
Enough.

435
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,357
I waited so long for these two.

436
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,859
It's very upsetting.

437
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,787
[Tamacti Jun] You did what you could.

438
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:41,915
Not enough.

439
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:47,379
More than she would've done for you
if the roles were reversed.

440
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,966
Are you certain about that?

441
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,093
Yes. Very.

442
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,472
And, though maybe not at this moment,

443
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,517
on some level, so are you.

444
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:06,148
You are not to blame.

445
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,527
And if your father was here, he'd agree.

446
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:16,658
I'll make sure to be quick.

You have been a fixture in my life
for as long as I can remember.

450
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:52,027
It'll be nearly unthinkable
not having your counsel

451
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,571
in whatever future life
I'm about to step into.

452
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,079
I've made some additional remarks.

453
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,457
Assuming they have my sister's blessing,

454
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,126
I'll read them to the troops
to begin the transition.

455
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,551

Thank you for your service.

[Maghra] Sibeth, no.

What have you done?

469
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:09,980
Maghra, once a dog bites,

470
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,274
no matter how loyal
you remember him once being,

471
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,027
no matter your fondness for him,
he must be put down.

472
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,987
-You've killed us both.
-[scoffs] Hardly.

473
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,239
His army waits outside,
and when they find out--

474
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:21,408
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not his.

475
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,076
He just borrowed it.

476
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,162
And they will hear the truth,

477
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:30,208
that his guilt over the injuries
I sustained was simply too great to go on.

478
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,421
He took his own life
according to the Old Way.

479
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,716
A loyal servant to the end.

480
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:42,262
Obviously, if you and I
were to tell conflicting stories,

481
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,805
it would only cloud that truth.

482
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:46,975
Confusion would set in, chaos, and then,
yes, we probably both lose our heads.

00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,229
Or we walk out of here together

484
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:53,732
and deliver the message,
in which I'll explain

485
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:58,278
that in this time of crisis, I will lead
my soldiers with my sister at my side.

486
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,990
The first time in my reign
that I'll rule with her counsel.

487
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,413
Don't be frightened.

488
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,874
I'm here.

489
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,377
I am right here.

490
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,172
[breathes shakily]

491
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,091
So much is about to change.

00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,736
Get off! Let go! Go!

495
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:41,822
Calm down, Kofun.

496
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,865
What did you do with my sister?

497
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,117
Your sister is fine.

498
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,910
You gave her to the Trivantians.

499
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,746
The Trivantians are not the monsters
you were raised to fear.

500
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,748
If it was not for my partnership
with them,

501
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:55,752
this place, my family, would all have
been killed long ago by the queen.

502
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,756
With our vision and the Trivantian army,

503
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,010
we can conquer the queen once and for all.

504
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,886
That will take years,

505
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:09,224
but soon we will control the most
powerful military on the continent.

506
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:13,478
We will no longer be hunted like dogs,
but seen as gods.

507
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,315
But it will take a sacrifice.

508
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,233
Huh?

509
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,489
Kofun, my son. I--

510
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:28,201
I'm not your son, you crazy fuck!

511
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,620
Shut your mouth.

512
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,499
You do not deserve the blessings
you've been given.

513
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:55,687
Take him out the back way.
I do not want the children to see him.

514
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,236
I'm very sorry.

515
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,490
You'll be taken to the outskirts
of the facility, then you're free to go.

516
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,452
What about my sister?

00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:13,997

[door slams]

Take everyone downstairs
and organize the larder.

Await my call.

I do not want the children to hear him.

You're not hiding from me, are you?

00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,046
Do you see me?

538
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,009
'Cause I smell you.

539
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:36,598
Hiding in your filth like a fucking rat.

540
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,647
Is this your House of Enlightenment?

541
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,025
There's no trees.

542
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:50,529
No air.

543
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:56,493
Just the putrid stench of things rotting.

544
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:05,335
Your vision and all your knowledge
is a disease that wiped out your kind.

545
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,254
But you feel nothing.

You fools know nothing.

00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,681
Come on out and fight me
like a fucking man, you coward.

[Jerlamarel]
Baba Voss. It doesn't need to be this way.

549
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:31,695
You gave my baby girl to the Trivantians.

550
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,989
It's not my fault. It's yours.

551

because he thinks she's your daughter.

Your brother.

558
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:57,804
And you just gave her to him?

559
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,556
I had no choice.

560
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,478
What kind of man waits 17 years
to meet his children only to betray them?

I am fighting for the entire human race!
Sacrifices must be made!

They're my children. You hurt them!

They are not your children.

564

They were made to fulfill a destiny
you couldn't possibly understand.

Is that right?

It's a weapon of the ancients.

Much more efficient
than your arrows and swords.

I know what a gun is.

You live in a world of perpetual darkness.

He was the last of his kind.

A soldier with the honor to recognize...

630

that having failed his queen, his kingdom,

631

his gods, and himself...

632
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:06,715
he had no choice
but to take a soldier's death,

633
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:11,303
which demands a release
in the traditional manner.

to live up to his noble sacrifice.

00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:34,868
So we forge ahead.

We will build a new world for ourselves.

00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,429
[shouting in foreign language]

650
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:47,941
That was interesting.

651
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,865
A world with no Witchfinders
would mean a world with no witches.

652
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,700
We're gonna find my family.

653
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,119
That's not up for discussion.

654
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:05,125
And when we do, I will not have them
labeled as fugitives by our army.

655
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:08,045
"Our" army?

656
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:10,130
Isn't it?

657
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,886
So, the road ahead
leads to a sighted kingdom.

658
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:19,848
I suppose I shall need a sighted king

659
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:23,018
in such a world
to give me sighted children.

660
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:27,939
Having been rejected by Jerlamarel once,

661
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,567
you can understand
why I'd not make the overture again.

662
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:38,158
What are you suggesting?

663
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,703
Tell me more about your son.

664
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:00,806
Chet-chet.

665
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:56,463
What do you see, my boy?

666
00:54:58,256 --> 00:55:00,258
Towers of God bone.

667
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:03,345
More than I've ever seen in my life.

668
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:05,931
There's smoke.

669
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:10,602
Paris.

670
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,813
She's here.

671
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:23,824
[Baba Voss] Let's go get your sister.

672
00:55:24,305 --> 00:56:24,596

Synced by

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,104
Ahmed Hamdy

4
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,831
Dorian the Elder once said...

5
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:57,794
"The most unsettling sound
in the human experience is silence...

6
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,005
when nature begs for wailing."

7
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:08,304
Silence in a birth, silence in a moment
of devastating heartbreak.

8
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,976
Silence during the infliction
of such extreme pain.

9
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,652
You've done yourself proud.

10
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,489
Your defiance is powerful.

11
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,578
Some men in my position
might find themselves affected by it...

12
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:37,792
suddenly fighting the onset of pity,
their resolve weakened...

13
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,004
and so on, and so on.

14
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:44,841
Just to be clear, those men are cowards.

15
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,846
There's a reason why I am
in this position, and they aren't.

16
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:53,475
And eight fingers from now...

17
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:57,354
we start on toes.

18
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,030
I will do this for days
until you tell me where my queen is.

19
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,930
I have the destination
where the queen is being held.

20
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,182
They won't be expecting us.

21
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:36,309
It's days from here at a quick pace.

22
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:39,062
The company is already preparing
to depart.

23
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:42,524
There's only a few things
that we need to resolve before then.

24
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:43,608
"Resolve"?

25
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:46,486
First, the boy.

26
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,408
I'm grateful he aided in the capture
of the two Shadows out there.

27
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,077
Now...

28
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,249
I'd like to know how he did it.

29
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,712
He's not your son.

30
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:07,007
That much was clear
the moment he was brought to you.

31
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,137
But he has vision too, doesn't he?

32
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,141
Yes.

33
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,979
Another child of Jerlamarel's...

34
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,151
with another woman.

35
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,781
You deserved more than that.

36
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,535
None of that is the boy's fault,
and you'd be nowhere without him.

37
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:39,456
I'm the Witchfinder, Maghra, and there
is one sitting in my tent as we speak!

38
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,542
Fault has nothing to do with it.
I can't simply ignore who he is.

39
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,960
Of course you can!

40
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:46,504
He's with me.

41
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:50,592
He has my protection.
And I'm the daughter of the king.

42
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:53,845
What else do you wanna resolve?

43
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,349
Whether he comes with us.

44
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,225
"Comes with us"?

45
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,728
I'm moving this army.
I cannot leave you behind.

46
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:04,939
Absolutely not.
I am not leaving until my family is found.

47
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:07,168
It's been days,
and my scouts have found no signs of them.

48
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,611
- You promised me!
- I promised to search.

49
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:11,654
And from where I stand,
that promise is kept.

50
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,050
Well, then you leave some of your men
behind. I will continue to search.

51
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,451
I have no choice in this matter,
and neither do you.

52
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:19,871
Boy...

53
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:28,171
I have forgotten more about killing
than you will ever know.

54
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,635
If you think because you have sight
that that will even the odds between us...

55
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,638
think again.

56
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,187
It's all right.

57
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:51,528
This place is uninhabited.
There's little danger here.

58
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,655
Just a few men could guarantee my safety.

59
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:58,284
Maghra, the queen is compromised.

60
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:01,621
She may be incapacitated. She may be dead.

61
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,082
We don't know
who is governing the kingdom.

62
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:06,876
We don't know
if anyone is governing the kingdom.

63
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,047
The chaos that preceded your family's rule
was dire.

64
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,218
Countless rivalries,
grievances and vendettas.

65
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,139
Without a Kane on the throne to rule,
they will rear their heads again.

66
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:23,518
And you are rightfully the next Kane
in the line of succession.

67
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:30,483
I will leave a contingent behind
to continue looking for your family.

68
00:07:32,193 --> 00:07:33,945
But as far as your presence goes...

69
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,575
this isn't a choice for either of us.

70
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,967
You're in command of the men left behind?

71
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,094
Yes, Your Highness. Four men under me.

72
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,305
Eight would be better.

73
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:02,265
Do it.

74
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:07,354
You understand how important
your charge here is, yes?

75
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:08,938
Yes, ma'am, of course.

76
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:11,566
They're my life.

77
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,151
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:14,004
You must talk to your father.

79
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,673
He doesn't wanna hear anything
I have to say.

80
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,842
That is why you must talk to him.

81
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:23,179
Why me?

82
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:27,684
Haniwa,
it doesn't matter who speaks first.

83
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,602
It is the way forward.

84
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,982
You think it's simple.

85
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:36,109
It is.

86
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:39,112
Break this silence while you can.

87
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,289
Why are we stopping?

88
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,794
We'll camp here for the night.
Your father's gone ahead, scouting.

89
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,092
How far off is it?

90
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,219
How far is what?

91
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,473
Oh, wow.

92
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:21,529
I can't tell if I'm relieved
or if I was hoping we'd never find it.

93
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:27,994
I'll go tell the others.

94
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,690
How does a queen
who never leaves her palace

95
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,944
end up by the side of the road with
nothing but a handmaiden and a driver?

96
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,155
You think someone attempted
to move against her?

97
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,284
I could imagine a number of things.

98
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,329
I'm trying not to.

99
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:13,998
She had enemies.

100
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,042
Comes with the crown.

101
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:18,586
More for some than others.

102
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,590
She's my mother. You know that, don't you?

103
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:29,180
Their faces, their voices,
the way they breathed, even.

104
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:35,228
I was so young when my mother died,
but even then I knew it.

105
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:38,898
The two of them were exactly the same.

106
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,069
So when she died,

107
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:48,533
it felt especially cruel
that every time my sister was nearby...

108
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:54,122
to hear her, to smell her, to touch her...

109
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,711
suddenly,
I'd be mourning my mother all over again.

110
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:04,966
I imagine it was no different
to my father.

111
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,346
I imagine that's why he could never
bring himself to take away the one thing

112
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,563
her birthright.

113
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:47,717
I brought food for her, as you asked.

114
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:54,057
You can call her what she is.
There is no power or magic in it here.

115
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:58,144
I brought food for the queen,
as you asked.

116
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,270
Very well.

117
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,494
Still not up to your standards, huh?

118
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:21,835
I had heard stories of your stubbornness,
your self-destructiveness, even.

119
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,881
When I first heard them, they seemed
outlandish to me, not to be trusted.

120
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:28,133
But now...

121
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,556
Perhaps you could confirm
or deny a few of them for me.

122
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:39,310
I heard you killed lovers
for snoring in their sleep.

123
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:42,856
Servants,
because you didn't like their smell.

124
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,526
You severed the tongues of young maiden

125
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,988
because they didn't... please you

126
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,990
fast enough.

127
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:58,413
Any of these you'd care to dispute,
or perhaps even claim credit for?

128
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,387
You know the rules.

129
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:18,933
The bell rings, and how do we know
you aren't trying to escape?

130
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,062
The bell rings, and we must respond.

131
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:26,149
The bell rings,
and you will suffer for it.

132
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,111
Until your ransom is paid,

133
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:34,449
you are an asset
that I intend to be very careful with.

134
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,122
So why don't you just relax?

135
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:45,710
Let us continue our conversation,
shall we?

136
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:53,301
Please know, inasmuch as I found
those stories entertaining...

137
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:59,891
the one that really interests me
involves a particular lover...

138
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,270
who broke your heart and then left you.

139
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,434
Haniwa.

140
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:09,854
What I said before...

141
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:11,231
I know.

142
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,358
- It's just because...
- It's okay.

143
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,777
- In the cave...
- I understand.

144
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,238
You sure?

145
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:36,464
Yeah.

146
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:50,020
What do you think we're headed towards?

147
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:57,110
Honestly, I think you need to manage
your expectations.

148
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:01,865
To set aside what we know of him, okay?

149
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,283
Set aside the fact
that he left his child to be abused

150
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,594
until he turned into a monster.

151
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,370
- We don't really know what actually happ...
- Mom didn't want this.

152
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,378
I have no memory of her talking about him
without sounding sad.

153
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:20,341
I have no memory of her talking about
any of this without warning us against it.

154
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:26,139
I mean, that has to have been
for a reason, Haniwa.

155
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:37,609
Don't you think it's strange that
she never told us what that reason was?

156
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:43,990
I don't know...

157
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,495
what was... in Mama's head.

158
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:55,126
But I do know that she loved him.

159
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,298
And there must be a reason for that.

160
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,280
You heard it in your sleep.

161
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,742
Is that an owl?

162
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,747
Not an owl. That is a man.

163
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:37,669
We're in the Badlands, Baba.
Lawless land.

164
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:41,214
And you are not well.

165
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:42,924
I'm fine.

166
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,427
Do the children know?

167
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:48,471
There's no need for them to know.

168
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,599
They always know more than you think.

169
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,526
Did Haniwa speak to you?

170
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,486
Why?

171
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:06,448
She's holding something...

172
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,784
something that she cannot give voice to...

173
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:12,162
and it frightens her.

174
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:15,623
Well, she's mourning.

175
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,751
Ah, so is Kofun.

176
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:21,963
But he's not gripped by the same darkness.

177
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:28,386
They're different.
They need different things at this moment.

178
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:31,931
I would think you of all people
would understand what she needs.

179
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:33,224
What do you mean?

180
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:39,564
You remember when I first came to you?

181
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,818
The rage, and how destructive I was?

182
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,030
Because I was afraid.

183
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:50,075
Afraid to trust you...

184
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:55,038
afraid to believe that I actually escaped
and that it was true.

185
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,750
And do you remember
what you told me when I did?

186
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:03,505
I told you if you broke any more
of my things,

187
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:05,590
I would kill you in your sleep.

188
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:07,801
Yes. But after that...

189
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,054
do you remember what you did?

190
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:19,145
You sat and you stayed for as long as
it took me to be able to breathe again.

191
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:25,110
You stayed so that I would know
I was not alone.

192
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,948
Haniwa's lost.

193
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:33,702
She's facing an uncertain future...

194
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,248
a lost mother, and a new father.

195
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,712
But I will give her the space she needs.

196
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:46,923
And like you, I'll make sure
that she knows she's not alone.

197
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:11,948
Paris, what is it?

198
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:18,788
Lavender no more.

199
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,916
I taste death.

200
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,976
It's days, it's maybe weeks.

201
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,563
It's human, isn't it?

202
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:53,948
Oh...

203
00:22:58,661 --> 00:22:59,662
Oh.

204
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:21,393
"A new world lies beyond."

205
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:26,898
A new god resides within.

206
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,614
Enter, and be seen.

207
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:37,701
Enter, and be judged.

208
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,705
Enter, and find death.

209
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,625
"Enter, and be seen."

210
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:48,837
Jerlamarel.

211
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,882
He's lost his fucking mind.

212
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,551
Perhaps not.

213
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:57,804
Maybe... Maybe this is what happens

214
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:01,516
when your work is important
and you don't want visitors.

215
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,767
Paris, I don't know.

216
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:08,231
Oh, you must know now how dangerous
it is to be sighted in this world.

217
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:12,277
The lengths one must go to
to keep it at bay.

218
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,945
I agree with Paris.

219
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:21,077
We didn't come this far just to turn
around because of something like this.

220
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:24,956
I want both of you to know
what we set out to know.

221
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,709
I want to know
what we all sacrificed so much for.

222
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:32,797
I want to know
what I sacrificed my wife for.

223
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:35,800
I need to know it.

224
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,971
Come.

225
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,933
At least we know
we're going the right way.

226
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:49,773
Kofun.

227
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,570
We forge ahead.

228
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,870
<i>I saw four guards.</i>

229
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,083
One here, by the entrance.

230
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,043
Two more...

231
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:55,588
patrolling between
the rows of silk workers.

232
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,091
And another by the second window.

233
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:02,387
The workers are all stationary, then?
Only the guards are walking?

234
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,057
Yes. And they tap their staffs
to announce their presence.

235
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:08,768
What kind of shoes are the guards wearing?

236
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,981
What kind of shoes?
Are they leather? Are they wood?

237
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,941
Leather, I think.

238
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:18,153
And what about the queen?
Do you know where she is?

239
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:22,115
I don't know what the queen looks like.

240
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:26,244
There was a bloodied woman here,
in the back.

241
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:28,163
Bloodied? Is she alive?

242
00:26:28,246 --> 00:26:29,247
I don't know.

243
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:33,793
So, you're certain?
Four guards and a space in between them?

244
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:35,128
That's what I saw.

245
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,130
That's what you saw.

246
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:39,299
As if vision absolves you
from being wrong.

247
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:41,384
You have enough men
to overwhelm them, don't you?

248
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:44,763
The moment they hear any of us,
the moment they sense us,

249
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:47,015
the moment an alarm is given,
this is over.

250
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:48,475
The only way to reach her alive

251
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:50,995
is for there to be no guards left
by the time they know we're here.

252
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,063
One man must do it, one at a time.

253
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:55,815
I'll do it. I can get them all.

254
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:59,194
I remember asking for your eyes, witch,
not your opinion.

255
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,197
The future of the kingdom is at stake.

256
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,699
I've relied upon you
as far as I'm willing.

257
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:07,285
Unless, Maghra, you trust him.

258
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,289
Forget I asked.

259
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:15,794
Marshal a vanguard. Signals, no words.

260
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:19,631
The next man to speak will be me,
when I'm ready to call you in.

261
00:27:19,714 --> 00:27:20,882
If you give no signal?

262
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,634
Then I have failed, the queen is dead.

263
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:24,111
You should burn everything to the ground

264
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:27,055
and take the princess to Kanzua
and see her installed upon the throne.

265
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:28,932
I haven't consented to that.

266
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,434
If it comes down to that,
you won't have to.

267
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,353
Is it going to come down to that?

268
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:34,437
No.

269
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:33,830
Cutter! Cutter! Come over here!

270
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:34,914
Guards.

271
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:37,917
There's an intruder! Someone's here!

272
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:40,003
Up, bitch.

273
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,180
My knife. My knife.

274
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,485
You think I would tell her who I am
without having a plan? Huh?

275
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:22,712
Majesty?

276
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:24,172
The queen is here.

277
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:29,177
Why doesn't she speak?

278
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:32,138
I'm fucking tired.

279
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:37,102
It's all right. You're safe now.

280
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:51,950
How did this happen?

281
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,994
How did they get you?

282
00:29:56,705 --> 00:29:57,997
I had to leave.

283
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,626
Someone moved against you. Who was it?

284
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:04,629
So many.

285
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:10,969
You'll recover soon,
and we'll return to Kanzua.

286
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,973
But first, a healer's coming.

287
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:30,030
She's here.

288
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,899
- Careful.
- Of course.

289
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:29,923
Have we met?

290
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:55,532
I'm sorry this happened to you.

291
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:02,330
You shouldn't leave, Maghra.

292
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,547
Not until you've heard the news.

293
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,844
What news, Your Majesty?

294
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,931
They all moved against me.

295
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,769
Claimed the gods were on their side.

296
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:30,066
And when they failed,
I was left with a choice:

297
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:34,696
to let this heresy stand...

298
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,491
or to answer with one of my own.

299
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:41,703
What does that mean?

300
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,122
You wish to return me to Kanzua?

301
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:47,542
There is no Kanzua.

302
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:55,175
For years, we held power based on
the whim of the machines beneath us.

303
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:59,846
When they chose to work, we were adored.

304
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,266
When they didn't, we weren't.

305
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:09,939
I don't want to be queen
because the machines work.

306
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:15,862
I want to be queen because I am.

307
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:28,792
The gods took the dam.

308
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,755
They destroyed it in a rage

309
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:38,051
and took with it the true heretics.

310
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:42,847
The weak, the selfish, the backward.

311
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:47,602
But they left me.

312
00:33:49,437 --> 00:33:50,647
Only me.

313
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:56,903
You destroyed it.

314
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:04,828
Those soldiers out there...

315
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:12,711
For 20 years, they've done your bidding
on the promise that one day,

316
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:16,589
they will return to their homes,
their families.

317
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,427
Through countless battles...

318
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:24,973
and miseries and horrors,

319
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:28,476
that was what sustained them.

320
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,979
And you just took it all away.

321
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:34,399
I did what needed to be done.

322
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,360
I saved our dynasty.

323
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:41,614
You think I'm gonna go out there

324
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:47,495
and tell my men all their families
were killed to save your dynasty,

325
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:50,874
and they'll just go
wherever I tell them from there?

326
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:53,293
Your men?

327
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:55,879
My men.

328
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,098
And I think they will do as I tell them...

329
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,018
because I am their queen.

330
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,652
I think,
for the first time in a long time...

331
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,573
that's something we should reconsider.

332
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,138
Whoa, whoa.

333
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,223
What?

334
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:50,308
- Why are we stopping?
- Shh.

335
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:52,102
Something doesn't feel right.

336
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,980
- What's ahead?
- It's a mountain pass.

337
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:59,818
- Is there another way around?
- No, not that I can see.

338
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,028
Paris.

339
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:04,155
I sense conflicting things.

340
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:06,199
I dream danger.

341
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,160
But I'm not exactly sure
where the danger lies.

342
00:36:09,244 --> 00:36:11,204
Maybe because there is none.

343
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:12,872
We'll find another way around.

344
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:14,457
We'll lose days.

345
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,936
- I said we find another way around.
- There is nothing here.

346
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,795
Kofun, tell him there's nothing here.

347
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:20,547
Dad, I don't see anything.

348
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:24,884
- I'll go.
- Hey.

349
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:28,430
Kofun, where is the God Flame in the sky?

350
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:30,032
It's already passed behind the mountain.

351
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,641
Why should the sun matter to you?

352
00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:34,144
It doesn't. I'm just trying to figure out

353
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:37,147
how soon it will be dark
and you'll be completely useless.

354
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,273
Baba.

355
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:19,356
Sound traps.

356
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:27,739
Point to them.

357
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:57,268
Yeah.

358
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:59,062
Go.

359
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:23,962
Don't move.

360
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:28,717
There's a bow and arrow. We need it.

361
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:36,558
What are you doing?

362
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:43,606
I can move in silence. You can't.

363
00:39:58,473 --> 00:40:00,850
- Haniwa, no!
- Cease fire!

364
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:05,969
You are Haniwa?

365
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:07,399
Yes.

366
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:11,611
And you who shouted...

367
00:40:13,363 --> 00:40:14,406
what's your name?

368
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:16,908
Kofun.

369
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,868
Children of Jerlamarel,

370
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:22,247
just beyond these trees there is a bridge.

371
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,584
You may pass over that bridge
into the House of Enlightenment.

372
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,089
Is there a healer
in the House of Enlightenment?

373
00:40:31,172 --> 00:40:32,841
You cannot pass.

374
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:35,051
You just told us we could cross.

375
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:39,097
Only the children of Jerlamarel may cross
into the House of Enlightenment.

376
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:42,434
There is only one rule, and that is it.

377
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:46,563
You tell Jerlamarel that we're here.
He'll understand.

378
00:40:47,772 --> 00:40:50,066
Only Kofun and Haniwa may cross.

379
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,151
You listen to me...

380
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:52,527
Boy.

381
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:56,948
There is only one rule, and that is it.

382
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:01,286
You can tell Jerlamarel why his son
and daughter came all this way

383
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:02,579
just to turn back!

384
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:04,164
We're not turning back.

385
00:41:05,582 --> 00:41:07,393
What are you talking about?
We have to turn back.

386
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:09,919
- She needs a healer.
- No. She has Dad and Paris.

387
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:11,504
He can take her to another tribe.

388
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:13,107
What are you talking about?
We're not leaving her here, Haniwa.

389
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,924
She doesn't need all of us.

390
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,343
- We stay together.
- Kofun.

391
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:17,570
- Enough.
- This is crazy.

392
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:18,595
Enough.

393
00:41:18,678 --> 00:41:20,680
Listen to me. Listen to me.

394
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:24,851
Haniwa, Kofun,

395
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:29,522
we have traveled too far,
at too great a cost, to turn back now.

396
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:33,693
I have thought about this
for a long while now.

397
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:37,697
I never wanted to believe it,
but Paris is right.

398
00:41:39,115 --> 00:41:44,079
Every child eventually comes to a bridge
that they must cross alone.

399
00:41:44,162 --> 00:41:46,039
What are you talking about?

400
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,086
The day you were born, I stood on a wall
fighting to protect you,

401
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:53,171
and I have done it every day since.

402
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:56,925
That's what a father does
to protect his children.

403
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:02,389
But a father must also know
when it is time to let his children go

404
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:04,474
so that they might find their own path.

405
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,729
- That time is now.
- No, that's not true.

406
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,733
That's not true.
Haniwa, tell him it's not true.

407
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:15,276
It is true, Kofun.

408
00:42:15,944 --> 00:42:18,738
You and I live
in a different world than him.

409
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:20,782
We always have.

410
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:24,452
We'll never really understand each other.

411
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:26,705
He brought us here knowing that.

412
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:28,748
Why would you do that?

413
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:35,171
Because I'm your father.

414
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,589
Oh, Papa.

415
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:38,717
My baby girl.

416
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:41,136
You are wrong.

417
00:42:43,346 --> 00:42:44,973
We don't live in different worlds.

418
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,684
You and your brother

419
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:50,854
are the only world that I have lived in
since the day you were born.

420
00:42:52,564 --> 00:42:55,734
My children, I'm as blind as anyone.

421
00:42:57,777 --> 00:42:59,237
But I see you both.

422
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,532
I will never stop seeing you.

423
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:05,201
But I was right.

424
00:43:06,703 --> 00:43:09,497
This day had come,
and you must meet your father.

425
00:43:09,581 --> 00:43:11,332
Dad, you're my father.

426
00:43:18,923 --> 00:43:20,133
I love you, boy.

427
00:43:26,765 --> 00:43:28,391
We'll see you again?

428
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:33,646
Yes.

429
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:37,942
Bow Lion.

430
00:43:42,906 --> 00:43:45,533
This will be like a...
Like a tickle for you.

431
00:43:45,617 --> 00:43:47,377
- Aaah!
- Oh. Yes.

432
00:43:49,871 --> 00:43:50,872
Good.

433
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:02,649
Remember your mother always.

434
00:44:03,426 --> 00:44:05,345
Protect each other at all costs.

435
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:10,600
- Dad.
- Kofun, no. Stop.

436
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:12,435
He'll be alone.

437
00:44:13,978 --> 00:44:17,190
He will have Maghra with him always.

438
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:22,862
And now, he will have the two of you.

439
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:26,741
I will be with him.

440
00:44:30,453 --> 00:44:31,871
Look to your sister.

441
00:44:33,123 --> 00:44:34,457
She knows.

442
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:39,045
Now...

443
00:44:40,505 --> 00:44:43,508
listen carefully, both of you.

444
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:48,471
The gift of sight can be blinding.

445
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:55,103
Jerlamarel... is your father,

446
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:57,856
and he is sighted.

447
00:44:58,857 --> 00:45:02,527
But he is not a god, and neither are you.

448
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:06,865
If you are to build this world...

449
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:10,660
remember your mother.

450
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:15,915
And remember Baba Voss,
who taught you all things.

451
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:21,421
And you build this new world
for the sighted as well as the unsighted.

452
00:45:22,297 --> 00:45:25,216
With no gods! Do you understand?

453
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:28,678
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

454
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:30,055
- Yes.
- Okay.

455
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:31,848
Oh, my babies.

456
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:37,479
Read the books for me.
Read the books for me.

457
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:39,564
Mmm.

458
00:45:42,692 --> 00:45:44,444
Young man.

459
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:46,071
- Oh.
- Mmm.

460
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:49,074
My staff.

461
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:54,954
Okay, go. Go now.

462
00:45:55,038 --> 00:45:59,376
Go now before it's too dark
for you to see.

463
00:46:06,341 --> 00:46:08,385
I can't believe he really left us.

464
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:11,971
We're the ones who left.

465
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,440
Okay.

466
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,985
We're coming now, the two of us.

467
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:28,363
Haniwa and Kofun.

468
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:43,336
You and me together, little brother.

469
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,800
Always, little sister.

470
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:51,845
Are you ready?

471
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:54,180
No.

472
00:46:54,264 --> 00:46:55,807
Me neither.

473
00:47:00,937 --> 00:47:02,022
Let's go.

474
00:47:16,161 --> 00:47:17,787
You sent them alone.

475
00:47:20,248 --> 00:47:22,834
Sometimes the best way
to protect your children

476
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:25,128
is to let them believe you've stopped.

477
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:28,214
Did Maghra tell you that?

478
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:30,925
Yes, she did.

479
00:47:33,428 --> 00:47:35,472
The only home I have is those children.

480
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,350
I have nowhere else to be.

481
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:40,602
Do you?

482
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:44,731
So we stay close?

483
00:47:45,398 --> 00:47:46,483
Oh, yes.

484
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,319
We stay close.

485
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:32,904
What now?

486
00:48:34,406 --> 00:48:35,490

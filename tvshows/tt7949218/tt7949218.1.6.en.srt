<i>I won't die for this city.
This city will die for me.</i>

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,092
Nyrie!

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,011
<i>What have you brought me?</i>

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,096
I will speak to you.
You've made a mistake...

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,226
I wonder who you might be
to make such a claim.

6
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>Opayol.
They're the ones who took our things.</i>

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,272
<i>There's no one down there.
It looks deserted.</i>

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,902
Stop! Feel! His chest.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,403
He can see.

10
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,822
Boots is Jerlamarel's son. Our brother.

11
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,007
Where's Mama? What happened?

12
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,075
They took her?

13
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,536
No, she let go of my hand.

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,620
Tamacti Jun!

15
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,082
Princess Maghra...

of the House of Kane.

Maghra!

21
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,279
Here I am.

22
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,411
Dad. Dad.

23
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:46,829
Boy.

24
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,193
There's more of them coming.
We're about to be surrounded.

25
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:50,958
- Dad.
- What happened?

26
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,042
What happened?

27
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,754
I didn't see it,
but he said he saw it, and...

28
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,213
- Saw what?
- Saw what?

29
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,132
What... What's she talking about?

30
00:02:58,214 --> 00:02:59,216
Did you find Mom?

31
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,885
I saw her leave the woods.

32
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:02,553
I saw her with them and...

33
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,597
I saw her die.

34
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,434
What? What?

35
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,561
She was taken before their leader.

36
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,146
She pled with him.

37
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,958
He seemed to be listening, but then
he drew for his sword and he cut her down.

38
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:16,942
He... He killed her.

39
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:19,195
No. No. She's not dead.

40
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:23,115
- He's lying.
- No.

41
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,242
Why should I believe him?

42
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,495
I didn't believe it either.

43
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,622
I went to look for her.

44
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,916
And I found this.

45
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:35,628
- I found her bag in blood.
- What?

46
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,755
I saw it with my own eyes.

47
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:40,091
I'm sorry, but we have to run.

48
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:43,219
No, no. I'm not running.

49
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:47,098
I'm not going anywhere until we find
the Witchfinder and kill him.

50
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,682
- No.
- Papa.

51
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,184
We run.

52
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,853
- What?
- There will be another time,

53
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:55,648
a time of our choosing,
but right now I have to keep you safe.

54
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:57,733
- No. I'll go without...
- Listen to me.

55
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,612
I have to keep you safe.

56
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:04,281
We must go.
We must go. They're on their way.

57
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,991
I know a place we can hide safely.

58
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,118
Follow me.

59
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:47,575
You were dead and now you are not.

60
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:49,785
How can this be?

61
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:51,162
Where's my family?

62
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:54,832
These children with vision,
they are yours...

63
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,502
aren't they?

64
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:01,255
I'll answer nothing
until I have your assurance

65
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:03,424
that my family will not be harmed.

66
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:07,053
I have orders to seize them
by any means necessary.

67
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,555
I'm giving you different orders then,
aren't I?

68
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:11,348
You are not the queen.

69
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:14,560
And whose fault is that?

70
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:20,191
Tell your men to bring them in alive
and unharmed,

71
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:22,234
and I'll tell you what you want to know.

72
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,571
And then I'll tell you more.

73
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,043
General.

74
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:42,963
Pass word into the field,
the fugitives must be caught alive.

75
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:47,802
Any damage visited upon them will be
returned to every tenth man of ours,

76
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,512
drawn by lots.

77
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,389
Do you understand?

78
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:53,641
Yes, General.

79
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:02,191
The order has been given, as you asked.

80
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:07,196
Now, will you answer my question?

81
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:19,375
There was a time...

82
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:23,587
had I given you my word...

83
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,549
you would not have
hesitated to believe it.

84
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,177
That was a long time ago.

85
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:32,346
Yes, it was.

86
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:36,851
But we are who we are.

87
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:39,812
No amount of time could change that.

88
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:45,651
If you trusted me then, do it again now.

89
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:50,156
Please...

90
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,909
tell me what happened.

91
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:00,791
This way.

92
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,260
Where are we?

93
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,679
It's a cave, well hidden.

94
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:15,389
I used to play inside as a child.

95
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:18,684
It's deep and dark.
Nobody will find us here.

96
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,343
The air is still here.

97
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,766
- It's a dead end.
- It's all right. We've arrived.

98
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:00,184
Boots!

99
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:02,561
What are you doing?

100
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,315
- Open the gate.
- Can't.

101
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:08,901
Boots.

102
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:13,114
Listen to me. Open this gate.

103
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:15,658
Please don't leave us in here.

104
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,205
Please stop.

105
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,210
Why are you doing this?

106
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,964
We took you in.
I told them to take you in.

107
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,716
It is better this way.

108
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,301
Too many of you to trust all of you.

109
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,470
One would be better.

110
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,848
- Goodbye.
- Boy.

111
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,558
- No.
- Boy!

112
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,268
- Open the gate.
- Hey!

113
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:43,978
Open the gate.

114
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:45,730
Open this gate!

115
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:47,940
Open this gate!

116
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,568
- Boots!
- Open the gate!

117
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:52,653
Boots!

118
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,679
- It's not. This can't be happening.
- I knew this would happen.

119
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:04,373
You never wanted to listen.
Nobody wanted to listen.

120
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,710
We told you not to do it.

121
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,507
- What did you say?
- She heard me.

122
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:14,508
Kofun!

123
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:16,594
We told you not to go inland.

124
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:20,765
We told you not to trust him.
But since when has that ever mattered?

125
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,851
You're always so fucking certain
you're in the right!

126
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:26,020
Well, look where it's left us now, Haniwa!

127
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,148
Fuck.

128
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:38,991
What is it?

129
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,160
It's dropping.

130
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,170
Kofun.

131
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:54,673
When we get to the bottom,
we're gonna be in the dark.

132
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:59,595
I have a flint.
I just... I need something to light.

133
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:03,099
The letter.

134
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:33,879
If this cage can be lowered,
it can be raised.

135
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:36,590
Do you see any tools we can use to do it?

136
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,595
I don't think so.

137
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:45,516
Someone's here.

138
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,353
I don't see anyone.

139
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:56,068
We can't stay here.

140
00:10:57,987 --> 00:11:01,282
If we can't get out the way we came,
we have to find a way through this.

141
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,410
We're gonna be in the dark again soon.

142
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,620
Then follow me.

143
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:14,438
What are you doing?

144
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:17,108
What do you care?

145
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,818
You've stopped working.

146
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:21,195
They will notice, and you don't want that.

147
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:27,618
The cocoon, it moves. Why does it do that?

148
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:32,081
That's even worse. You must summon
someone quickly so they can take it away.

149
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,375
What for?

150
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,920
The worm is ready to emerge

151
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:41,716
and it cannot do so without
ruining all the silk from the cocoon.

152
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,927
The Overseers will not take kindly to it.

153
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:46,846
What is your name?

154
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,141
What do you care?

155
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:54,812
You seem awfully concerned with my welfare
despite the fact we've never spoken.

156
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,106
- I want to know your name.
- My name is Cora.

157
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:01,235
And my concern is for my welfare,
not for yours.

158
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:05,531
If the Overseers or, worse yet,
Cutter gets angry with one of us,

159
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:07,783
the rest of us end up suffering as well.

160
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:11,787
I'm gonna be very honest with you, Cora.

161
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,039
This is no way to live your life.

162
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:16,792
Okay. So you're one of those.

163
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,379
"Those"?

164
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:25,259
You're not the first woman of means who's
found herself kneeling before the rack,

165
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:28,054
lamenting her change in circumstances.

166
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:35,269
Here, I am fed,
I'm sheltered, and I'm unmolested.

167
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:40,274
There are much worse ways
to live your life, I can assure you.

168
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:44,070
Perhaps you're entitled
to want more than that.

169
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:48,783
There is no part of me
that needs more than that in my future.

170
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:53,037
Well, maybe, like our little friend here,

171
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,250
you could grow new parts
to accommodate the need to want more.

172
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:02,004
You! Why are you idle?

173
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,381
Why are you not working?

174
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,050
I am glad you're here.

175
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,969
I wasn't sure what to do with that
and I wanted to...

176
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:14,809
This is urgent.

177
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,104
This could have been wasted.

178
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:23,359
Get back to work.

179
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:27,196
I said, get back to work!

180
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,032
Mind your racks.

181
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,619
Will you get up for me?

182
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,375
You're making me so very angry right now.

183
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,798
I said, will you get up for me?

184
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:59,270
No.

185
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,151
You are new. You will learn.

186
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,362
Let me know when she stirs.

187
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,281
We'll try again.

188
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:17,788
<i>So much is about to change...</i>

189
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:20,750
<i>in a moment.</i>

190
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:26,172
<i>The world is shedding its skin,
revealing something new.</i>

191
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:28,966
<i>And yet all I can feel is sadness.</i>

192
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:35,139
Any words I might deploy to address it...

193
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:39,643
seem small to me...

194
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:44,690
and unworthy of a great life.

195
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,489
So I'll just say...

196
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,664
The task of succeeding you...

197
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,335
it's doomed to fail.

198
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,130
You're irreplaceable.

199
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:12,760
But I will do my best...

200
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,264
to preserve what you've left me,
to make you proud.

201
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,232
Come.

202
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:30,528
Maghra?

203
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,950
It's okay, don't be frightened. I'm here.

204
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:37,868
I'm right here.

205
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:51,257
Things will change.

206
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:59,348
But what will never change is this:

207
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:05,312
I'm going to take care of you.

208
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:09,608
Maghra.

209
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:17,158
It's astonishing how the smallest
moment can change an entire world.

210
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:21,245
How many lives can be upended.

211
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,499
Kingdoms. History. All of it.

212
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:31,088
<i>All set in motion by a dying man
whispering four words to his daughter.</i>

213
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:40,097
"You must rule... soon."

214
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:51,567
What he said, if he said it, was far less
destructive than what you did about it.

215
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,985
Your choice, Maghra, not his.

216
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:54,320
"If" he said it?

217
00:17:56,947 --> 00:17:59,742
There was a time
you would have taken me at my word.

218
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:01,786
I have no wish to play games with you.

219
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,245
What games?

220
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:06,165
When I came of age
and tried to rally support

221
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:09,668
to remove my sister from the throne,
it was no game to me.

222
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:12,630
When most of the generals
and half the court pledged their support

223
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:15,883
to make the change,
it certainly was no game to them.

224
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,970
And when you held the fate
of the entire kingdom in your hands,

225
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:23,974
the one voice of support I needed
to make good a king's dying wish,

226
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,603
when you could have changed
the world with just one word, "yes"...

227
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:29,939
you said "no."

228
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:32,650
- Was it a game to you then?
- You were a child...

229
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:36,362
I was old enough to understand
what had been obvious to my father,

230
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:39,281
that my sister was ill-suited
for the role...

231
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:43,994
that the weight of her authority
would aggravate all of her weaknesses.

232
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:48,999
I loved my sister,
but I knew what she would become.

233
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,960
And I tried to save her from it.

234
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:53,462
And was I wrong?

235
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,256
Were you wrong?

236
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,510
You were smart.

237
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:05,850
You were kind, and you were loyal.

238
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,185
And you weren't strong enough.

239
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:11,772
Say what you want about your sister,

240
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:14,150
but that has never been a label
applicable to her.

241
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:17,737
You underestimated me then,
and you're doing it again now.

242
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,905
None of this is what I asked.

243
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,408
She told me you were dead.

244
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:25,369
She told us all
that Jerlamarel killed you. Why?

245
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,831
As soon as I failed,
I knew I could not stay.

246
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:31,792
So I ran.

247
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,712
She lied. And here we are.

248
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:38,049
You didn't just attempt
to seize her crown.

249
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,302
You didn't just run when you failed.

250
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:44,847
You took her most favored consort
in the bargain too.

251
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:51,228
It gave me no pleasure to hurt her
in that way.

252
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:57,276
But Jerlamarel had an opportunity
to wield significant power through her,

253
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:00,780
and instead he chose
to be a fugitive with me.

254
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:05,785
That should tell you how little control
we had over that relationship.

255
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:09,622
It was simply beyond our abilities
to deny.

256
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:12,333
And where is he now? Where is Jerlamarel?

257
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,793
I don't know.

258
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:16,796
I haven't heard his voice
since before the children were born.

259
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:19,423
Children I have hunted
to the ends of the earth,

260
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,842
without ever knowing who they truly were.

261
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,844
Children who are still fugitives

262
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:26,806
that I have spent half a lifetime
sworn to apprehend.

263
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,975
Then your grievance is with the queen
who swore you to it.

264
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,062
I encourage you to go home
and confront her about it.

265
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:38,651
I will have something
brought to you to eat.

266
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:47,660
In the meantime,
I thank you to remain inside.

267
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,579
Your presence among the men
will only confuse them.

268
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,499
Tamacti Jun.

269
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:57,253
When you find them...

270
00:20:58,129 --> 00:20:59,672
will you leave us be?

271
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:30,703
Someone's here.

272
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:51,182
You are uninvited, yes?

273
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:55,144
You are uninvited, yes?

274
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:59,356
Woman. Yes. But we did not intend...

275
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,025
You came to us. Why?

276
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:07,531
We were trapped here by a man who...
By a boy who betrayed us.

277
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:10,493
We're only looking for a way out.

278
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:13,079
A boy.

279
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:17,500
You are welcome as long as you like. Come.

280
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,713
Where is here? Who are you?

281
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:24,215
Come. This way.

282
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:44,693
It's all right. You'll be all right.

283
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:13,347
Where are we?

284
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:17,059
We all woke up here with the door locked.

285
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:19,145
None of us know any more than you do.

286
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:22,148
That taste in your mouth
is Queen's Stalk.

287
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:25,151
It's mushrooms to numb the senses.

288
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:29,613
And the lights?

289
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,323
Lights?

290
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:32,992
You didn't tell them, Kofun?

291
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:38,164
Some kind of glowing bugs
hanging from the ceiling.

292
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,966
There are stories of clans
who took refuge below.

293
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:52,845
Some who have been away below so long...

294
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:56,390
they are something other than human.

295
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:02,438
Whoever it is, if they wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

296
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,316
How do we know we're not dead?

297
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:09,820
'Cause Mom still isn't here.

298
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:17,661
And wanting to kill us
is different from wanting us dead.

299
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,933
Maybe they left us in here
so we'd finish each other off for them.

300
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:24,001
Well, they're going
to be very disappointed,

301
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:27,755
because for as long as we are in here,
we will remain together.

302
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:31,050
We will hold together
until we get free of it.

303
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,970
If they don't mean to kill us,
then they need to feed us.

304
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:37,616
Which means, at some point,
someone needs to come through this door.

305
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,727
And when that door opens...
I will get us a way out.

306
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:43,729
But for how long?

307
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,898
What?

308
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,984
For how long do you think
we can hold together in here?

309
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:42,329
Here. That's warm.

310
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:46,250
Won't heal anything,
but it might at least help you sleep.

311
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:02,308
Why are you helping me?

312
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:10,066
I was the youngest of six
and our father was a monster.

313
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:16,697
We all suffered his cruelty
and his anger...

314
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:18,908
his lust.

315
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,787
We all suffered it knowing
that it would likely never end.

316
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:27,208
On the night I turned nine,
I'd had enough.

317
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:32,838
I went to him in the night
and I stuck a knife through his heart.

318
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:38,636
Then I went back to bed
and I slept soundly.

319
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,140
Interesting.

320
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:45,768
You think I'm weak.

321
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,688
You think I don't resist
'cause I don't have the courage to.

322
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:52,274
And you are wrong.

323
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,830
I was the oldest of two.

324
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,086
Our father was a kind man...

325
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:16,966
to my sister, at any rate.

326
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:24,724
To me, I never felt his anger,
or violence,

327
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:28,185
or cruelty, or really anything.

328
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:37,153
All I felt from him
was stark, cold indifference.

329
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:45,870
I was the oldest...

330
00:27:47,204 --> 00:27:50,541
but he wanted to give away my birthright
to my younger sister...

331
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:56,338
the one I cared for and protected...

332
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:00,092
any way I could.

333
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,514
He wanted to hand her my future.

334
00:28:11,228 --> 00:28:12,897
It was then that I learned...

335
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:18,027
in this life...

336
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,323
one must take the life one wants.

337
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:30,039
So I took everything from them both.

338
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,794
What was "everything"? What did you take?

339
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:41,675
More than you can imagine.

340
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:55,439
How many of us exactly are there here?

341
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:59,026
The workers?
There are near thirty of us.

342
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:05,825
And how many of them?

343
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:09,537
Four Overseers and the Cutter himself.

344
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:14,583
What kinds of weapons do they possess?

345
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,503
I don't know. Knives and clubs.

346
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,424
And, well, you've met the Shadows.
They lurk outside.

347
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:23,634
One never knows where they are.

348
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,891
If there are enough of us...

349
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:36,605
if we get our hands on those weapons,
it might not matter.

350
00:29:38,774 --> 00:29:40,860
Follow me and I'll make it so.

351
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:45,990
Why would anyone follow you?
No one has any idea who you are.

352
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:53,289
I believe once you tell them who I am,
they'll understand.

353
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:56,792
Well, I don't have any idea
who you are either.

354
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:03,799
Let's fix that, shall we?

355
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:19,774
Well?

356
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:23,402
I did what you asked.

357
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:28,574
And I have news.

358
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,303
They're all asleep.

359
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:51,722
I know. They snore.

360
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:57,019
Not quite as loud as when they
were babies, but I can still hear it.

361
00:30:58,604 --> 00:30:59,814
It's comforting.

362
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:07,696
I have known them almost as long
as I knew you before they arrived.

363
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,491
That isn't right.

364
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,494
Can that be right?

365
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:25,840
I remember the day you arrived.

366
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:28,843
So strong...

367
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:33,389
but so broken.

368
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:35,141
Baba.

369
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:39,895
I remember thinking...

370
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:45,192
"What horrors has this boy
walked through?"

371
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:47,903
I said to myself,

372
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:54,994
"Oh, Paris, do not put this one through

373
00:31:55,077 --> 00:32:00,875
any more suffering
than he's already endured."

374
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:07,131
I'm afraid...
that is exactly what I have done.

375
00:32:07,214 --> 00:32:11,302
Baba. I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

376
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:15,681
I had her hand in mine. I had it.

377
00:32:15,765 --> 00:32:17,933
She was right there.

378
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:19,018
Don't.

379
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:21,520
Then she was gone.

380
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:29,653
I am the one who's pushing the children
to want more,

381
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:32,031
to need more.

382
00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:35,451
This is where it led.

383
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,704
Paris, stop. Please, stop.

384
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:42,458
Stop. Stop.

385
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:48,005
I have to hold this together.

386
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:52,009
I have to hold them together.

387
00:32:55,596 --> 00:33:00,101
If they have any reason
to think that I'm coming apart...

388
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:06,482
If they sense it, even for a moment,
this is all over.

389
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,613
Okay? You have done nothing but love them.

390
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:18,744
I will not permit you
to apologize for that.

391
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:29,880
What happened was not...
It wasn't your fault.

392
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,639
Then whose fault was it?

393
00:33:47,064 --> 00:33:48,774
No. No.

394
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:55,573
No! No! Let fucking go of me! You fu...

395
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:00,786
Your Majesty.

396
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:05,249
When they first brought you to me,

397
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:09,503
I was skeptical, I admit,
that you would be of any use.

398
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:15,134
We have had wealthy ones before
and, frankly, they never last very long.

399
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:20,389
But you are not merely wealthy.

400
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:24,435
You are something else entirely.

401
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:30,649
My army will return for me.

402
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,860
And when they do...

403
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:38,157
you will regret every fucking malice bone
in your fucking body,

404
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,493
you fucking piece of shit.

405
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:42,078
I'm gonna have you killed.

406
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:46,332
I'm gonna do everything possible

407
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:49,126
to take away your fucking power,
you fuck.

408
00:34:56,467 --> 00:35:02,973
I can only imagine the number of people
that have dreamt of doing this to you.

409
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:05,893
The Witchfinder is far from here.

410
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:10,481
But when he left, he made it clear
where he was going, and what for,

411
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:14,234
on the off chance
that we might acquire any information

412
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:16,153
that would be of value to him.

413
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:22,283
I think we could safely agree
that the most valuable thing in his world

414
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:25,830
is now in my possession.

415
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:30,835
The only question being
how to prove it to him.

416
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,674
I heard a story once.
Perhaps you can tell me if it is true.

417
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:40,928
I heard that when a Payan monarch
ascends the throne,

418
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:43,347
a ceremony takes place
to honor the occasion.

419
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:45,223
And in that ceremony,

420
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:51,063
an amulet that is embedded
beneath the skin of the reigning monarch

421
00:35:51,147 --> 00:35:54,900
is removed and implanted into his heir.

422
00:35:56,527 --> 00:35:57,737
Table.

423
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:13,878
An amulet that resides
just above the heart.

424
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:18,340
Could this possibly be true?

425
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,722
What do you know? It is true.

426
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,918
Thank you for this.

427
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:59,924
Now, let us find out what it can do.

428
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:31,288
Wait, please.

429
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:34,208
You're gonna help us get outta here.

430
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,210
That is precisely why I'm here.

431
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:37,461
What I'm doing is forbidden.

432
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:40,631
If they hear us,
it will be as dangerous for me as for you.

433
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:44,135
Please. Let me tell you what I know.

434
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:52,435
My name is Delia.

435
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:57,732
This place you find yourself in,
it is peaceful, it is tranquil,

436
00:37:57,815 --> 00:37:59,358
but it is so unforgiving.

437
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:04,113
To protect this place,
it must never touch the world above.

438
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,199
So none who enter may ever leave.

439
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:11,036
There have been uninvited in the past.

440
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,832
And, in the past, they have been permitted
to decide to join us,

441
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:19,086
but not soon, not for some time.

442
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:22,798
The urge to return is too strong.
It cannot be willed away.

443
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,426
How much time?

444
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:30,931
When I arrived, five winters and summers
passed before the door was open to me.

445
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,559
That can't be all you came to say.

446
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:35,853
Why are you here?

447
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:37,563
I believe you...

448
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:42,234
that you were lured here... by a boy.

449
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:49,700
Though, he's probably more a man and less
a boy than he was when he lured me here.

450
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:53,871
Boots. You know him?

451
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,168
He's my son.

452
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:05,466
It wasn't long after he was born
before I realized he was different.

453
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:09,428
It wasn't long after that
before the rest of the village did too.

454
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:12,598
I tried to protect him.

455
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:16,811
I pled for understanding
and mercy from the others.

456
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:21,023
He was just a boy.
His curse just an accident of nature.

457
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:26,695
They ridiculed him,
spat upon him, beat him...

458
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:29,281
sometimes worse.

459
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:31,909
Where was his father?

460
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,619
He was gone.

461
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,205
A man who'd only joined our village
recently

462
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:38,332
when the boy was still very small.

463
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:40,668
He left one day. He never returned.

464
00:39:48,843 --> 00:39:54,557
The boy grew quieter as he got older,
and angrier...

465
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:58,561
until one day
he couldn't suffer it anymore.

466
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:01,731
What did he do to them?

467
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:05,735
He started with the ones
who had been most violent with him.

468
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:09,113
<i>Killed some in their sleep.</i>

469
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:15,953
<i>Some he chased
as they ran in panic and terror.</i>

470
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:22,209
<i>When that was done, he moved on to
the ones who simply spoke ill toward him.</i>

471
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:27,590
<i>By the time the bloodshed was over,
the only Opayol left were him and me.</i>

472
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:30,926
Why are you telling us this?

473
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,474
The child is my fault.

474
00:40:37,892 --> 00:40:40,436
Therefore your presence here
is my fault as well.

475
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:45,316
Whichever of you is successful
in escaping here alive...

476
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:49,320
swear to me that you will find the boy,

477
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,906
that you will find my son...

478
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:55,659
and you will kill him.

479
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,209
I'll do it.

480
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,492
This place is forbidden by the elders,

481
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:21,454
but I have felt the power
of the God Flame coming from above.

482
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:23,581
Haniwa. Why did you fall behind?

483
00:42:23,664 --> 00:42:25,833
Sorry. I saw something.

484
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,126
Saw what?

485
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,171
You wouldn't understand.

486
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:36,635
She saw. Be so very careful with her.

487
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:46,353
Dad. Dad, I think I know how this works.

488
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:49,565
We have to pull this
till the elevator rises to the top.

489
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:52,026
We can control it from above.
Send it back down.

490
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:54,695
But someone has to stay down here
and hold this thing.

491
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:02,620
How many do you think there could be?

492
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:05,456
Too many.
I'll do what I can to slow them down.

493
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:10,378
All right. Everyone in.

494
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,505
- No, Dad. I can help you.
- Get in, boy!

495
00:43:13,672 --> 00:43:15,091
- You in?
- Yeah.

496
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:25,101
Papa, we'll send it right back.

497
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:40,801
We're here. We're here. Okay, come on.

498
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:50,061
Papa, we're bringing it back down!

499
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:13,918
Help me!

500
00:45:57,002 --> 00:45:58,003
No!

501
00:45:58,504 --> 00:45:59,714
Dad, move!

502
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:43,632
- Kofun!
- Papa!

503
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:44,925
Haniwa!

504
00:46:46,218 --> 00:46:47,678
Dad! Dad!

505
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:49,764
Papa, we're here! We're here.

506
00:46:52,892 --> 00:46:54,560
- Dad!
- He's climbing.

507
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:57,021
We're here, Papa. You're okay.

508
00:46:57,104 --> 00:46:59,648
Can you hear us? We're right here.

509
00:46:59,732 --> 00:47:00,983
Follow our voices.

510
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,071
You're okay. You're okay.

511
00:47:06,238 --> 00:47:07,632
We're right here. We're right here.

512
00:47:07,656 --> 00:47:08,699
We're here.

513
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:11,494
Come on. Please. You're okay.
You're okay, we're close.

514
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:13,788
Hold on! Hold on!

515
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:15,498
Papa, please hold on.

516
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:16,582
To your right.

517
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:18,334
Dad, there's a ledge to your right.

518
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:20,668
No! Dad!

519
00:47:26,008 --> 00:47:27,009
We're here!

520
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:28,302
You're close.

521
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:31,430
Come on, Dad, you're almost here.

522
00:47:34,308 --> 00:47:35,684
I don't know wh...

523
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:37,812
You're so close.

524
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:41,023
He's too far.

525
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,567
- Kofun, can you reach him?
- I'm reaching out a hand.

526
00:47:43,984 --> 00:47:45,528
Dad! Take my hand!

527
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,658
Da... I can't reach! I can't reach you!

528
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:53,619
I can't reach you, it's too high.

529
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:04,088
Okay. Okay.

530
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:07,049
Dad!

531
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:08,259
Hold on!

532
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,679
- Dad! Hold on!
- Please! Hold on, Papa!

533
00:48:11,762 --> 00:48:13,264
We have you!

534
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:15,975
Please hold on. Please.

535
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:20,938
- Dad!
- Boy.

536
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:21,939
Give me your hand!

537
00:48:22,022 --> 00:48:23,190
You can do it!

538
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:34,034
I have you. I have you!

539
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,012
A member of your party has been located.

540
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:38,099
He is here.

541
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:40,643
Maghra.

542
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:47,274
This is one of yours, is it not?

543
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:55,116
Yes. It is.

544
00:49:58,327 --> 00:49:59,537
Leave us.

545
00:50:00,788 --> 00:50:01,997
Please.

546
00:50:12,591 --> 00:50:13,801
Where's my family?

547
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:19,473
- I don't know.
- You left them.

548
00:50:19,557 --> 00:50:20,975
There was fighting.

549
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:23,978
I tried to help them.
But when I looked, they were gone.

550
00:50:25,146 --> 00:50:26,689
I came here to help you.

551
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:29,316
If you wanna help me,
go find my husband and my children.

552
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,609
I have tried.

553
00:50:31,485 --> 00:50:35,114
I will try again if that is what you ask,

554
00:50:35,656 --> 00:50:38,909
but please know
there are other ways I can help you.

555
00:50:38,993 --> 00:50:40,703
There is nothing else that I want.

556
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,873
I saw them kneel before you.

557
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,755
<i>They believe you to be important. Yes?</i>

558
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:58,721
To be important you need to be strong.

559
00:51:00,097 --> 00:51:01,515
I can make you strong.

560
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,228
I can do things no one here can.

561
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:14,361
If I were in your service,
you could do things no one here can.

562
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:20,242
Better if they don't have to believe
you're important.

563
00:51:20,826 --> 00:51:23,245
Better to be strong enough to prove it.

564
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,627
I would be devoted to your service...

565
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:33,756
and all I would ask is one thing from you.

566
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:35,549
What?

567
00:51:36,634 --> 00:51:39,345
That you promise not to be mean to me.

568
00:52:04,495 --> 00:52:05,538
What is it?

569
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:09,166
Please return to the tent.

570
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,544
- I'll join you momentarily.
- I'm not going anywhere.

571
00:52:11,627 --> 00:52:12,837
Tell me what happened.

572
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:29,228
The author of that message claims
to be holding the queen. Your sister.

573
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:31,772
Ransom?

574
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:35,276
They claim that unless we deliver
the requested payment

575
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,153
to the specified location...

576
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:38,654
This is a fraud.

577
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,949
How could someone have kidnapped
the queen from inside Kanzua?

578
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:43,993
An army protects her there.

579
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,005
Give me a moment
to confer with my lieutenants.

580
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,507
I'll meet you inside shortly.

581
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:08,059
Let me help you.

582
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:10,936
What?

583
00:53:12,646 --> 00:53:14,607
I know who left that message.

584
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:17,193
Who has your sister.

585
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:18,778
How could you possibly?

586
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:21,197
Because they are still here.

587
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,578
I can see them.

588
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:40,633
Tell me you will accept me
into your service as your lieutenant.

589
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:46,680
I am the only one here who can help you.

590
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:51,644
Just say yes, and I will do it.

590
00:53:52,305 --> 00:54:52,397

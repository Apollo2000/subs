1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,107
<i>Alkenny. This is our home.
We are one and we fight as one.</i>

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:13,948
Clear the wall!

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,535
At the end of winter,
a woman wandered into our village.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,707
<i>She was three months pregnant.
She never said who the father was.</i>

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,000
Jerlamarel.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,420
The heretic that you've been seeking.

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,297
The Witchfinders are coming.

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,424
<i>- We're trapped.
- We are not.</i>

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,929
<i>There is another way off this mountain.</i>

10
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,599
Jerlamarel not only lives.
He has passed on his life.

11
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:47,623
Find his children, and bring them to me.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

13
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:50,426
Chet-chet!

14
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:58,518
Chet-chet-chet!

15
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:47,937
Please cry. Please be alive.

16
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,364
Hey! No!

17
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:16,909
Hey! Hey, face me!

18
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:21,497
Hey! Look at me!

19
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,750
Look at m...

20
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:28,670
Hey, face me!

21
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:36,694
Face me!

22
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:16,510
Who's there? Answer me. Who's there?

23
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:20,722
I see my children are in good hands.

24
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,684
Jerlamarel...

25
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:31,708
is that you?

26
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:37,656
Yes.

27
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,199
Did you come to take them away?

28
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,952
No. I'm a fugitive.

29
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:43,954
And I have work to do elsewhere.

30
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,625
They are safer with you as they grow.

31
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:54,506
I stayed close to make sure
that you would find the sanctuary.

32
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,301
And to kill the bears in the valley.

33
00:06:57,325 --> 00:07:05,325
I believe this is the last bear.

34
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,398
These children are a gift.

35
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:16,403
Take great care of them as they grow.

36
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:23,869
May I have your hand?

37
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,955
What is... what is this?

38
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,375
At the sanctuary, beside the waterfall,
there is a small cave.

39
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,086
Climb in it. There you will find a box.

40
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,381
I've given you the key to open that box.

41
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:38,050
Speak to Paris.

42
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:42,054
Tell her that the contents of the box
are for my children.

43
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:44,223
Open the box when they are 12 summers old.

44
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,308
Old enough to understand what is inside.

45
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:50,103
What is inside?

46
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:52,272
Knowledge.

47
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:55,400
Knowledge that will begin a new world.

48
00:07:55,424 --> 00:08:03,424
Better even than the world
of our ancestors.

49
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:13,059
Someday, we will be together.

50
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,013
Name them Haniwa and Kofun.

51
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,976
That way I'll know them
when they come to me.

52
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,435
And when will they come to you?

53
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,104
The answers are all in the box.

54
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:37,860
Wait. Jerlamarel.

55
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:42,781
Jerlamarel!

56
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:48,996
Jerlamarel.

57
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Jerlamarel!

58
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:20,835
I just heard Baba Voss
calling the witch's name.

59
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:27,159
Does this not bother you?

60
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:32,998
- Is there no law in this place?
- We are far away from the law here.

61
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,375
Baba Voss is in charge now.
We dare not offend him.

62
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,253
Baba Voss is not the law.

63
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,172
God is the law.

64
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,508
Perhaps we are far away from God here too.

65
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:48,680
It was Baba Voss and it was Paris
who condemned my mother...

66
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:53,101
your own sister, to the bonfire.

67
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,770
For what?

68
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,191
Because she questioned the wisdom
of letting a man like him,

69
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:04,822
a stranger, who would not speak of
his past, to be in charge of the village?

70
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:11,328
They burned her because they feared
she spoke the truth.

71
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:17,793
God doesn't lose sight of those things.

72
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:21,922
And even if he did...

73
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:29,946
I never will.

74
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:36,562
Where have you been?

75
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:41,650
Baba Voss?

76
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,611
What happened?

77
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:47,990
Only the truth.

78
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,700
Sit down, my love.

79
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:52,286
Why?

80
00:10:52,310 --> 00:11:00,310
Because Jerlamarel... happened.

81
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:34,445
It says we'll find her
at the end of the fallen trunk.

82
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,274
I've only ever heard stories.

83
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,277
I didn't even know that we had a Shadow
living among us in the village.

84
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,238
That's why Shadows are Shadows.
No one knows who they are.

85
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:54,324
But the Alkenny have always had a Shadow.

86
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:58,245
I left a note on the altar for her,
and when I came back, it was gone.

87
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:59,955
She will be here.

88
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,666
And how will you know when it arrives?

89
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,711
I don't know. I've never done this before.

90
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:10,090
I presume she will make herself
known to us.

91
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:11,884
Why do you keep saying "she"?

92
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:15,304
Because Shadows are always women.
Men are too clumsy.

93
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,890
So who do you think it is, then?

94
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:21,560
Somebody we probably talk to every day.

95
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:24,188
Somebody with the power to hide her body.

96
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:28,567
No one can both be
and then not be all at once.

97
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:30,611
She moves only when others move.

98
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,946
Even Ayuras can't hear her.

99
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,867
She purges herself of thought.
Even presages can't sense her.

100
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:41,371
She's in another place, undetectable.

101
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:49,254
Even dogs think they're stone.

102
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,425
She is here.

103
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,928
Shadow...

104
00:13:55,952 --> 00:14:03,560
I greet you.

105
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:08,440
Shadow, I need you to shadow someone,
someone in the village,

106
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:13,654
and report everything you hear.

107
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:17,449
She will not respond unless you submit.

108
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:23,997
Stand still!

109
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:32,005
Shadow, will you do as I ask?

110
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,466
Is that a yes?

111
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,806
Two for "yes," one for "no"? Yes?

112
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,977
Shadow, the person is Paris.

113
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,729
We believe she is a witch. We need proof.

114
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:55,753
Can you shadow a witch?

115
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Shadow, can you shadow a witch?

116
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:17,301
And how shall we pay you?

117
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:25,325
Shadow?

118
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:34,985
"A new world," he said?

119
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:39,781
Perhaps in making a new world,
the old will be destroyed.

120
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:47,805
It's just a box, my love.

121
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:57,049
What is it?

122
00:15:57,073 --> 00:16:01,220
It's for the children.
Perhaps it is a toy.

123
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:04,389
No. It will have a meaning.

124
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:07,768
Everything he does has a meaning.

125
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,521
Meaning of which I can never understand.

126
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:12,856
I'm good for caring,
not good for understanding.

127
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,443
Baba Voss, I would always choose a man
who can care of me

128
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:21,824
over a man who understands me.

129
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,158
Paris?

130
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,536
Yes.

131
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,829
Your husband invited me.

132
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:32,084
Jerlamarel himself said
we must consult with her.

133
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:39,758
Come, come.

134
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:47,782
What else is in the box?

135
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:58,277
This message says
we must keep what is on top on top,

136
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:06,301
and what is at the bottom on the bottom.

137
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,173
How do we make a new world of tree bark?

138
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:22,009
The breeze brings no visions either.

139
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:24,803
And many more of the same.

140
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:29,183
Paris.

141
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:33,061
What? Do you know what they are?

142
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,148
Yes.

143
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:41,778
They... they are books.

144
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,071
What are books?

145
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:49,995
My grandmother told me stories
her grandmother's grandmother told her.

146
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:55,083
I dreamt them with her.

147
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,838
Books are in the holy shape.

148
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:06,844
They are silent, and yet
they speak directly into the imagination.

149
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:12,141
You can burn them,
but they are more powerful than fire.

150
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:16,772
All the knowledge of the ancient ones
are put into them.

151
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:21,860
Secrets of the age of vision.

152
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:27,074
My grandmother's grandmother
had books of her own.

153
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:30,244
But the Witchfinder burnt them all.

154
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:35,165
I thought all the books had been burnt.

155
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:37,459
Jerlamarel said
that we must wait 12 summers

156
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,877
before we give them to the children.

157
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:43,590
He must believe that they have inherited
his ability to hear silence.

158
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:46,385
He can believe,
but that does not make it true.

159
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,679
My babies may not be cursed.

160
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,930
Cursed?

161
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:55,853
We're here, living alone forever,
in a village filled with superstition.

162
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:59,273
Maybe your children won't stay forever.

163
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:01,233
Meaning what?

164
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:02,568
Meaning what, Paris?

165
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:06,363
Until we know for certain
that they have the ability,

166
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:08,490
there must be no dispute between us.

167
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,661
We must bury them like precious seeds.

168
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,957
Because they are a gift from Jerlamarel.

169
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,418
And Jerlamarel's gifts are always good.

170
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:24,381
You know different, Maghra?

171
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:27,509
Baba Voss...

172
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,221
bury the books by the hyacinth tree.

173
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:39,245
And for 12 summers,
we will not speak a word of this.

174
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:21,913
Shadow?

175
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:27,611
Shadow.

176
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:35,635
I got your message.

177
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:43,685
I'm here.

178
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:53,262
Are you there?

179
00:20:53,286 --> 00:21:01,286
Shadow?

180
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:10,487
She wouldn't speak.

181
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,281
She tied what she heard.

182
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:17,119
There were three present.
Baba Voss, Paris, and Maghra.

183
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,787
They spoke about the babies.

184
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,080
What of the witch?

185
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,498
The babies.

186
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:25,127
They're wailing, they're feeding,
they're cooing, nothing else.

187
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:29,339
This is what she said.

188
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:30,716
The Shadow is lying!

189
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,010
You may be right.

190
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:37,347
She may not answer my questions.

191
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:40,058
But I'm gonna send news of a witch.

192
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,852
And then the Witchfinders can ask them...

193
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:49,876
News? How are you going to send news?

194
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,738
A message.

195
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:59,161
It will flow downstream
through a dozen different valleys.

196
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,746
Who knows who will find it?

197
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,456
A beaver will find it.

198
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,416
But I will do it twice a day.

199
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,585
Three times a day.

200
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:10,672
And one day, our prayers will be answered.

201
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,967
There are so many valleys and rivers.
It will take years.

202
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:21,991
Perhaps.

203
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:30,291
But we will have hope.

204
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:06,369
Hold!

205
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,695
My friend.

206
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:22,719
Knew I'd find you out here
all by yourself.

207
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:32,129
How are things with you?

208
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:33,463
All is well.

209
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:36,258
Good.

210
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,260
And you?

211
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:43,182
Is all well with you too?

212
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:45,142
Do you really wanna know?

213
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:51,398
Of course.

214
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:55,861
Things are, are not so good.

215
00:23:55,885 --> 00:24:00,199
I have trouble sleeping.

216
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:01,450
I'm sorry to hear that.

217
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:06,622
You see, I hear things during the day
that keep me awake.

218
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,624
What sort of things?

219
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,710
I feel a great mistrust around me.

220
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:15,714
I fear someone may have even gone
to great lengths

221
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:23,738
to spy upon me and those closest to me,
inside my own home.

222
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:27,059
It is highly unlikely.

223
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:31,605
It is no secret that you and your aunt
bear ill will towards me and my family.

224
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:36,985
I thought if there was someone out there
with poor judgment to want to provoke me,

225
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:41,698
you, of all people, might know them.

226
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:49,498
But you don't, do you?

227
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:54,545
No, I do not.

228
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:59,007
Good. That's good.

229
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:03,512
I want you to remember, I am the law here.

230
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:08,183
Anyone and everyone can come to me
and speak their mind,

231
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,228
and if they face me when they speak,

232
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:15,440
they will meet a fair man, a just man.

233
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:17,985
The man that I am right now.

234
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:22,197
But if I hear whispers in the wind,

235
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:25,617
and I must discover the speaker myself,

236
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:31,039
then he or she may face the man
that I once was.

237
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:39,063
A man with the taste for blood and terror.

238
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:48,682
If someone has something to say,
please, Gether Bax,

239
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:54,104
tell them to find me and say it...

240
00:25:54,128 --> 00:26:02,128
before I find them first.

241
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,305
Hear me!

242
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:36,021
You have failed to give me the information
I asked for.

243
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:38,899
And you've lost your homes.

244
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:44,613
Speak now so you may not lose your lives
as well.

245
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:51,119
Tell me what you know about the heretic
and devil called Jerlamarel.

246
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:55,332
Tell me what you know about his children.

247
00:26:55,356 --> 00:26:57,709
We... we hear nothing.

248
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:05,733
Please, I beg you, let us be.

249
00:27:06,075 --> 00:27:14,075
If you've heard nothing,
then your ears are no use to me.

250
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:37,916
Messenger!

251
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:45,940
A report for the queen.

252
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:57,519
"We have been searching in the mountains
of the Sun Grave land for months now."

253
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,855
We pray to God always for guidance,

254
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:05,527
but we get no word,
no scent, no markers, no hope.

255
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,322
But the villages of the Sun Grave world
are scattered.

256
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:11,325
There are many mountains
and lost plateaux.

257
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:18,040
The people fear bears and lions
and remain inside their defenses.

258
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:24,922
And, so, it is with heavy heart
that I now seek your instruction.

259
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:27,299
Is my mission ended?

260
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,927
I believe it is now hopeless.

261
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:34,598
I humbly request
that we be allowed to return to Payan.

262
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:41,730
"I remain your devoted servant,
Tamacti Jun."

263
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:43,315
May I read the message for myself?

264
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:46,235
- I have read it to you in its entirety.
- Give it to me.

265
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:54,259
I have very sensitive fingers.
You may have missed something.

266
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:16,890
The first arm's length
is indeed from Tamacti Jun.

267
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:19,434
The second arm's length is not.

268
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,813
Tamacti Jun is never humble,
he's not a servant,

269
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:24,982
and by secret agreement
between Tamacti and I,

270
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:27,901
he always ties a heart every tenth
to avoid forgery,

271
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:31,822
and this, my Holy Lord Sak, is a forgery.

272
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:34,533
Others wrote it. You were sent. Kneel.

273
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:42,332
- Your Majesty...
- I said kneel!

274
00:29:42,356 --> 00:29:47,421
Tamacti Jun is the royal tax collector
and the royal Witchfinder.

275
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:51,675
He's commissioned to serve 20 summers,
and 20 summers he will serve.

276
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:57,639
And every single day of his service,
he will hunt for Jerlamarel.

277
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:05,663
For hatred and vengeance are
the two wild horses pulling his carriage.

278
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:09,026
Who sent you to lie to me?

279
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,196
Others with concerns.

280
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,490
Which others?

281
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:18,952
Others who wish to make you see reason,
Your Majesty.

282
00:30:18,976 --> 00:30:21,246
Your Majesty,
the heretic Jerlamarel is lost.

283
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,998
We have troubles here.

284
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,083
The holy power is fading.

285
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:27,920
Water is coming through cracks
in the eternal wall,

286
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:30,547
and the level is rising.

287
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:35,052
The gods now only sing with two voices.

288
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:39,014
People are questioning your power.

289
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:46,480
You need your army here, Your Majesty.

290
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:51,401
Who tied the false knots?

291
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:53,529
Lord Carne.

292
00:30:53,553 --> 00:30:56,573
Lady Zee.

293
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:59,201
And more?

294
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:07,225
None.

295
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:16,526
Choke on your own lies.

296
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:42,218
I wish to pray.

297
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:15,027
Jerlamarel, my one true love.

298
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:20,616
Once, I prayed with you like this.

299
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,245
Once, we spoke to each other
without words...

300
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:28,665
but you no longer speak to me.

301
00:32:28,689 --> 00:32:35,756
So I'll speak to you in a prayer.

302
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,303
Jerlamarel... come home in peace...

303
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,889
and beat your pursuers to my body.

304
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:47,976
I will forgive your sins.

305
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,106
Come back and give me children
with the power, your power.

306
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,236
I will proclaim the Vision heresy.

307
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,990
I will renounce the gods.

308
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,034
For our children will be the gods.

309
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:10,916
And I will be the god you once denied.

310
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,380
Forever and ever.

311
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:19,299
Behold...

312
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:24,346
Lord Carne and Lady Zee...

313
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,849
whom I thought to be faithful to me.

314
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:28,559
Please, Your Majesty!

315
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,979
I found them guilty
of treason and forgery.

316
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:34,648
We only spoke the truth.

317
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:36,900
The truth you all know.

318
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:41,113
She only thinks of Jerlamarel
when here, at home,

319
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:43,448
the engines are breaking,
the water is rising.

320
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:51,472
She is not a go...

321
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:59,089
It is true.

322
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:02,843
The battle I fight to save your lives...

323
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:06,930
and to save your holy Payan city
is a hard one.

324
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:13,687
But I fight it because that is the lot
of my lineage.

325
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:20,068
As God instructs me,
I am a god as much as he allows.

326
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:24,406
So, as his hands on earth,
I hold back destruction,

327
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:29,286
warm the winter, cool the summer,
put magic in our fences

328
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:35,417
against lions and bears who
would otherwise destroy your children...

329
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:42,090
even on full bellies.

330
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:47,804
But the greater battle I fight
is against light...

331
00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:52,601
a power that puts man above God...

332
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,228
a power that would, once again,

333
00:34:54,252 --> 00:34:57,731
put leather reins and chains
on a world restored.

334
00:34:57,755 --> 00:35:03,529
Our armies are out in the field,
fighting these devils of light.

335
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:06,824
We should honor them.

336
00:35:06,848 --> 00:35:14,581
Not whisper treason behind their backs.

337
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:19,169
To speak against me...

338
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:23,006
is to speed a return of light
and destruction.

339
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:28,720
It cannot be forgiven.

340
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:35,184
With regret, old friends...

341
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:43,208
go.

342
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:55,455
We are Payan.

343
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:59,626
We are holy.

344
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,173
We are chosen.

345
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:10,345
- We are, we are, we are.
- We are, we are, we are.

346
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,973
We are Payan.

347
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:16,310
We are holy.

348
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:19,771
We are chosen.

349
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:27,795
We are - We are.

350
00:36:56,541 --> 00:37:04,541
I brought some rose fruit for the babies.

351
00:37:08,678 --> 00:37:11,865
Maghra...

352
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:14,660
- the air I feel...
- Yes.

353
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:16,787
Yes, you do.

354
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:24,811
You feel sorrow and joy somewhere,
perhaps, but mostly sorrow.

355
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:29,007
Here.

356
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:31,510
Their favorite toy.

357
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:39,534
Place it anywhere,
anywhere you like, just quietly.

358
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:56,535
Haniwa, Kofun, where's your toy?

359
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,290
Go find your toy.

360
00:38:01,314 --> 00:38:04,543
Do you have it?

361
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,128
Good girl.

362
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:11,633
Now give it to Aunty Paris.

363
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:15,679
Go play.

364
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:23,703
And if I cover their eyes,
they can't do it anymore.

365
00:38:24,378 --> 00:38:27,566
I've known for a long time. And I ju...

366
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,277
I just pretended that I didn't know.

367
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,238
And now it is certain.

368
00:38:33,262 --> 00:38:34,615
To who?

369
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,991
Baba!

370
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:37,826
Come here, my loves. Come.

371
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,870
You may go outside and play.

372
00:38:39,894 --> 00:38:47,894
I'll be right out.

373
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:04,269
I have known
since Haniwa grabbed at my hand

374
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:09,650
and told me the sun had a sister
that came out at night to play.

375
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:12,361
I know.

376
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:18,075
So, what Jerlamarel told you was true,
Baba Voss.

377
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:23,413
These twins are the beginning
of a new world.

378
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:25,415
I say we declare the truth.

379
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:28,335
They are my babies.

380
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:32,256
Already Souter Bax and Gether Bax
speak of us as witches.

381
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,842
They have friends, more and more.

382
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:42,866
I say we hide, we hide the truth.

383
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:49,022
Jerlamarel said 12 summers.

384
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:53,610
We say nothing until then.

385
00:39:53,634 --> 00:40:01,634
And until then,
they will live with their eyes closed.

386
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,836
Once upon a time,

387
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:16,592
there were four brothers and sisters
living happily together in a village,

388
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:19,261
just like ours.

389
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:21,972
They all worked together every day.

390
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:26,226
One made the most fragrant perfume.

391
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,647
Another baked the sweetest cakes.

392
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:34,067
Another played the most exquisite music.

393
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:39,323
And the fourth wove silk
for sheets and dresses

394
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:44,495
that felt like warm snow.

395
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,706
And they all worked happily together
every day,

396
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,460
and they never quarreled.

397
00:40:51,484 --> 00:40:53,295
But then one day,

398
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:59,009
a boy came along who said
he was their long-lost older brother.

399
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:03,597
But when the sisters and brothers
asked him what he did...

400
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:09,269
he said he told people the truth.

401
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:12,272
"What truth?" they asked him.

402
00:41:12,296 --> 00:41:15,734
"Well," he replied...

403
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:21,907
"I could tell you
that one of you is very handsome..."

404
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:26,662
one is quite pretty, one is plain...

405
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:30,624
"and one of you is very ugly."

406
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:34,211
The family were very puzzled
by his words...

407
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:40,968
because, if you hadn't guessed already,
the names of these brothers and sisters

408
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:44,972
were Scent, Taste,

409
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:48,851
Sound and Touch.

410
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:54,356
And there was no "ugly"
and there was no "pretty" in their world.

411
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:01,363
"But which one of us is which?"
they asked him, their brother.

412
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:07,619
"Well, since you can't know,
you shouldn't care," he replied.

413
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:11,039
And, with that, he went to walk off.

414
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:18,380
"Wait! What's your name?"
they called to him.

415
00:42:18,404 --> 00:42:24,094
"My name is Vision," he replied.

416
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:31,268
And with that, he rode away
and left them all alone to wonder.

417
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:37,274
Soon, the family started quarreling
about which one of them was beautiful

418
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:40,819
and which one was ugly.

419
00:42:40,843 --> 00:42:46,325
Each one of them spent so much time
wondering about what Vision had said...

420
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:49,286
that the perfume lost its scent...

421
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,247
the cakes lost their taste,

422
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:55,626
the music lost all harmony,

423
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:01,548
and the silk became threadbare and torn.

424
00:43:01,572 --> 00:43:08,263
Until, at last,
one day they came together again...

425
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:12,351
and they decided to forget
what Vision had told them.

426
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:18,774
Because before he came,
they'd all been perfectly content.

427
00:43:18,798 --> 00:43:24,238
And soon, they were content again.

428
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:32,262
Because they decided
that just four was just enough.

429
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:41,145
And they all lived happily ever after.

430
00:43:50,705 --> 00:43:53,141
Hi-ho.

431
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:56,436
Hi.

432
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:02,109
I have brought a gift
for the twins to share...

433
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:06,113
for their birthday tomorrow.

434
00:44:06,137 --> 00:44:09,116
Since the river thawed,
you haven't spoken of it.

435
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,617
Of what?

436
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:13,704
We've been waiting for this day to come.

437
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:17,916
Twelve years, Maghra.

438
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,670
Of course,
you are free to do as you choose.

439
00:44:21,694 --> 00:44:28,010
Well, that is good of you, Paris.

440
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:35,684
If you think they are still too young,
how long will you wait?

441
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:40,522
Baba Voss and I have made a decision.

442
00:44:40,546 --> 00:44:48,546
What is buried stays buried... forever.

443
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:50,407
That is your choice?

444
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:52,034
It's our choice.

445
00:44:52,058 --> 00:44:54,453
Nothing comes between us, Paris,
not even you.

446
00:44:54,477 --> 00:44:58,624
So they just walk around
with their eyes closed and grow,

447
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:00,083
live, die here.

448
00:45:00,107 --> 00:45:01,752
- And only here...
- To live!

449
00:45:01,776 --> 00:45:04,004
That is the thing. No, Paris?

450
00:45:04,028 --> 00:45:06,715
That is what I want for them,
that they live.

451
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,467
If their secret should slip,

452
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:10,469
if something from that box
should give them away,

453
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:14,556
if something, anything were to happen,
and a thousand other "ifs,"

454
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,350
they would burn.

455
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:19,394
Or if the books in the box
should tell them to leave the village

456
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:22,606
and they become food for lions and bears,

457
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,858
then they will die.

458
00:45:24,882 --> 00:45:29,905
And if you're dead,
your eyes are closed forever.

459
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:33,325
One day, someone will find us,
will find them.

460
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:35,285
Maghra, they need to be prepared.

461
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:38,539
- Enough!
- No, not enough!

462
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:40,833
This life is not enough.

463
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:42,709
Your excuse is not enough.

464
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:48,423
I don't need to give you any excuses.

465
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:49,550
What about Jerlamarel?

466
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:52,761
Jerlamarel?
Jerlamarel did not raise these children.

467
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:54,179
He did not break their fevers.

468
00:45:54,203 --> 00:45:59,893
He did not love them to sleep
because he was gone, just wandering.

469
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:02,312
Your voice.

470
00:46:02,336 --> 00:46:05,732
You hate him.

471
00:46:05,756 --> 00:46:08,152
Why?

472
00:46:08,176 --> 00:46:12,614
Maghra?

473
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:15,450
And why are you taking your hate
out on them?

474
00:46:15,474 --> 00:46:19,913
Mama!

475
00:46:19,937 --> 00:46:22,166
Go away, Paris.

476
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:30,190
I want to be with my children.

477
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,024
Paris.

478
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:50,402
Hey, come in. Come sit.

479
00:46:50,426 --> 00:46:53,030
My babies.

480
00:46:53,054 --> 00:46:59,161
My big ones, happy birthday.

481
00:46:59,185 --> 00:47:04,458
You are 12 years old today.

482
00:47:04,482 --> 00:47:06,168
My.

483
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:10,631
For 12 years, you have kept a secret.

484
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:14,551
And you have kept it very well.

485
00:47:14,575 --> 00:47:18,805
I wonder, could you keep another?

486
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:20,390
What is it?

487
00:47:20,414 --> 00:47:26,688
It is for you and for you only.

488
00:47:26,712 --> 00:47:32,694
It is the greatest birthday gift
of all time.

489
00:47:32,718 --> 00:47:33,862
What are they?

490
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:35,405
They are books.

491
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:37,574
We think they are books.

492
00:47:37,598 --> 00:47:43,080
Here. Here are the instructions that will
help you hear what the books are saying.

493
00:47:43,104 --> 00:47:44,581
Instructions from who?

494
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:46,500
From your father.

495
00:47:46,524 --> 00:47:48,335
What does Dad know about this?

496
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,796
No.

497
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,716
From your true father.

498
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,426
What?

499
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,929
I only know what your mother told me.

500
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,764
I was hoping
that she would tell you herself.

501
00:48:00,788 --> 00:48:02,683
We already have a father.

502
00:48:02,707 --> 00:48:08,355
I know, who loves you so very much, Kofun.

503
00:48:08,379 --> 00:48:10,524
Haniwa...

504
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:15,154
there is also a man...

505
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:19,324
who rescued your mother in a blizzard.

506
00:48:19,348 --> 00:48:21,660
That's the story she told.

507
00:48:21,684 --> 00:48:26,165
She was lost, and he saved her.

508
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:30,043
And he stayed with her.

509
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:33,130
And when she came to our village,

510
00:48:33,154 --> 00:48:37,843
you two, twins, were already inside her.

511
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:40,888
- His name is Jerlamarel.
- No, no.

512
00:48:40,912 --> 00:48:42,764
- Wait, Haniwa.
- Kofun.

513
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:45,225
Haniwa. He mustn't tell anyone.

514
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:48,312
Here. Take the message and read it.

515
00:48:48,336 --> 00:48:56,336
You are brave. Go.

516
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,427
Maybe we're witches.

517
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:23,013
Maybe the stories about vision are true.

518
00:49:23,037 --> 00:49:26,266
No.

519
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,811
I have the truth in my hands.

520
00:49:28,835 --> 00:49:35,776
Soon I will know and you will not.

521
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,574
Go ahead.

522
00:49:42,598 --> 00:49:44,451
"Once upon a time,"

523
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:48,580
almost all humans had the power
that you have.

524
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:53,252
Human beings used this power,
and the power of their minds,

525
00:49:53,276 --> 00:49:56,046
to conquer the world.

526
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,632
They built machines that could fly,

527
00:49:58,656 --> 00:50:02,094
machines that could speak
across thousands of miles.

528
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:06,932
They even left the earth in giant ships.

529
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:13,730
Such was their power, they began
to outgrow the earth and destroy it.

530
00:50:13,754 --> 00:50:21,071
Some say sight was taken from them by God
to save the planet from destruction.

531
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:25,784
But after so many years,
the gift of light is being restored,

532
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:33,417
given only to chosen people with
an instruction to build the world again.

533
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,627
I am your father.

534
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:39,464
And I have passed this gift on to you.

535
00:50:39,488 --> 00:50:42,718
It is your duty to make use of it.

536
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:44,887
Learn from the books I have left.

537
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:47,973
I have chosen the books with care.

538
00:50:47,997 --> 00:50:51,477
I have also left instructions
where you should go

539
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:55,105
when you feel you are strong enough
to leave your village.

540
00:50:55,129 --> 00:50:58,692
When you come, I will be waiting.

541
00:50:58,716 --> 00:51:03,906
Together, we will begin the world anew.

542
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:09,119
With all my love, your loving father...

543
00:51:09,143 --> 00:51:16,210
"Jerlamarel."

544
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:24,234
What should we do?

545
00:51:34,377 --> 00:51:36,897
You opened the box.

546
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,190
I did, Baba Voss.

547
00:51:38,214 --> 00:51:41,819
Without permission.

548
00:51:41,843 --> 00:51:47,699
Jerlamarel saved their lives from a bear,
and yours.

549
00:51:47,723 --> 00:51:50,118
He built a bridge.

550
00:51:50,142 --> 00:51:54,581
And guided our tribe to safety.

551
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:58,001
And he made one request of you:

552
00:51:58,025 --> 00:52:01,755
"Let them learn."

553
00:52:01,779 --> 00:52:07,135
Let them discover the truth.

554
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:14,601
Then let them choose.

555
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,478
Maghra will burn the books.

556
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:18,730
- So do not tell her.
- You would have me lie?

557
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:26,321
For years, you told the twins
you were their father, out of kindness.

558
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:34,079
Now, you must be kind to Maghra.

559
00:52:34,103 --> 00:52:42,103
Silence is not a lie.

560
00:52:46,782 --> 00:52:48,510
I heard them talking about leaving.

561
00:52:48,534 --> 00:52:53,140
You know they must someday.

562
00:52:53,164 --> 00:52:55,142
- And when they leave...
- No.

563
00:52:55,166 --> 00:53:03,108
When they leave,
the books will give them knowledge.

564
00:53:03,132 --> 00:53:08,697
Baba Voss, you are a good man.

565
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:11,200
- But you have not always been.
- That is enough.

566
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:16,038
Just because we are hiding here
doesn't mean the world has changed.

567
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:22,586
But the twins,
Baba, the twins might be the change.

568
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:26,298
They are hope, Baba.

569
00:53:26,322 --> 00:53:28,342
Think of the things you have witnessed.

570
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:33,222
Think of the deeds you have done.

571
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:40,145
Pay the world back, Baba.

572
00:53:40,169 --> 00:53:48,169
Silence is not a lie.

573
00:54:04,151 --> 00:54:11,593
Baba?

574
00:54:11,617 --> 00:54:19,617
Don't waste a log. I'll keep you warm.

575
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:46,128
Are you all right?

576
00:54:46,152 --> 00:54:54,152
Yes. Everything is all right.

577
00:55:04,295 --> 00:55:12,295
Come to bed.

578
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,991
What do you got?

579
00:55:58,015 --> 00:56:06,015
You?

579
00:56:07,305 --> 00:57:07,810

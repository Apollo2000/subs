1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:06,649
<i>Tell me what you know about Jerlamarel.
Tell me about his children.</i>

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,861
There is a small cave.
There you will find a box for my children.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:15,658
Bury the books. And for 12 summers,
we will not speak a word of this.

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:20,622
Twelve years, you have kept a secret.
Could you keep another?

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,125
They are books from your true father.

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,544
You opened the box.
Maghra will burn the books.

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:30,423
<i>So do not tell her.
The books will give them knowledge.</i>

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:36,804
It was Baba Voss who condemned my mother,
your own sister, to the bonfire.

9
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:44,828
I'm gonna send news of a witch. A message.
Who knows who will find it?

10

11
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:51,426
Chet-chet!

12
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:59,518
Chet-chet-chet!

13
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:15,786
Still recognize your melody...

14
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,708
the way your right is heavier
than your left.

15
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:24,378
But now you shift uneasily
from foot to foot.

16
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:27,131
You never used to. You were solid.

17
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:31,469
Life, experience...

18
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:39,352
they rock me from side to side.

19
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:47,376
Welcome home, Tamacti Jun.

20
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:55,926
Majesty.

21
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:06,295
My tour of duty is done.

22
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,882
My commission was for 20 summers.

23
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:12,218
And those summers have turned to winter.

24
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:15,805
You brought taxes and tribute?

25
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:23,829
Yes.

26
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:35,908
The axles groaned through the mountains.

27
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:39,745
A hundred carts, God bone, grain,

28
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:46,502
diamond for axes, axes for wood, slaves.

29
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:50,923
You're a fine tax collector.

30
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:54,343
But you're not a finder of witches.

31
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:59,098
In every village, I interrogated,

32
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:04,770
presagers would say, "Jerlamarel.
No, no, sir. I don't know that name."

33
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,148
I burned all who lied to me.

34
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:08,399
You spread his name.

35
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,985
In order to find him.

36
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,614
You were a prophet for him?

37
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:17,200
Gathering people,
telling them about his power,

38
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:22,872
giving them his name,
scattering his seeds?

39
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:25,583
As your Witchfinder general,

40
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:31,672
I have come to report that
I have failed my queen...

41
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:34,550
and I accept the natural consequence.

42
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:37,136
But I ask only this:

43
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,974
instead of execution on the altar...

44
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:47,480
you allow me to take my own life...

45
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:50,525
in the manner of a warrior.

46
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,444
Your Majesty, the people are rejoicing.

47
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:57,532
The elders are dividing the spoils.
The warehouses are being filled.

48
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:02,995
A market for the slaves is put into ropes.

49
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:06,290
Our most exalted general has returned.

50
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:07,416
Tamacti Jun?

51
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,921
Yes. It is I, Tamacti Jun...

52
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:17,218
who have returned with a hundred carts
when it should've been a hundred and one.

53
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:21,931
Your Majesty, his failure to find one man,
one heretic,

54
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:25,017
must be balanced against
this sound of hundreds calling his name.

55
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,479
Lord Dune, go to the high altar.

56
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:31,774
Tell the people to gather.
I'll speak to them.

57
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:39,798
I, too, will rejoice.

58
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:48,098
Tamacti Jun.

59
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:55,256
Yes.

60
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,844
In recognition
of 20 years' loyal service...

61
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:03,806
you have my permission...

62
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,520
to take your own life.

63
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:17,544
Farewell.

64
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:54,023
Lord Dune, why are you still here?

65
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:58,277
You could have ordered him to live.

66
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:03,616
Tamacti Jun understands the nature
of his failure better than you.

67
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,244
Outside,
they're celebrating their own doom.

68
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,620
One man lost.

69
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:11,249
No!

70
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:16,212
Our power lost!

71
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:20,633
Jerlamarel's a god striding across
the world, making more gods,

72
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:26,472
who will make more gods!

73
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:29,267
Tamacti Jun knows what is lost.

74
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:33,896
Go.

75
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,110
Tamacti Jun! Tamacti Jun!

76
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:44,407
Come, come.
He's over there, under the tree.

77
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:48,452
Who's where, under what tree?

78
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,163
Turkeys.

79
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:54,167
So, you go around
and drive them towards me.

80
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:56,711
Ready?

81
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,588
Hush, Daddy.

82
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,214
Feel.

83
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:03,509
I made something.

84
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:07,805
From the books, for hunting.

85
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,185
Listen.

86
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:20,209
And learn.

87
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:27,575
- I got it. Come.
- What?

88
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,495
I read in one of the books from the box

89
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:36,459
something very interesting about
the people who used to live in America.

90
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,127
What is America?

91
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:41,839
This is just the beginning, Daddy.
I've read so much.

92
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,758
With the right machines and enough power,

93
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:48,137
we could make weapons much
more powerful than what I just used,

94
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:51,224
to kill a hundred in one hour.

95
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:53,559
Or they had these bombs...

96
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,687
Things called "bombs"
that could blow up whole cities.

97
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:59,440
Half your words are book words to me,
love, and they mean nothing to me.

98
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,609
Well, what about this turkey?

99
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,611
Turkey means dinner.

100
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,571
Every day I could go out.

101
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:10,243
I could get deer, even.

102
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:14,080
Just like Jerlamarel.

103
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:18,876
You say deer.

104
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,170
And how exactly would I explain that
to your mother?

105
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:27,677
That is exactly what Kofun says.
Everything we learn, he wants to hide.

106
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:30,388
You know I enjoy a tasty deer.

107
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,723
I don't even like turkey.

108
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:40,747
- Makes me sleepy.
- I know, Papa.

109
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,250
What are you doing?

110
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:05,173
I could kill any one of them
at any time...

111
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,966
and they wouldn't even know what it was.

112
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,179
They'd say it is
the God Flame's vengeance.

113
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,431
Even though we know

114
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:18,895
the God Flame is
a bunch of gas 93 million miles away...

115
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,981
- burning in outer...
- Stop!

116
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,108
He didn't leave us books
so that we can make weapons.

117
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:28,029
How do you know? Why did he
leave us books? What was his reason?

118
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,572
Explain, Professor.

119
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:35,203
Stop.

120
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,454
Do you think about it?

121
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,247
Think about what?

122
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,625
What it'll be like when we meet him.

123
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:46,589
If we meet him.

124
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:50,176
This will guide us.
It's a picture of the world.

125
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,639
Look,
I've already worked out where we are.

126
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:58,726
See, our river flows
to this bigger river called Mississippi.

127
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,938
And then...

128
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:04,690
this was once a city called Pittsburgh.

129
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:06,275
- Pittsburgh.
- I think it was...

130
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,195
Industrial town known for the production
of steel manufactured goods.

131
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,696
Goddens' History of America.

132
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,119
Our father left us with the knowledge
and wisdom from all ages of humanity,

133
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:20,081
and yet, somehow, Kofun,
you make it boring.

134
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:21,958
"Boring" is bows and arrows.

135
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:29,982
"Boring" is reading and not doing.

136
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,848
- Chet-chet!
- Chet-chet-chet!

137
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:41,060
Last night, a baby was born...

138
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:44,939
to Souter Bax.

139
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,775
But the baby was not whole.

140
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,237
The baby was not formed human.

141
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:58,619
Because you witches cursed me!

142
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:02,248
You should burn them...

143
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:05,585
not follow them.

144
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,963
What came from her was...

145
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,131
a devil.

146
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,799
And it's their fault.

147
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:15,052
The baby was not born that way
because of any curse.

148
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,722
God Flame, welcome her.

149
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:21,350
It was born that way
for want of fresh blood.

150
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,979
When so few are together for so long,

151
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,607
the blood of the tribe thickens.

152
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:30,610
We have known through the generations
that without new blood,

153
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,570
the monsters would come.

154
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:36,741
- Simple genetics. DNA clusters...
- Hush, Haniwa.

155
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:40,828
This baby is a warning to us.

156
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:44,749
And we should heed that warning.

157
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,668
We need to share ourselves and be shared.

158
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,003
No.

159
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:53,382
We must go out again and join
the festival, dance away the monsters.

160
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:57,053
We have avoided the festivals
for a reason.

161
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:59,555
Out in the world, we are hunted.

162
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,058
Here, we are safe.

163
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:05,478
Perhaps here, we might be a little smarter
about choosing partners.

164
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,397
The need is deep, Baba Voss.

165
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,359
New blood is needed here,
and has for a long time.

166
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:16,739
I said, no.

167
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:19,867
These people have been held here
for so long.

168
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:22,954
Held here? Held here?

169
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,413
They have been protected here.

170
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:27,458
The one does not out-rule the other,

171
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:30,878
especially since so many of them dispute

172
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,840
whether we are here to protect them
from the Witchfinder,

173
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:38,302
or to protect your children from them.

174
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:41,264
They have done without medicine
while sick.

175
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:44,475
They have done without trade
while wanting.

176
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:48,146
They have done without.

177
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,358
And if you forbid them from travel...

178
00:14:52,382 --> 00:15:00,382
they will start leaving on their own.

179
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:15,840
Our people wandering the countryside
on their own.

180
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:19,719
They'll lead the Witchfinder to us
in no time.

181
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:23,848
Then maybe it's better we have some
control over where they wander

182
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:27,935
and who they come in contact with.

183
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:34,317
What do you propose, my love?

184
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:38,696
I know the way to a festival.

185
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,720
They have some medicine, goods,
and new blood.

186
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:56,589
The only way to protect Haniwa and Kofun
is to make sure that this place is secure.

187
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:01,594
And if that means we have to control
where the Alkenny goes...

188
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:09,618
then that's what we'll do.

189
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,719
I'll be told when it's done?

190
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:51,743
Yes, Your Majesty.

191
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,452
It is done?

192
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:12,999
News from the Sun Grave, Your Majesty.

193
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:21,023
News?

194
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:54,665
Great God Flame,

195
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:58,669
accept my spark into your flame

196
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:06,693
and let it rise to meet you.

197
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:38,141
It's not over.

198
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:46,608
It's not over.

199
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:51,597
We'll be gone for a week.
The festival's a few days' walk.

200
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:53,641
Antia is going, and she's younger than us.

201
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,019
Haniwa, I am not risking anyone
finding out about your gift.

202
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,313
We've kept our secret safe here
for 17 summers.

203
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,940
Well, not without suspicion.

204
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:03,276
We're better at keeping secrets
than you know, Mama.

205
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,695
Meaning what?

206
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:08,281
You are not old enough to share
or spread your seeds.

207
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:10,116
We don't want to share disgusting seeds.

208
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,285
Well, then you should be happy to stay.

209
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,665
Why would someone like me
want the seed of a blind man?

210
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,418
Come here.

211
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:27,341
I said, come here.

212
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:30,845
Why would you speak this way?

213
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:37,185
I don't know. I'm sorry.

214
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,521
Because I love you all...

215
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:43,065
and you all love me,

216
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,444
I ignore certain voices in my head...

217
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:54,468
because I know you would not lie to me.

218
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:10,468
By accident of birth,
you were given the ability to see.

219
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:14,013
Do not think you are superior
because others cannot.

220
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:22,037
And keep your book words to yourself,
because sometimes those words are wicked.

221
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:31,239
Mama, these flowers will rot
before I even get there.

222
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,117
These flowers are for you,
to smell along the way,

223
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:39,205
to find the feeling to enter
into the dance.

224
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:41,040
Who says I'll dance?

225
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:45,211
It's long past time, Bow.
Your father and I danced.

226
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,754
Form up.

227
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,923
- Baba?
- Love.

228
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,260
Remember, Alkenny, let us be known as
"the people of the waterfall."

229
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:59,350
Let us not speak of the past.

230
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:07,374
Travel well.

231
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,898
Hey.

232
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:48,608
Haniwa.

233
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,026
Slow down!

234
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,654
We're upwind. They can't hear us.

235
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:57,658
I'd like to keep it that way.

236
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:05,682
Happy?

237
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,669
Kofun.

238
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:16,693
We're going to see the world.

239
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,278
What is that?

240
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:39,450
Maybe this is one of those places the
spaceship took off and went to the moon.

241
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:42,620
Look. Look at that wheel.

242
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:48,835
I don't remember reading
about cars that size.

243
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:56,859
Come on, before it gets too dark.

244
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:22,034
Fresh wool. Fine, like silk.

245
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:30,058
Mesh to mend your clothes.

246
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:55,526
I am the priest of the God Flame,

247
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:01,449
brother of the fire,
who shapes me like God bone.

248
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:05,036
Executor of God's will.

249
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,123
We have built this temple of flame.

250
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,585
We have brought witches to burn.

251
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,547
All have been convicted
of having the power of light.

252
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:18,257
A Witchfinder is here.

253
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,425
Behold...

254
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:21,761
No. This is something different.

255
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:29,602
As we turn the witches of light
into heat.

256
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:32,021
Please.

257
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:34,232
They can't even see.

258
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:36,984
Look at their eyes.

259
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,986
They're being burned for nothing.

260
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:45,034
- Stop!
- Please.

261
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:53,058
You're wrong! They can't even...

262
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:59,549
The Witchfinder has missed us,
but his message has traveled.

263
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:07,573
Made disciples.

264
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,117
The children will never be safe.

265
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:31,372
The children will be safe at home.

266
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,292
Everyone thinks home is safe...

267
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:42,316
until it isn't.

268
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,388
Help!

269
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:18,412
Haniwa!

270
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:52,805
Strong.

271
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:59,187
Young.

272
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,939
Healthy...

273
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:09,963
For once, these sheep
are not held behind their fences.

274
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:24,295
Fethin?

275
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:30,510
Fethin!

276
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:36,098
Fethin!

277
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:40,311
Slavers! Slavers!

278
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:41,521
What is it?

279
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:44,482
There's Slavers!

280
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:50,321
They took my Fethin!
They took my little girl!

281
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:54,617
Fethin!

282
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:57,954
Fethin!

283
00:28:57,978 --> 00:29:01,582
They were Slavers!

284
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,044
Mama. Mama, Papa, wake up. It's me.

285
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,963
What are you doing here?

286
00:29:06,987 --> 00:29:08,714
Mama, I think something bad has...

287
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:11,300
Where's Kofun?

288
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,177
Where's Kofun?

289
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,012
I think he's...

290
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,514
I think he's been taken.

291
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,641
By whom?

292
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:26,665
I think he's been taken by Slavers.

293
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:49,714
What do you think you're doing?

294
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:51,507
Why have we stopped?

295
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:59,531
The boy thought he'd take a break.

296
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,728
- Something's wrong with him.
- I'll find out.

297
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:06,105
No.

298
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:09,233
I will.

299
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:13,696
You scream, I will gut you.

300
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,325
Can't you hear her? She's hurt.

301
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,328
She keeps tripping, so I'm tripping.

302
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,621
So, don't trip.

303
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:29,645
No, please! She's bleeding.

304
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:34,884
How do you know?

305
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:36,636
I'm a Scentier.

306
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:42,767
I can smell the blood. And she's limping.

307
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:49,732
It is not her foot
my customers are interested in.

308
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:54,153
A bit of spirit.

309
00:30:54,177 --> 00:30:58,032
This one will get a good price.

310
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:06,056
Move!

311
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,050
There! I see smoke.
They follow the Sage Road.

312
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,552
They will stray from it.

313
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,178
For you, but not for me.

314
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:21,180
They will leave a trail. I will see it.

315
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:26,060
- I will gather warriors. We pursue!
- There's no time.

316
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:30,148
Few men will come. I need them back.

317
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:38,172
Haniwa, lead the way.

318
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:43,221
Hemlock. It's theirs.

319
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:44,388
You certain?

320
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:48,935
Absolutely.

321
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:52,146
Mama? Papa?

322
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,565
There's a message here.

323
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:58,945
Kofun left a message.

324
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:00,154
What message?

325
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:04,033
How could he leave a message?

326
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:07,453
You're just going to have to trust me.

327
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:15,477
Trust you? What message?

328
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:26,597
Kofun has written a message,
and I can read it.

329
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:31,144
No. How do you know those words?

330
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:37,316
How do you know "written" and "read"?

331
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,444
It's knowledge from the box, Mama.

332
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:42,321
We opened it.

333
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:45,158
We have learned to read and write.

334
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:51,539
And we read all the books he left behind.

335
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:55,126
Who opened it?

336
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:00,840
I did.

337
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:04,802
What does the message say?

338
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:07,263
- Mama, I...
- My son is missing!

339
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:15,287
I want him back! So, what does it say?

340
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:47,444
Guards!

341
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:07,965
Sit!

342
00:35:14,187 --> 00:35:20,086
What's your name?

343
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,630
Kofun.

344
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:26,675
My name is Fethin.

345
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:34,699
Did you really think telling the Slavers
I was hurt would make them help me?

346
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,854
Okay, you're welcome.

347
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:42,316
No, I didn't mean it like that.

348
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Thank you.

349
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:56,539
Careful. Many rocks. Many rocks.

350
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,916
Mama.

351
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,293
I'm good.

352
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:01,460
Yes.

353
00:36:01,484 --> 00:36:06,465
I see ahead,
smoke coming from inside a structure.

354
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:08,551
- Are the towers made of God bone?
- Yes.

355
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:10,803
It's where they hold the slaves
before they sell them.

356
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:13,347
If I don't get to him now,
he'll be sold to the market.

357
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:21,371
How do you know, Papa?

358
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:25,860
I know this place...

359
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:30,448
because my father was a Slaver...

360
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:34,994
and his father before him.

361
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:43,018
And for a time, so was I.

362
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:48,090
It's not as you think, Haniwa.
Your father was different.

363
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:53,721
Do not tell her that. It isn't true.

364
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:58,476
I was raised to chain and whip

365
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,732
and beat and sell innocent people.

366
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:09,570
He taught me how to torture.

367
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:15,827
But I've buried that part of me,
that man...

368
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:20,331
deep down in a hole.

369
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:24,168
But now I must do something
I swore I would never do.

370
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:27,505
What?

371
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:32,385
Wake him up.

372
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:35,763
- Papa, I can go with you. I have my bow.
- No.

373
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,598
No, my love.

374
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:44,522
You must not see what I'll become.

375
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:52,546
I will get Kofun back.

376
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:48,711
I will get mighty God bone for you.

377
00:38:48,735 --> 00:38:56,735
Mighty God bone.

378
00:39:30,694 --> 00:39:34,841
Chet-chet!

379
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:42,865
What was that?

380
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:23,363
Close your eyes.

381
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:39,549
Wech.

382
00:41:39,573 --> 00:41:44,554
The great Baba Voss.

383
00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:48,474
The great coward.

384
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:51,144
The great...

385
00:41:51,168 --> 00:41:55,648
deserter.

386
00:41:55,672 --> 00:42:00,486
Finally, my day has come.

387
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,574
And I will have your head.

388
00:42:04,598 --> 00:42:06,868
Upokokohua.

389
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:14,375
Haere Mai!

390
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,420
Pick it up.

391
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:25,444
Papa, watch out!

392
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:38,373
Your boy!

393
00:43:42,779 --> 00:43:50,779
No...

394
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:03,750
Papa.

395
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,537
It's me.

396
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:17,165
Mama, it's me.

397
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:19,083
Mama, it's all right.

398
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:21,252
- Kofun?
- It's all right.

399
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:22,336
Kofun.

400
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,756
Mama, it's all right.

401
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,841
It's all right.

402
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:29,093
Haniwa. Haniwa.

403
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:34,473
I'm here, Mama. We're all here.

404
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:36,809
I'm sorry.

405
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,312
I'm so sorry.

406
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:43,399
- I'm sorry about the box.
- It's okay.

407
00:44:43,423 --> 00:44:51,423
I'm sorry.

408
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:05,270
Mama?

409
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:37,719
- Mag...
- No.

410
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:40,456
Mama!

411
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:48,480
No.

412
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:59,702
Mama?

413
00:46:59,726 --> 00:47:04,040
All we have learned from our books,

414
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:09,212
and all we have learned
from the festival...

415
00:47:09,236 --> 00:47:14,842
all we have learned in 17 summers...

416
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:20,681
None of it makes me wanna leave here.

417
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:23,309
And Haniwa?

418
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:31,333
What of you?

419
00:47:31,383 --> 00:47:34,570
A man is dead.

420
00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:37,156
A bad man...

421
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,953
but still, he's dead.

422
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:43,955
I killed him

423
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:51,712
because I knew I had the power to kill him
and not be caught.

424
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,423
All that I've learned...

425
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:56,926
all that I've read...

426
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,429
all of it...

427
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:05,226
all of it makes me want to leave here.

428
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:10,273
But, Mama...

429
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:13,359
I'm scared of...

430
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:17,530
what I am and what I can do.

431
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:24,162
And I just want you to know
that I love you, Mama.

432
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:26,747
And I love you, Papa.

433
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:30,960
And one day,
my big mouth might get me burned.

434
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:34,881
No.

435
00:48:34,905 --> 00:48:40,678
I already know.

436
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:45,016
I know.

437
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,311
I know you.

438
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:53,232
My babies...

439
00:48:53,256 --> 00:48:57,945
Because I knew him.

440
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:03,034
And it's time I told you about him.

441
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:06,746
Jerlamarel.

442
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,916
It's time for the truth...

443
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,421
for all of us.

444
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:18,591
He was a good man.

445
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:26,390
But sometimes power can consume goodness.

446
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:28,559
I'll tell you about him.

447
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:32,647
Baba, go and get Paris.

448
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:40,671
She should hear this too.

448
00:49:41,305 --> 00:50:41,165

1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,253
The festival's a few days' walk.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,215
Kofun. We're going to see the world.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:10,177
Behold! We have brought witches to burn.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,348
The Witchfinder has missed us,
but his message has traveled.

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>Where's Kofun?</i>

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,519
Help! Haniwa!

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,022
- Kofun has written a message.
- How do you know those words?

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,690
It's knowledge from the box, Mama.

9
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,318
We opened it.
We have learned to read and write.

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,041
And we read all the books he left behind.

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,031
Your boy!

12
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,286
<i>A message.</i>

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>It will flow downstream
through a dozen different valleys.</i>

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,917
News from the Sun Grave, Your Majesty.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,418
It's not over.

17
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,971
<i>Chet-chet!</i>

18
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:53,146
<i>Chet-chet-chet!</i>

19
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,372
They have come for the witches at last!

20
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,583
Before we came here,

21
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,753
we had a chance to give the witches up,

22
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,005
but they enchanted you all.

23
00:03:00,422 --> 00:03:02,591
Now is your moment to repent.

24
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,426
Let us rid ourselves of them!

25
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,472
They are the ones to blame
for the danger we are facing today,

26
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,849
and they must answer for it!

27
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,851
Everyone knows

28
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:13,935
To the river...

29
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,605
that you have been our true enemy
this whole time!

30
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,274
Hold them! Don't let them go!

31
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,526
Do not let them leave!

32
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,279
We will use them
as a bargain for our lives.

33
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:25,947
I have him! I have him!

34
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:30,243
Stand back!
The witch has me by the throat!

35
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,536
We have to leave now.

36
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,060
Get them to the river. To the river.

37
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,916
- Let the devils pass!
- Arca!

38
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,667
We'll be rid of them soon enough!

39
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,752
Matal!

40
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:41,380
Go.

41
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,133
Go with them. Live.

42
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,218
I love you.

43
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,652
Matal.

44
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,908
What is she doing?

45
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,661
Bow?

46
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:13,995
I'm coming with you.

47
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:15,914
Come with me! Follow!

48
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,458
Kofun.

49
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,587
You have no use for me.

50
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:24,548
Let me go.

51
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,550
He deserves to die.

52
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,385
No.

53
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:31,680
No.

54
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,520
If I were a devil for real,
I would take great pleasure.

55
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:46,695
But we're not that kind of tribe.

56
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,297
I am Tamacti Jun.

57
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:55,138
Witchfinder General for Queen Kane
and the Holy Guardians of the Payan.

58
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:59,684
At last, Witchfinder,
you have come to save us.

59
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:01,812
On your knees.

60
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,397
What?

61
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:06,983
All of you.

62
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:22,332
For your lives...

63
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,294
give up the children of Jerlamarel.

64
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,716
We Alkenny are good people.

65
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:34,177
Quiet people.

66
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,264
Please...

67
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,768
Witchfinder, please.

68
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,188
The witches are gone.

69
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,321
Until proven otherwise...

70
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,533
you're all witches.

71
00:06:58,076 --> 00:06:59,536
Holy Guardian!

72
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,497
This is Gether Bax!

73
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,667
The witches, they've run!

74
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,878
Follow me!

75
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:15,052
Wait. It's a dead end.

76
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,513
No, my boy. This is where we descend.

77
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,811
Look.

78
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:29,274
Dad.

79
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,986
You did this? Alone?

80
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:36,114
Anything Jerlamarel can do,
I can do, only bigger.

81
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:38,200
What is it? What's below us?

82
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,035
Freedom, Mama.

83
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,664
Dad built a boat.

84
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,461
Son.

85
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,256
When did you do this?

86
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,050
When I could.

87
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,819
You'd be surprised
how much you can accomplish

88
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,804
before your eyes even get open
in the morning.

89
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:00,972
Why?

90
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:04,810
Like you,
I hoped this day would never come.

91
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,562
But you prepared for it?

92
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,067
Yes, I did. And because of it,
we will live to see tomorrow.

93
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,234
The ones that fled...

94
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,070
was one of them a builder?

95
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:00,031
Yes. Yes, a very skilled one.

96
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:05,245
Cross.

97
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,067
- Dad.
- I know. I can hear them.

98
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:20,987
Give me my sword.

99
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:44,720
They are ahead. Both sides.

100
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,725
We travel silently.

101
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:34,770
I have been looking for you...

102
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,523
for a lifetime.

103
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,364
I was there when you were born.

104
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:54,748
I heard your first cries.

105
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:03,590
And ever since, I have devoted my life
to finding you again.

106
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:14,267
I have laid waste to so many lives
to reach you.

107
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:17,938
And now...

108
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:21,858
what next?

109
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:27,155
Nearby, there's a village
filled with your kinsmen

110
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:31,034
all on their knees
begging for my forgiveness.

111
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,706
Perhaps you can purchase it for them.

112
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,461
Speak.

113
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:46,967
Let me hear the sound of your voices

114
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,095
for the first time
since they were newborn wails.

115
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,933
Announce yourselves.

116
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:00,313
And let me escort you to meet your queen.

117
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:05,235
Do it...

118
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:08,905
and the village lives.

119
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,375
No?

120
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:38,328
Help!

121
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,461
No!

122
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,185
- Baba!
- Maghra.

123
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,783
Wait, Mama.

124
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:33,467
No!

125
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,512
Mom!

126
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:58,784
Go!

127
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,376
Arca!

128
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,323
What lies downriver?

129
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:40,534
Can we pursue?

130
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,370
I've been run through.

131
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:48,125
What lies ahead?

132
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:53,004
Perhaps you can be saved.

133
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:56,007
Open waters, deep water.

134
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:57,884
They'll move quickly.

135
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,721
You will not be able to catch them.

136
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,515
Help me.

137
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,446
There. That should save you some time.

138
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,952
Return to the village. Kill them all.

139
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,123
Herald.

140
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,295
Message for Queen Kane.

141
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,673
The witches have escaped.

142
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,901
Tamacti Jun sends news.

143
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,695
Did he locate the witches?

144
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:43,407
Yes. But, for the moment,
they escaped him.

145
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,951
They escaped him again?

146
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,663
- How?
- He doesn't say.

147
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,791
So we must guess,

148
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,752
or invent for ourselves.

149
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,170
Lady An,

150
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:03,009
when the God Flame burns our skin,
do you blame God or yourself?

151
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,846
Neither one, my queen.

152
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,307
I blame my maid for not shading me.

153
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:14,062
Gods are not blamed.
No one is blaming you.

154
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,775
But perhaps this news means
Tamacti Jun should return home.

155
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:21,194
No.

156
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:25,490
But to undertake such a journey,
Tamacti Jun will need more soldiers.

157
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:27,075
Majesty, please...

158
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:29,828
Send more. Send all of them.

159
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,205
These are fathers and mothers,

160
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,832
husbands and wives,

161
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,834
daughters and sons.

162
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:39,504
Their families have suffered
their absences.

163
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:43,633
They are tired of this...
fruitless crusade.

164
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,719
It's beyond their understanding.

165
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:49,973
The holy machines are groaning too,
Your Majesty.

166
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:53,560
The gods themselves
do not understand this.

167
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:56,646
But you understand
what the gods are saying?

168
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,525
Yes! They are saying "enough!" Enough!

169
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,156
There...

170
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:10,577
in our ancient constitution.

171
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:18,960
"And the monarch
shall rule the parliament,"

172
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:22,756
"and the monarch shall rule until death."

173
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,341
I'm not feeling unwell.

174
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:29,012
Majesty,
here is what the people of Payan say.

175
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:31,556
As you fuck them like prayer mats.

176
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,852
Plainly, simply, you have
chased the witches for a generation.

177
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:37,771
Yet none has been found.

178
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:40,232
You have sacrificed our army,

179
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,692
emptied our treasure houses.

180
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:47,280
Still there is no proof of evil power.

181
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,200
Just...

182
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:55,163
a man you once loved
who ran away from you.

183
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:05,173
They say we are a nation
governed by a broken heart.

184
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:28,215
A message from Jerlamarel.

185
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:35,389
A message to present to the children
once they were ready to leave us behind.

186
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:38,016
It is a message for eyes.

187
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,021
More surprises from Jerlamarel?

188
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:47,818
I gave him my word.

189
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:51,696
I would present it no sooner
than when they were ready for it.

190
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:55,283
It's the last of my messages from him.

191
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:59,454
Last of my promises to him.

192
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:01,039
Are we sure?

193
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,167
Yes, we are.

194
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,920
Go ahead.

195
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:14,594
"My dear children..."

196
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,349
the river is the beginning.

197
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:23,812
The first step of your long journey
back to me.

198
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:27,899
Follow the river to the lavender.

199
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,277
"The great lavender road."

200
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:32,654
The lavender road is real.

201
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:37,325
"Then follow the lavender road
to the House of Enlightenment."

202
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:41,913
There, I will build a new kingdom.

203
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,417
A bright shining light
in a world of darkness.

204
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:49,129
And one day, you will come to me
and know what I know.

205
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:53,592
"And carry this knowledge forward
to the darkest corners of the earth."

206
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:58,939
- "Those with eyes to see must follow me."
- "...see must follow me."

207
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:07,439
So, what? We just follow the river?
For how long?

208
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:10,525
He'll leave us signs.

209
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,447
- We'll make it.
- Will we?

210
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:17,365
What other choice do we have?

211
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:18,784
We have a choice.

212
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:23,538
Listen to me.

213
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,042
Look at me.

214
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:40,472
The longer the journey,

215
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:44,267
the more profound its challenges,

216
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:48,146
the more it changes all who endure it.

217
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:52,776
A journey like this one...

218
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,032
Those of us who could survive it,

219
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:03,328
I fear, would emerge on the other end
of it unrecognizable to each other.

220
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:22,973
What kind of answers
will the House of Enlightenment provide

221
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:27,018
to any of us
if we no longer recognize ourselves?

222
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:38,989
I will abide to whatever our vote decides,
but you must hear this.

223
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:45,454
We have a choice to live as we are.

224
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,789
We can gain some distance
on the Witchfinder,

225
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:50,792
who most certainly continues his pursuit
as we speak.

226
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,756
And we can move far away
from anywhere he might track us...

227
00:25:57,174 --> 00:26:02,554
and live our lives simply, and quietly,

228
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:04,598
and together.

229
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:19,237
Mama, I don't know that I can ever know
who I really am

230
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:21,948
until I know where I came from.

231
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,539
And I can't know that
until I know Jerlamarel.

232
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:36,880
And you?

233
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:44,179
I don't think I'm meant to be someone
who hides from the world.

234
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:47,891
I don't think I want to be someone
who ignores the truth

235
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:49,893
because I'm afraid of what it might mean.

236
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:55,649
I see.

237
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:01,530
Shall we take the vote?

238
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,410
All those in favor of leaving the river
and finding shelter.

239
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:07,828
Chet-chet.

240
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:09,830
Chet-chet.

241
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:15,627
All those in favor of following the trail
of Jerlamarel.

242
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,254
- Chet-chet.
- Chet-chet.

243
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:19,798
Chet-chet.

244
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,054
There's still one vote left to be cast.

245
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:33,103
- No.
- We are one tribe, Haniwa.

246
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:34,813
We are one tribe.

247
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:36,690
We.

248
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:40,527
The ones who have been in this together
from the beginning.

249
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,362
I agree with Paris.

250
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,198
Right now we are all that remain
of the Alkenny,

251
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:47,367
and Bow Lion shares that connection.

252
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:50,078
The Alkenny were willing to hand us over
to the Witchfinder

253
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:51,621
in order to save themselves.

254
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,957
They did what they did.

255
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,627
But they also taught you, they fed you,

256
00:27:58,086 --> 00:27:59,921
they loved you, and befriended you.

257
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:03,884
They uprooted their lives to save yours.

258
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,636
And the very first chance they got,
they betrayed us all.

259
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:10,742
There are six of us on this boat,
and everyone will be heard.

260
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:11,767
No.

261
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:16,772
She has absolutely nothing to do
with this.

262
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:17,939
Haniwa.

263
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:21,526
I vote to follow the river.

264
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,908
I vote with Haniwa and Kofun.

265
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,662
Arca, Matal, my mother...

266
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,209
We've sacrificed too much to stop now.

267
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:41,463
Then we have decided.

268
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,267
General!

269
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:55,894
Report.

270
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:57,604
Good news, General.

271
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,607
We believe the terrain ahead
is treacherous but may be passable.

272
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,069
The column needn't be camped for more
than a half day while we scout it out.

273
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:07,489
No one's stopping
until either we're all dead

274
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:11,159
or we find the children of Jerlamarel.
Understood?

275
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:13,787
- Understood.
- Good.

276
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:15,747
So move!

277
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:25,006
Then it must be done to kill the queen.

278
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,091
A god?

279
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,718
Who here still believes that?

280
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:29,720
What we believe is not important.

281
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:32,264
Many of the people of the lower walls
still believe it.

282
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:37,144
- If we deposed...
- Deposed their god, they would rise up.

283
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:39,312
- We have soldiers.
- So few.

284
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:42,107
Then we must not be the ones
to depose her.

285
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,610
If even we fear to do it,
who else possibly would?

286
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:49,030
To kill a god, one must enlist a god.

287
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:54,202
Her death must involve no struggle,
no blood, no weapon.

288
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,706
No evidence of human hand whatsoever.

289
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,876
And then the people from the lower wall

290
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:05,881
will hear that their queen was struck down
by divine intervention.

291
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,802
And they will say, "This is justice."

292
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:31,865
I'm too merciful.

293
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:41,166
We could pray.

294
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:46,755
I pray only for the truth.

295
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,467
What do you hear?

296
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:54,388
There are new whispers about you.

297
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:59,226
Who whispers? Lady An? Lord Dune?

298
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:02,229
Yes, and others.

299
00:31:04,856 --> 00:31:06,066
Give me names.

300
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:12,155
All of them, my queen.

301
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,236
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

302
00:31:52,362 --> 00:31:54,573
You have no reason to go
where we're going.

303
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:56,825
If you voted against us,
you wouldn't have to.

304
00:31:58,952 --> 00:31:59,995
They're gone.

305
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,623
Everyone's gone.

306
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,043
Where else am I gonna go?

307
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:14,092
Still. Still you chose the harder path.

308
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:18,013
The more dangerous one. But why?

309
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,642
I don't know you and your sister
very well.

310
00:32:23,602 --> 00:32:26,063
Not like I knew the others in the village.

311
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:30,275
Because we were the only ones
you couldn't spy on.

312
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,278
I know you're a shadow.

313
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,449
I may not know all your secrets...

314
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,745
but your sister's anger
has never been a secret to anyone.

315
00:32:43,955 --> 00:32:45,707
I voted that way because...

316
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:50,837
I don't know what difference it makes,
and I'm done fighting for today.

317
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:55,759
She isn't angry.

318
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,345
I mean, she isn't angry with you.

319
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:05,185
Look, this is just a lot for her,
and she's trying her best.

320
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:07,771
And sometimes that comes out as anger.

321
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:15,320
Isn't it hard for you too?

322
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,918
Thank you for trying to speak to me.

323
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:34,548
I'd like to be alone now.

324
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:49,271
Hey, do you need help?

325
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:52,274
Yes. I made these.

326
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,901
- To give to Bow.
- Okay.

327
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,570
For you and Haniwa.

328
00:33:57,988 --> 00:33:59,614
We need to stop for the night.

329
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:02,784
She needs to rest by a fire.

330
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,291
Yes.

331
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,130
Are you all right?

332
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:24,347
She's never spoken to me that way before.

333
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,350
Argued with me, yes.

334
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:30,187
Defied me many times, but...

335
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:35,984
this was just something so different.

336
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,618
If the vote had been a tie
and I'd broken that tie against her,

337
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:47,412
I honestly don't know
what she would have done.

338
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:55,837
We told them to hide who they were
their whole lives.

339
00:34:57,714 --> 00:35:01,385
Told them it wasn't safe
for anyone to know.

340
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:08,100
We never really knew
who they were supposed to be.

341
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:11,560
How could they?

342
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:17,150
Maybe the further up this river we go...

343
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:21,154
the freer they'll be to find out.

344
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:02,696
Your Majesty?
Your handmaiden delivered my invitation?

345
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:05,323
Indeed, she did, Lady An. Indeed, she did.

346
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:08,118
Your Majesty, welcome.

347
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:25,052
The smell of sex
and the sound of songbirds.

348
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,262
The divine combination.

349
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:29,473
And as I told you in my invitation,

350
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:32,142
I have a special pleasure in store
for you.

351
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:37,272
Everyone not invited, leave now.

352
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:49,326
A new song. A new bird.

353
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:52,954
You will be the first to hear it
inside the palace walls.

354
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:57,417
And who will stay to share my delight?

355
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,879
It is I, Your Majesty.

356
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:03,048
With your permission.

357
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:06,093
Of course, Lord Dune. I know it'd be you.

358
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:12,391
We think the strange new bird
has been blown off course by a storm.

359
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:18,397
My net man heard it singing
in the apple trees and managed to trap it.

360
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:21,900
Well, then that man will be rewarded.

361
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:25,445
As will you, Lady An.
And you, Lord Dune, for thinking of me.

362
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,115
And here is our new guest.

363
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,377
I don't hear a song.

364
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,049
I'm told this particular bird
only sings when you take it in your hand.

365
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:49,970
Yours will be the first hand to hold it.

366
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:53,390
Well...

367
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:56,601
then open the door of the cage, Lord Dune.

368
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:12,909
Birds usually tremble among people.
I don't hear it tremble.

369
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:16,413
Perhaps it's not afraid.

370
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:27,340
And I am not afraid.

371
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:31,303
You see, my whole entire parliament
agreeing to my death,

372
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,638
this whole rotten city wanting me to die.

373
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:38,393
I've decided I won't die for this city.
This city will die for me.

374
00:38:41,897 --> 00:38:43,106
You can go first.

375
00:38:58,038 --> 00:38:59,039
Okay.

376
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:09,674
We've traveled a good distance.

377
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:13,720
As long as we keep moving by daybreak,
we should be fine.

378
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:17,808
One of us should stay awake through
the night to keep watch and tend the fire.

379
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:23,730
Sit with me.

380
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:39,746
Mama...

381
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,625
Tell me.
What do you imagine it will be like?

382
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,093
What will what be like?

383
00:39:53,802 --> 00:39:56,972
"There, I'll build my kingdom," he says.

384
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:02,686
We're all gonna risk life and limb
to get to this place.

385
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:04,730
So, tell me.

386
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:08,650
What do you imagine
this kingdom will be like?

387
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:15,490
Well...

388
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:23,915
I imagine...

389
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:31,590
it will be... a place
where we'll remember things.

390
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:36,219
About what things were like for us once.

391
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:40,098
About who we used to be.

392
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:43,560
About...

393
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:48,356
how to use that knowledge
to make things better now.

394
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:53,820
I imagine...

395
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:57,574
it will be a place where...

396
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:01,578
I won't be the strange one anymore.

397
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:07,292
Where I can help
to build something important...

398
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:11,004
and do it without having to hide who I am.

399
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:18,011
If your father builds himself a kingdom,
you would be its princess.

400
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:24,267
It's not like that.

401
00:41:25,102 --> 00:41:28,146
I would do whatever he asked me to do.
However I could help.

402
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,816
And who would I be in this kingdom?

403
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:34,027
You'd be its queen.

404
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,950
I don't think so.

405
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:43,495
A king with vision...

406
00:41:44,663 --> 00:41:47,416
a prince and princess with vision.

407
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,460
I'd be the one without.

408
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:54,840
I'll be the strange one.

409
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:58,135
The one they say is weak.

410
00:41:58,218 --> 00:42:00,303
I would never let anyone say that.

411
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:02,097
I know you wouldn't.

412
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:11,440
It is important for me
to reach this place.

413
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:14,443
But it's not about me.

414
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:17,154
It's about all of us.

415
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,034
We'll all be better off there.
I really believe that.

416
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:34,296
We should all rest awhile.

417
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:37,466
Okay.

418
00:44:23,488 --> 00:44:25,782
Kofun, my sword is missing.

419
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:27,200
My bow's gone, too.

420
00:44:27,784 --> 00:44:29,578
- Maghra.
- Bow, check the boat.

421
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:31,079
- Chet-chet.
- Maghra.

422
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:33,331
- I thought one of you was awake all night.
- Come.

423
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:34,624
- We were.
- Come.

424
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,084
Then how did this happen?

425
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:38,920
Someone walked all through our camp,
woke none of us,

426
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:41,214
- and was seen by neither of you?
- I don't know.

427
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,051
It's all gone now, isn't it?

428
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:47,429
- Help me. We need to go.
- Okay. Now walk.

429
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:48,638
We can't leave.

430
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:49,973
We must.

431
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:54,478
All that was taken was weapons.
It's nothing irreplaceable.

432
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:56,354
- I'm missing something.
- Come.

433
00:44:57,147 --> 00:44:58,231
What are you missing?

434
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:02,235
It's a small pouch. It's soft.
Size of a fist.

435
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,695
What is in the pouch?

436
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,365
Something very important to me.
The only thing I have left of my father.

437
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:10,118
- My only connection to him. It's...
- Okay.

438
00:45:10,202 --> 00:45:13,914
It's irreplaceable! We have to find out
where it went. We have to get it back.

439
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:16,583
- But, Mom, what is it?
- It's important.

440
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:19,836
Maghra, listen...

441
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,380
Please can you just...

442
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:24,549
Don't ask me to say anything more.
Just help me find it.

443
00:45:26,176 --> 00:45:29,012
My love, we are unarmed.

444
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:32,516
Whoever came last night may return.

445
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,976
And the Witchfinder lurks out there
somewhere.

446
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,812
If we remain too long, he will find us.

447
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,480
Then we must hurry.

448
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,778
My father, my relationship with him
is not something I know how to talk about.

449
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:46,113
It's complicated.

450
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:49,074
And, of all people,
I would think you would understand.

451
00:45:56,581 --> 00:46:00,794
Whatever secrets I have kept from you
has been to protect us.

452
00:46:01,336 --> 00:46:04,715
Whatever secrets you have kept from me
has always been to protect us.

453
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:08,135
Please help me understand this.

454
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:13,056
Help me justify putting our children
in danger right now because I cannot.

455
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:15,809
I know.

456
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:20,897
What could possibly be so important
and still you'll not say it?

457
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:23,692
- I'll do it.
- No.

458
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:25,861
Haniwa.

459
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:28,530
She already knows everything
you're asking.

460
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:30,490
I'll find it for you.

461
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:34,077
If it were river bandits,
they're half a day away.

462
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,847
If it was the Opayol,
there could be hundreds of them.

463
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:37,622
A hundred of them won't see me coming.

464
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:40,459
Do you know how fortunate we were
to escape the Witchfinder?

465
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:42,669
Very fortunate.

466
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:44,671
Another fight and now without arms?

467
00:46:44,755 --> 00:46:47,174
I'm not suggesting
we get into a fight, Papa.

468
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,176
Whoever took it...

469
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:52,113
how can they fight me
if they don't even know that I'm there?

470
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:55,682
And besides, we don't know who they are.
We should at least try to figure out...

471
00:46:55,766 --> 00:46:57,225
I think I know.

472
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:02,481
- What?
- I think I know who took our things.

473
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,568
- What are you talking about?
- Look, please.

474
00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:12,115
What is it? What do you see?

475
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,632
Tell me. What is it?

476
00:47:32,302 --> 00:47:33,345
Tell me.

477
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:48,819
It is time, my queen.

478
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:51,571
News of Lady An's parlor has spread.

479
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:54,658
Demonstrations in protest of you
having killed several beloved lords

480
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:56,451
have begun about the lower wall.

481
00:47:57,244 --> 00:48:00,372
The palace guard keeps them at bay,
but for how long I do not know.

482
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:08,880
My queen?

483
00:48:11,717 --> 00:48:13,093
What happens next?

484
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:17,180
The remaining lords are convening.

485
00:48:17,264 --> 00:48:20,559
If they gain the trust of the mob,
there's no telling what they may do.

486
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:43,392
Father, whose power we feel
but cannot touch...

487
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,563
I accept my fate.

488
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:52,401
I thank you that I could choose its hour.

489
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:55,232
Jerlamarel,
you did not come for me, my love.

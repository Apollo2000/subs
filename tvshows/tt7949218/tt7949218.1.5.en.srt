1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,921
I have been looking for you.

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,216
Announce yourselves and the village lives.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,303
<i>The witches have escaped.</i>

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,515
A message from Jerlamarel.
It is a message for eyes.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,183
"My dear children,

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,395
the river is the first step
of your long journey back to me."

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:21,980
I'm missing something.

8
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,608
<i>Something very important to me.
We have to get it back.</i>

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,985
I think I know who took our things. Look.

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,155
There are new whispers about you.

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,116
Who whispers? Lady An? Lord Dune?

12
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,619
Her death must involve no struggle.

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,205
No evidence of human hand.

14
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,876
I've decided I won't die for this city.
This city will die for me.

15
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,587
Jerlamarel,
you did not come for me.

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,172
So I am coming to you.

19
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,571
<i>Chet-chet!</i>

20
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:54,746
<i>Chet-chet-chet!</i>

21
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,208
There you are.

22
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:29,675
Look what happened.

23
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,261
Look what I did.

24
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:37,808
Your story is over now.

25
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,438
All of you... I ended it.

26
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:49,861
But mine is just beginning.

27
00:03:58,745 --> 00:03:59,997
Goodbye, Father.

28
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:05,669
I always loved you...
even if you never did me.

29
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:09,715
Please, my queen.

30
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:31,528
God has abandoned us!

31
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:46,752
We are Payan. We are holy. We are chosen...

32
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,048
Come on, boy.

33
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:58,263
Okay. Good boy.

34
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:08,482
The beast has slept for too long.

35
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,108
And now it is awake.

36
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:20,702
Everything is ahead of us...

37
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,580
everything that matters.

38
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,110
Ooh.

39
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:56,279
Ooh.

40
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,378
Thank you.

41
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:15,966
What have I done?

42
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,594
You gave me some time alone.

43
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:24,641
Resisted the urge to push for answers
you know I can't give.

44
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:34,735
What could be so important about
some trinkets your father gave you

45
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:39,656
that you would risk your children's lives,
your husband's life...

46
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,993
just to retrieve it?

47
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:50,876
I'm sure if there were more to that story
than you've already divulged,

48
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:54,421
you would've told them
before you would tell me.

49
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,260
I will say, though...

50
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:04,514
there is a different question...

51
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,435
I have spent the last little while...

52
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,022
unable to silence in my mind.

53
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:16,693
What question is that?

54
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,448
The day you arrived in our lives...

55
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:27,329
do you remember the last thing
Jerlamarel said to me as he left?

56
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:30,207
I don't.

57
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:36,254
He said, "Be careful."

58
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:42,928
In that moment, and in every moment since,

59
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:45,889
I assumed he meant...

60
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:52,688
"Be careful with this woman I love,
with the children she's soon to bear."

61
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:57,359
His words have been like a rock to me...

62
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:03,490
something solid to hang on to
all these years.

63
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:14,292
But with all that has changed
since we left the waterfall

64
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,628
and set off up this river...

65
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:22,467
I wonder if I misunderstood what he meant.

66
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,429
What else could he have meant?

67
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:32,978
Now your husband and children,

68
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:37,858
they have walked unarmed into
grave danger because you said so.

69
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:39,651
They hardly hesitated.

70
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,530
Nor did you.

71
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:53,874
I feel something growing in you
since we started upriver on this journey.

72
00:08:57,461 --> 00:09:02,758
Something in your voice,
in your way, Maghra.

73
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:06,928
Something formidable.

74
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:08,889
Something dark.

75
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:11,975
I am the same person you've known
for almost a lifetime.

76
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:19,274
I understand your confusion,
and I tolerate your curiosity.

77
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,612
But please do not suggest that my husband
or my children are in grave danger

78
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,989
because of my sinister motives.

79
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:31,202
Or that I am indifferent to their welfare.

80
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:46,134
Hold my hand.

81
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:53,934
Pray with me...

82
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:59,606
that they'll all come back
safe and unharmed.

83
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,743
These might be tracks here.

84
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:15,998
Where?

85
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:23,797
This is ridiculous.

86
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,061
What do you hear?

87
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:42,524
Nothing.

88
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,571
I hear humming.

89
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,240
Yes.

90
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:55,579
A bunch of people, and they're humming.

91
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,082
Coming from that way.

92
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,546
Humming? Who's humming?

93
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,992
Humming.

94
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:45,754
What is this?

95
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:50,050
Opayol. Scavengers.

96
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,407
There's no one down there.
It looks deserted.

97
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,033
It isn't.

98
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,619
They're about by night,
and they sleep by day.

99
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:19,663
They're the ones who took our things.

100
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,707
They're most definitely down there.

101
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,917
What I can't say is how many men.

102
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,045
I'm guessing there's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

103
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,006
- Easily.
- We're not turning back.

104
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm also guessing
they're a lot less unarmed than we are.

105
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:33,987
Whatever the significance
of your mother's possessions,

106
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:36,114
I am certain she would not want
either of you dead over it.

107
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,139
Me too.

108
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:42,310
But I can get in and out of there
without them even knowing I was there.

109
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:44,646
No one's going anywhere alone.

110
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,064
I have to go alone.

111
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:48,692
I'm least likely to get caught that way.

112
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,279
I can slip in and out.

113
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:54,448
You said so yourself,
they're probably asleep.

114
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,260
But if you wake one of 'em,
the other ones will come out quickly.

115
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,618
Then I'll avoid them.

116
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,707
Mama knew how difficult
it would be to find this,

117
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,334
and she's asked us anyway.

118
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:09,755
Are we saying that we don't trust her
to understand what that means?

119
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:12,817
Are we saying we think she's incapable
of making that kind of decision?

120
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:13,925
Okay.

121
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:17,721
Okay.

122
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:20,849
You're both right here.

123
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:22,476
I'll call out if I need help.

124
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,771
But I have to try.

125
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:05,602
This is a... terrible idea.

126
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:08,563
No, we should've stopped her.

127
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:10,357
How?

128
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,443
She would've done this for any one of us.

129
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,405
She would not have been stopped
by any one of us.

130
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,909
Honestly, I don't think this
has anything to do with us.

131
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:24,121
I think the moment that Mom
mentioned her father,

132
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:25,831
her connection to him,

133
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,375
Haniwa's decision was made.

134
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:33,547
You know, there wasn't even a decision
to be made. It was unavoidable.

135
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:01,950
The idea of an absent father,

136
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,577
the chance to reconnect,

137
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,786
it was just...

138
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,372
It was too much for her.

139
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,177
And I'm just afraid that
there's not gonna be...

140
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:43,510
Oh, no.

141
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:44,761
Haniwa!

142
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:00,736
Haniwa!

143
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,200
Haniwa. Haniwa.

144
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:13,749
- Is she still breathing?
- Yeah.

145
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,542
- Where's she hurt?
- I can't see.

146
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,419
Dad!

147
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,692
Wait. No. Wait. No, no, no, no, no!

148
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:09,971
No. Stop. Stop! You don't know who he is!

149
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,263
I don't care who he is!

150
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,308
His-His chest.

151
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,394
Look. Feel. Feel.

152
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,903
Get up. Get up.

153
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:31,535
He can see.

154
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:05,485
So empty here.

155
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:14,036
I was born into the sound
of the engines...

156
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,458
thunder, power...

157
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,377
meaning.

158
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:26,465
I spent my entire life bathed in it.

159
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,555
Never ventured far enough from the capital
that I couldn't hear it.

160
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,770
I always wondered what the world would
sound like if I'd ventured a little...

161
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:41,605
further.

162
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,277
Turns out, sounds like nothing at all.

163
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:50,030
How unbelievably boring.

164
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,534
Listen to the water, my queen.

165
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,540
And the wind.

166
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,961
And perhaps if you listen,
it might whisper its secrets to you.

167
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,259
There are no secrets here.

168
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,055
No information being bargained.

169
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,140
- Hmm.
- No stories being woven.

170
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:20,519
No strength, no fear.

171
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:23,146
Nothing.

172
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:27,567
Is this really how people
go about their lives...

173
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,321
in the absence of anything
of any importance?

174
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,575
I suppose so, Your Majesty.

175
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:40,747
This journey may require it,

176
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,542
but I don't think I'll be very good
at being that person.

177
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:48,296
I don't believe there's even the smallest
part of me that is built for it.

178
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:52,592
I'm hungry.

179
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:19,119
I'm hungry!

180
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:21,371
I'm ready to take my dinner.

181
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,416
Did you find eggs? 'Tis the season.

182
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,130
Driver?

183
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,384
I hear the fire dying. Did you find food?

184
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:36,136
Driver, where are you?

185
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:45,479
Save the fire.
It's choking on its own smoke.

186
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,232
Driver?

187
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:56,323
Driver? Fucking answer me.

188
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,738
Nyrie!

189
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,702
Nyrie!

190
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:25,370
Nyrie.

191
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,916
Nyrie!

192
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,252
I have whatever you want.

193
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:36,590
I have whatever you want.
I have rings. I have God bone.

194
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:38,383
So soft.

195
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:40,385
Exquisite fingers.

196
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:41,678
No rings.

197
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:44,514
No God bone.

198
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,601
We take you.

199
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:52,189
Nyrie?

200
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:58,028
Nyrie!

201
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,076
Mama, it's us.

202
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,160
Haniwa.

203
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:09,498
Come.

204
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,753
Did you find it?

205
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:20,175
Thank you.

206
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,350
I count four.

207
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,312
Who is our new friend?

208
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:35,857
They call him Boots.

209
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,485
Raccoon hides.

210
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,906
This is the creature who took our things.

211
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,991
Yes.

212
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,286
But he didn't know who we were,
and he didn't have a choice.

213
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,039
Let me explain, please.

214
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,502
All right.

215
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:07,055
When Jerlamarel left us,

216
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:11,393
left us to go to the House
of Enlightenment as he promised...

217
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:14,938
it seems he didn't go there directly.

218
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,566
He made a stop for the winter.

219
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:21,987
He approached the Opayol.

220
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,906
He lived among them for a year.

221
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,117
A year?

222
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:32,831
But... once his child was born...

223
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:35,751
he resumed his journey.

224
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:39,963
Boots is that child.

225
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:43,383
Boots is Jerlamarel's son.

226
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:45,844
Our brother.

227
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,729
After Jerlamarel continued his journey...

228
00:25:57,648 --> 00:26:00,651
the Opayol treated Boots like a slave.

229
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:05,572
Forced him to scavenge and steal for them.

230
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:10,202
Once word came that the Witchfinder
was campaigning through this area,

231
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:12,663
the Opayol left to seek safety elsewhere.

232
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:15,165
And they abandoned him here
to fend for himself.

233
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:17,834
Child! Child!

234
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:22,881
Are you suggesting
we bring him along with us?

235
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:24,132
Yes.

236
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:30,430
Aside from offering him a way out
of being treated like an animal...

237
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,851
aside from him being an asset to us,
a skilled fighter...

238
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:36,144
He can see.

239
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:38,981
Can't he?

240
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:44,194
Yes, he can see.

241
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:49,616
You... You two, you are in agreement?

242
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,161
Why is everyone being like this?

243
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:56,707
He is family.
We're not leaving him behind.

244
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,085
I've asked all the same questions
you have.

245
00:27:01,211 --> 00:27:02,963
I have expressed the same concerns.

246
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:04,089
And?

247
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:08,385
And if I was gonna forbid this
from happening, Paris,

248
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,929
I imagine you would have
heard me do it by now.

249
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:12,139
Don't you?

250
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:16,852
What else do you know about him?

251
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:20,105
Aside from his skill as a thief.

252
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,900
Do you trust him?

253
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:32,617
I have never had anyone to look after me
as you do for each other.

254
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,995
To be a part of that,

255
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:37,831
I will do whatever it is you ask of me.

256
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,841
Then let him come.

257
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:55,140
Let us begin to build for ourselves
an army of the sighted...

258
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,770
So long as its newest recruits are willing
to swear their allegiance

259
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:02,564
to the only general we have amongst us.

260
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,316
I swear it.

261
00:28:06,026 --> 00:28:08,904
No. Show us.

262
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,191
Such a perfect day.

263
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:55,742
Your total silence I find far more
interesting than her total silence.

264
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:06,461
You know, I will be there
when they slit your throats,

265
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:10,215
reminding you what a fucking mistake
you made today.

266
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:25,147
Too many times separating from you...

267
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,941
and worrying it'll be our last.

268
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,611
Let's never do it again.

269
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:43,081
I never told you much about him...

270
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,418
about my father.

271
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:49,796
I never asked you to.

272
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,507
It's never mattered to me
where you come from.

273
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,218
I know. Nor I you.

274
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:00,349
He gave this to me the day he died.

275
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:04,394
Been in his family for as long
as he could remember.

276
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:06,647
Open it.

277
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:16,615
All of that for this.

278
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:21,703
Must've loved him very much.

279
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:23,914
He was a very good man.

280
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:26,667
Kind, wise.

281
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,755
I think he would've liked you.

282
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,217
Let's not get carried away.

283
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:41,890
I wish I'd known him.

284
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:46,645
Perhaps you can tell me
more about him sometime.

285
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:49,940
I think I'd like that.

286
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:57,614
Kofun is right.

287
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,575
I should get moving.

288
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:02,995
Of course.

289
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:06,081
That boy, Boots...

290
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,959
you don't trust him, do you?

291
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:14,881
I haven't planned on trusting anyone new
for a while.

292
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:16,717
I see.

293
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,553
Then why did you choose to allow it?

294
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,033
I'm flattered you thought I have
any choice in the matter.

295
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:25,350
I'm being serious.

296
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,894
- I know.
- Why didn't you forbid it?

297
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,903
'Cause at the end of this journey...

298
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,949
they will meet a new father.

299
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:46,121
And I can't give them any new reason
to want one.

300
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,377
Kofun understands our choices.

301
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:54,171
He always has.

302
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,715
Doesn't take them personally.

303
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,595
But her...

304
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,144
I don't wanna lose her.

305
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,649
You won't.

306
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:25,494
Yes.

307
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,225
Love you.

308
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:09,162
They don't like me, do they?

309
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:13,875
They're scared...

310
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:16,086
and confused.

311
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,548
But they're good people.
They'll come around.

312
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:21,717
Do they like you?

313
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:24,511
What did you say?

314
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:26,346
They yell at you.

315
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,432
They question you, make you feel small.

316
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,935
That is how my people always treated me.

317
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,986
Why did they make you wear the mask?

318
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,991
They said I was not like them.

319
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:49,911
Not a man, but something else.

320
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:52,539
They said the mask would remind me.

321
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,797
My family loves me.

322
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,634
They don't always understand.

323
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:10,891
But I have never doubted
for one moment that they love me.

324
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:21,610
How you've been treated, it was wrong.

325
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:24,154
You deserve better than that.

326
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:27,532
But I promise...

327
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:30,327
you're one of us now.

328
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:33,413
You'll never be treated that way again.

329
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:41,463
Y-Your mother.

330
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:45,717
Do you think she will have room
to love another child

331
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,594
as she already loves you and your brother?

332
00:34:57,688 --> 00:34:59,314
That may take some time.

333
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:03,651
This is complicated for her.

334
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:07,698
But...

335
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:13,328
my mother has the biggest heart
of anyone I've ever met.

336
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:16,832
She does what's right.

337
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,377
She always does what's right.

338
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,812
- Why did you keep your secret for so long?
- How do you do that?

339
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:41,898
Do what?

340
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:45,026
Sneak up on people who can see you
sneaking up on people.

341
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:49,613
I wasn't trying to be sneaky.
Maybe you just weren't paying attention.

342
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,078
Will you answer my question?

343
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,247
What are you talking about?

344
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,874
What secret?

345
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:06,631
You kept it for so long,
you don't even know it's a secret anymore.

346
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,471
Why did no one in the Alkenny know...

347
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:16,558
that you could see?

348
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:20,270
Well, given how everyone else reacted
when the Witchfinder turned up,

349
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:21,834
I think my parents were probably wise

350
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:24,107
to not trust them
with that piece of information.

351
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,652
Hmm.

352
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:37,120
Baba and Maghra were stuck in the Alkenny.

353
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,916
And I guess they kept a secret
to protect you two.

354
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,460
Something like that, yes.

355
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,507
Can I tell you what it's like
to observe people

356
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,509
that don't know that
you're observing them?

357
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,144
They are completely vulnerable to you.

358
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,315
You could keep their secrets.

359
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,442
You could spread them to their enemies.

360
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,404
You could strike at them...

361
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,865
without them ever knowing who did it,

362
00:37:14,783 --> 00:37:17,536
or how, or why.

363
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:22,249
You could change their life.

364
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,168
Could end their life...

365
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:28,922
for any reason...

366
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:31,633
or no reason at all.

367
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:35,137
That is what gods do.

368
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:39,117
You might not know what this feels like

369
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:42,394
because you never made the choice
to hold that power over others.

370
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:45,731
It was made for you by your parents.

371
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,569
But I know.

372
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,660
And I suspect Jerlamarel knew, too.

373
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:06,043
For me,
it brought me closer to those I shadowed.

374
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,379
For Jerlamarel...

375
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:15,177
he fathered a child among them
and abandoned him.

376
00:38:15,802 --> 00:38:18,347
So, what does any of this
have to do with you, anyway?

377
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,352
Maybe I find it amusing that you can see
and still observe so little.

378
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,161
Where am I?

379
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:43,163
The City of Worms.

380
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,795
Where am I?

381
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:09,356
Ah, my friends.

382
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:12,526
What have you brought me?

383
00:39:13,276 --> 00:39:15,737
I have a horse. It needs water.

384
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:18,657
And I'm tired. I need to sleep.

385
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:20,283
I've ridden all day.

386
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,828
I need oil for my ass
and a maid to apply it.

387
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,913
After I've slept, I will speak to you.

388
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:26,748
You've made a mistake...

389
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,049
Mmm.

390
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:41,304
Exquisite fingers.

391
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:47,686
You have done well. Thank you for this.
She will be... perfect.

392
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,276
A silkworm is a fascinating creature.

393
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:56,862
Would you like to know why?

394
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:03,869
She begins so small, so innocent,
unassuming.

395
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,164
But in the course of her very short life,

396
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:10,334
she creates a substance of such beauty,
such perfection,

397
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:12,878
that the wealthiest men in the world,

398
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:16,214
men who could dress themselves,
their wives, their concubines,

399
00:40:16,298 --> 00:40:18,717
in whatever they desire,

400
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:22,137
choose... this.

401
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:27,267
And when her life has run its course,
her usefulness expired,

402
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:32,189
she spends her final days sadly grotesque.

403
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:36,652
A winged creature with the urge to fly

404
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,945
but denied that ability.

405
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:42,616
A husk of herself, used up,

406
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,577
eager for death.

407
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,539
You will come to know her well here.

408
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,919
You will come to understand her.

409
00:40:55,796 --> 00:40:59,800
My friend, you do not want me in here.

410
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:03,387
I haven't met a worm in my life.

411
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:09,518
Yeah. Perhaps for a time, it'll amuse you.

412
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:15,691
But soon you will regret it!

413
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,541
Is that so?

414
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,629
I wonder who you might be
to make such a claim.

415
00:41:39,756 --> 00:41:42,551
Delicate hands unused to being worked.

416
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:45,387
An impudent mouth unused to being struck.

417
00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:47,723
A woman of wealth...

418
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:53,395
accustomed to wielding authority
or the authority of a husband, perhaps.

419
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:57,858
But from... where?

420
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:07,075
The Witchfinder's campaign
brought him through here not long ago.

421
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:09,745
When he was asking for information,

422
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:14,791
his accent reminded me of the time
I spent in Kanzua,

423
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:19,671
selling our goods to the high-born
with money to burn.

424
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,094
Your accent brings back
those same memories.

425
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:33,769
You were a noblewoman, I presume.

426
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:38,482
Perhaps even a councilor
to that bitch queen.

427
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:41,943
But no matter.

428
00:42:42,569 --> 00:42:45,989
Here you will be the same as the rest,
or even less so, perhaps,

429
00:42:46,073 --> 00:42:48,825
as everything must be learned
from the beginning.

430
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:52,412
If you work hard for me,
you will live well.

431
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:56,375
If you try to escape, you will not
get far, and the consequences will be...

432
00:42:58,043 --> 00:42:59,169
unpleasant.

433
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:02,589
You are an interesting one.

434
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:08,136
I look forward to whatever time
we are able to spend together here.

435
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:14,851
Hear me...

436
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:17,270
Jerlamarel.

437
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:19,982
Jerlamarel.

438
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:21,900
Kofun?

439
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:24,861
Yeah. Here, Dad.

440
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:26,613
Is the boat free?

441
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:30,409
It's unmoored, but it's stuck.

442
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:32,703
What do you mean "stuck"? Stuck where?

443
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:34,329
Tide's gone out.

444
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:39,451
What are we gonna do?

445
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:47,676
We're gonna have to wait till morning.

446
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:27,966
Come.

447
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,011
Run.

448
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:32,429
Come.

449
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:35,182
Run.

450
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:13,720
They can't ride through this, can they?

451
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:16,264
They can. But it'll slow them down.

452
00:45:26,984 --> 00:45:28,151
I hear them.

453
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,863
- Haniwa.
- Yes.

454
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:35,701
Take your mother and Paris
and find shelter for them.

455
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:37,869
I love you. Go. Go.

456
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,670
They're everywhere.

457
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,592
Dad, I'll-I'll stand with you.

458
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,513
Yes, you will, son.

459
00:46:18,618 --> 00:46:20,620
Stay here.

460
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:24,666
Everything will be all right.

461
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,740
Ooh.

462
00:48:26,997 --> 00:48:27,998
Maghra?

463
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:30,876
Maghra?

464
00:48:34,755 --> 00:48:36,340
Baba Voss!

465
00:48:44,348 --> 00:48:45,450
Where's Mama? What happened?

466
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:47,142
- She's gone.
- Haniwa!

467
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:49,412
- Haniwa.
- No.

468
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:52,314
Baba, I had her by the hand.

469
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,398
They took her?

470
00:48:53,482 --> 00:48:55,984
No, she let go of my hand.

471
00:48:56,401 --> 00:49:01,281
She whispered to me.
She said, "Be careful."

472
00:49:04,368 --> 00:49:05,369
Mama?

473
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:09,998
Mama!

474
00:49:21,885 --> 00:49:23,387
Tamacti Jun!

475
00:49:30,102 --> 00:49:33,730
Do you hear my voice, Witchfinder?

476
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:39,486
Do you hear me?

477
00:49:57,421 --> 00:49:58,547
Speak.

478
00:50:01,216 --> 00:50:02,426
Witchfinder...

479
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:06,304
can you hear me?

480
00:50:08,181 --> 00:50:10,976
I hear the voice of a dead woman.

481
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,687
Then listen closer.

482
00:50:50,474 --> 00:50:51,808
Take my hand.

483
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:00,942
And speak.

484
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,944
Hail...

485
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,156
Princess Maghra...

486
00:51:08,492 --> 00:51:13,205
of the House... of Kane.

487
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:23,000

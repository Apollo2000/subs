.. Vickers. Yeah, I heard.

60
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,530
So, what do they say about him?

61
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,810
He's just moved back after two years PCSO.

62
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,330
Neighbourhood?

63
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,810
He hasn't done it.

64
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,850
Is there anything else he hasn't done?

65
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,810
What can I say? He jumped the queue.

66
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,890
It wouldn't be my decision, Ryan.

67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,810
Straight on Response?

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,730
No skills, no experience?

69
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,250
So, what has he got?

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,620
A dad with stripes on his arm
and the big corner office.

71
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,490
Look... just don't ride him too hard.

72
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,130
So what? Treat him the same
as everyone else, yeah?

73
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,410
Exactly. And remember, the
Chief picked you personally.

74
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,820
Oh, course he did. I'm the best
baby-sitter in the business.

75
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,740
- Sir.
- Sir.

76
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,170
Jake, meet Ryan.

77
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,700
Ten weeks. You and me.

78
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,300
Let's go.

79
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,490
All right, Jake. I don't know
what you know and what you don't,

80
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,340
so we'll start at the very beginning.

81
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,740
Do you know how to do your vehicle checks?

82
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,410
So why did you want to do this?

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,770
Next step. Done two years PCSO, so...

84
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,130
I already know your CV.

85
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,010
I want to know why you wanted
to become a police officer --

86
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,970
cos in my experience, there's
three different types.

87
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,250
Fighters, who just want to punch people.

88
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,570
Then you've got your speed freaks,
who just want to drive fast.

89
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,850
And then, there's your bed wetters.

90
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,290
Finally get a chance to
throw their weight around,

91
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,250
now they can hide behind a uniform.

92
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,370
So, which one are you?

93
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,170
Suppose I'm a chip off the old
block. Dad's a policeman...

94
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,810
Let's just be clear. You
MIGHT be a policeman --

95
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,060
your dad is a politician.

96
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,100
Let's go!

97
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,170
I just...

98
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,890
I just want you to know,
I'm totally up for this.

99
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,410
- I'm bricking it, obviously... Nervous...
- You should be --

100
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,930
cos I'm going be all over you.

101
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,290
Anything that comes between you and
your ability to do the job properly

102
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,210
will become my problem.

103
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,260
So, is there anything you need to tell me?

104
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,850
Er... Open book, really.

105
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,780
I'm gay, 22, single...

106
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,250
So, what about you?

107
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,250

you put the knife down?

Yes, OK. You're sorry.

You've made a bit of a mess

Are you happy for us to

Is it OK if Jake does it?

It's his first day, but I
reckon he'll do a good job.

Look, I'm going to have
a quick look round.

140

know about? Sharps? Needles?

All right.

- All right, keep your arms
up for me, mate. - That's it.

144

Keep them up.

you keep flailing about.

I couldn't think of anything else to do.

151

Things get on top of me, you know?

152
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,340
Hey... I'm here, all right?

153
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,650
I'm not going to leave you.

154

Now, keep them up. OK?

155
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,730
How are we getting on in here, then?

156
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,890
Nathan, do you remember
me? We've met before.

157
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,530
You come outside with us,

get in our nice, warm van and we
can pop down to the hospital...

We just need the doctor to take
a quick look at those arms...

161
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,570

Please be on the lookout
for a stolen digger,

165
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,370
taken from a building
site in Stanmer Park,

166
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,890
- described as a commercial-type
digger... - Nice job.

167
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,340
It's all about how you
talk to people, isn't it?

SPLASH

169

I've seen a huge
improvement since last time.

170
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,450
I'd even say he's enjoying it.

171
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,490
'It's always been about
confidence with him.'

172
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,010
But once he got over his
nerves, I knew he'd enjoy it.

173
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,370
'He's definitely got more
movement in his socket.'

174
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,090
Hopefully, we'll be able
to build up the body mass.

175
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,330
He even jumped straight
in the pool this morning.

176
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,120
Oh, bless him...

177

from the swimming pool.

216
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,890
he was lying on the
floor, covered in blood --

217
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,410
Kaleem standing next to him.

- My son.

Hello, Kaleem. My name's Jo.

220
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,280
How old are you?

221
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,450
He's eight. He's off sick.

222
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,210
Do you like superheroes, Kaleem?

223

Who's your favourite?

224
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,050
Would you like to tell me what you saw?

225
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,240
He didn't see anything.

226
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,410
When the teacher was taking the register,

227
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,730
she realised Lauren hadn't
come in with the others.

228
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,970
I warned them about him.

229

Oh, God -- my little girl!

We split up 18 months ago.

Yeah, we will.

237
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,130
We've got his mobile and car registration

238
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,370
and we're trying to
locate him as we speak,

239
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,720
so if you could tell me
a little bit about him?

240
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,020
Is there a history of mental illness?

241
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,730
He's a depressive --

242
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,770
paranoid, volatile...

243
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,490
But he won't get help.
Can't hold down a job...

244
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,210
Do you have any reason to believe
that he might hurt your daughter?

245
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,860
I don't know.

246
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,740
I don't know what he's capable of.

247
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,450
You said it was your first day.

248
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,860
It is.

249
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,170

Being a cop?

252
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,530
Yeah. So far, so good.

253
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,220
I had a job once.

254
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,340

my mother's a lawyer.

I'll be with you.

Anything else?

Maybe we could go out afterwards?

- Just for a bite to eat?

Good news.

We've been able to locate
James to within a mile radius.

382
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,850
We've placed a marker on his vehicle
and put out an "all ports" warning.

383
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,770
Thank God. So, when are you going
to move in, get Lauren back?

384
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,490
It's not as simple as that.

385
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,410
But you just said you'd located him.

386
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,460
We don't have an exact location. It's a...

387
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,890
It's a process of triangulation.

388

390

My daughter might not have time!

391
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,160
Would you like to me to get a...

392
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,010
.. family liaison officer?

393
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,460
No!

394

No, I don't want a family liaison officer.

something, before it's too late.

Been bled on, spat on and felt up.

400
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,370

00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,570
He's faster than us and he's pulling away.

474
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,820
We will be with you in...

475
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,610
You said it was the Bravo Two Seven!

476
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,740
A27... Oh, shit!

477
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,890
Alpha, sorry. Alpha.

478
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,340
TYRES POP

479
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,850
We're losing him.

480
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,500
Sorry, mate.

481
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,330
Vehicle is still on the road,

482
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,180
ALPHA Two Seven, heading east.

483
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,090
Come on. Come on.

484
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,280

It's a loss, loss, loss.

487
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,850
The thing is, we were trying
to catch some really bad men

488
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,690
and we went and caught
your daddy, by mistake.

489
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,730
Thanks for being so reasonable about it.

490
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,210
We'll get you towed,
get you somewhere safe.

491

00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,610
'Go ahead, Donna.'

493
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,810
Can I have recovery for a
vehicle on the Bravo Two Seven

494
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,530
to Brighton Central Tyres?

495
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,330
Recovery is for a manual vehicle,

496
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,690
which has been stung by police in error.

497
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,740
'Copy that, Donna. Your location, please?'

498
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,010
Location is the Stanmer Park junction.

499
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,730
The vehicle is a green hatchback,

500
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,250
registration November Two Five
Eight Hotel Lima Whisky, over.

501
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,490
'Control received, are you aware
that the vehicle is marked on PNC

502
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,210
'as an "urgent stop and
detain all occupants"?

503

'Do you have the occupants with you?'

504
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,690

the area now.' - I said I'm sorry.

'Can I confirm their description please?'

509
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Look, I hadn't done a commentary before...

510
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,930
.. and the bloody sat nav...

511
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,530
I don't know if it's an A road, B road...

512
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,930
No, you don't.

513
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,120
You don't know anything!

514
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,290
You know, no-one else is going to
say this to your face, so I will.

515
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,380
Everyone thinks you got
this job because of your dad.

516
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,530
Is that what you think?

517
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,490
I think there's a reason why people
put time in on Neighbourhood --

518
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,570
cos then they know where they
are, they know what they're doing.

519
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,360
Cos this... This job is hard enough.

520
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,850
No respect from the public,

Shit from all sides --

523
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,090
and then, I get saddled with you!

524
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,210
- You know what? You
should be pleased. - What?

525
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,530
You've been looking for an
excuse to jump down my neck.

526
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,970
- The moment I started, on my back...
- That is my job!

527

I'm tasked to monitor and assess you...

528
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,770
It's more than that and you know it is.

529

I can't help being the boss'
son, but you can help being a...

Surprisingly pugnacious,

About two years.

Yeah... Yeah, fine.

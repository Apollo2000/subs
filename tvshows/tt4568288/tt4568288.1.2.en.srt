1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,870
You can't catch me! Won't catch me!

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,250
110. Still elevated.

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,250
Hardly surprising, what
you've been through.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,250
No.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,250
You know, there can be a lot of
side effects -- not just physical.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,250
Anxiety.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,250
Agitation.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,250
Dislocation.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,440
A sense of unreality.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Ladies.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,900
Don't let him get off the end.

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,250
I can't believe I did that.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,250
To Jake!

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Of all people.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,250
Get down on the ground.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
On the ground, now!

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,250
How are you? Yeah...

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,250
Get down on the ground, mate.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,250
I'll get down on the ground. I'll get...

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,250
Ooh, a clean-shaven officer.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,300
That's what I like.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,250
How? Explain to me how this happened.

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,250
We were in pursuit.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,250
Suspected drug dealer.

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,250
He was high, sir.

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,250
Completely off his face. Uncontrollable.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,250
I'm a Taser officer. I
need you to put that down.

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,250
"I'm a Taser officer. I
need you to put that down."

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,250
If you don't put that down,
I'm authorised to shoot you.

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Put that down now.

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,250
You're not going to shoot me.

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,250
'The suspect was brandishing a weapon.

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,250
'Donna was the Taser officer.

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,300
'As far as I'm concerned, she
followed all correct protocols...'

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,170
I'm going to... Taser! Taser! Taser!

36
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,250
Don't move. Stay on the ground.

37
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
You shot me!

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,900
'What happened next was
entirely unpredictable.'

39
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,250
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

40
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,300
There's been a bit of an
incident. on the pier. It's Jake.

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,250
Stay down. I'm warning
you. Just stay down.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,770
No, wait!

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,440
Oh!

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
Hey!

45
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,700
- You all right?
- Sorry.

46
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,250
I shouldn't have jumped in.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,250
No need to apologise, mate. She loved it.

48
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,250
Yeah, well, it's not every day
you get to shoot the boss's son.

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,250
Trust me -- you're going to
be the talk of the division.

50
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,250
You're a legend!

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,250
What? Come on!

52
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Just stop!

53
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
I have a jewellery box in my bedroom.

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,250
And the other one must've gone up there

55
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,250
while I was in the garden with the boy...

56
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,250
looking for his dog.

57
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,170
Yeah, I'm not sure there was a dog.

58
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,250
But he had a lead -- a
red lead in his hand.

59
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,250
I-I saw it.

60
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,250
Doesn't mean there was a dog.

61
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,250
Maybe he just said that
to get you out the house

62
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,900
while his friend went upstairs.

63
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,250
Mrs Simpson...

64
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,250
Oh, Tilly, dear.

65
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,250
Tilly. Er, did you notice
anything about the boys?

66
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,250
Clothes? Height?

67
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Er... I don't know. I didn't really...

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,250
Oh! They had a motorbike.

69
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,250
Younger one had long hair and
the other had a red T-shirt.

70
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,970
I-I can't believe I let them in.

71
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,250
- Bene! - Right, OK, we'll
get on to local inquiries...

72
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,250
Is that a hot-water crust?

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,250
You know your pastry.

74
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,250
My nonna makes a rabbit pie
-- pasticcio di coniglio --

75
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,250
almost as good as yours.

76
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,640
Donna?

77
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,250
- Vegetarian.
- Oh.

78
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,600
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see
if anyone saw anything.

79
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,250
My Bill.

80
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,250
He'd have known how to
deal with those boys.

81
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,840
We were married for 50 years.

82
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,250
On the market.

83
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,250
OK. Thanks.

84
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,250
Right. CSI will be here within half
an hour, so we'll just hang on.

85
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,250
Make sure we preserve any
prints or DNA for them.

86
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,250
'Any patrol, please, for
an immediate graded call

87
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,240
'to the Joy of Ink Tattoo Parlour...'

88
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,170
'Reports of a violent disturbance.'

89
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,250
Stop it.

90
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,250
Control, this is Kilo 220.
Show us state six. Over.

91
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,250
- What's going on?
- A customer. He's gone completely...

92
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Look at crazy man!

93
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,250
Get off him. Back away now!

94
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,250
Back away! Stay back.

95
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,250
- Stay back. Come on!
- Come on!

96
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,300
- Come on. Come on! - Jake!
You want some more? - Jake!

97
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,250
Jake! Jake, for God's sake, come on.

98
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,040
Come on, then!

99
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,250
And we're going to keep you here,
pending further forensic analysis

100
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,300
on the substances we found on you, OK?

101
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,250
Can't exactly say how long.

102
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,250
The time...

103
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,250
Pete, you want to listen to me?

104
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,250
The time and my consciousness are one...

105
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,250
travelling together.

106
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,250
We're going to use your door
keys to access your property.

107
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,250
To cross frontiers to the...

108
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,250
To the flesh of the universe.

109
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,250
You all right with that, are you?

110
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Rather than us breaking your door down...

111
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,250
I see you.

112
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,570
Lost.

113
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,700
Blocked.

114
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
But you hold the key that
unlocks your own enlightenment.

115
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,370
I'm your trip guide.

116
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Your psychic travel agent.

117
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,900
Excellent. Thank you very much.

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,250
And we'll come and sort out those
security measures for you, OK?

119
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,250
It will be a uniformed officer

120
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,250
but you make sure you check
his ID before you let him in.

121
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,250
Yes. You're very kind.

122
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,250
Tilly, Control have just told me

123
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,500
this is the third time
you've been burgled.

124
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,250
Yes. Yes, I think so.

125
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,250
You ever thought about moving somewhere

126
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,250
with a bit more support, Tilly?

127
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,250
Sheltered accommodation or...

128
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,250
You sound like Martha, my daughter.

129
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,250
Always on about bungalow... Basingstoke...

130
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,250
You're not keen, then?

131
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,250
I've lived off this land all my life.

132
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,250
Two stupid little boys won't scare me off.

133
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,250
You'll have to carry me out, feet first.

134
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,250
All right, Tilly.

135
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,250
Oh!

136
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,240
I nearly forgot...

137
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,250
(Be nice.)

138
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,250
(I am)

139
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,250
(You're not...)

140
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,250
There you are.

141
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,250
Martha made it for me.

142
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,250
It's a record -- my jewellery.

143
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,250
I'll show you what's missing.

144
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,300
That'll be really useful, Tilly.
We'll make sure this gets to CID.

145
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,250
12,843 results for a gold locket.

146
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,250
Needle in a haystack?

147
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,400
First you've got to find your haystack.

148
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,250
Three times last night.

149
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,250
Can't keep up the pace.

150
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,250
Sandy not pregnant yet?

151
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,250
It's not for dint of trying.

152
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,250
She's all fallopians
and fertility windows.

153
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,250
But what about me, eh?

154
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,250
Oh, I'm just expected to perform,

155
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,250
on demand.

156
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,300
A... gigolo.

157
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
- Carl...
- Mm?

158
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,640
Do you ever feel, like...

159
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,250
.. blocked?

160
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,250
Bran flakes, every time.

161
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,250
No, just, you know, the...

162
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
Your conscious... ness...

163
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,250
You all right?

164
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,440
No.

165
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,250
You froze.

166
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,250
I didn't.

167
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,250
So, why didn't you jump in, then?

168
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,300
Well, I tried that on the pier,
didn't I? Nearly got fried.

169
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,250
Anyway, I-I was keeping a reactionary gap.

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,250
You know, a distance between me and...

171
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,250
The violent offender.

172
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,250
Yeah, I know the theory. It doesn't
really work in practice, though, does it?

173
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,300
By the time you get your head out the textbook,
they've smashed each other's faces in.

174
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
What were they fighting about, anyway?

175
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,250
Your son's been arrested for
possession with intent to supply

176
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,300
and I have written authority to
search this address for evidence.

177
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,250
Any questions?

178
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,250
Peter wouldn't be involved in all this.

179
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,250
He's a student.

180
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,250
He is doing his PhD.

181
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,250
Oh, in what?

182
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,250
Pure and applied chemistry.

183
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,250
He's always been so very bright.

184
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,250
Even at primary school,
they noticed him. G and T.

185
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,250
- Sorry?
- "Gifted and talented".

186
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,250
My husband used to call
him our little inventor.

187
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,170
Always beavering away in the garage.

188
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,370
I have to see you...

189
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,900
.. tonight.

190
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,100
No, I don't think that's possible.

191
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,170
It's not an operational imperative.

192
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,250
Could you bring it up at the next SMT?

193
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,440
Mm.

194
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,700
You can go if you need to.

195
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,300
I could pop back in after
dinner, if you're sure.

196
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,570
A-ha.

OK, OK, team four. We're not done yet.

220
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,250
OK, so, erm...

221
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Today's doughnuts, courtesy of...

222
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,840
.. Student Constable Vickers.

223
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,250
Ah-ah-ah.

224
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,250
An electrifying arrest.

225
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,250
And for those of you that
didn't see it live...

226
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
we have here an action replay.

227
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,250
I don't know if I want to see this.

228
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,250
Team four at its finest.

229
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,250
'Put that down now.

230
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,250
'You're not going to shoot me.

231
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,250
- 'Taser. Taser. Taser.'
- Don't do it...

232
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,250
300 hits and counting.

233
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,250
Don't be stupid.

234
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,250
Drumroll.

235
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,250
- Drumroll.
- Get ready.

236
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,250
50,000 volts? Someone want 50,000 volts?

237
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,640
Here we go, here we go...

238
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,250
And then see this.

239
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,170
Watch him now...

240
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Er...

241
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Sir?

242
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,250
Sit down. Sit down.

243
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,250
Carry on.

244
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Erm...

245
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,250
Er, DS Moffat, you had something...

246
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Boss. Sir.

247
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,250
Quick request before you head out.

248
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,250
For those of you who don't
know, this is Peter Foyles,

249
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,250
also known as Red Pete.
He's an alleged drug dealer.

250
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,250
Now, I have him in custody and we're
building a case while we wait for
the results from the drugs lab.

251
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,250
In the meantime, can you ask
around whether people on the street

252
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,250
know him and what he's selling? Thank you.

253
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,250
- Did I really sound like that?
- Yeah, you did.

254
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,250
Oh, and if you do seize any bags

255
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,250
similar to the ones he's been
manufacturing, just be careful,

256
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,250
as ideally I want to take fingerprints

257
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,250
to try and connect him to the
drugs supply. Thanks a lot. Cheers.

258
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,440
Let's do it. Come on.

259
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,250
One for the road?

260
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,250
Take mine. Go on.

261
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,250
Not two!

262
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,250
Cheers, Jake. Are you going
to do this once a week?

263
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,500
Yeah, yeah. No worries.

264
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,250
They giving you a hard time?

265
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,640
Bit of banter. It's fine.

266
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,250
I, er, heard you found
your mum last night.

267
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,250
Yeah. She was in a bit of a state.

268
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,250
Mm. Yeah. Work called. She said
it was all right for me to go.

269
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,250
She would say that, wouldn't she?

270
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,250
You know what she's like -- brave face.

271
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,250
I think we should talk to the doctor

272
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,200
- about getting her some different
anti-emetics... - I'm onto that.

273
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,250
Look, it's brilliant

274
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,250
that you've come back home.

275
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,250
That you're there for her.

276
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Means a lot to her.

277
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
To both of us.

278
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,170
That, however...

279
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,100
.. is shocking.

280
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,250
Landlord reckoned he
came in about midnight.

281
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,970
Paid in cash.

282
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,250
On his own?

283
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
No. With a lady.

284
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
She left by herself
around two hours later.

285
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,250
No wallet? Car keys?

286
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,700
Nothing.

287
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Put the call in to the MPLO. See
if anyone's reported him missing.

288
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,250
- Sand... - Look, I can't
guarantee I'll be back,

289
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,100
but I'll be home as soon as I can.

290
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,700
Sand...

291
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,250
Babe, listen... I can't make
any promises -- you know that --

292
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,300
but some fatty's died in the saddle
and I'm stuck here with the boss.

293
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,250
Hey... Oh, come on, you
know what Felix is like.

294
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,700
He's hardly Mr Family Man.

295
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Can you explain to me

296
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,250
why we found drug manufacturing
equipment in your mother's garage?

297
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,250
No...

298
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,700
comment.

299
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,250
For the benefit of the tape, I'm
showing the suspect exhibit JM1.

300
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,250
- Are these yours?
- No comment.

301
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,250
- What are they?
- No comment.

302
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,250
How much do you charge for them,
and who are you selling them to?

303
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,250
- No comment. - OK, great.
Interview terminated at 1500 hours.

304
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,250
Already? Intense.

305
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,250
Oh, don't worry. We will
be interviewing you again

306
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,250
when we get the results back from the lab.

307
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,970
(I haven't done anything wrong.)

308
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,370
So, your mum's sick?

309
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,500
Yep.

310
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,700
Cancer.

311
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
What kind?

312
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,570
Lung.

313
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,250
Prognosis?

314
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Too early to tell.

315
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,170
How's she coping?

316
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,250
Mainly by being furious.

317
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,250
Already sworn at the Macmillan woman!

318
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,250
Difficult patient, then?

319
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,250
Not really. She just...

320
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,700
She likes being in control.

321
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,250
The old man might be the boss at
work, but at home she wears the...

322
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,700
Ryan...

323
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,250
Oh, no. No way.

324
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,170
Not having that.

325
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Your collar, Jake.

326
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,250
Control, this is Kilo 220
for a vehicle PNC check.

327
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,250
Dukes Mount, code two...

328
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,250
Know why we pulled you over?

329
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,770
Slow day?

330
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,250
You were riding without a helmet.

331
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Hey, do I know you?

332
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,250
Don't think so.

333
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,840
I do. I recognise you. You...

334
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,440
You used to surf, man.

335
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,250
Shoreham. Yeah... You and me, bro.

336
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,250
Remember? We shared some line-ups...

337
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,250
- Yeah. Maybe. - Caught a break or
two back in the day. Few dawn patrols.

338
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,250
Well, you can't drive on a public
highway without a helmet, so...

339
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,250
Yeah. Look, man, I'm sorry
about that. I forgot it.

340
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,250
- I'm still acclimatising, you know?
- Acclimatising?

341
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,250
Yeah. Culture shock, you know?

342
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,250
Just got back from six months
on Siargao Island. It's...

343
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,250
It's basic. But, oh, it is paradise.

344
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,250
Killer reefs.

345
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,250
'Kilo 220, vehicle is
confirmed as a Vespa scooter.

346
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,250
'No reports of it lost or stolen.'

347
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,250
I'm going have to give you
a traffic offence report.

348
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,250
You're giving me a ticket?

349
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,250
The Central Ticket Office will
write to you offering you a fine,

350
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,640
a course or a court date.

351
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,400
And you'll have to push that bike home.

352
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Know what, man? You've changed.

353
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,700
Who are you, Mr Pixelated?

354
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Ain't on the fingerprint database,
no-one's reported you missing...

355
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,440
- Briefcase...
- Mm.

356
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,250
Recognise her?

357
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,250
Yep.

358
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,900
She goes by the name of Pearl.

359
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Don't think I need to tell you
what she does for a living.

360
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,170
They're going to need a big fridge.

361
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,250
Cos, er...

362
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,250
th-that's what they say, isn't it?

363
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,250
That the average size of coffins has, er,

364
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,840
doubled...

365
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
'Scuse me, boss.

366
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Oh. The old lady's
jewellery's turned up online.

367
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,250
I'll, er...

368
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I'll respond to the, er...

369
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Donna, it's Carl.

370
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,250
I've got an address for
your distraction burglars.

371
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,250
Ashwell's Yard.

372
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,250
Yeah.

373
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,250
Listen... Right, watch your
back. I know this family.

374
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,250
Nicked the boys myself several times.

375
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,840
Trust me, they can get rough.

376
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,250
Remind you of home?

377
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,900
Yeah, this is just like Italy.

378
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,250
That's them.

379
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
Gavers!

380
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,250
Kilo 230, this is a priority call.

381
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,250
I have a male making off
on foot at Ashwell's Yard.

382
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,250
Suspect is Sean Ashwell,
wanted for burglary.

383
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,370
Any units to assist?

384
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,250
On the ground! On the ground now!

385
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,250
Get on the ground now!

386
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,250
Lino. Lino, I need...

387
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,440
Ah!

388
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,250
Are you OK? You all right?

389
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
Are you OK?

390
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,250
The suspect... is a loss
over the perimeter fence,

391
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,250
towards the A283.

392
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,250
My colleague has been booted in the face.

393
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,250
She is conscious and breathing...

394
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,250
Where the hell were you?

395
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
'Roger that, Kilo 230. Do
you require an ambulance?

396
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,250
Stop.

397
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,900
I've got a warrant to
search your premises. Hey!

398
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,250
- What do you want?
- I'll have that.

399
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,250
- Get off it. That's my bag.
- Let's have a look. Let's have a look.

400
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,900
What's this?

401
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,900
This yours?

402
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,250
- This you, is it? This your husband?
- What are you doing?

403
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
- Get away from me. - I'm arresting you
on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

404
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,250
There she is. There she is.

405
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,250
There she is.

406
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
Hello, Pearl.

407
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,250
Pearl.

408
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,640
Pearl!

409
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,250
Don't know why you're asking me. I
don't know what you're talking about.

410
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,250
Oaklea Bed and Breakfast. Your
client died. You left the scene.

411
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
What client?

412
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,250
Yeah, hello.

413
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,840
Fat bloke.

414
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,700
Looked like he liked pies.

415
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,440
Pies and prostitutes.

416
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,300
What's he done now?

417
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,250
Look, I'm working at the
moment -- I can't get out of it.

418
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,250
Pearl, come on, don't make this hard
on yourself. We know you were there.

419
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,250
- I wasn't there! I told you,
it wasn't me... - Really?

420
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,250
Right, well, so...

421
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,250
Who is...

422
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,900
Who's that?

423
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,250
Could be anyone.

424
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,900
My hair's not like that.
She looks a right state.

425
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,250
OK. Thank you. Bye.

426
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,370
You all right, boss?

427
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,250
If you don't cooperate,
I'll be sending patrol cars

428
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
up and down your street every
five minutes -- understand?

429
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,970
I only took the cash I was owed.

430
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,900
That's all.

431
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,440
Just what I was owed.

432
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,250
DI Kane.

433
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Can you put a name though PNC and
the local system for me, please?

434
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,840
KC Malone.

435
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,250
Do you know who he was?

436
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,250
That's what we're trying to find out.

437
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,250
So, it's not a, er...

438
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,900
Not a regular client, then, no?

439
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,300
We were... right in the
middle of it, you know?

440
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,250
He went a funny colour,

441
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,570
made this weird noise...

442
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
It was awful.

443
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,250
She's pretty.

444
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,250
- My daughter.
- Oh, right, I didn't know you had...

445
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,170
She's got one of her own now -- Lexi.

446
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,250
That's a nice name.

447
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,500
So, where do they live?

448
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,250
Please...

449
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,250
I don't want any trouble.

450
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,440
I just want my script.

451
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,100
Please -- I just need my methadone.

452
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,900
Kevin Malone. Shoreham-by-Sea.

453
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,250
Verbal warning last
year for kerb-crawling.

454
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,900
Deputy head?

455
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,900
Also, er...

456
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,440
Married with two kids.

457
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,900
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

458
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,250
Look, it's my choice. My risk.

459
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,300
- I shouldn't have run ahead.
- Just trying to catch the bad guy.

460
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,250
And, er...

461
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,250
just so you know, I...

462
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,250
I am going to get back into shape.

463
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm going to go to the
gym. Double my training.

464
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,170
I know you will.

465
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,840
Yeah, that's fine. I'll hold.

466
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Oh, you...

467
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,250
Damn it. Damn it!

468
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,250
All right. Turn around. Turn around.

469
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,440
Thank you. Good to go.

470
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,250
- I need to see the doctor.
- Yeah, I know.

471
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,250
I need something.

472
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,170
Come on. Pearl, sit down, be quiet.

473
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,250
Timed this well.

474
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,250
Right. Book her in, then you can
head to Shoreham, do the death knock.

475
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,250
I need to clock off early
tonight, boss. I did mention it.

476
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,300
You need to inform the family of
the victim's death. But I can't.

477
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,250
It's Madison's...

478
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,250
She's my youngest -- it's her birthday,

479
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,300
and I promised the family I'd
get home on time... for once.

480
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,250
I'll see you in the morning.

481
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,900
So, you're not coming with me?

482
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,250
Boss, listen, I know that
something's come up for you --

483
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,300
and it is none of my
business, I know -- but...

484
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,300
.. Felix, I really need to
get back to my family tonight.

485
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,700
Please.

486
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,840
Just do your job, DC Hawkins.

487
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,250
We've had the results back from the lab

488
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,250
and they tested negative
for controlled substances.

489
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,250
You're going to be charged with affray,

490
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,250
but released without charge for the drugs.

491
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,250
At this time, we intend to take
no further action against you

492
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,250
relating to these offences.
You are now free to go.

493
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,250
I tried to tell you...

494
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,250
I did nothing wrong.

495
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Yeah, well, I don't agree,
but then what do I know?

496
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,250
I'm not "gifted" or "talented".

497
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,250
I don't understand what chemicals you use,

498
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,250
what compounds you copy,
how you keep it all legal.

499
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,700
But I do know one thing...

500
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,250
Legislation moves forward.

501
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Laws change.

502
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,640
I will catch up with you.

503
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,500
Bye.

504
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,970
Cheers, Shaz.

505
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
- There.
- Thanks.

506
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,250
Corey used to do all that --

507
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,250
surfing.

508
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,250
Now he just chucks himself
off tall buildings.

509
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Ah. Parkour.

510
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,300
I don't care what it's
called. It's bloody stupid.

511
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,300
His mother would be turning in her grave.

512
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,250
'Any patrol, please, for
an immediate graded call

513
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,250
'to 24A, Princeton Drive.

514
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,300
'The landlady has reported a suicide.'

515
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,250
I got four lodgers in the house.
22 years -- not a problem.

516
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,250
But this one? Always in arrears.
He hasn't paid the rent in months.

517
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,250
I came here to give him notice to quit.

518
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,250
Control, this is Kilo 220. The male
is deceased. Evidence of suicide.

519
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,250
- Come outside with me. I'll take some details.
- What am I going to do about my money, then?

520
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,250
Can you inform the duty DI? I'm
going to need CSI at this location.

521
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,250
I've got so much to pay
for, you wouldn't believe it.

522
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,440
How could he do this?

523
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,570
Ryan?

524
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,570
Shit!

525
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,250
'So, now, we're either Tasering each other

526
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,250
'or mistaking people for corpses.'

527
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,300
No wonder everyone out there thinks
we're useless, incompetent and uncaring.

528
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,250
Let's not make it easy for them.

529
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,250
Boss, it was a confusing situation.

530
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
- The suicide victim...
- That wasn't...

531
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,250
He thought his landlady was
going to chuck him out.

532
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,250
He was trying to make
her feel sorry for him.

533
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,250
Oh, great plan(!)

534
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,250
Except she called an ambulance,

535
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,250
and he didn't know when
to stop pretending.

536
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Probably just before they
nailed down the coffin lid.

537
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,250
Right. Well, as you can imagine,

538
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,250
I've just had a very embarrassing
conversation with CSI,

539
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,250
explaining why they weren't needed,
and sent my apologies to the FME...

540
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,250
who were all very impressed
with our police work(!)

541
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,250
Boss, he poured fake blood everywhere.

542
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,250
Hundreds of suicide notes.

543
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,300
Honestly, I-I couldn't...
I couldn't find a pulse.

544
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,500
This is Inspector Webb.

545
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,170
Are you smiling?

546
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,250
No.

547
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Take this is as a learning opportunity.

548
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,250
Don't take anything for granted.

549
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,500
Check everything twice.

550
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,250
Everyone can make mistakes.

551
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,770
Even you?

552
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,040
Don't push it.

553
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,250
You can't keep doing this, Dad.

554
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,250
I have to work.

555
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,570
They look after you now.

556
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,970
It's what we decided -- remember?

557
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,250
Are you listening, Dad?

558
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,440
No.

559
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,250
No.

560
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
NO!

561
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

562
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,570
I had to go to Shoreham.

563
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,250
Ruin a family's evening.

564
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
Break their hearts.

565
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,900
How was it?

566
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,250
Oh, er...

567
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
mental.

568
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,250
Screaming. Cake... Vomit.

569
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,370
Yeah, they loved it.

570
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,250
Maddie? She's in bed.

571
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,600
I put her in the bath. She was
nearly half asleep already.

572
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,250
She had a lovely time.

573
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,440
Yeah, and I missed it.

574
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,500
I'll make it up to you.

575
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,250
- Oh, er, are you going to
have a shower? - Yeah. Yeah.

576
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,250
Er... Well, don't take too long.
I've taken my basal temperature.

577
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,250
Good. Good.

578
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,040
Er... Right -- ready when you are.

579
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,250
Oh, come on, gorgeous! We only
want to see your Elgin marbles...

580
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,250
That's assault!

581
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,250
Touch me again, I'll
perform a citizen's arrest.

582
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,300
I told you. Step away
from each other. Now!

583
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,900
Oh, come on.

584
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,250
Nice to see you've got such authority.

585
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,250
It's all right, mate, they've
lost interest in you.

586
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,250
Nice helmet!

587
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,250

Calm down, all right?
Tell me what happened.

No. Still no response.

It's going to be all right.

Just look at me. CPR?

638

On... On what?

639
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,300
No, er, no signs of life...

It's OK, Jake.

641

It's all right.

642

Stop.

643
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,840
Just stop.

644
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,840
All right?

645
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,440
It's... It's too late.

646
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,250
Are you sure it's my man?

647
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,300
Tall, wiry, swinging some kind

650

Returned so soon?

651
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,300
Hmm.

652
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,250
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
maliciously administering poison,

653
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,300
so as to endanger life or
inflict grievous bodily harm.

654
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,700
Tilly...

655
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,250
I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.

656
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,250
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

657
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,250
if you fail to mention when questioned

658
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,250
something you later rely on in court.

659
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,300
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

660
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,250
Hey, Mum.

661
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,250
'Don't you "hey" me.'

662
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,250
What have you said to your father?

663
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,300
He's fussing around me
like Florence Nightingale.

664
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,250
'Jake?'

665
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,170
Er, I don't know.

666
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,170
'What do you mean, you don't know?'

667
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,250
Jake? What's the matter? What's going on?

668
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,300
Nothing, Mum. It's... It's all good.

669
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,770
Bit damp?

670
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,700
Just washing off the blood.

671
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,250
Yeah, I heard.

672
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,250
Are you all right?

673
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,440
Mm.

674
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Still, I know something
that'll cheer you up.

675
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,170
I saw you online.

676
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,250
- Getting Tasered.
- Mm.

677
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,300
- I like to entertain.
- Oh, you did.

678
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,250
If you want to sue the police...

679

680
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,100
The third time she's been burgled.

681
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,700
I know.

682
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,300
Third time.

683
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,250
What did we offer her?

684
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,300
A little chain across her front door.

Sometimes those mistakes
spiral out of control

712
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,250
and you think that it's
over, that it's irreversible.

713
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,250
But the thing that you learn...

714
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,250
is that there's always a way back.

715
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,300
Unless you go over the edge.

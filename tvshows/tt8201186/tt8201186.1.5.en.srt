1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:04,999
My client was court-martialled,
convicted and incarcerated

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,517
for six months based
on erroneous evidence.

3
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:11,187
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,069
I believe you.

5
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:15,751
You're new to homicide, aren't you?

6
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:18,191
I've been in SO15
for the last four years.

7
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:20,311
Yeah, that explains
the heavy-handedness.

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,231
Excuse me?

9
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:24,991
My barrister, my friend, is dead.

10
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,151
The police think I done it,
my ex thinks I done it.

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,271
And between you and me
there's moments...

12
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:32,271
...when I'm scared that I done it.

13
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:34,431
I saw you taken to
a house in Eaton Square.

14
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:36,751
Only, no-one else saw it.

15
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:39,271
If they don't believe you
they ain't going to believe me.

16
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,031
Gastor Square.
That's where they took me.

17
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:43,991
What's the status, Eli?

18
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,311
Toy Soldier is contained, Sir.

19
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,991
They call it correction -

20
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:50,031
when they take something
they don't like

21
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:52,231
and they change it.

22
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:54,791
If you wanted to pass
fake footage off as real,

23
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,311
you'd want someone naive to find it.

24
00:00:57,312 --> 00:01:00,631
I was used to find
something planted for me.

25
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:03,151
I can only conclude
that your intention was to pervert

26
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:04,551
the course of justice.

27
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:05,951
And I am left with no alternative

28
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:08,551
but to suspend you from duty
with immediate effect.

29
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,734
He was in Hannah's flat!

30
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:17,871
I've been going through CCTV
on the previous bus that night.

31
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:19,271
She's there.

32
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:21,071
Hannah Roberts.

33
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:24,511
How far did you even look
into the victim, Detective?

34
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:26,991
When did you ever hear of a human
rights lawyer defending

35
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:29,512
a British soldier?

36
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:33,512
Shaun.

37
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:39,003
I imagine you'd like to
know what is going on?

38
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:03,872
Where to, love?

39
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:55,231
Shit!

40
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:57,832
Oh, you stupid dickhead!

41
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:00,552
Shit!

42
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:10,751
What the hell?

43
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:13,791
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?

44
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,511
I live here.

45
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:16,671
What's happened?

46
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,831
I thought everyone was away!

47
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,591
Mum and Dad are away.

48
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:22,751
You think I'm going with them
on a cruise?

49
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,991
Why aren't you at uni?

50
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:27,111
I graduated!

51
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:29,151
Oh.

52
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,880
Why are you crying?

53
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:32,992
I'm not.

54
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:39,951
I just needed somewhere to stay.

55
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,407
What's going on?

56
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,591
You can talk to me.

57
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,138
I'm a good listener, Rachel.

58
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,672
Seriously?

59
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,831
Since when did they put her
pride of place?

60
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,271
That's always been there.

61
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,545
No, it hasn't!

62
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:02,711
I think it's nice,
that they remember her.

63
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:05,991
It's disgusting,
that they have the nerve.

64
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:09,991
What do you want us to do,
act like she didn't exist?

65
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:13,538
That's what they did
when she was alive.

66
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:20,671
Do you realise how thrilled they'd
be if they knew you were here?

67
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:24,945
Do you know how proud they are
of you? Your job?

68
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:28,871
We all are.

69
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:32,418
Dad would do literally
anything for you.

70
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,018
My mum would too.

71
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,112
I just...

72
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:42,671
...wish you'd let us all in
a little bit more.

73
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:43,992
Rachel?

74
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:48,302
Where do they keep the car keys?

75
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:02,751
Why don't we...

76
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:03,911
...sit down?

77
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,672
I'm good standing.

78
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:11,749
I want to show you something.

79
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,831
I've seen it.

80
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:18,192
Not like this.

81
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:22,511
Hannah?

82
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:23,592
Shaun?

83
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:26,191
You got the sound?

84
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,071
Would it be you?

85
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:31,631
If I sued the MOD, would it be you
representing me

86
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:35,711
or would it be some specialist
lawsuit barrister?

87
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:40,311
Only because, I don't want
you to represent me any more.

88
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,791
Not cos you're not the best,
because you are.

89
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:47,111
It's just, you know,
if you were to represent me again,

90
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,991
then I wouldn't be able
to ask you out.

91
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:53,271
Look, I know your mates
don't hang about in estate pubs

92
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:56,071
in Croydon making jokes
about Muslims and sex offenders.

93
00:05:56,072 --> 00:06:00,751
This is where I'm from but I've
done my best to get away from it.

94
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:03,551
It's probably why I joined up
in the first place.

95
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:04,752
Just...

96
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,431
Your grandad's right about you.

97
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,391
You're not bad.

98
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:16,351
Not at all.

99
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:19,751
- Get on this.
- I'll give you a lift.

100
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:21,571
You got a boyfriend?

101
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:24,832
I'll call you.

102
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:27,152
Sorry.

103
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:54,192
That's what happened.

104
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,432
That's what happened.

105
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:10,992
We can upload this.

106
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:13,871
The real one.

107
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:16,145
It proves I didn't do it!

108
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:21,832
What?

109
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:28,672
What?

110
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:33,911
She said the CIA or whatever.

111
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,031
- Correction.
- Yeah. They stitched me up.

112
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:38,271
But now everyone can see
for themselves what happened.

113
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:41,151
The intelligence community
has hurt a lot of people

114
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,791
through correction, Shaun.

115
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,711
People close to us.

116
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,552
But not you.

117
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,031
So who did this, then?

118
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:56,214
We can help you, Shaun,
but you have to listen.

119
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:58,991
What's going on?

120
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,174
You need to take a seat.

121
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,072
What did you do, Charlie?

122
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:17,472
Hannah!

123
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:21,911
Shaun.

124
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,792
OK, now come to me.

125
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,391
Talking, talking.

126
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:27,871
In your own time.

127
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,631
You'll have to
improvise on the night

128
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:31,391
- but it doesn't hurt to practise.
- OK.

129
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,711
Make yourself familiar
with the space.

130
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:38,191
Just remember, all that
really matters is that you...

131
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:41,551
End up level with the third
column from the bus stop.

132
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:43,471
And?

133
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:46,711
At an angle where the camera
can see both our faces.

134
00:08:46,712 --> 00:08:49,751
Precisely, ready for another take?

135
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:50,991
Let's do it.

136
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:53,265
How's it looking, people?

137
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:58,007
Traffic check.
Ellison Road, all clear.

138
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:01,791
Eastern Lane, clear.
Talbot Junction, clear.

139
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,551
Status with the feed?

140
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,991
How's it looking, Naz?

141
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,231
Live feed is blocked.

142
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:10,505
Decoy feed in play. We have control.

143
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:14,191
Feed check complete, good to go.

144
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:15,283
Still clear.

145
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,791
Remember, once I've grabbed you,
it needs to look like I'm the one

146
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,831
doing the dragging, but you're the
one actually leading that movement.

147
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:25,431
OK, I just want it to look real.

148
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,705
I don't mind if it hurts.

149
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,991
In your own time, guys.

150
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:34,071
We'll place the bus wipe after,
so just start whenever.

151
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:35,471
Do you prefer a cue?

152
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:38,200
Yes, actually that would help.

153
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:39,871
Can we get a cue?

154
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:42,671
She'll be demanding
her own trailer next!

155
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,431
Standing by, everybody.

156
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:46,671
Counting down the bus wipe.

157
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:48,351
In three...

158
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:49,991
two...

159
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:51,032
one.

160
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,832
Action!

161
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,311
What are you smiling at?

162
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,791
It's happening, Faisal.

163
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,311
For real?

164
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:12,991
We've shot the scene.

165
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,151
So...

166
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,711
Who is it? A volunteer?

167
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:17,552
The less you know.

168
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:21,920
Even if it works...

169
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:25,271
...how do we prove
it's what happened to me?

170
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:27,454
Faisal, if this works...

171
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:32,774
...we're going to wake up
to a whole new world.

172
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:59,912
Can we not?

173
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:05,711
I came here to view
because you said it was ready.

174
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:07,391
You don't think it's ready, Eli?

175
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:10,391
We tracked the bus wipe
on every single take,

176
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,831
we added light fill from the bus
onto Shaun and Hannah.

177
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,032
Take it back.

178
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,711
Stop.

179
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,631
Tell me that face-mapping is temp.

180
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:21,991
- Looks OK to me.
- Technically, it's passable.

181
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,751
But look at his expression.

182
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:25,431
His body is kidnapping a woman,

183
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:27,191
his face is waiting
in line at the co-op.

184
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,511
Eli's right, it would be better
if Shaun looked angry.

185
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,951
People tend not to post angry
pictures of themselves

186
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,191
on social media.

187
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,791
- What about the rest of his archive?
- There has to be something.

188
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,271
That lad is angry all the time!

189
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:40,071
Yeah, but not on the news, not on
the pre-trial interviews you shot,

190
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:41,351
the FaceTime calls we hacked.

191
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,351
Can't the computer
generate an angry face?

192
00:12:43,352 --> 00:12:46,871
The more archive-based the deep
fake, the better it looks.

193
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:48,418
I think it works.

194
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:51,551
You think it works?

195
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,832
Currently?

196
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:59,151
Those dead, expressionless eyes,
they don't bother you?

197
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:01,231
He's in a trance.

198
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,871
A traumatised soldier.

199
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:06,351
Denied something
he thought he'd won.

200
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,591
Unable to accept rejection.

201
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:09,631
Snaps.

202
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,791
Shaun's got no record of PTSD.

203
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,671
Everyone assumes he has.

204
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:15,831
A soldier who murdered
on the battlefield.

205
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:17,671
The police will leap on it,
so will the press.

206
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,111
I know people with PTSD.
They don't have memory blackouts.

207
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,711
We're not talking about reality.

208
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:25,471
We're talking about what
we can make people believe.

209
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,831
You sound like them.

210
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:28,911
We've got to think like them.

211
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:31,231
You can bet they did this
with your brother's trial,

212
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,231
doctored the evidence so carefully

213
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,631
the only person who
could deny it was himself.

214
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,352
We sure did.

215
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:42,191
Shaun abducts me during an episode,

216
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:45,102
and blocks it out due to trauma.

217
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:48,051
It fits a narrative.

218
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:52,031
Well, how about your position?
Are you going to hit your mark?

219
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,711
- If she's not in position, it's game over.
- I know.

220
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,871
What happens if he parks
his car across the street?

221
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:58,991
We've filmed 25 versions!

222
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:01,591
Car, no car, car enters
from the south, from the north.

223
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,391
Jacket on, jacket off. Come on.

224
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,351
Would you like to
look at the alt-takes?

225
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:06,716
Yeah, actually.

226
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,951
Not long now.

227
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,232
Are you OK?

228
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:16,111
I still don't get
why he's helping us.

229
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,271
I can't see the
whistle-blower in him.

230
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,911
Eli's taking a huge risk.

231
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:23,231
He can be a pain in the arse
all right, but...

232
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,511
Hey, Charlie?

233
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:28,111
Do you know for a fact he'll be
wearing all this?

234
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:31,351
Yes, Eli, he'll be wearing it.

235
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,271
He's told us 100 times,

236
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,951
he wants to go to
court in military dress.

237
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:36,591
This uniform, exactly?

238
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,956

There are two people in this room
that believed in me

244
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:57,991
when not everyone did.

245
00:14:57,992 --> 00:15:02,356
That's this man here,
my solicitor, Charlie Hall.

246
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:05,191
Might as well preload a take.

247
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:08,272
- No car, jacket on?
- Yeah.

If I could choose anyone
to take into battle with me,

That's a good one.

260
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:51,111
But do you believe me?

261
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:53,311
Yes.

308
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:07,149
then I wouldn't be able to...

309
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,872
...ask you out.

310

I know that me and you
are different, Hannah.

313
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:27,751
What?

314
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:28,934
Blow this up.

315
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:34,071
- Shit!
- What is it?

316
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,631
- His collar's up.
- Is that a problem?

317
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:37,791
Is that a problem?

318
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,920
If you don't have a turned-up collar option,
I'd say that was a problem, yes.

319
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,031
- What do we do?
- Abort?

320
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:45,951
- Has Hannah seen it?
- I don't think so.

321
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:47,231
This is why I asked for comms.

322

He's a soldier. If she wore

00:18:53,272 --> 00:18:55,911
Your mates don't hang about
estate pubs in Croydon,

00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:59,031

00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:05,711
Bus approaching, 12 seconds.

330
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,671
That's it.

331
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:12,036
It's probably why I joined up
in the first place.

332
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,591
Aside from the estate pubs
in Croydon,

333
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:32,502
we're really not that different.

334
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:37,512
Genius!

335
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,032
Get in, Hannah!

336
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,952
Nicely done.

337
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:46,712
Sorry.

338
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:53,751
You got to feel a bit sorry
for the guy.

339
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:57,207
Feel sorry for the unarmed man
he shot.

340
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,745
Tell Hannah she's a star!

341
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,894
Sutton South to control!

342
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,271
Go ahead.

343
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:47,031
Assault in progress,
Ramilies Road, Bus Stop Z.

344
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:48,712
Received.

345
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,831
Charlie just called.

346
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:18,469
They've arrested Shaun Emery!

347
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,512
Why me?

348
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,952
In a word? Publicity.

349
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:49,111
I'd have volunteered.

350
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:51,711
Any of us would.

351
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:54,111
We needed someone in the public eye.

352
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:59,111
And when you came along,
talk about national interest.

353
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:01,751
We knew you'd make headlines.

354
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:03,631
I know you'll want to kill me,
Shaun.

355
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:06,151
Kill you? You don't know a thing
about me, Charlie.

356
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:07,991
You never did, neither did Hannah.

357
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,351
Both just see a squaddie.

358
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:13,151
I guess that's why you defended me
in the first place?

359
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:14,231
Not to help me.

360
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,631
But we did help.

361
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:20,178
Nobody else came up with that idea,
the video flaw.

362
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:22,671
What are you saying?

363
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:27,511
I'm saying if it wasn't for
Hannah and myself,

364
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,058
you'd still be serving time.

365
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,991
Hannah's abduction was never
going to stick to you, Shaun.

366
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,231
We weren't consigning you
to prison for long.

367
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,751
The case would have been thrown
out of court as soon as...

368
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:45,298
As soon as Hannah showed up.

369
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:50,511
Hannah was supposed to stay hidden
until the trial, then reappear,

370
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:52,991
publicly - proving you'd been
convicted on false evidence.

371
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:56,071
Exposing the process of correction.

372
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:57,891
So, what went wrong?

373
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:04,271
We planned for almost
every possibility.

374
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:07,071
We didn't count on the spooks
getting hold of the footage

375
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:10,031
before you made the news.

376
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:12,431
How were we to know the lead
detective would turn out to be

377
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,251
from Counter fucking Terrorism?

378
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:30,471
Whose motor's this?

379
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:31,912
Stepmum's.

380
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:35,671
You all right?

381
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,752
Yeah, you?

382
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,272
He's here.

383
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:57,891
I'm here if you need me, ma'am.

384
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:18,231
You brought protection?

385
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:21,505
Can you blame me for being cautious?

386
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:27,431
Did your wife say anything?

387
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:31,705
Did you drag me down here
to talk about my wife?

388
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:34,516
You were right.

389
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:40,951
I didn't look hard enough
into Hannah Roberts.

390
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:42,232
I admit it.

391
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:50,271
I know she caught the bus
that night,

392
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:52,272
just as Emery claimed.

393
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:56,669
Shaun didn't abduct Hannah...

394
00:24:58,152 --> 00:25:01,334
...and he didn't murder her either.

395
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,229
This isn't how I imagined it.

396
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:19,551
- Where's your phone?
- In the car.

397
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,351
Imagined what?

398
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,951
- Your introduction.
- I'm not recording you.

399
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:26,311
Can you blame me for being cautious?

400
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:28,391
Introduction to what?

401
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:29,712
Correction.

402
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,203
It's a beautiful thing.

403
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:37,271
You have to understand, Rachel.

404
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:39,111
This is global.

405
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:41,511
Even if we wanted to,
there's nothing any of us could do

406
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:44,111
to stop it. Not me, not you and not
Hannah fucking Roberts.

407
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:45,951
What is it about her?

408
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:48,351
She defended terrorists,
someone has to.

409
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:51,111
If she'd had it her way, half of
them would be out on the streets.

410
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:53,911
So what? We go after suspects,
not their lawyers.

411
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:57,094
Hannah Roberts was coming after us.

412
00:25:57,752 --> 00:26:02,389
I knew it as soon as I first saw
that fucking video.

413
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,036
When DID you first see it?

414
00:26:12,912 --> 00:26:16,911
- When did you first see the video?
- You should know.

415
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:19,912
You're the one who sent it to us.

416
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:32,991
- Traitor!
- It's called being promoted.

417
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,671
I suppose you're out
celebrating your success.

418
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:37,671
So are you lot going to run
a facial-rec for me

419
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:39,591
- or shall I call Ops Room Two?
- Ouch!

420
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:43,592
- That's uncalled for.
- Send us the capture.

421
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:55,231
- We have a contender.
- Great. Let me see.

422
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:56,911
Sending.

423
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:58,192
Received.

424
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,352
You're welcome!

425
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:47,511
- Yeah?
- Sorry to disturb, sir.

426
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:50,431
Some footage just came to my
attention I thought you should be

427
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:52,551
aware of. It could be legit, but...

428
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:56,511
...you get a feel for these things.
Camera location, no other CCTV.

429
00:27:56,512 --> 00:28:00,511
It presents as a kidnap,
but the victim...

430
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,431
...is Hannah Roberts. It's the
barrister that represented...

431
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,796
Faisal Dahmani.

432
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:08,051
Send me the capture.

433
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:44,751
Secure phone.

434
00:28:44,752 --> 00:28:46,271
Charger.

435
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:48,151
Police scanner.

436
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:52,607
Night-vision monitors
with their own power supply.

437
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,511
Front door.

438
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:03,991
Front drive.

439
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,271
Perimeter road.

440
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:08,071
That's way on the corner
where the farm begins,

441
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:11,391
and Cujo hears the cars
coming way before that.

442
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:12,631
Living room.

443
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:14,111
Kitchen.

444
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,352
Us.

445
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:18,960
It's just up there.

446
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:26,552
Oh, and breakfast.

447
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:41,471
My brother's not going to
know how to thank you. My family...

448
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:43,200
...none of us will.

449
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:46,683
Thank me when it works.

450
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:09,351
So, this breaks down into three
possibilities.

451
00:30:09,352 --> 00:30:13,671
- One, the event happened to be real. Two...
- It's a stunt.

452
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:15,431
Thank you, Frank.

453
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:18,871
Given Hannah Roberts' potential
awareness of certain...

454
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:22,391
...methodologies, this could be some
kind of activist stunt

455
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:25,377
in which Shaun Emery is
potentially complicit.

456
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:26,431
Or?

457
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:31,160
Scenario three, Roberts is
actually using correction.

458
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:34,471
The most problematic scenario.

459
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:36,511
Can't we tell it's corrected?

460
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:38,111
We're still running tests.

461
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:39,711
There's one way to find out.

462
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,311
Redact the footage.

463
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:44,431
If the SIO can't find evidence to
corroborate, then we know it's fake.

464
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:46,951
That rather depends on the SIO
being worth their salt.

465
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:50,511
They are. I happen to know them,
it's a former colleague.

466
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:53,256
If there's evidence to be
found, she'll find it.

467
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:55,031
Well...

468
00:30:55,032 --> 00:30:56,911
...let's hope it's option one.

469
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:59,791
If this is correction, the quality
suggests Hannah Roberts had

470
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:02,429
help from a foreign entity...

471
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,065
...or worse...

472
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:07,631
...from someone inside the programme.

473
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,831
Each one of my staff that wasn't
drafted from yours

474
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:15,469
is a serving or former
member of Langley or the NSA.

475
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:18,785
Just like Edward Snowden.

476
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:25,311
I strongly suggest you cancel any
plans you might have

477
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:27,191
for the foreseeable future.

478
00:31:27,192 --> 00:31:30,111
We need round-the-clock
monitoring on a new target.

479
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:32,352
Name, Shaun Emery.

480
00:31:33,712 --> 00:31:36,192
Yes, the soldier.

481
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,712
- Eli.
- Sir.

482
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:42,231
I had two additional senior ops
analyse the footage.

483
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,271
They found no tells,
no signs of correction.

484
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:47,351
When was the last time you ran
a security check on this unit?

485
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:49,631
The operatives? 11 days ago.

486
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:53,360
Beginning of the month.
They're all clean.

487
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:55,312
Run another one.

488
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:57,632
Sure.

489
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:08,911
Sir, the target is showing
as being held in police custody.

490
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:10,272
Not for long.

491
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:11,123
They've released Shaun Emery -
without charge.

492
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,191
I've had my station chief
breathing down my neck all night.

493
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:18,271
I've finished work an hour ago,
I am due back after lunch.

494
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:19,871
Why did they release Emery?

495
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,431
My guess? You can't debunk a story
that was never told.

496
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:25,271
What does that mean?

497
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,733
If Emery isn't charged...

498
00:33:26,734 --> 00:33:28,631
Then the footage
doesn't make the news.

499
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,391
- There's nothing for us to disprove.
- Maybe we need to conjure up

500
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,191
some more evidence. Persuade the
police there's enough there

501
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:36,431
- to get Shaun re-arrested.
- What kind of evidence?

502
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,711
If somebody found something
belonging to you,

503
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,991
washed up in the blind
spot by the river -

504
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:42,551
clothing, jewellery.

505
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:44,551
Planting physical evidence?

506
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:46,511
That undermines the whole point!

507
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:50,431
Shaun has to be convicted on the
basis of corrected video alone.

508
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:53,591
I don't know, Hannah.
If it gets the case reopened...

509
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:56,991
The video's still key.
Just, this way, it's supported.

510
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,720
I can live with it.

511
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,112
Hannah?

512
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:15,231
There's a necklace in my
jewellery box in the bedroom.

513
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:18,505
It has my name engraved on the back.

514
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,031
What's going on?

515
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:57,032
Looks like Toy Soldier
and Heavy Snow are on a stakeout.

516
00:34:57,352 --> 00:35:00,352
And nobody thought to loop me in?

517
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:03,934
Toy Soldier on the move.

518
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:55,591
What's the latest on Toy Soldier?

519
00:35:55,592 --> 00:36:00,871
Believe he's currently inside
Hannah Roberts' apartment building.

520
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:03,111
Why the hell didn't you
tell me this?

521
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:05,385
I was just about to, sir.

522
00:36:07,752 --> 00:36:10,671
Enough tracking. Next opportunity
you get, you bring him in.

523
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:11,992
Securely.

524
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:19,192
Copy that, sir.

525
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:31,196
At least tell me you got
the necklace.

526
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:34,751
I'm sorry, Hannah.

527
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:37,476
- So what happens now?
- Where's Eli in all of this?

528
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:40,232
- Where's Hannah Roberts?
- I was in her flat.

529
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,727
I would've got somewhere if one
of your guys hadn't turned up.

530
00:36:42,728 --> 00:36:43,871
Hell are you talking about?

531
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:45,311
The fucking guy I was following!

532
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:47,031
Now, listen, you've gotta
believe me.

533
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:52,396
I'm being set up, the fucking video
was a fake, it was fake!

534
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:05,472
You see that?

535
00:37:06,712 --> 00:37:09,271
I thought it was
some of our finest work.

536
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:11,454
I'm talking about Emery.

537
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,671
What do you make of that story?

538
00:37:13,672 --> 00:37:17,111
Do you think he was following
somebody?

539
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,512
Sir?

540
00:37:19,472 --> 00:37:21,432
Hey! It's online.

541
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:24,032
It's on YouTube.

542
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:28,231
- Who leaked it?
- I don't know, but it's on BuzzFeed.

543
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:30,951
- This was not the fucking plan!
- I thought we wanted it on the news.

544
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:33,111
As evidence, not some random upload.

545
00:37:33,112 --> 00:37:36,231
Alongside deep fakes and conspiracy
nuts, it has no validity.

546
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:38,911
I don't know.
The Guardian have gone for it.

547
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:40,871
BBC Online. Mail Online.

548
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:43,991
Shit! It's everywhere.
The police can't ignore it.

549
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:46,191
They'll have to re-arrest him now,
no?

550
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:47,871
People are believing it.

551
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:50,145
Like you said they would.

552
00:37:59,512 --> 00:38:02,240
I was just thinking about you.

553
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:05,232
Give me an hour.

554
00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:12,592
Eli.

555
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:15,751
Sir.

556
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,951
- That security check?
- Yeah.

557
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:19,911
I ran it right after you asked.

558
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:22,151
Everybody came back clean.

559
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,432
Even you?

560
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,831
Yeah, save the usual.

561
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,271
Bestial porn.

562
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:34,951
Permission to go take a piss now,
sir?

563
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:37,771
So long as that's all you take.

564
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:57,080
This takes me back.

565
00:38:58,592 --> 00:39:01,071
Always liked it here.

566
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:05,711
One of the last to install cameras.
Still only has the three.

567
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:08,531
Nothing, for a London cemetery.

568
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,151
You'd think we could trust
the dead to go unwatched.

569
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:16,789
Should I have brought flowers?
Or is that premature?

570
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:31,309
The soldier is not complicit.

571
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:35,240
I thought he was, now I don't.

572
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:40,778
He doesn't have a clue
where Roberts is.

573
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:46,512
It's correction.

574
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:50,791
And there's only one option.

575
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,351
Which is?

576
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:56,625
We are done trying to make
this story disappear.

577
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,316
It's time to make it true.

578
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:16,151
I don't like the idea of leaving
you here.

579
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:17,951
Well, I'd better get used to it.

580
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:20,351
It might be weeks
before the big reveal,

581
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,151
if it goes to trial.

582
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,831
It will.

583
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,512
It's working.

584
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:48,498
We need to find another way.

585
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:50,752
Well...

586
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:55,911
...I guess I could just take her
to the woods...

587
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,549
- ...just let her go.
- Frank.

588
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:02,516
She's a British citizen...

589
00:41:02,872 --> 00:41:04,600
...on British soil.

590
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:11,691
- Frank.
- Of course, of course, of course.

591
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:14,392
You're right.

592
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:23,923
Besides, I wouldn't know where to
look for her, even if I wanted to.

593
00:41:26,592 --> 00:41:28,951
Listen! You're making a mistake.

594
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:31,871
Let me talk to Frank.
Let me talk to Frank!

595
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:33,351
Guys...

596
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:38,111
- ...there's nothing I can tell you.
- You're going to tell us something.

597
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:40,112
You've got it wrong...

598
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:18,991
...low, Bailey, 1003, slow-moving.

599
00:42:18,992 --> 00:42:22,551
Filling 1006 by midnight tonight.

600
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:26,351
New lows expected
south-east Biscay, 993,

601
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:30,391
and Fastnet 997 by same time.

602
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:33,471
The area forecasts
for the next 24 hours.

603
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:38,751
Viking, North Utsire,
variable north-westerly 3 or 4.

604
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:40,671
Sea state moderate.

605
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:44,551
Occasional showers,
visibility mainly good.

606
00:42:44,552 --> 00:42:47,916
South Utsire,
north-westerly 4 or 5...

607
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,032
Cujo?

608
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:26,156
Anybody else in the house?

609
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:35,672
Mm.

610
00:44:43,672 --> 00:44:45,232
Eli says hello.

611
00:44:49,432 --> 00:44:52,951
I don't know what you did
to offend him, but...

612
00:44:52,952 --> 00:44:55,911
...he sure gave you up
in a heartbeat.

613
00:44:55,912 --> 00:44:59,951
He's a little less forthcoming
about your friends, though.

614
00:44:59,952 --> 00:45:03,391
So I thought maybe you
could shed some light.

615
00:45:03,392 --> 00:45:06,671
Don't be blinded
by delusions of loyalty.

616
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:12,127
They left you here - with only
the protection of Rin Tin Tin.

617
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:15,512
Go, team.

618
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:22,443
I want you to tell me
who you're working with.

619
00:45:33,712 --> 00:45:36,591
You're Dahmani's lawyer, right?

620
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:38,391
Faisal Dahmani?

621
00:45:38,392 --> 00:45:43,151
Let me ask you a question. Did you
actually buy into his bullshit?

622
00:45:43,152 --> 00:45:46,911
Did he give you the big baby browns?

623
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,640
Or did you know he was guilty?

624
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:53,432
Prove it.

625
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:56,751
Come again?

626
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:59,631
Prove my client was
guilty in a court of law

627
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,191
without falsifying evidence.

628
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,751
- Prove it!
- I saw the intel.

629
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:07,431
- The wiretaps, the intercepts.
- Inadmissible.

630
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,671
In this country, maybe.

631
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:11,431
- If you don't like it, you can always
fuck off home. - Charming.

632
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:13,151
Sorry for keeping you safe.

633
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:15,511
My client is wrongly imprisoned.
Who's keeping him safe?

634
00:46:15,512 --> 00:46:18,951
- Your client's a fucking terrorist.
- It doesn't matter!

635
00:46:18,952 --> 00:46:22,498
Everybody has the right
to a fair trial.

636
00:46:23,632 --> 00:46:26,271
I'm not just doing this to
save Faisal.

637
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:28,991
I'm not even doing it to save every
other victim you've fucked over

638
00:46:28,992 --> 00:46:32,791
by correction. I'm doing it to save
our system of justice.

639
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:35,429
Innocent until proven guilty.

640
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:39,631
And I'm doing it to expose
malignant bastards like you

641
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:41,351
trying to undermine it.

642
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:44,911
Did you ever stop to think about
the irony...

643
00:46:44,912 --> 00:46:45,992
...Hannah?

644
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:49,792
Your beautiful system.

645
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:52,865
Your shining cornerstone.

646
00:46:54,392 --> 00:46:57,847
It's anathema to the people
you defend.

647
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:01,391
Your Islamist clients -

648
00:47:01,392 --> 00:47:05,751
they don't just want to kill you and
me and a few thousand like us.

649
00:47:05,752 --> 00:47:08,752
They want our way of life to end.

650
00:47:10,632 --> 00:47:12,178
Faisal Dahmani...

651
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:18,142
...he wants your beautiful system
destroyed.

652
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:23,192
Prove it.

653
00:47:57,432 --> 00:47:59,672
A woman's life.

654
00:48:02,752 --> 00:48:07,571
Like I said, this wasn't how
I wanted you to find out.

655
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:10,231
- I had a plan.
- And to think I played a part...

656
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:12,551
When the time was right,
to tell you about the programme.

657
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:14,991
- ...makes me sick to my core.
- I'm not condoning what happened,

658
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,471
but Hannah Roberts sealed her own
fate. And you'll see that.

659
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:18,758
- I can show you.
- Show me?!

660
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:20,316
I don't want to be
anywhere near you.

661
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:23,311
Rachel, I told you
because I trust you.

662
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:25,191
- I believe in you.
- Don't touch me.

663
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:26,591
Rachel, you've got to be careful.

664
00:48:26,592 --> 00:48:29,071
Rachel, don't do anything stu...

665
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,432
Rachel!

666
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,356
What are you going to do?!

667
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:57,123
I've known Hannah for seven years.

668
00:48:57,992 --> 00:49:00,551
And I love her very much.

669
00:49:00,552 --> 00:49:04,111
She didn't plan to risk her life,

670
00:49:04,112 --> 00:49:06,391
but was this a cause
worth dying for?

671
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,302
Yes, I believe she'd say it was.

672
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:12,811
Surely you can understand that.

673
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:14,831
Soldiers die in war.

674
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:17,151
This cause is like a war to us.

675
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:20,062
Suspects fitted up by the state.

676
00:49:20,592 --> 00:49:22,471
Why don't they just deny it, then?

677
00:49:22,472 --> 00:49:25,871
A young Muslim gets caught supplying
hydrogen peroxide,

678
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:29,231
and his defence is to claim
the video isn't real?

679
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:34,071
A white nationalist with previous
caught on camera buying firearms.

680
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,311
Who does the jury believe, Shaun,

681
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:38,791
when the evidence
is in front of them?

682
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,751
Hannah's death needn't be in vain.

683
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:44,631
With her murder, those bastards
took our stunt -

684
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:46,791
and they made it real.

685
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:49,911
Now they believe all
they have to do is convict you

686
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:53,912
and the question of false
evidence goes away.

687
00:49:54,552 --> 00:49:57,791
But we've still got the footage.
The real CCTV.

688
00:49:57,792 --> 00:49:59,751
So fucking well get it
out there, then!

689
00:49:59,752 --> 00:50:02,751
But it only works if you're charged,
Shaun. If we make it public now,

690
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:05,231
all we've achieved is
a story about fake news,

691
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:10,596
and we want to show that correction
has infected the courts.

692
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:20,271
You're expecting me
to go through with this?

693
00:50:20,272 --> 00:50:22,671
My brother's still locked up.

694
00:50:22,672 --> 00:50:24,551
So's my dad.

695
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:25,952
So's my son.

696
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:30,151
I was out, Charlie. I was out.

697
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,031
I was about to see my kid.

698
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:35,231
And because of you, my ex thinks
I'm a fucking murderer.

699
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,791
And you expect me
to just go along with this?

700
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:39,520
We hoped you would.

701
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,378
We didn't expect it, though.

702
00:50:47,952 --> 00:50:50,551
The police are going to catch up
with you sooner or later, Shaun.

703
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:54,511
And when they do, we're the only
ones that can help you.

704
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:58,694
So all things considered,
this is for the best.

705
00:50:59,112 --> 00:51:01,711
Anonymous phone call.
Someone spotted you in the club,

706
00:51:01,712 --> 00:51:06,258
let the police arrest you and
leave the rest to us.

707
00:51:10,152 --> 00:51:14,391
It's not like you've left me
much choice, is it, mate?

708
00:51:14,392 --> 00:51:18,031
When all this is over,
you'll still be a hero, Shaun.

709
00:51:18,032 --> 00:51:20,942
Just not in the way you thought.

710
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:28,625
Let me ask you something,
and don't fucking lie.

711
00:51:30,272 --> 00:51:31,512
Helmand.

712
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,591
The video was flawed,
out of sync, like we said.

713
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:40,774
I'm not asking about the video. The
video doesn't prove my innocence.

714
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:43,185
What do you really think?

715
00:51:44,672 --> 00:51:47,945
What do you and Hannah really think?

716
00:51:54,752 --> 00:51:56,392
We gotta move.

717
00:53:50,312 --> 00:53:53,271
All units be advised.
Lights are down inside the venue.

718
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:56,631
Repeat - lights down
inside the venue.

719
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:59,360
Understood. All exits covered.

720
00:54:15,272 --> 00:54:18,000
Please look straight forwards.

721
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:19,552
Keep moving.

722
00:54:20,712 --> 00:54:21,992
Keep coming.

723
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,291
You all right, mate?

724
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:48,951
Eyes on suspect. South Emergency
Exit, Wick Road.

725
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,511
Kilo 6 to all units.

726
00:54:51,512 --> 00:54:53,471
Urgent assistance required.

727
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:55,391
Eyes on!

728
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,191
Copy that, Kilo 6.

729
00:54:59,752 --> 00:55:01,271
Kilo 1 to Kilo 6.

730
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:02,792
Repeat location.

731
00:55:04,352 --> 00:55:05,752
Patrick?

732
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:10,992
Sorry, ma'am.

733
00:55:39,392 --> 00:55:41,029
Please, don't run.

734
00:55:42,712 --> 00:55:48,803
I couldn't arrest you if I wanted
to. They've taken me off the case.

735
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:58,071
Those people at Gastor Square.

736
00:55:58,072 --> 00:56:01,254
They're the ones who killed Hannah.

737
00:56:02,552 --> 00:56:04,192
I know.

738
00:56:06,712 --> 00:56:09,231
You're innocent.

739
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,992
I can prove it.

740
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:16,032
I'm so tired of believing people.

741
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:23,552
Can't force you.

742
00:56:25,712 --> 00:56:27,531
Where are you going?

743
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:30,072
Somewhere safe.

744
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:34,151
He could try and force you,

745
00:56:34,152 --> 00:56:36,791
but he's scared you'll
make his nose bleed again.

746
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:38,392
Is he coming?

747
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,312
You coming?

748
00:57:16,992 --> 00:57:19,951
If you're lying, I'll break more
than your fucking nose, yeah?

749
00:57:19,952 --> 00:57:23,225
All right, Chuck Norris.
Door's open.

750
00:57:34,472 --> 00:57:37,791
The most heavily surveilled
city in the entire Western world,

751
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,311
and the prick just can't just
be found?

752
00:57:40,312 --> 00:57:43,040
Who's helping him now - Putin?

753
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:05,371
Find out which
school his daughter goes to.

1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,792
There's been a development
I'd like to make you aware of.

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:09,225
We've found samples of Hannah's DNA
in the boot of your grandfather's car.

3
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,625
What do you remember, Shaun?

4
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:12,145
Charlie? Have you seen Hannah?

5
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,625
I thought she was with you.

6
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:15,265
CAREY: Did you lose control?

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:19,266
What happened between you
and Hannah Roberts?

8
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,185
When I think about it,
when I close my eyes,

9
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:26,732
I've started seeing Hannah
on the video.

10
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:31,705
- Why is it happening? - Normally I can
see it coming something like that.

11
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:35,785
If we need you testify, Becky,
just stick to the facts.

12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,465
Why don't you tell me
where Hannah is,

13
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,505
before your friend starts
dropping digits.

14
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,865
I don't know where she is!!

15
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,585
I've been trying to find out what
happened to her, where she's gone.

16
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,025
I would've got somewhere if one
of your guys hadn't turned up.

17
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:47,745
The hell you talking about?

18
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:49,145
The guy I was following!

19
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:53,065
We have the support of SO15'S
finest, led by DSU Garland.

20
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,025
Sorry, Sir. DSU...? Garland.

21
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:57,385
Gemma.

22
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:00,585

Belgravia.

23
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:02,185
Ma'am, we're in position.

24
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:03,665
Eaton Square, Belgravia.

25
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,025
We do not have eyes on Shaun Emery.

26
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:09,936
- I can see him.
- Get tactical in here now.

27
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:13,505
HERE! I'M DOWN HERE!

28
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,985
House search complete.

29
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:16,585
No contact.

30
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:19,465
I'm starting to think that
Shaun Emery is telling the truth.

31
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,025
Except that I can prove he isn't.

32
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,905
Hannah Roberts did not
get on that bus.

33
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:25,545
If I wanted to hide
an edit in this scene,

34
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:28,585
I'd use something crossing
the frame blocking the action.

35
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:31,132
It doesn't have to be a bus.

36
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:35,905
I understand you have this drive

37
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:39,088
to get to the very heart of things.

38
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:43,914
But accepting you can rarely
see the whole picture...

39
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,506

00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,106
IT BEEPS QUICKER

165
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:26,906
HE COUGHS

166
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,626
Easy, Shaun.

167
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:35,797
I don't want to use the Taser,
but, if I have to, I will.

168
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:40,425
We were waiting for you to stumble
into a blind spot all night.

169
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:45,699
I didn't expect you to stumble
into the road. My apologies.

170
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:50,583
Steady!
You've probably broken some ribs.

171
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,665
I need to take a look at your shoes.

172
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,848
Pass them to me, please.

173
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,936
You'll get them back.

174
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,525
Kenny! Stop the van!

175
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,025
Kenny! Jesus Christ!

176
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:21,425
- Sh. You stay fucking back.
- We're trying to HELP you!

177
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:24,625
- Don't fucking move.
- Wait! Look inside your shoe!

178
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,536
You've got a tracker!

179
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:32,986
If I may?

180
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,745
Why do you think
they always know where to find you?

181
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,826
Those fucking...

182
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:06,545
I'm meeting people
for dinner at nine.

183
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:10,025
- Work people or wife people?
- Wife people.

184
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:16,026
Pretentious wife people who think
food tastes better at 1,000 feet.

185
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:17,745
The Shard?

186
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,825
That'll put a dent in your wallet.

187
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:22,225
Paying for the view
and I don't like heights.

188
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:25,905
- BARTENDER: Anything for you, madam?
- Just water, please.

189
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,725
So, I hear you've had a result.

190
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,837
You stuck with it. You were right.

191
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:41,425
Why is the woman who redacted
the evidence now running the case?

192
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,385
Gemma Garland.

193
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:45,477
She's SO15, apparently.

194
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,545
Whatever she is, she's making
a mockery of your department.

195
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:54,545
How do you mean?

196
00:15:54,546 --> 00:16:00,705
I raised a serious concern with her,
and she dismissed it.

197
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:01,826
Concern?

198
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:08,385
I think someone's interfering
with our feeds,

199
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,568
tampering with evidence.

200
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:12,586
I'm listening.

201
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:19,226
Take this video.

202
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:24,545
There's a chance it may have been
manipulated

203
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,183
while it was being monitored.

204
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:31,545
Live? It's possible that someone
hacked the feed, put a delay on it,

205
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:34,465
then used this bus to mask an edit.

206
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:38,194
Switching from a real event
to a fake one.

207
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:45,545
What, and then magic
all of this stuff up?

208
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,819
Who's your suspect,
Steven Spielberg?

209
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:52,052
It reminded me of something.

210
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,568
From Operation Sycamore.

211
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,865
This was key, wasn't it?

212
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:02,945
We knew the three Potters
were in contact with the arms dealer

213
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:05,825
but we had no evidence
to connect them.

214
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:10,463
Right, until your CCTV trawl
uncovered this meeting.

215
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,065
Look at it.

216
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,612
A truck goes past
just before they meet.

217
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:25,865
I'm sorry. Is that it? A truck
goes past? A bus goes past?

218
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:29,145
For someone extolling the virtues
of hard evidence,

219
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,265
you don't exactly have very much.

220
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:35,985
Listen, Rachel, the reason
I wanted to see you is this...

221
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:38,466
...thing has to stop.

222
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,265
Thing?

223
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:45,025
Us. It has stopped. I stopped it.

224
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:46,945
Every step of the way
you're coming to me...

225
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:49,785
I called you because I thought
you'd want to know there's a chance

226
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:53,786
the bloody camera network's
been compromised!

227
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,288
Or did you already know?

228
00:17:57,746 --> 00:18:02,292
- I can't get into this.
- Did you... already know?

229
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,465
You've had a shock tonight, Rachel.

230
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,012
Why don't you get some rest.

If you could give me a call back

233

I'd really appreciate it, thank you.

has not yet been determined.

236
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:21,505
But police have confirmed that
Shaun Emery, who remains at large,

237
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:24,779
is now wanted on suspicion
of murder.

This van is hot now. All that
swerving around in range.

239
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,066
He can't be in here.

240
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:05,185
What is that?

241
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,096
A map of blind spots.

242
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,945
Where the cameras can't see.

243
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:13,385
If you're careful, you can get
across town without being watched.

244
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:16,705
If they can track a shoe,
they can track a phone, no?

245
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:18,345
Not that phone.

246
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:21,528
There's another spot in 100 metres.

Who are you? Alma.

248

No, who ARE you?

They should fit.

the police saw you wearing,

255
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:44,865
and get arrested,
or do you want to put those on?

You know when you saw Emery
in Eaton Square,

00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:30,905
do you think you might have got
the wrong address?

Good job it's facing away.

But that's not a police camera.

296
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,425
It's a private one, no?

297
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:21,305
Six million CCTV cameras in the UK.

Almost all of them are online.

- They can be hacked?

Sure you want to do this, Ma'am?

325
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:51,546
Sir?

326
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,586
It's not the fig leaf.

327
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:01,825
Detective Carey,
Homicide and Serious Crime.

328
00:28:01,826 --> 00:28:04,545
I'd like a word with
the occupants of the property.

329
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:06,785
The occupants are overseas.

330
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,385
What a surprise.

331
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:11,425
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to move.

332
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:13,145
It's all right.

333
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,586
Let them in.

334
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:42,506
Please.

335
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,705
You sure you're not thirsty?

336
00:28:57,706 --> 00:29:00,105
No. Thank you, Mr Napier.

337
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,346
Frank.

338
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:05,705
We're sorry to drag you
from your work.

339
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:11,545
It was our suspect, Shaun Emery,
who pointed us in your direction.

340
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:15,785
He mentioned this address when
I spoke to him earlier this evening.

341
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:18,025
You spoke to Shaun Emery tonight?

342
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:19,266
Briefly.

343
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:23,705
I didn't manage to get
the significance of it.

344
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:26,797
Perhaps you could shed some light?

345
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:35,150
Siege of Petersburg, 1865.

346
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:40,136
Lincoln may have won
the hearts and minds...

347
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:46,019
...but if General Grant hadn't
butchered the Confederacy...

348
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:51,812
...that war probably would have
gone the other way.

349
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:58,465
I don't want to insult
your intelligence, Detective Carey,

350
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:01,466
and I hope you don't insult mine.

351
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:05,874
But the work we do here
is very sensitive.

352
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:09,025
If I were to give you any details,

353
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:12,705
without the warrantry
of your Government or mine,

354
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:14,265
that would constitute

355
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:17,665
an unauthorised sharing
of intelligence.

356
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:23,212
Heck, protocol dictates I can't
even acknowledge this address.

357
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:30,074
This address? Where we're sitting
now? You can't acknowledge it?

358
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:33,345
It seems...

359
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:38,437
...Detective Flynn is not
hip to the quirks of our trade.

360
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:42,219
But you, on other hand...

361
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:47,145
...you weren't always in Homicide,
were you?

362
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:49,065
I transferred from CT.

363
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:52,305
Why in the world would you
do a thing like that?

364
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,905
It's making more and more sense.

365
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:56,865
Can I ask a question?

366
00:30:56,866 --> 00:31:01,957
If you're not able to share
anything, why meet us at all?

367
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:06,659
So he can gather intelligence on us.

368
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,026
Old habits.

369
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,306
Well...

370
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:17,423
...I should get back to work.

371
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:31,585
Perhaps we'll get that warrantry.

372
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:34,859
I wish you all
the luck in the world.

373
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:38,145
But shouldn't you be
hunting your murder suspect?

374
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,706
We are.

375
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:54,945
Still thinking
about your girlfriend?

376
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,106
She's my ex.

377
00:31:57,786 --> 00:32:01,705
When all this is resolved,
you'll feel a great weight lifted.

378
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:06,343
Yeah, what makes you sure
it's going to be resolved?

379
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,746
Trust me.

380
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:16,626
My barrister, my friend is dead.

381
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,865
The police think I done it.
My ex thinks I done it.

382
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:24,265
And between, you and me, there
are moments I'm scared I done it.

383
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:27,145
So, if you know I didn't do it,
maybe you could explain it to me.

384
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:30,783
Cos I'd like to find
the people that did.

385
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:38,630
They call it "correction".

386
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:46,325
When they take something that
they don't like and they change it.

387
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,066
Who?

388
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:55,946
Alma. Who?

389
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:00,305
I will tell you.
But you need to be patient.

390
00:33:00,306 --> 00:33:04,034
Right now, I just need you
to concentrate.

391
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:10,521
And help me over this wall.

392
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:17,546
PHONE BUZZES

393
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,905
SHE SIGHS

394
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:26,265
I can't keep taking calls, Frank.
When I find him, you'll find him.

395
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:28,705
I just thought you should know,

396
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:33,706
your Detective Inspector
came knocking on my front door.

397
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,625
Carey?

398
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:38,026
Bright girl.

399
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,786
Too bright?

400
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:52,386
It's tricky, politically.

401
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,179
She's a bit of a mascot around here.

402
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:00,921
I'm sure you'll find a way.

403
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:19,425
- Found it. - Found what?
- That photo in his office.

404
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:22,385
General Ulysses S Grant
at City Point. What about it?

405
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,465
It claims to be from 1865.

406
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:27,145
But experts now believe
it was created in 1902.

407
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:28,945
The background is from
a different battle.

408
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:30,665
And the body's from
a different general.

409
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,505
It's one of the earliest
examples of faked photography.

410
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:36,025
Frank Napier is flaunting it
in our face.

411
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:39,025
You know that "sensitive work"
he mentioned?

412
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:40,665
They're hacking our CCTV.

413
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,545
Tampering with evidence.

414
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:45,910
I just... I just don't have evidence.

415
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:52,263
I think I owe you an apology.

416
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:56,785
- For? - I should have been
talking more to you and Latif,

417
00:34:56,786 --> 00:35:00,150
instead of leaning on 15
all the time.

418
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:02,025
Guess I'd have known better

419
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:04,785
if I hadn't "practically skipped
my stint in Uniform".

420
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,665
HE LAUGHS WRYLY

421
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:09,485
I didn't mean to take the mick.

422
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,545
What's wrong? I'm just hoping

423
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:19,345
Marcus Levy might have
called me back.

424
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:21,305
Who? He's the video expert.

425
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:24,145
He knows how Emery's footage
might have been faked.

426
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:27,025
Ma'am, I don't trust
these people one bit.

427
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:29,585
But Shaun Emery's video
can't be fake.

428
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,185
We've got the body!
And the double-decker?

429
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:35,505
We know Hannah didn't get in
that bus like Emery claimed.

430
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,345
I mean, you saw the footage!

431
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,345
We're not just talking about
one video, either.

432
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,625
What about his whole journey?
To the river. Back home.

433
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:44,385
Levy said it's simpler
than you might think.

434
00:35:44,386 --> 00:35:46,865
All the hard work could have been
done beforehand.

435
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:50,230
Then the fakery spliced
with the real.

436
00:35:51,706 --> 00:35:55,888
Yes, I know how it sounds.
But he's the expert.

437
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:59,703
It's not that.
Just something Becky said.

438
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,186
Becky?

439
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,865
At first, his shoulders are relaxed.

440
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:09,945
He doesn't put his hands up,
then, when he does,

441
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,545
they're open, defensive.

442
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,346
And then he changed.

443
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:19,665
You say it's unusual, then,
Becky, not to see the signs?

444
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,985
We can always tell when something's
going to kick off.

445
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:24,145
So, how do you explain this one?

446
00:36:24,146 --> 00:36:26,705
He's a psycho. Can't predict that.

447
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,225
I'd have called in sooner, if I had.

448
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:30,025
If there was nothing
suspicious about it,

449
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:32,185
just out of interest,

450
00:36:32,186 --> 00:36:34,385
why were you monitoring it
in the first place?

451
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:36,865
That's what we do. We watch.

452
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:41,665
But out of everything that's
happening in the borough? Well...

453
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:45,625
He's... not a bad looking bloke,
is he? And...

454
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:48,717
...I just thought it was romantic.

455
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:52,625
His behaviour changes completely.

456
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:55,545
And it changes right after the bus.

457
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,585
What, all this is made up
on a computer, like Toy Story?

458
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:01,825
Marcus Levy said the hard work
could've been done in advance.

459
00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:04,865
And how could they know where
these two would end up standing?

460
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:07,025
Er... what are you talking about?

461
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,481
Yeah, what about Toy Story?

462
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:13,505
We just need to analyse
the footage, that's all.

463
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:15,225
Make sure it all stands up.

464
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:17,465
You can't argue with this.

465
00:37:17,466 --> 00:37:19,066
No, of course.

466
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:27,226
Thank you.

467
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,345
Sorry, I shouldn't have
said all that.

468
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:37,983
Not in front of the children.

469
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:39,625
See, even that makes sense.

470
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:41,225
What does?

471
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,385
If you wanted to pass
fake footage off as real,

472
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,659
you'd want someone naive to find it.

473
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:51,025
What? Rachel?

474
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:54,025
You said you'd talk to me
and Nads from now on?

475
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:55,865
Team Homicide?

476
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:58,230
This isn't about Homicide.

477
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:02,299
Call it a night, Patrick.

478
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:14,470
You're going to have come up with a
better name for our team than that.

479
00:38:19,826 --> 00:38:22,825

481

00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,305
It's DC Taylor
from Stoke Newington CID.

483
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:32,305
According to his
Mr Levy's phone,

484
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:34,545
yours was the last number he called.

485
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,345
Neighbours discovered him
unconscious

486
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:40,305
on his living room floor
this evening. He's in a coma.

487
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:42,397
Treat it as suspicious.

488
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:45,385
There's no sign of force.

489
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:48,023
The front door was left open.

490
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,945
They wanted him found.

491
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:55,856
Have you any idea why Mr Levy
might have been targeted?

492
00:39:00,586 --> 00:39:02,345
Did you get him down all right?

493
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:04,165
- HE CHUCKLES
- Good.

494
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:08,379
My bus will be here
in three minutes.

495
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:13,390
Don't go to bed! I'll be home
before you know it!

496
00:39:13,546 --> 00:39:17,505
- DS Flynn, please leave a message.
- Patrick, it's Rachel.

497
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:21,585
Just be vigilant on
your way home, please.

498
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:26,346
I'll explain later,
but just make sure you're safe.

499
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:29,426
And your family.

500
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:37,786
Are you serious?

501
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:45,665
This is where you've brought me?

502
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,625
What about all these fucking people?

503
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:52,105
Don't worry, they'll all be too
off their heads to recognise you.

504
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:56,585
- And these cameras?
- They're offline. They're secure.

505
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,306
I know this place.

506
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:01,634
What are you doing?

507
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:03,906
Come on.

508
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:11,225
You said you wanted to know
about "correction".

509
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:13,136
We can talk in there.

510
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,506
LOUD HOUSE MUSIC PLAYS

511
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,465
All right, listen, I've got to go.

512
00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:58,625
I'll grab a bottle of red
from the offie.

513
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,066
I'm on my way.

514
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,746
Taxi!

515
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:42,665
CAR ALARM BEEPS

516
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,186
VEHICLE APPROACHES

517
00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:52,386
DI Carey.

518
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:56,545
I'm sure you're busy trying to
locate your suspect

519
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:59,546
but I need a moment of your time.

520
00:42:00,506 --> 00:42:03,185
It's come to my attention
that, earlier this evening,

521
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:05,745
you instructed DS Latif to arrange
the removal of a victim's

522
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:07,945
remains from Lambeth Coroner's.

523
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:11,105
Any attempt to move such an article
during an ongoing investigation

524
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:13,985
should be considered a breech
in the chain of evidence. This is

525
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:16,665
a homicide investigation that began
at SCD. The autopsy should

526
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,865
have been carried out at
Croydon Coroner's Office.

527
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:21,625
...the body was rightfully
registered at Lambeth Coroner's

528
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:24,305
and I can only conclude that your intention
was to pervert the course of justice.

529
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:27,225
I'm perverting the course of justice!

530
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:30,225
This is not the first transgression
you've made during the course

531
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:32,585
of this investigation.
I also have reason to believe

532
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:35,865
you conspired to publish classified
CCTV evidence online in an effort to

533
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:39,945
undermine your superiors and unduly
influence police operations.

534
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:43,465
These incidents will be reviewed
by a disciplinary board to determine

535
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:46,625
if action or criminal charges
should be taken against you.

536
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:48,905
Until then,
I am left with no alternative

537
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:53,452
but to suspend you from duty
with immediate effect.

538
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,826
Get some rest, Rachel.

539
00:43:02,186 --> 00:43:06,825
Hopefully, when you return,
the decision will go your way.

540
00:43:06,826 --> 00:43:10,917
Be a huge loss to the force
if you were to go.

541
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:23,385
I never said anything
about the evidence.

542
00:43:23,386 --> 00:43:25,425
But I couldn't move the body.

543
00:43:25,426 --> 00:43:27,986
I'd be suspended.

544
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,266
Ma'am?

545
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:38,186
I'm sorry.

546
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:41,870
I'm meant to take the car.

547
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,625
You sure this can't wait till
the day shift? Sorry, fella.

548
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:21,626
The coffees are on me.

549
00:46:00,346 --> 00:46:03,426
WOMAN LAUGHS LOUDLY

550
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:07,764
Chestnut.

551
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:11,726
- Chestnut? Is this a joke?
- It is a joke!

552
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:16,066
THEY LAUGH

553
00:46:18,346 --> 00:46:21,386
Guv? I thought it was you!

554
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:26,425
Sorry, am I interrupting?

555
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:28,146
No...

556
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:33,728
DI Carey, this is my wife, Elaine.
This is Dee.

557
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:36,185
Too many names.

558
00:46:36,186 --> 00:46:38,865
Hi! I'm Rachel.

559
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:40,625
You two work together?

560
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:45,186
- We did. I got moved. - Promoted.
- Technically.

561
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:50,663
So, who's looking after
the kids tonight?

562
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:55,376
We just let them
walk the streets, don't we?

563
00:46:57,026 --> 00:47:00,545
- Whereabouts are you sitting?
- Oh. I'm not with anyone, actually.

564
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:02,785
I got stood up.

565
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,625
ALL: Aw.

566
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:06,985
Come and sit down.
Let's get the girl a drink!

567
00:47:06,986 --> 00:47:09,505
You're on a big case though,
at the moment, aren't you?

568
00:47:09,506 --> 00:47:11,746
No, I got suspended.

569
00:47:13,946 --> 00:47:15,505
I had no idea.

570
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:17,865
Sounds like you really do
need a drink!

571
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:20,065
Excuse me?
Could we get another drinks menu?

572
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:22,785
That's really kind,
but it's been a weird day.

573
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:28,145
I think I'll just go up to the
top floor and jump out the window.

574
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,785
I think you'll find the windows
don't open. Try the roof.

575
00:47:30,786 --> 00:47:32,986
Daniel?

576
00:47:34,266 --> 00:47:36,505
It's fine. Detective's humour.

577
00:47:36,506 --> 00:47:39,143
It was so lovely to meet you.

578
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:40,866
Guv'.

579
00:47:45,026 --> 00:47:49,786
CHATTER RECOMMENCES

580
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:02,619
Just going to the little boys' room.

581
00:48:23,106 --> 00:48:24,706
Shaun?

582
00:49:20,226 --> 00:49:21,826
Shaun!

583
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:51,385
Come on, Carey, pick up!
Where are you?

584
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:55,226
PHONE BUZZES

585
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,585
I'll talk to them about the
suspension but you need to go.

586
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:09,405
I remembered something else
about Sycamore.

587
00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:14,616
I wasn't meant to be
on CCTV watch that day.

588
00:50:15,826 --> 00:50:21,190
I was re-assigned that morning,
told to help with the trawl.

589
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:27,065
Perfect, wasn't I! Fast-track girl,
hungry for promotion.

590
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,145
- I can speak later. - I was used to
find something planted for me

591
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:32,705
and surely you remember it
because you were the one

592
00:50:32,706 --> 00:50:38,070
that re-assigned me! And THAT -
that's what got me promoted!

593
00:50:38,746 --> 00:50:41,265
So, my career's a fucking lie.

594
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:44,065
You were even going to put me
forward for a commendation,

595
00:50:44,066 --> 00:50:49,339
- for a case won on false evidence!
- Keep your voice down.

596
00:50:50,186 --> 00:50:56,005
Why is this happening? How many
other suspects have we fitted up?

597
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:01,905
Answer me...

598
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:06,145
...or, so help me, I will march over
there and I will tell your wife

599
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,786
about us in every, intimate detail.

600
00:51:18,986 --> 00:51:22,185
If you knew what was at stake,
you'd walk away

601
00:51:22,186 --> 00:51:23,785
and pretend this never happened.

602
00:51:23,786 --> 00:51:25,696
I do know the stakes.

603
00:51:26,706 --> 00:51:29,745
- I know what happened to Marcus Levy.
- Who?

604
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:33,586
He's lying unconscious in A&E.
For what?

605
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:39,265
For figuring out what
they did to Shaun?

606
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,985
Is that what they'll do to me?

607
00:51:40,986 --> 00:51:43,585
I don't know what you're
talking about. Shaun Emery!

608
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:46,345
You faked his video evidence, too.

609
00:51:46,346 --> 00:51:48,985
Why? Rachel, I...

610
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:52,714
And if Shaun didn't kill
Hannah Roberts...

611
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:55,266
...then who did?

612
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:02,505
Your wife must be wondering
where you've got to.

613
00:52:02,506 --> 00:52:05,745
I'll tell you this.
The soldier and the silly bitch,

614
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:07,385
if that video was faked,

615
00:52:07,386 --> 00:52:10,545
I swear on my children,
it wasn't anyone we know.

616
00:52:10,546 --> 00:52:12,705
Why would you call her that?

617
00:52:12,706 --> 00:52:17,434
How far did you even
look into the victim, Detective?

618
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:19,685
Ask yourself this...

619
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:21,745
...when did you last hear

620
00:52:21,746 --> 00:52:26,474
of a human rights lawyer
defending a British soldier?

621
00:52:35,626 --> 00:52:37,945
This is Detective Inspector
Rachel Carey.

622
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,305
Please leave a message.

623
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:42,785
Ma'am? Call me back!

624
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:45,145
If there was a delay
on the video feed,

625
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:47,585
Latif would've checked
the wrong bus.

626
00:52:47,586 --> 00:52:51,665
I've been going through CCTV
on the previous bus that night.

627
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:55,506
She's there. Hannah Roberts.

628
00:52:56,866 --> 00:53:00,412
She got on the bus
just like Emery said.

629
00:53:39,826 --> 00:53:41,546
Shaun!

630
00:54:24,186 --> 00:54:27,305
VOICE TALKS SOFTLY

631
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,465
...though she with giants fight.

632
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:32,465
She will make good her right

633
00:54:32,466 --> 00:54:34,346
to be a pilgrim.

634
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:38,265
A pilgrim of justice.

635
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:40,448
ALL: Pilgrim of justice.

636
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:50,865
I'm sorry.

637
00:54:50,866 --> 00:54:52,345
He wouldn't wait.

638
00:54:52,346 --> 00:54:54,586
That's understandable.

639
00:55:00,026 --> 00:55:01,866

1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,501
Armed police!

2
00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:02,693
Shaun Emery, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of assault,

3
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:04,835
-kidnapping and perverting the course of justice.
-What?

4
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,007
That ain't right
she got on that bus.

5
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:10,726
This isn't right,
none of this happened! They
made it so that I grab her.

6
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:13,372
-What you're saying - it makes no sense.
-I know!

7
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:16,364
I had Shaun Emery in custody
until she came along

8
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,318
and redacted the footage.
MI5, I'm guessing.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,798
Just be careful not to
tread on their toes, especially you.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,838
Why me?

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,358
After all your hard
work on Operation Sycamore.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,398
I am a senior video engineer
and broadcast consultant.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,638
Any career highlights?

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,678
The FA Cup Final, 1991,
Spurs v Nottingham Forest.

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,398
-Tottenham fan?
-So long as there's a seat for me in the executive box!

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,238
-What's the location?
-Brenner Street.

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,078
Hannah Roberts' address.

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,238
I don't know what I'm going to find,
but I've got to start somewhere.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,040
You see that bloke that just
come out? He was in the flat.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,718
Taxi turning
into Eaton Square, Belgravia.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,598
We're in position -
Eaton Square, Belgravia,

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,518
and we do not have
eyes on Shaun Emery.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,238
I can see him.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,158
We need intel on that property.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,998
We don't know whose turf
we're treading on.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,278
Wait here and do not take
your eyes off that door.

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,438
What's the status, Eli?

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,360
Toy Soldier is contained, Sir.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,400
May I?

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,360
Apple or cranberry?

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,478
I'd loved to have brought
you a nice hot tea,

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,440
but it's against safety regulations,
if you can believe it!

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
Frank.

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
It's clean.

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, him?

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah...I was hoping
he wouldn't be necessary.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
I guess that all comes down to you.

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,320
Please.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,798
Well...

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,120
..I'm just going to go ahead and...
and take the cranberry.

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
Mm!

42
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,878
Well, as much as I'm enjoying
this back and forth,

43
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
I'm a little pressed for time.

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
You mind telling me where she is?
Hannah Roberts.

45
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,038
How should I know?

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,398
Shaun, I'm going to
ask you one more...

47
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,318
I don't know where she is, mate.

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,400
Well, like I said,
it does come down to you.

49
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,360
That's not live.

50
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,958
Is it? You can't fool me twice.

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
That's a fake.

52
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,440
Malek, remove the hood.

53
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,278
I don't know about you,

54
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,918
but I'm getting tired of Secret
Squirrels stopping us doing our job.

55
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,038
Issues of national security.

56
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,760
-Is that what they'll say when Hannah Roberts' body washes up on the banks of the Thames?
-No.

57
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,198
They won't say a thing.

58
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,038
They'll slink off into the shadows,

59
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,600
-and we'll get shat on from a great height.
-Hmm.

60
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,198
You know what the old lot used
to do, times like this?

61
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,798
Take a 10p piece to a phone box
and call the News Of The World.

62
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,158
Well, there's no
News Of The World any more.

63
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,720
Or phone boxes.

64
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,118
-Tom?
-More training?

65
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,998
I need the session recording from
earlier, but the room's being used.

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,238
Sorry about that.

67
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,158
Some people actually work here,
and bloody rules state
I have to give them priority.

68
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,358
But it'll still be on the system,
though, right?

69
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,440
I shall collate and send it to you
as soon as possible, my dear.

70
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,718
Can I ask...

71
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,920
..have you ever come across
timing issues?

72
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,238
Christmas drinks, '92.

73
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,398
Finally plucked up the courage to
ask Philippa Ducket out on a date.

74
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,158
One day sooner,
and she might've have said yes.

75
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,558
But Colin Parnell got
in there first. Bastard!

76
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,638
-I mean to the network.
-Oh.

77
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,798
Delays to the camera feed.

78
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,238
Not on my watch.

79
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,398
But in theory?

80
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,758
Well, in theory...

81
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,718
..Wi-Fi faults between
the time server

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,398
and the recorders can cause delays,

83
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,798
but we safeguard against it.

84
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,158
So it is possible...

85
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,798
..to monitor an event,
thinking it's live,

86
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,598
while in fact it happened
seconds earlier?

87
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,798
Why are you asking?

88
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
Because it happened today.

89
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,198
Either that, or my team are blind.

90
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,238
Well, which is it?

91
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,960
The sooner I can review those
recordings, the better.

92
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,520
Do you know if the Service own
a safe house in Belgravia?

93
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,278
I'd be the last
person to know that, Carey!

94
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,000
Why don't you ask the guv'nor,
Danny Hart? He'll know.

95
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,238
Slightly busy man, I imagine.

96
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,720
He's always had time for you.

97
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
Thanks.

98
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
Right.

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,078
You'd better hold it steadier

100
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,080
than that, Nads - this is going to
get a lot of views.

101
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,960
Wave to your friend.

102
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,360
Don't you want him to know
that you're OK?

103
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,960
Leave him out of it, mate.

104
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,280
Torture me instead.

105
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,398
-Torture?
-Enhanced interrogation - whatever you want to call it.

106
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,718
Shaun, just tell me where Hannah is.

107
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,358
Why do you think I was in her flat?

108
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,078
I've been trying to find out what
happened to her, where she's gone.

109
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,078
-I would have got somewhere if one of your guys hadn't turned up!
-What the hell are you talking about?

110
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,920
The guy I was following,
the fucking guy I was following!

111
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Shaun...

112
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,718
..I could no sooner use enhanced
interrogation on you than torture
you.

113
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,598
Or your friend here.

114
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,678
I mean, how would that look -
an American hurting Brits?

115
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,078
Two, three years down the road,
The Guardian would come out with

116
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,398
an expose, next thing you know,
Oliver Stone's making

117
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,518
a fucking movie, telling
the world what an asshole I am.

118
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,920
No, thank you.

119
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,880
Now, Malek, on the other hand...

120
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,680
..well, he was recruited
from the Syrian national guard.

121
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,200
They have an entirely different
view of all that.

122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,358
I sure hope his wife is
the caring kind, you know.

123
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,518
I don't know where she is!

124
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,838
I mean, he is going to need a lot
of assistance after my boys have
finished with him.

125
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,998
Listen to me, listen to me.
I'm being set up.

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,638
-All the things you do with your fingers....
-The video is a fake.

127
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,598
Tying your shoelaces,
wiping your ass.

128
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,918
I'm telling you everything that
I know - I'm being set up.

129
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,278
Holding your kid's hand
when you're crossing the street.

130
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,880
The video is fake - it's not me.

131
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,718
Why don't you tell me where
Hannah Roberts is, before your
friend starts dropping digits?

132
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,838
I don't know where she is.

133
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,038
Jesus Christ, what
a waste of fucking time!

134
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,598
-I didn't do any...
-Malek...

135
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,158
-I don't know where she is!
-Sorry, man.

136
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,318
-None of this fucking happened!
-It's just a question of time, at this point.

137
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,158
-I'm being set up - the video is a fake.
-What say we start with the thumb?

138
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,838
I'm being set up.
The video is a fake!

139
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,958
Don't you understand that?
I'm being fucking set up!

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,158
-None of it fucking happened!
-There we go - look at this.

141
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,600
-Tell him to fucking stop!
-Oh, damn!

142
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,518
Mat! Matty boy!

143
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,398
This little piggy went to market...

144
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Mat!

145
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,160
-Mat!
-..this little piggy stays home...

146
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,398
Mat!

147
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
Matty boy!

148
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,038
-We're down to three now, Shaun.
-Mat!

149
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,400
Pretty soon, we're going to
be on the left hand.

150
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,200
Just tell us where she is, Shaun.

151
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,160
You see that?

152
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,398
I thought it was
some of our finest work.

153
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,598
I'm talking about Emery.

154
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,000
What do you make of that story?
You think he was following somebody?

155
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Sir?

156
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,280
It's been online for 12 minutes.

157
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,798
Hi, you've reached the voicemail
of Commander Danny Hart.

158
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
Please leave a message
and I'll get back...

159
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,278
It's Carey. Ma'am?

160
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,198
I suppose you've seen it?

161
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,598
What's that, Ma'am?

162
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,918
Somebody's uploaded the
Emery footage to YouTube.

163
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,880
The CCTV? Who did that?

164
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,198
I don't know.

165
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,758
But if we identify the IP address,
we can find out.

166
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,118
Is...tracing the leak really
a priority, Ma'am?

167
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,238
If the video's uploaded, they
won't be able to keep it redacted.

168
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,638
Might force them
to relaunch the case.

169
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,718
It already has - Boyd's called
a full department meeting,

170
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,958
20 minutes.

171
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,198
-We're on our way.
-No, wait. One of you stay there.

172
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,878
Patrick, keep your eyes on
that address.

173
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,278
If Emery surfaces,
call me immediately.

174
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,320
Ma'am.

175
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,318
Looks like you're getting the bus.

176
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,758
In the last few hours,

177
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,158
dramatic footage has emerged online,
depicting a man believed to

178
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,718
be former soldier Shaun Emery
attacking and abducting a woman.

179
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,838
The victim is thought to be
Emery's barrister -

180
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,838
32-year-old Hannah Roberts.

181
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:50,078
Emery was acquitted for the previous
charge of murder, just hours before
these images were captured.

182
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,318
Obviously, it's a very
distressing situation...

183
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,118
Come here, baby.
She was right next to you!

184
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,598
I didn't see!
Kind of a bit distracted!

185
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,718
..why the only suspect involved in
the disappearance of Hannah Roberts,

186
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,160
namely Shaun Emery,
has been released.

187
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,438
You've all seen the video
evidence by now.

188
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,758
I'm sure you all know how seriously

189
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,438
we take the leaking of
classified material.

190
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,918
Make no mistake - the culprit will
receive full disciplinary action.

191
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,398
Our foremost concern, however,
is finding the victim,

192
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,598
Hannah Roberts,
whose whereabouts remain unknown.

193
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,638
And, of course, apprehending Shaun
Emery - the lowlife who took her.

194
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,958
The investigation will be
led by DI Carey, for those of you
who've not had the pleasure.

195
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,118
Rachel.

196
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,958
And due to the urgency, our
colleagues in Counter Terrorism have

197
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,718
generously offered their assistance.

198
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,358
So you'll feel right at home.

199
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,758
We have the use of a CT ops room

200
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,638
and the support of SO15's finest,
led by DSU Garland.

201
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,798
I will now hand you over
to DI Carey for...

202
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,440
-Sorry, Sir. DSU...?
-Garland. Gemma.

203
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,038
Ma'am.

204
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,918
Regarding the hunt for the suspect,

205
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,118
I took the liberty of putting an
all-ports warning in effect.

206
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,318
I can authorise a facial-rec search,
too, if you issue the order?

207
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,800
I know where he is.

208
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,678
Shaun Emery was last seen entering
a property in Belgravia earlier
this afternoon.

209
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,358
DS Flynn's stationed close by,
keeping eyes on.

210
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,038
It's a large mansion house.

211
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,118
We know of at least two
others inside the building.

212
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,318
Both male, both unknowns.

213
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,118
Beyond that, we have no
intelligence on the property.

214
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,958
None. Perhaps you...

215
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,400
Sounds like we need to knock on
the door. SO15 to monitor.

216
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,638
Arrest teams go in soft.

217
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,480
Uniform and armed units on
standby...

218
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
..would be my suggestion.

219
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,440
Agreed.

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,280
Carey - who do you suppose
leaked the footage?

221
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,078
I've no idea, Sir.

222
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,398
A number of people had
access across the department,

223
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,560
plus there's Comms.

224
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,478
Ma'am?

225
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,640
The detective super from SO15 -
do you know her?

226
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,838
It's a big department.

227
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,318
Rachel?
Why don't you jump in with me?

228
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,440
We can get up to speed on the way.

229
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,520
I'm surprised we haven't met.

230
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,478
I'm SO15, myself.

231
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,758
Well, till recently.

232
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,320
I've been on secondment.
We must have missed each other.

233
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,358
Oh, sorry! Just chuck
that in the back.

234
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,440
Sweet. How many do you have?
Kids, not dolls.

235
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,760
Two girls.

236
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,920
-You?
-Me? No.

237
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,720
I never thought I'd have any.

238
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,238
My mother died giving birth
to my younger brother, so...

239
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,438
God! Sorry.

240
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,238
Yeah, sad.

241
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,518
I was only three, so I don't
remember much, but it certainly put

242
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,720
me off the whole thing for a long
time.

243
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,118
That's why I ended up doing
what I do, I suppose.

244
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,600
Anything to avoid a normal
family life, you know?

245
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
But we all change.

246
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,878
After a while, you crave
a bit of normality.

247
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,360
Not sure I will.

248
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,600
-So what about you? Father in the police, or bullied at school?
-Ha!

249
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,438
Come on, I told you mine!
Why a detective and not a...

250
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,960
..pole vaulter?

251
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,718
Do you want my usual, flippant
answer, or my deep and meaningful
one?

252
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
Which do you think I want?

253
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,480
Well, my dad wasn't in the police.

254
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,960
No, my, um...

255
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,920
My mum died when I was 13.

256
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
Lymphoma.

257
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,798
And then my dad introduced me
to his other woman

258
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,438
and my half-sister.

259
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,238
Your father had another family?

260
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,638
In secret, for seven years.

261
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,560
He'd spend half the week with us,
the other half in London.

262
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,678
Mum thought it was for business.

263
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,840
She never suspected?

264
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
She died not knowing.

265
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,958
I never want to be like that.

266
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,240
Like what?

267
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,120
In the dark.

268
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,240
Well...that beats my story.

269
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,760
Since the footage got redacted...

270
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,840
..I've spent pretty much every
waking moment trying to imagine why.

271
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,200
That's understandable.

272
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,040
You just can't stay out
of the spotlight, can you, friend?

273
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,038
Tactical are in position, Ma'am.
If backup's required, we're ready to
deploy within 15 seconds.

274
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,158
Hopefully, it won't come to that.

275
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,958
DS Flynn and I will approach the
door in the first instance,

276
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,638
supported by remote surveillance
from the monitoring stations.

277
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,998
They've bounced the feeds from
the ops room. Good to go.

278
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,478
All other units await
further instruction.

279
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,800
Understood.

280
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,358
Clear vision on arrest team.

281
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,878
-Comms check?
-10-4, receiving.

282
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,478
Tactical and support units
in position. Standing by.

283
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,000
Received, Ma'am.

284
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,160
-Sorry, Sir. I didn't see you...
-Ignore me. I'm passing through.

285
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,758
Glad to be back on the case, Ma'am?

286
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,998
Officially? Almost a good thing -

287
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
the leak.

288
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
Sir? We have some
visitors from out of town.

289
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,440
Bring it up.

290
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,240
They're looking for me.

291
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,598
Detective Sergeant Flynn.
Homicide and Serious Crime Command.

292
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,078
We're looking for a suspect,
believed to be in this area.

293
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,600
Any chance you recognise him?

294
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,080
I know him.

295
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,878
From the TV.

296
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
He's the soldier.

297
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,120
In this area? I don't see him.

298
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,920
Mind if we take a look inside?

299
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,638
But the owners are overseas,

300
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,078
so it will be very difficult to
contact them for permission.

301
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,800
We don't need permission -
we have a warrant.

302
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,400
Downstairs! I'm downstairs!

303
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,078
What is this place?

304
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,520
Private apartments.

305
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,560
I need all these doors open.

306
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,960
Jutca!

307
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,438
How many people in the building?

308
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,998
Normally, two.

309
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,118
Since you came, four.

310
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,360
Where does this door lead to?

311
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,720
-Downstairs.
-I need it open.

312
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,040
This one, I do not have.

313
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,520
Get Tactical in here now.

314
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,760
Downstairs!

315
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,758
Here! I'm down here!

316
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,200
-Search every room.
-This way.
-Tactical with me.

317
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,600
Armed police! Armed police!

318
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
I'm downstairs, yes!

319
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,918
I'M...HERE!

320
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,400
SHUT...UP!

321
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
Check that door.

322
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,640
Hit it.

323
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,480
-Clear.
-Clear, Ma'am.

324
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,400
-How we doing?
-Clear, Ma'am.
-Clear, Ma'am.

325
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,558
Search complete on the top floor.
No contact, Ma'am.

326
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,638
No other exit points either, Ma'am.

327
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,478
You had eyes on the front
door all afternoon?

328
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,800
Yes, Ma'am.

329
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,398
House search complete.

330
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,760
No contact.

331
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,638
I need a full CCTV trawl of the last

332
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,518
three hours from all
cameras in the immediate vicinity,

333
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,760
starting with this one.

334
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
Understood.

335
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,000
Where's the monitor for that camera?

336
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,600
Let me have audio.

337
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,558
Come on! We just searched

338
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,400
the whole house! Where is the
monitor for this camera?

339
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,920
Er... I don't have.

340
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,520
-Why not?
-I never have.

341
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,838
This camera is a...

342
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,240
How you say in English, dunny?

343
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,758
-Dummy?
-Dummy, yeah. This is a dummy.

344
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,400
It's a dummy camera, Ma'am.

345
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,240
Think we put them off the scent?

346
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,400
Yeah...but for how long?

347
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
On your feet, Soldier.

348
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,800
You're a real shit magnet,
you know that, Shaun?

349
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,080
Just a routine measure to protect
my friends against your temper.

350
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,840
All right, mate.

351
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,000
You've got to admit -
it's kind of fitting.

352
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,560
..put his facial rec back to
the old suspect. As yet, no matches.

353
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,078
Understood.

354
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,638
How's the trawl from Eaton Square?

355
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,998
It's happening.
Pulling the feeds up now.

356
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,678
Anything in particular
you're looking for?

357
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,078
Yes.

358
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,078
The suspect leaving the
property we just raided.

359
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,398
-Where's Tom?
-He's off shift.

360
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,198
I thought he never went home.
He was going to pull
the recordings from my session.

361
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,838
-Rachel, would you like to lead this?
-I am leading this.

362
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,480
I meant the briefing, sorry.

363
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,918
You go ahead.

364
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,958
OK. Just to be clear, folks,
the investigation continues to be

365
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,598
under Detective Carey's
operational command...

366
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,998
How long has she been in SO15?

367
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,320
A lot longer than me.

368
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,880
You've worked with her?

369
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,238
Ma'am, sorry to interrupt,

370
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,118
but DS Phillips
and I pulled the suspect's

371
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,358
journey on CCTV
during the initial...

372
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,358
I'd like you to go over it again.
Things may have been missed.

373
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,480
Ma'am.

374
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,000
Shit! He's out! He's out!

375
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,920
Let him go.
No need to cause a scene.

376
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,120
Attaboy!

377
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,678
Today's feeds from Eaton Square?

378
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,158
Yes, Ma'am.
Nothing of interest so far.

379
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,638
The suspect doesn't
leave the property?

380
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,478
-Does anyone?
-No, Ma'am.

381
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,158
-How far back have you checked?
-Till 9am this morning.

382
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,598
Shaun Emery, the suspect?

383
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,798
You don't see a taxi arrive
and him enter the property?

384
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,638
No, Ma'am.

385
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,360
Check again between 12 and 1pm.

386
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,918
Where's the techie who
was on my session earlier?

387
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,198
Off shift, I guess.

388
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,878
Well, I need to speak to him.
Get him on the phone now.

389
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,080
All right.

390
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,880
-Who was it?
-For fuck's sake!
-Can I help with anything?

391
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,280
Ma'am.

392
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,078
Come on, you Spurs!
Come on, you Spurs!

393
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,838
Come on, you Spurs!
Come on, you Spurs!

394
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Come on, you Spurs!

395
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,680
I need to report a concern.

396
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,158
The sighting of the suspect
at Eaton Square - it was via CCTV.

397
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,680
I monitored it myself, live.

398
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,718
But there's no trace of it
in the archive.

399
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,198
-You're certain you saw him?
-On the feed, Ma'am, yes.

400
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,438
Except, my team on the ground
didn't.

401
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,758
-Didn't?
-I realise how it must sound.

402
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,198
It's almost as hard to believe
as Shaun Emery.

403
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,720
But also very similar.

404
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,558
The only eyewitness to Hannah
Roberts' abduction

405
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,760
was a council
worker monitoring the feed.

406
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,638
Shaun Emery claims this evidence
is somehow untrue.

407
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,798
While I'm strongly disinclined
to believe that,

408
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,558
I also cannot deny the correlation
with what happened today.

409
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,960
How do you make sense of it?

410
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,758
I was hoping you might
shed some light.

411
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,000
Why me?

412
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,758
I imagine there's only
so much you can tell me,

413
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,958
but I thought it might be
pertinent...

414
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,318
To...?

415
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,520
..to the concerns that saw
the Emery footage redacted.

416
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,520
You're right, Rachel.

417
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,760
There is only so much I can tell
you.

418
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,560
But thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

419
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,040
It may well be pertinent,
as you suggest.

420
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,158
I've been trying to retrieve the
recording from my original session.

421
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,000
I'd like to see that.

422
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,078
He's always in the toilet!

423
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,478
You spend more time in the toilet...

424
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,718
We can go home now - you can
go to your own toilet!

425
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,878
-Thank goodness for that!
-Take care, mate.

426
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,680
Come on, you lilywhite Spurs!

427
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,000
Marcus.

428
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,078
Marcus.

429
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,840
Don't freak the fuck out. Keep
moving, keep moving, keep moving.

430
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,278
I just want to talk to you alone.

431
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,158
How far's your place?

432
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,360
How do you know I live alone?

433
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,600
Wild guess.

434
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,998
If you want money,
I don't keep any in the house.

435
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,398
Even if you did,
it'd take me a month to find it!

436
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,800
You ever heard of a cleaner?

437
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,160
You seen it, then?

438
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
The video?

439
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,718
I suppose everyone has.

440
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,440
Well, it's not real.

441
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,038
Go on, get it up.

442
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,360
Please.

443
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,278
So what, by "not real",

444
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,278
you mean this isn't you?

445
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,478
It's me, and that's Hannah,
but that didn't happen.

446
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,160
She kissed me. She got on a bus,
that's the last I see of her.

447
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,480
Go on, then.

448
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,240
Figure it out. How they did it.
Like you did at my appeal.

449
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,278
Well, I...

450
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,758
This is very intricate.

451
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,478
There's a lot of action.

452
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,918
On the other hand,

453
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,758
face-mapping technology is becoming
more and more accessible.

454
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,960
You've probably seen these
deepfake porn sites.

455
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,398
No.

456
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,958
Well, as I understand it, they um...

457
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,238
..they take famous women's faces
and they put them on bodies that...

458
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,318
Well, apparently
they can look quite convincing.

459
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,718
The point is, someone had
enough images of you,

460
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,438
plus the right software...

461
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,638
Fucking Army's got thousands
of photos of me.

462
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,158
But...

463
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,158
..none of this explains how it
could have appeared on CCTV.

464
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,238
Police said they'd seen it live.

465
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,880
-Live?
-Live, yeah.

466
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,760
OK, um, let me show you something.

467
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,398
Right... Do you know who that is?

468
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,518
No.

469
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,600
-It's Joseph Jastrow. Psychologist.
-So?

470
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,400
What do you see here, Shaun?

471
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,360
Are you taking the piss?

472
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,598
A duck. What?!

473
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,320
Not a... Not a rabbit?

474
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,758
You see, Jastrow observed that
people were more likely to see

475
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,318
a rabbit at Easter time.

476
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,558
So he concluded that what we see

477
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,238
depends on our surroundings,
our state of emotion.

478
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,000
I mean, I don't know
a great deal about it, but, um...

479
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
..I know the mind can be tricked.

480
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,318
And I know you
can't alter live CCTV.

481
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,678
Listen, you duck-rabbit fuck!

482
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,520
-I didn't do it!
-Please don't hurt me.

483
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,080
I wasn't going to hurt you.

484
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,238
Ma'am, it looks like
DSU Garland was right.

485
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,718
There was another
blind spot in Emery's journey.

486
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,598
On his way back home from the river.

487
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,358
You missed it the first time?

488
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,958
Apparently.

489
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,278
Phillips was leading it.

490
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,278
It's not your fault.

491
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,358
Get down there, take a look.

492
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,358
Ma'am, aren't you coming?

493
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,560
-You and Patrick can take it.
-OK.

494
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,518
Is this room free now?

495
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,398
I need to upload my training
session from earlier today.

496
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,478
The entire recording
from 11.30 to 1.

497
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,278
Ma'am, just spoke to a caller,

498
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,838
reckons he's got new information
on Shaun Emery.

499
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,638
-He's asking to speak to the SIO.
-Take his details for me.

500
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,998
Is it up?

501
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,518
It's not on the main server.

502
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,358
-Why not?
-I don't know.

503
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,278
You said it was training...

504
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,998
I thought the whole system
was saved for a week?

505
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,918
-Ma'am?
-What's this?

506
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,798
The caller's details. Mr Levy.

507
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,838
He did say it was urgent.

508
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,558
It's not always a week, OK?

509
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,438
-It's measured in volume of data.
-Yeah, but it's been a couple of hours!

510
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,358
Rachel? You found another
gap in the suspect's journey?

511
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,038
DS Latif is leading the search.

512
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,438
I'm trying to recover that
recording we discussed, Ma'am.

513
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,718
The discrepancy. It doesn't
appear to be on the system.

514
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,238
Look, I can't find what's not there.

515
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,118
I wanted to make sure that you saw
it, given how important you said it
was.

516
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,960
So...

517
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,918
..all there is to go on is the trawl
that revealed nothing...

518
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,238
..and your account.

519
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,398
The Tech Op.

520
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,680
He saw it too.

521
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,118
Is he here?

522
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,838
Apparently not.

523
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,558
But like you said, Ma'am,

524
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,440
this needs looking into.

525
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,080
Rachel.

526
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,640
I understand you have this drive
to get to the very heart of things.

527
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,998
It's commendable,

528
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,840
and, in other detective work, vital.

529
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,038
But here at Counter Terrorism...
Intelligence,

530
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,518
accepting you can rarely
see the whole picture

531
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,280
is part of the job.

532
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,720
There are boundaries you learn
to recognise and respect.

533
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,640
Just the same
as in your private life.

534
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,520
You asked, why the police?

535
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,200
I should have given
you my usual answer.

536
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,438
Because when they say,
"Move along, nothing to see here",

537
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,760
they're lying.

538
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,280
Mr Levy? It's Detective Carey
returning your phone call.

539
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,998
How big is this blind spot?

540
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,720
Just this lower level.

541
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,840
And he was in here for a minute?

542
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,360
One minute, 12 seconds.

543
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,960
Let's get these garages open.

544
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,320
-Mr Levy?
-Yes.

545
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,438
-Did you get the links I sent you?
-To your Wikipedia page?

546
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,798
Well, just so you don't think
I'm some crackpot.

547
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,318
You're a sports producer.

548
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,398
Senior broadcast consultant.

549
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,640
Right.

550
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,918
I'm in the middle of a manhunt,
Mr Levy.

551
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,078
He came to my house.

552
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,238
Shaun Emery?

553
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,838
-About an hour ago.
-I need to call this in.

554
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,358
Don't, please, please.

555
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,960
Listen to what
I have to say, before you do that.

556
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,440
Shaun!

557
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,918
Shaun!

558
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,440
-Mat?
-Yeah.

559
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,118
-You got out?
-What?

560
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,758
How the fuck did you find me?

561
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,438
Cos you're shit at hiding!

562
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,758
Quinny's stag!

563
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,278
When we missed the last train, so
we broke in and kipped in here.

564
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,440
Said we'd always have
a place for the night.

565
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,280
What, you forgot?

566
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,120
It's just me.

567
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,398
Your fingers?

568
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,760
What about them?

569
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,040
-They chopped off your fingers.
-What?!

570
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,120
Fuck.

571
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,400
Are you going to put that down now?

572
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,080
You've seen this many times,
I'm sure.

573
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,480
Now, Shaun claims this
has somehow been fabricated.

574
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,558
And what do you think?

575
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,558
Well, as I said to Shaun, almost
anything is possible these days

576
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,318
when it comes to video manipulation.

577
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,438
I imagine you're familiar
with so-called

578
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,280
deepfake pornography, for instance.

579
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,440
Go on.

580
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,398
Well, the point is,

581
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,758
you don't have to be
Anslem von Seherr-Thoss any more

582
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,798
to produce convincing
visual effects.

583
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,518
In any case, the simple
fact of the matter is,

584
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,558
you cannot manipulate
CCTV images live.

585
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,240
But what if it wasn't?

586
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,838
What if it wasn't what?

587
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,200
Live.

588
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,118
You mean, like,
if there was a delay to the feed?

589
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,798
Let me ask you something.

590
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,238
Do any other street cameras border
this one, or cross its range?

591
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,518
No. There were no border cameras.

592
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,638
Right, no need
for direct continuity.

593
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,438
Now, if someone were to
hack into this feed

594
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,798
when this street was empty, and
then slow it down or loop it for a
few seconds,

595
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,318
who's going to notice?

596
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,238
But then, once the delay to the feed
is introduced,

597
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,718
that would buy time for the next
component of this subterfuge.

598
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,798
Which is?

599
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,918
The stitch.

600
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,238
See, Shaun remembers this stage
as accurate and authentic,

601
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,798
yet, he claims what follows
is a work of fiction.

602
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,238
Now, if that is the case,
then there has to be a transition

603
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,038
that the human eye doesn't see -
an invisible cut.

604
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,918
And is there?

605
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,758
I don't know - I can't see
an invisible cut any more than I can
see the Invisible Man.

606
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,160
But I know where it'd be
if there was one.

607
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,078
If I wanted to hide an edit
in this scene, I'd use the wipe.

608
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,838
-The wipe.
-Yeah. The wipe is something crossing the frame,

609
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,200
blocking the action.

610
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,518
This could be an edit?

611
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,038
It's the perfect place to hide one.

612
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,958
And, after all, the contentious
part of the action is post-bus.

613
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,118
Now, I must say, it is extremely
well-executed, if it is,

614
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,558
but I mean, that's the point.

615
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,718
If properly done,
it's impossible to prove.

616
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,238
It doesn't have to be a bus.

617
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,198
No, anything that passes by and
obscures the action, would do it.

618
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,038
A bus, a train, a person, if
they're close enough to the camera.

619
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,798
-A truck?
-Yeah, yeah, a truck. Yeah.

620
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,358
Look, look, it's just a possibility,

621
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,598
but I thought you should
know about it.

622
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,280
Thank you, Mr Levy.

623
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,718
I need something,
from the archives.

624
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,398
-I don't know where your session is.
-No, not that. From Sycamore.

625
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,638
The Rashid meeting.

626
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,760
What, your star turn? Try YouTube -
it was in all the reports.

627
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,640
Carey? Why do you need it?

628
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,000
-This one?
-Yeah.

629
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,678
Clear.

630
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,360
Where's your car?

631
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,038
With my other half.

632
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,720
So, where's your other half?

633
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,760
I saw them torture you.

634
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,358
It weren't me, Shaun.

635
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,838
They must have made it up.

636
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,320
It must be the same ones
that faked your CCTV.

637
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,960
That don't make sense. If, er...

638
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,240
If he faked the CCTV,
why would he ask about Hannah?

639
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,918
What's the matter?

640
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,680
I know it's not real.

641
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,398
But when I think about it,
when I close my eyes,

642
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,518
I've started seeing it
like that fucking video.

643
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,680
Why does that happen?

644
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,040
Shaun, you've done nothing wrong.
Remember that.

645
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,398
I need to get out of London.

646
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,758
-All these cameras, I can't fucking think.
-They've got cameras outside London.

647
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,240
Not as many.

648
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,118
-You drove.
-Shaun...

649
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,640
-I can't.
-Yeah, you can. Just give me the car, all right?

650
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,880
You ain't coming with me.

651
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,840
The four individuals sentenced
this morning had the means...

652
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,918
The suspects claim
they had no connection

653
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,158
to the Birmingham-based
arms dealer.

654
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,920
This CCTV footage says otherwise.

655
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,320
This CCTV footage says otherwise.

656
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,080
This CCTV footage says otherwise.

657
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,558
The suspects claim
they had no connection

658
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,678
to the Birmingham-based
arms dealer.

659
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,520
This CCTV footage says otherwise.

660
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,838
DS Latif to Control.

661
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,318
We're looking for a dark grey
Skoda Octavia...

662
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,198
Registration - Yankee, Yankee,
Zero, Six,

663
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
Uniform, Papa, Oscar.

664
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,280
Running plate check.

665
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,558
Got him.

666
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,318
Suspect vehicle heading
south-east on the A282.

667
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,520
Fuck.

668
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,800
Got him.

669
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,680
What the hell's he looking at?

670
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,280
I'm heading down there.

671
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,878
Don't you need to stay and command?

672
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,680
Not from here.

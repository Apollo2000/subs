1
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,007
You have to come.

2
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,275
Something really bad happened.

3
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,511
Did you just get your period
all over yourself?

4
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,248
This isn't my blood.

5
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:40,088
Holy crap!

6
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,223
Who told you you could
have a baby here tonight?

7
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,792
Guys, I'm so sorry.

8
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,728
Obviously, I'm as upset

9
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:48,196
as anyone about this.

10
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,865
I'm sure I can walk
if I can just get some Gatorade.

11
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:52,133
I don't care if you can walk.

12
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,802
How are we supposed to get you
to the front door

13
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,371
without everyone seeing you all gross

14
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,473
and postpartum?

15
00:00:58,508 --> 00:00:59,908
No one wants to see that at a party.

16
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:02,744
Right. Of course. Uh...

17
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,812
This is super embarrassing.

18
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,548
I didn't even know I was pregnant.

19
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,283
I just thought it was the freshman 15.

20
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,051
I thought I was having a bread baby.

21
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,419
You are officially the worst

22
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:12,754
Kappa pledge of all time.

23
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,489
Okay, we have to get her help.

24
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,257
You guys, they're playing "Waterfalls."

25
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,194
Is that a baby? Amazing.

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,063
Look, this is our song.

27
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:23,565
TLC!

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,233
I am not missing "Waterfalls"

29
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,401
for this.

30
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,402
"Waterfalls" is my jam.

31
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:28,903
We can't just leave her.

32
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,405
We'll be back after this song.

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,507
Give the baby some mojito to quiet it down.

34
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,134
Kappa!

35
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,774
You guys, I'm such a good babysitter.

36
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,076
I brought you some Bartles and Jaymes.

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,813
What the hell?

38
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,548
What's wrong with her? She looks awful.

39
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,451
She's dead.

40
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,152
How do you know she's dead?

41
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,888
Because her eyes are stuck open.

42
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,790
I tried to touch one, but she didn't move.

43
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,359
Dude, that is so gross.

44
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,461
I can't even wear contact lenses because

45
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,629
that freaks me out so much.

46
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,397
She's dead.

47
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,667
Okay? What the hell are we gonna do?

48
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,713

49
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,860
Good morning, slits.

50
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,828
Good morning, Chanel.

51
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:02,597
My name is Chanel Oberlin,

52
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,766
and I am the queen of Kappa Kappa Tau.

53
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,435
No.

54
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,138
No.

55
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,341
No.

56
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,342
These are my minions.

57
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,376
I don't know their names.

58
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,577
I don't want to know their names.

59
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,845
They're known as...

60
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,782
Chanel #2.

61
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,950
Chanel #3.

62
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,919
Chanel #5.

63
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,690
I'm Chanel #1, obvi.

64
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:31,626
There was a Chanel #4,
but she got meningitis.

65
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,528
She was like, "I'm sick.
I have to go home."

66
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:34,862
And I was like, "No. Stay."

67
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:36,531
But she went home anyway,
and then she died.

68
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,334
So another thing I was right about.

69
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,537
I'll see you ladies in bio.

70
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,105
I have a colonic at 10:00.

71
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,873
A lot of people talk smack
about how sororities

72
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,209
are exclusive and they're a class system.

73
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,046
Well, guess what.

74
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:55,316
Life is a class system.

75
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:57,485
And a sorority is the one place
left in the world

76
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,088
where you get to pick and
choose the people around you.

77
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,726
That obese specimen of human
filth scrubbing bulimia vomit

78
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,728
out of the carpet is Ms. Bean.
I call her White Mammy

79
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,429
because she's essentially a house slave.

80
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,430
Watch this.

81
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,932
Excuse me, White Mammy.

82
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,501
You're not allowed to call me that.

83
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:16,738
Sorry. I have a question.
And it's just a hypothetical.

84
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,239
If I asked you

85
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,074
if you knew somethin' 'bout birthin' babies

86
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,009
or if you didn't know nothin'
'bout birthin' no babies...

87
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:23,911
what would you say?

88
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,613
I'd say I don't know.

89
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,614
Don't know...?

90
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,249
I don't know nothin'

91
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,617
'bout birthin' no babies.

92
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,919
Amazing. Thank you.

93
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,088
Oh, still a lot of puke to scrub.

94
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,256
Let's make that a priority.

95
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,591
The things you say are hilarious

96
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,626
- and poignant.
- Thank you.

97
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:40,628
Yeah, you have an
amazing skill at telling people

98
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,130
what they need to hear.

99
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,532
I'm sorry. Did I ask you
to pull down my panties

100
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,033
and blow a compliment up my butt?

101
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,603
Nobody likes a suck-up, Chanel #5.

102
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:52,106
Oh, Ms. Chanel, I almost forgot.

103
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:55,610
The Dean of Students called, and
she needs to see you right away.

104
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,879
I'm gonna be honest.

105
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,114
I hate sororities, and I hate you.

106
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,517
For years, I've seen the damage

107
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,886
these so-called sisterhoods
have had on young girls.

108
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,654
Do you think you like to munch box

109
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,055
because your last name is Munsch,

110
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,724
or is that just a coincidence?

111
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,125
First of all, I'm not a lesbian.

112
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,227
Second, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

113
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,562
You see, out in the real world,

114
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,731
people just don't talk
that way to other people.

115
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:17,899
It's not normal.

116
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:19,534
Now, I'm not sure you're aware,

117
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,737
but I'm no longer Associate Dean.

118
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,072
After Dean Reynolds' unfortunate
passing over the summer,

119
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,707
I was promoted to her position.

120
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,143
Well, that sure sounds suspicious.

121
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,245
Yes. I snuck into the home
of my 80-year-old colleague

122
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,215
of 20 years and dropped a
transistor radio in her bathtub

123
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,050
so I could get a five percent raise.

124
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,952
Take your glasses off.

125
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,157
Now, Dean Reynolds' oversight of Greek life

126
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:48,229
at this school was so negligent
that it bordered on criminal.

127
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:52,400
And Kappa is the source of
rampant reports of alcoholism,

128
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,836
prescription drug abuse, racism,

129
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,239
as well as allegations of bestiality...

130
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,074
No one forced that goat
to get as drunk as it got.

131
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,075
That's on him.

132
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,277
But all of it is like children

133
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:06,180
playing in a sandbox
compared to the horrors

134
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:09,250
that occurred at Kappa last spring.

135
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,385
This is the final police report
on the assault

136
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:14,455
on your presidential predecessor
at Kappa, Melanie Dorkess.

137
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:17,191
That girl was a bitch
who thought she was all that

138
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:19,026
because her family founded the Olive Garden

139
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:21,028
and she had no gag reflex.

140
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:23,364
My main problem with you,
Chanel, is that you're short.

141
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,033
And, historically, short people
are sneaky backstabbers,

142
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,568
like Napoleon or Paul Shaffer.

143
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,270
I asked, but the dry cleaner said

144
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,805
they couldn't rush the clothes.

145
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,806
I'm so sorry.

146
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:32,874
I'm not finished.

147
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,208
I could actually handle

148
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:35,977
that you're built like a Thai lady boy,

149
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,378
but what I can't stand

150
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,547
is that you think you're my heir apparent.

151
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,483
The Greek system is under
fire all over the country.

152
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,819
The next president of this
house has to be willing

153
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,287
to dance with the devil himself

154
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,122
to keep this thing of ours going.

155
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,891
And, baby, you ain't got it.

156
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,826
I'm sorry, Chanel.

157
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,594
You are no longer invited on my plane

158
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,229
down to Punta Mita for spring break.

159
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,664
No. Please don't do this to me.

160
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,966
Don't you want me to spray-tan you?

161
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,801
I have it all ready.

162
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,672
No, Chanel. I would honestly
rather not have you around.

163
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,682
Okay. Someone turn me
into Jada Pinkett Smith.

164
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,703
The police still can't figure out

165
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,905
who filled that tank with hydrochloric acid.

166
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,442
You know what I think?

167
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,144
I think you did it.

168
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,413
I think you knew

169
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,048
that with her out of the way,

170
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,417
Kappa would be yours for the taking.

171
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,586
I'm flattered.

172
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:28,322
But like the final police report says,

173
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,391
the manufacturer of said spray tan

174
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,059
settled with Melanie out of court.

175
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,095
It's good enough for me, and the D.A.,

176
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,398
who, last I heard,
considers the case closed.

177
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,433
This is personal for me, Chanel.

178
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:42,737
You represent everything that is wrong

179
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,607
with young girls nowadays,
and I'm gonna take you

180
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:49,010
and that so-called kingdom

181
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,544
you call a sorority down,

182
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,281
and I'm gonna start
by revoking its charter.

183
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,952
Uh... Chanel, I can take it

184
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,120
from here.

185
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,521
Gigi Caldwell. Hi.

186
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:03,090
Hi, hi, hi. I'm president
of the national chapter

187
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,392
of Kappa Kappa Tau.

188
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,626
What is that skirt?

189
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:09,196
Uh, it's Forenza.

190
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:10,364
Yeah.

191
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,602
So, um... you can't revoke our charter.

192
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,303
I'm so sorry.

193
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,972
That'll be up to the board of trustees.

194
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,641
Your organization
might want to find a lawyer.

195
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:22,877
I am the lawyer.

196
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,979
I graduated summa cum laude

197
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,981
from a fourth-tier law school

198
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,216
in the Caribbean, so...

199
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,651
I'm a pretty smart cookie.

200
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:33,654
Okay, you can't let her revoke our charter.

201
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,289
My career depends on it.

202
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,091
Every year, the head of Kappa gets

203
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,093
a year-long internship
with Good Morning America

204
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,495
and Kappa sister Diane Sawyer.

205
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,564
How else am I supposed
to become a network news anchor?

206
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,166
Are you done?

207
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,968
Okay, Chanel, why don't you
head back to the house

208
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,570
and start getting it ready for rush.

209
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:52,339
It's gonna be a totally rad one this year.

210
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,010
We have a side boob mixer,
followed by a white party,

211
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:59,346
where everyone is
encouraged to wear/be white.

212
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:00,981
In regards to

213
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,984
your fatwa against me, Dean Box Munch,

214
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,520
I'm sure you are aware that my daddy

215
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:09,023
is the largest donor
to this university's endowment.

216
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,692
I would not get personal
with me, sweetheart.

217
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:13,227
I don't fight fair.

218
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,701
I may not be able to
revoke its charter today,

219
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,703
but there is no way that Kappa,

220
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,705
at least the way it's constituted now,

221
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:26,373
is surviving the year.

222
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,977
You know what, I could not
agree with you more.

223
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,179
May I make a suggestion?

224
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,552
I, uh, I made a playlist

225
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,387
for the ride. Check it out.
Let me see.

226
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,957
Oh, let me guess, "Grace College Drive"?

227
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,493
You're so literal.
I just hope it's not maudlin.

228
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,894
Big word, college girl.

229
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,900
Dad, are you kidding?

230
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,373
What? I am sentimental.

231
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,243
You know, when I took you to
see Twilight in the theater,

232
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,912
it was your first PG-13 movie.

233
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,747
Come on.

234
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:07,982
Team...

235
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:11,252
- Edward. Edward.
- Yes. Edward. Team Edward.

236
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:14,088
Look, I'm-I'm totally freaking
out about all this, okay?

237
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:17,758
Y... You're all I got, Gracie.
No pressure or anything.

238
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,927
And I know this... I know
this makes me a loser,

239
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,662
but, uh...

240
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:23,864
You're my best friend.

241
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, it does make you a loser.

242
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:29,103
Look, Dad, I'm really gonna be fine.

243
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,338
I went online, and Wallace University is

244
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,207
one of the safest campuses in the nation.

245
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:36,443
I... I know, okay? I'm... I'm... I'm
gonna ask you one more time.

246
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,445
- Dad...
- Please don't join a sorority.

247
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:40,281
- Dad, we already talked about this.
- Look, girls are vicious, okay?

248
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,116
And I know you think
sororities are some kind of,

249
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,284
like, magical sisterhood,

250
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,386
but it's actually Game of Thrones

251
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:46,921
once you pull back the veneer.

252
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,123
Dad, Mom died when I was
two years old, okay?

253
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,958
I don't have any of my own memories.

254
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:52,927
I've got the stories that you tell me

255
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,696
and a few old photographs
that survived the fire

256
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,331
and this.

257
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,303
You know, there's that one photo of her

258
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,039
in the sorority house,
and she's with her sisters,

259
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,974
and she just looks so happy.

260
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:10,144
Every time I've pictured her,
it's with this pin

261
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:14,081
on her formal dress and
a big smile on her face.

262
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,217
I just feel like

263
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,484
if I join Kappa,

264
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,753
it'll be like I'm following
in her footsteps.

265
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:22,156
And how many other chances am I gonna have

266
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:24,458
to feel close to her like that?

267
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,690
Okay, so, um...

268
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,259
You ready?

269
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:01,095
Just like we planned.

270
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,031
Three-second silent hug,
and then you leave.

271
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,033
And-and no eye contact.

272
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,234
- Right.
- Okay.

273
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,472
One.

274
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,540
Two.

275
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,211
Three.

276
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:36,797
Ooh, somebody call CSI,
because there was a murder scene

277
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:39,233
in that bathroom.

278
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,568
Hi. I'm Zayday. I'm your roommate.

279
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:43,570
Uh, hi. I'm-I'm Grace.

280
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,673
And what-what's wrong with the bathroom?

281
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,074
Someone puked in the sink,

282
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,176
and I'm pretty sure
I saw an actual ringworm

283
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,411
climbing up the wall.

284
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:51,912
I'm not afraid of anything,

285
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,314
but that bathroom
scared the crap out of me.

286
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,583
I've got to get out of this dorm room.

287
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,185
Was that your dad
who ran out crying before?

288
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,255
Yeah. I know, it's, like, super dorky,

289
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,823
but we're really close.

290
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:04,124
Oh. Where's your mom?

291
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,561
She died when I was really little,

292
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,730
so I don't really remember her.

293
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,598
My mom was mostly out the picture, too.

294
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:14,001
I was raised by my grandma,
who told me every day,

295
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,436
if I really, really applied myself,

296
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:16,904
I could get out of Oakland

297
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,706
and grow up to be the first
black woman president.

298
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,074
And here you are. That's amazing.

299
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,109
Yeah, except she was serious.

300
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:24,178
My grandma ain't no joke.
She like Tiger Woods' daddy.

301
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:26,714
Trying to make me golf and everything.

302
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:29,383
Girl, I was terrified I was
gonna get some religious freak

303
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,285
or a cutter for a roommate,
but you're dope.

304
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,854
Well, I don't think I'm gonna
be in the room for very long.

305
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,255
I'm rushing Kappa Kappa Tau.

306
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,890
Hey, why don't you join with me?

307
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,759
- Girl, I'd rather die.
- Ooh, come on.

308
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,028
This is gonna be a year
of infinite possibilities.

309
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,529
I can feel it.

310
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:45,132
And if you are serious about
becoming president someday,

311
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,635
becoming president of Kappa
is not a bad place to start.

312
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,404
Actually, you make a good point.

313
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,637
Don't look so excited. It's not diet.

314
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,972
Cindy McCain is pretty much

315
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,907
- who I want to be when I grow up.
- Me, too.

316
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,076
Or Megyn Kelly.

317
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,412
Hold this. It's too heavy.

318
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,414
Your role models are awesome,
and you're legacies,

319
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,317
so you're a total lock to get in.

320
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,587
Sisters, potential pledges,

321
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,256
I have an important announcement to make.

322
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,592
I am bursting like a piece of Freshen-Up.

323
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,761
Anyway,

324
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,763
Dean Munsch and I were talking about

325
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,699
how to bring Kappa Kappa Tau

326
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,167
into the 21st century.

327
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,568
Now,

328
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,503
what's cool these days is

329
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,372
a global community free of cliques...

330
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,707
Let's cut to the chase.

331
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,942
This year, Kappa will be required

332
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,944
to accept anyone

333
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,112
who wishes to become a pledge.

334
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,615
Things just got interesting.

335
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,084
I'm in? I'm in?

336
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,518
Yeah, you in, girl. You in.

337
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,619
If you're enrolled

338
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,955
at this university, you are free

339
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,324
to become a pledge at Kappa Kappa Tau.

340
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,127
The doors are open

341
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,297
to the public.

342
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,400
Don't!

343
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,806
You can't do this!

344
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,486
You didn't knock!

345
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,754
You know what that means.

346
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,088
Rules are rules.

347
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,660
Thank you. Now, what is it?

348
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,662
You have to come downstairs.

349
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,664
Now.

350
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,666
This is a total nightmare.

351
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,603
If this is our pledge
class, I'm killing myself.

352
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,405
And then Munsch.

353
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,273
Look at them. They're the dregs of society.

354
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,608
I can't believe this.

355
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,910
Each one of these gashes
is worse than the next.

356
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,278
I spent the last two weeks

357
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,113
learning the whole history
of Kappa Kappa Tau.

358
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,683
It was founded in 1837 at Miami
University in Oxford, Ohio.

359
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,786
Neckbrace.

360
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,188
Hester Ulrich, history major.

361
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,657
She smells like hot dog water,
and probably sprained her neck

362
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,759
giving blumpkins down at
the local bowling alley.

363
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,162
I love Taylor Swift.

364
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,531
I know the lyrics to
every one of her songs,

365
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,167
and I don't let the fact
that I'm deaf stop me

366
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,135
from singing them at the top of my lungs

367
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,370
whenever I get the chance.

368
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,038
Deaf Taylor Swift.

369
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,673
Tiffany something.

370
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,209
And like all deaf people,
she has horrible halitosis.

371
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,978
Look, I'm not saying that
all heterosexual sex is rape.

372
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,448
I'm saying all heterosexual sex is gross,

373
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,216
and that deep down, every woman knows this.

374
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,151
Predatory Lez.

375
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,153
Mac or Butch or something.

376
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,656
Two days ago, I caught her
staring at my ass on the quad.

377
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,058
All that girl's after is
a whole lot of bikini burger.

378
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,560
I feel you.

379
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:22,232
Hey, girl, can I just ask you,
what's up with your outfit?

380
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,735
My therapist says I had a
traumatic experience

381
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,239
that kept part of my psyche
forever trapped in the '90s.

382
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,308
But I'm, like, uh, I'll take it.

383
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,910
And then there's those two.

384
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,813
God knows what they're
talking about, basic bitches.

385
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,115
What fresh hell is this?

386
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,192
Chanel, I'd like to
introduce you to Jennifer.

387
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,594
I'm sorry, Kappa doesn't participate

388
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,095
in the Make-a-Wish Foundation.

389
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,129
Oh, but you do now.

390
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,499
Jennifer here is a sophomore.

391
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,200
I found her sitting alone in the library

392
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,268
without a friend in the world,

393
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,036
which leads me to you, Chanel.

394
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,105
Jennifer here is your new pledge.

395
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,107
Jennifer, why don't you tell Chanel

396
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:06,009
a little bit about your interests?

397
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,444
I'm a candle vlogger.

398
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,446
What the hell is that?

399
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,082
You guys, I love this one.

400
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,918
I got it at Bath&Body Works, half off.

401
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,786
I call it the Nancy Meyers experience,

402
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,088
because when you burn it,

403
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,737
it smells like creamy couches
and menopause.

404
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,573
You know, like a Nancy Meyers movie.

405
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,408
Four stars.

406
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:34,084
Look, I don't know what to tell you, Chanel.

407
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,320
If Kappa's suddenly filled
with weirdos and fatties,

408
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:38,322
there is literally no way
you can be popular.

409
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:39,423
And I need you to stay popular,

410
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,191
'cause if you want to stay at the top

411
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,327
of the list of the pieces of ass
I'm getting, there's criteria.

412
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:44,928
And the criteria is you got to be popular.

413
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,563
But, Chad...

414
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,665
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there,

415
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,601
because I'm getting really pissed off.

416
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,769
Chad is an amazing person.

417
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:54,271
Chad Radwell is

418
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,772
the president of the
Dickie Dollar Scholars,

419
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:58,609
and he's super hot, and
he doesn't have time for this.

420
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:01,778
Are-are you fake crying?

421
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:02,913
Stop fake crying.

422
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,448
When you fake cry, you are so not hot. Ugh.

423
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:07,584
I just think you are amazing, Chad.

424
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,353
Anyone you dated would be popular.

425
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:10,854
I mean, they would be popular

426
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,289
because they're dating you.

427
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:14,291
Okay. Boone.

428
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,293
Thank you.

429
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,295
Look, Chanel, I'm a psychology major,

430
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,197
so I'm gonna break this down

431
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:21,498
into terms that you'll understand.

432
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,034
My ego... it's super strong.

433
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,369
Okay, but it's not strong enough

434
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:27,471
that I can just go around
dating garbage people.

435
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,206
Like, yes, I could find a random girl

436
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:30,607
who wasn't popular, and, yes,

437
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:33,143
if I started dating her,
she would then become popular.

438
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,747
Dude, that is great idea for a movie.

439
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,081
Somebody should make that movie.
I would see that movie.

440
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,318
Me, too. You know who
should direct that movie?

441
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:44,187
Michael Bay, the greatest
director of all time.

442
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,159
But I can't go date a girl

443
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:51,662
who was popular and then
she just stopped being popular.

444
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:53,497
Because that would be crazy.

445
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,500
It's crazy, and nobody's
gonna go see that movie.

446
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:58,268
Do you know why nobody's gonna
go see that movie?

447
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,337
I...

448
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,839
'Cause it never got made.

449
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,174
But you said you loved me.

450
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,509
I do sort of love you.

451
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:07,244
I just... I would love you a lot more

452
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,445
if other people loved you, too.

453
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:11,848
Listen,

454
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,685
I can't date a garbage person, Chanel.

455
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,020
I won't. I'm not gonna do that to myself.

456
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,589
Uh, I need you to leave.

457
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:20,424
Okay, I need you to leave
because you're bumming me out,

458
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:21,592
and you're bumming Boone out.

459
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,328
And we're just trying to have a nice day

460
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:26,229
hitting golf balls at hippies.

461
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,233
Cross swords, bro.

462
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:33,837
Good-bye.

463
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,209
You guys, support human rights.

464
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:40,510
Amnesty International.

465
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,548
Oh, hi, Ms. Bean. What are you doing?

466
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,717
Oh. Oh.

467
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:48,685
You told me to scrub all the floors

468
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,621
in the house with a Barbie toothbrush.

469
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:53,857
Ms. Bean, this sorority is
for pretty girls only.

470
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,626
Pretty girls, like you and me.

471
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,527
Now, I have a plan to keep it that way,

472
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:59,896
and you're a part of that plan.

473
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,565
If Dean Munsch gets her way,

474
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,567
Kappa's gonna be filled
with fatties and ethnics.

475
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,502
The fatties will bring
their big old appetites,

476
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,704
and you know what those
ethnics will bring with them?

477
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,473
Weird spices from their home countries.

478
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:11,742
That is a nuclear combination, Ms. Bean.

479
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,644
The weird ethnic spices
will send the fatties

480
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,545
racing to the bathroom to blow liquid fire

481
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:17,414
out of their huge, swollen bowels.

482
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:18,915
Think of the splash back.

483
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:20,751
Think of the undersides
of all of the toilets

484
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:22,586
that you're gonna have
to sanitize, Ms. Bean.

485
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:23,754
I don't want that.

486
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,656
I don't want that for you.

487
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:27,691
Here you go.

488
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,163
Uh, welcome to The Grind.
What can I get started for you?

489
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,098
You don't want anything, do you?

490
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,235
I'll have a Trenta, no-foam,
five-shot half-caf, no foam,

491
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,605
pumpkin spice latte with
no foam at 210 degrees.

492
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,708
First of all, that's really hot.

493
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:47,010
That's two degrees below boiling.

494
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:48,679
I'm sorry, did I enter a wormhole

495
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:50,447
to a universe where this coffeehouse

496
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:51,948
does not possess the technology to heat

497
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:54,051
my favorite autumnal
tradition to 210 degrees?

498
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:57,621
I like my pumpkin spice lattes extra hot,

499
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:59,389
so please comply with my request.

500
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,859
But extra hot is 170 degrees.

501
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:04,795
I'm sorry, does your job description

502
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,697
entail arguing with your customers, thereby

503
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,899
delaying the moment at which
they receive the irresistible,

504
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:11,601
nutmeggy sweetness of
the extra hot, no foam,

505
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,637
pumpkin spice latte they've been
thinking about all day?

506
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:14,638
I mean, God!

507
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,740
Ma'am, what would you like?

508
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,642
She doesn't want anything! She wants you

509
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,544
to start making my extra hot, no foam,

510
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,879
pumpkin spice latte!

511
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,548
So, anyway, since we can't

512
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,949
turn the castoff pledges away,

513
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:27,584
we're gonna have to scare them off.

514
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,153
That's why I'm gonna burn
your face off. What?

515
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:32,155
Not for real, silly, it'll be pretend.

516
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,990
So here's the skinny. We're gonna get

517
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,592
in a fight, and I'm gonna dunk your head

518
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:37,828
- in the deep fryer.
- What? No!

519
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:40,097
The oil won't be hot. We'll
turn off the machine, idiot.

520
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,165
Oh. You'll just pretend and
come up all screaming,

521
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,401
and I guarantee all those
newbies will run screaming

522
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,303
into the night and go pledge
some other sorority.

523
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,571
Sound like a plan?

524
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:50,607
Right, one 210-degree, Trenta, five-shot,

525
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,509
no foam, pumpkin spice,

526
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:56,079
half-caf, no foam latte for Chanel.

527
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,381
Thank you, coffee donkey.

528
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,019
Ugh! You burned the milk!

529
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,688
Learn to make a pumpkin spice latte,

530
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,356
you psychopath.

531
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:09,025
Next time, I get you fired, or worse.

532
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,496
Other barista!

533
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:18,034
Welcome to The Grind. How may I help you?

534
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,505
Pumpkin spice latte, please.
I want it freezing though.

535
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:24,808
Actually, I just want a regular coffee.

536
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:27,377
Those white girl
pumpkin spice lattes annoy me.

537
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:29,312
I'm in love.

538
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:30,547
Name?

539
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,249
Seסorita Awesome.

540
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,619
You got it,

541
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:37,287
Seסorita Awesome.

542
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:41,558
Look, uh, sorry about that girl
who went all latte-psycho on me.

543
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:44,127
Her name's Chanel; she's
president of the Kappa House.

544
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:46,997
And she thinks that means her
poop smells like ginger beer.

545
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:49,232
I know her.

546
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:52,135
I... I mean, I just met her.
I'm pledging Kappa.

547
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:53,970
You don't seem the type.

548
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:57,073
Well, clearly, you haven't
discovered the many layers

549
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,109
of Seסorita Awesome.

550
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,381
Seסorita Awesome, wait up.

551
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,483
Oh, it's Grace, actually.

552
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,084
Grace, Pete.

553
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,020
Look, you can't join Kappa House.

554
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,055
I don't just work as a barista,
I'm also the editor

555
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,256
of the school paper, The Sentinel.

556
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:14,991
I like to think of myself, uh,

557
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,493
as an investigative reporter.

558
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:19,162
Anyway, I think at their cores,
all these sororities are evil,

559
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:22,232
but that house is truly dangerous.

560
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,835
Excuse me, but I think you're
getting a little too close

561
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,171
to my new pledge,
Mr. Convicted Sex Offender.

562
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,840
Ms. Bean,

563
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,007
go organize the trash.

564
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:32,442
I'm sorry, wh-what is she talking about?

565
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,244
Gay Jimmy Olsen over here got a little

566
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,213
obsessed with me last year.

567
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:38,215
I still have the 15,000
text messages he sent me.

568
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,850
I had to get a restraining order.

569
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:41,885
I was a freshman and I had a crush, okay?

570
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,054
I tend to get a bit
passionate about things.

571
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,389
Look, you intentionally led me on.

572
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:48,358
You kept acting like
you liked me just so you could

573
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,026
- humiliate me.
- What was I supposed to do?

574
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:51,862
True Tori was over, I was bored.

575
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:54,497
Ms. Bean, let's hit it!

576
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,805
Ms. Bean, I said let's hit it!

577
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,074
Grace, please don't do this.

578
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,576
I'll be fine.

579
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,813
It was nice to meet you, Pete.

580
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,096
Let's do this.

581
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,441
Enter, ye who dare.

582
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:40,944
We have some bad news.

583
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,312
We found something.

584
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:43,813
Number Two came up to ask Ms. Bean

585
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,248
if she had a bigger punch bowl,

586
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:46,549
and she noticed her bedroom door was open.

587
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:57,560
I love a creepy collage.

588
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,344
Okay, so you all want to be
Kappas, is that right?

589
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:17,447
Well, you're about to learn
what being a Kappa is all about.

590
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:19,449
It's about kicking
the living crap out of someone

591
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,484
when they disrespect you. Follow me!

592
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,197
Hey, White Mammy,

593
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:36,900
you're about to get your ass handed to you.

594
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,668
I was just in your room,
where I noticed you have

595
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:41,237
a sizeable shrine with
evil burning candles,

596
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:43,306
photos of me with my face scratched out

597
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:44,641
and pairs of my stolen panties.

598
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:46,309
Care to explain, chubby old Nazi?

599
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,979
Chanel, I don't know
what you're talking about.

600
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,314
Now I know why all your
food tastes like it's got

601
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,515
a little bit of pee in it.

602
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:53,817
You know, ladies, Ms. Bean and I

603
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:55,318
had arranged a little prank

604
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,087
where I was gonna dip her fat face

605
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:59,656
in some cold fry oil
to scare all you bitches.

606
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,858
Well, I propose a change of plans.

607
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:03,526
What do you think, Ms. Bean?

608
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,428
How about I just drown you in it?

609
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,139
Oh, my God, who turned the fryer on?!

610
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,735
She's dead.

611
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:48,738
Well, of course she's dead!
You just burned her face off!

612
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:51,374
Shut up. You don't die from
getting your face burned off.

613
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,542
Yes, you do!

614
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:54,377
She probably had a heart attack.

615
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:55,278
Oh, my God.

616
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:02,719
Where are you going?

617
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:03,920
To get the campus police.

618
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:05,488
There's a dead woman in your kitchen.

619
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,057
Oh! Ms. Bean was a servant;

620
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:08,992
She knew the risks.

621
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,827
I'm going to the authorities.

622
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,128
Fine, go.

623
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:13,663
I'll be sure to tell the police all about

624
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,065
how you shoved Ms. Bean in that fryolator.

625
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,000
What? You did that.

626
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,335
That's not how I saw it.
And my witnesses agree.

627
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:21,104
Pledges, show of hands.

628
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:22,739
Who will back up my story if I promise

629
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:25,108
that by the end of the year,
I'll get you all boyfriends...

630
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:26,543
cool boyfriends?

631
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,779
And I'll take you all on my dad's jet

632
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:30,947
to Cancun for spring break.

633
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:33,983
All of y'all ratchet.

634
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,320
You're an awful person.

635
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,522
Maybe. But I'm rich and I'm pretty,

636
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,558
so it doesn't really matter.

637
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:05,815
Sisters and pledges of Kappa Kappa Tau,

638
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:09,018
you now all share something
so very precious to me.

639
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:10,120
A felony?

640
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:11,688
A secret.

641
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,156
And secrets are the glue

642
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,325
that binds sorority sisters together.

643
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,461
We will remember this night
for the rest of our lives.

644
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:20,029
And until the day we die,

645
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:21,831
we will know that we few
are the only people

646
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,333
who know what happened in that kitchen.

647
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:26,236
Because if any of you ever tell,

648
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:29,172
I will make sure you end up
laying right next to Ms. Bean

649
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,608
in this freezer.

650
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:33,643
Who wants cocktails?

651
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:35,111
Yay!

652
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:56,001
How did my life turn into this?

653
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:01,040
I marched for the Equal Rights Amendment,

654
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:04,810
I burned my bra
in the middle of this campus,

655
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:07,813
and then left school
to intern for Gloria Steinem

656
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:10,015
at Ms. Magazine.

657
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:11,784
This generation...

658
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:14,119
it couldn't give a rat's
ass about any of it.

659
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:16,522
Nothing's changed.

660
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:19,466
Have you seen the way girls
dress on this campus?

661
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,802
These sorority bitches

662
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:24,538
strutting around in basically
just their underwear,

663
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:28,475
screaming bloody murder
about being objectified,

664
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,179
as if they haven't objectified
themselves already.

665
00:31:32,214 --> 00:31:34,481
And all that marching.

666
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,517
All the protests.

667
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:38,519
What did I get out of it?

668
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:45,851
I'm sitting in the same office
I used to throw bricks into.

669
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:48,320
I'm making less than the 26-year-old

670
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:51,665
assistant football coach
who bangs the same brand

671
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,394
of perky 19-year-olds my husband
left me for two years ago.

672
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:00,899
You're awful in bed. Are you aware?

673
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:03,043
I mean, just... the worst.

674
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,746
What? What... Did I not take you there?

675
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:08,115
Look what I've stooped to.

676
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,518
Getting sex by blackmailing
students on academic probation.

677
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,922
Look, I need to say something.

678
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:16,790
I'm in love with you.

679
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,292
Of course you are.

680
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,960
Because that's the only way this situation

681
00:32:19,995 --> 00:32:22,129
could get more depressing. Please leave.

682
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:24,865
I will, but I'm gonna
take a pair of your panties.

683
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,867
I'm gonna barf on your face
unless you get out of here.

684
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:29,636
And-and go take a psychology course.

685
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:32,873
Try to figure out who gave you
such disgusting mommy issues.

686
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:35,676
It was, you know, probably my mom.

687
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:39,480
Okay. Um, I'm gonna call you.

688
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:43,550
As I can't destroy every phone on Earth,

689
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,586
that'll remain a possibility.

690
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:53,694
What?

691
00:32:54,697 --> 00:32:56,697
Done worse.

692
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:02,135
I have to tell you something.

693
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,804
You loaded a dead body into a freezer.

694
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,273
Based on the strain on your
faces as you carried her out,

695
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:08,442
- my money's on Ms. Bean.
- Um, wh-what?

696
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:09,877
- You loaded a dead body...
- Shh!

697
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,383
Um...

698
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,853
You-you were spying on us?

699
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:21,021
I'm an investigative reporter.

700
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:22,856
And that house is the story of a lifetime.

701
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:24,491
I agree. That's why I asked to meet you.

702
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:26,426
What are you proposing?

703
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,828
I want to help you with your exposי,

704
00:33:27,863 --> 00:33:29,263
secretly feed you info.

705
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,664
You need eyes on the inside.

706
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:32,199
You do have really pretty eyes.

707
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:34,835
Focus on the case. Look, I think Chanel

708
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,803
accidentally killed her,
but now I'm not so sure.

709
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,839
Wait, so when you thought she murdered her,

710
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:41,475
- you helped her hide the body?
- Look, it's more complicated than that.

711
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,277
I joined that sorority
to feel close to my mom.

712
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,712
You know? I've heard the way
my dad talks about her...

713
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:47,681
kind, a fighter, big heart.

714
00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:50,384
No way she belonged to Kappa
the way it is now.

715
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,286
Chanel and her type have destroyed it,

716
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,454
mutated it into the monster it is today.

717
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,723
But it can be the way it was.

718
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,692
I can change it back,
but I need to get Chanel

719
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:01,028
and her minions out of there to do it.

720
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:03,363
I need to expose Chanel
for who she really is.

721
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,065
And I want to use your story as

722
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,267
my weapon of reputation destruction.

723
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,004
I just want to honor my mom.

724
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,506
Deal.

725
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,508
Mm. One last thing.

726
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:17,544
What do we do now?

727
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,613
Examine the body.

728
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:55,115
We hid her in there.

729
00:34:57,987 --> 00:34:59,453
You shoved Ms. Bean's face

730
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:01,355
- in a vat of hot oil?
- Yes.

731
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,889
The fryer wasn't supposed to be on.

732
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:05,692
I don't know what to do with the body.

733
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,128
Oh, Chanel. That is so hot!

734
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:09,396
What?

735
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:11,198
Hold up.

736
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,899
Are you saying dead bodies
don't turn you on?

737
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:14,468
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

738
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,269
You are so lame, you know that?

739
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:18,071
God, I love all that death stuff.

740
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:21,408
I got my first boner watching
Faces of Death.

741
00:35:21,443 --> 00:35:22,909
Show me the body.

742
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:24,878
- Seriously?
- Why did you bring me here, Chanel?

743
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:26,146
Show me the dead body.

744
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:27,347
Hmm.

745
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:34,855
What the hell? Is this some kind of joke?

746
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,423
Oh, my God, she's alive.

747
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,424
Ms. Bean's alive.

748
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:38,959
Yeah, or somebody stole the body.

749
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:42,195
Now I'm cold, I got blue balls.

750
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:44,231
The worst date ever.

751
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,208
Kappa sisters, someone is screwing with us.

752
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:57,811
This blood oath will ensure
solidarity among us.

753
00:35:57,846 --> 00:35:59,880
We are all related now.

754
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:03,550
Let's all touch bloody
fingers as I read this oath.

755
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:07,054
"Hail, Odin, wise warrior,
one-eyed wanderer,

756
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:08,488
tell the scenes your missing eyes see."

757
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:09,489
Wait, Odin who?

758
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:10,724
Where did you find that?

759
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,125
I don't know, the Internet.

760
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:14,327
I just Googled "blood oath"
and this is what came up.

761
00:36:15,597 --> 00:36:17,564
"Norse father,

762
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,667
you who chooses the slain
on this winter solstice..."

763
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,135
What? "Solstice"? Is that Wiccan?

764
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:23,136
What does this oath even mean?

765
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:24,371
I don't know, Number Three.

766
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:25,472
I didn't spend a lot of time on the Internet

767
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:26,840
looking through different blood oaths.

768
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,308
I just need you all to not say anything

769
00:36:28,343 --> 00:36:29,743
about what happened,
and I figured a blood oath

770
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:31,078
was cheaper than buying you all presents.

771
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:32,579
Look, we're all just freaking out, okay?

772
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:33,847
Let's just rub our fingers together

773
00:36:33,882 --> 00:36:34,981
and promise to keep quiet.

774
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:36,583
Fine.

775
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:37,751
Wait, what about STDs?

776
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:39,820
What if one of us has, like,

777
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:42,522
genital warts or... chlamydia or something?

778
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:44,324
Idiot, you don't get STDs from blood oaths.

779
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,992
You get STDs from dirty toilet seats

780
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:47,994
and drinking the water in Mexico.

781
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,098
Um, "STD" stands for
"sexually transmitted disease,"

782
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:53,600
which means that it's transmitted sexually.

783
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:56,703
Does it look like the four of us
are about to have sex

784
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:58,271
right now, Number Five, huh?!

785
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,239
I have HPV.

786
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,407
What?

787
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:03,043
Yeah. I got it last summer.

788
00:37:03,078 --> 00:37:04,377
It's not a big deal.

789
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:05,512
A lot of girls have it. I just think

790
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:06,613
I should sit out the
whole blood oath thing.

791
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:08,682
How did you get HPV?

792
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:09,783
When were you in Mexico?

793
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:11,485
I can't do this.

794
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:15,288
Oh, God, fine. You know what,
forget the blood oath.

795
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:16,456
Every time I try to plan something,

796
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:17,457
you dumb bitches ruin it.

797
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,092
I can't stay silent!

798
00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:21,128
Somebody murdered Ms. Bean,
and someone's gonna find out,

799
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,463
and I want to be a network newscaster.

800
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:25,565
I'm calling my mom, and I'm going home.

801
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,011
Okay, okay, let's just all calm down.

802
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:24,174
Clearly Ms. Bean did this.

803
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,343
That seems like an insane conclusion

804
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:28,345
- to just jump to.
- She's back from the dead,

805
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,313
and she's getting revenge
by killing us one at a time.

806
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:33,850
Wait a minute.

807
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:36,086
This is great. This is amazing.

808
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:37,154
How is this amazing?

809
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:39,544
If Ms. Bean is still alive,
that proves I didn't kill her.

810
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:41,412
Now I won't be prosecuted for murder

811
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:43,648
and I can stay popular
and on my proper career track,

812
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:46,050
and Chad Radwell won't break up with me.

813
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:47,218
Okay, well, then there's no reason

814
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:49,220
we shouldn't call the police.

815
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:51,422
Are you kidding me, Number Three?

816
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,624
What are we gonna tell them,

817
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,092
that we burned Ms. Bean's face off,

818
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:55,326
thought she was dead,

819
00:40:55,362 --> 00:40:57,228
hid the body, then it came back
to life and stabbed

820
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:58,997
Chanel #2 while we were all in the house?

821
00:40:59,032 --> 00:40:59,998
They're never gonna believe that.

822
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,666
That's an insane story.

823
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:02,967
That is insane.

824
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,335
Until we can prove what happened,

825
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:05,737
we need to keep the body here.

826
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:07,171
We can't just leave her
here; she was our friend.

827
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:09,073
Meh.

828
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:13,945
Ladies, that's the door.

829
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,947
Hell Week begins now.

830
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:17,749
Good evening, idiot hookers.

831
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:22,387
I'm very happy to welcome you to
Hell Week here at Kappa House.

832
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,089
Could you speak up, please?

833
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,190
I'm having trouble

834
00:41:26,226 --> 00:41:27,025
hearing you.

835
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,393
I said, "Welcome to Hell Week!"

836
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:30,862
When you stupid dugongs

837
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:32,096
first waltzed through that door,

838
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:33,831
I could tell you thought
you were gonna have it easy.

839
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,367
Well, let me relieve you
of that misconception,

840
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:37,835
because you're about to get hazed

841
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,671
harder than a suburban banquet hall

842
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,673
during bat mitzvah season.

843
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,676
I am not gonna let you
haze any of these girls.

844
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,177
And I will litigate.

845
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,346
There's going to be a new Kappa House

846
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,715
- on this campus, and it starts with us.
- Hmm.

847
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,317
It's going to be a sorority
about empowerment,

848
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:54,619
sisterhood and respect.

849
00:41:54,654 --> 00:41:56,054
That sounds terrible.

850
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:57,388
Okay, Pissy Spacek,

851
00:41:57,424 --> 00:41:59,957
you and I have a few
differences we need to iron out.

852
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:01,893
What do you say to a little coffee klatch?

853
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:02,994
We can talk it over.

854
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:04,595
Number Five, you're in charge.

855
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,965
You got it, girl.

856
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,233
Thank you.

857
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:14,639
I got you a pumpkin spice latte.

858
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:17,208
They're so my jam, even
though they make me obese.

859
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,910
We're not here to make nice.

860
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:21,512
You want to talk, let's talk.

861
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:23,915
Fine. I can't stand you.

862
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,516
But you also remind me of a young me.

863
00:42:25,552 --> 00:42:26,751
So here's my compromise.

864
00:42:26,786 --> 00:42:28,786
I want you to be one of my minions.

865
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:32,757
Grace, I want you to be Chanel #6.

866
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:35,593
Wow. Uh, quite an honor.

867
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:36,694
It is.

868
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,096
It's the gateway to the top of the heap.

869
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:40,231
No.

870
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,768
Look at where being Kappa
Queen has gotten you.

871
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:46,404
You put on a good front,
but you're miserable.

872
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,373
Don't you think any of that has
anything to do with the fact

873
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:51,409
that you've created an
atmosphere based solely

874
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,111
on negativity and raw ambition?

875
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:54,512
You say that like those are bad things.

876
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:57,148
Uh, wait.

877
00:42:59,152 --> 00:43:00,852
Okay, you're the only person at this school

878
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:02,553
who is almost as smart as me.

879
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:04,789
Can we talk for real for a second, please?

880
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:06,190
I mean, you're so confident

881
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:07,291
without being mean.

882
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:08,626
What antidepressants are you on?

883
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,297
Chanel,

884
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,768
why are you so awful to everyone?

885
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,237
My boyfriend compulsively cheats on me.

886
00:43:19,272 --> 00:43:20,638
All of my friends work for me.

887
00:43:20,673 --> 00:43:22,440
My parents didn't even
call me on my birthday

888
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,441
because they were too busy

889
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,778
hosting a fundraiser for Jeb Bush.

890
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:30,481
Don't you see that all
that's happened isn't a crisis?

891
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:32,750
It's an opportunity,

892
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:35,987
for you and for Kappa to really change.

893
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:38,322
Think about how great it would be

894
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:40,758
to have a real sisterhood,

895
00:43:40,794 --> 00:43:44,028
one that will always
remember your birthday.

896
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:50,268
Yeah, no, I tried. See, I really tried.

897
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:52,336
But all of this flowery,
peace-on-Earth crap,

898
00:43:52,372 --> 00:43:53,838
it makes me want to puke.

899
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:56,007
You're pathetic.

900
00:43:58,311 --> 00:43:59,911
Yeah, walk away now!

901
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:02,246
You haven't even seen
half of what I'm capable of!

902
00:44:02,282 --> 00:44:04,782
Once you're on my fatwa list,
I show no mercy!

903
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:08,619
Totally spit in your coffee, bitch.

904
00:44:11,724 --> 00:44:13,691
The Sexy Gopher Whore Head Challenge

905
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:16,160
is one of Kappa House's
oldest hazing traditions.

906
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:17,528
You gals are gonna stay here overnight,

907
00:44:17,564 --> 00:44:18,930
getting to know each other

908
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:21,299
and trying to keep the ants
from crawling up your noses,

909
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:22,533
while the Chanels and I

910
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:24,468
go get banana daiquiris
at the White Stallion.

911
00:44:24,504 --> 00:44:26,137
Good night, ladies.

912
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:39,984
Guys, I can't move at all.

913
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,052
I think that's the point!

914
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,320
I don't mean to be a contrarian,

915
00:44:42,355 --> 00:44:44,956
- but I'm enjoying this.
- You guys,

916
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:47,658
what do you think Taylor Swift
is doing right now?

917
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,340
What time is it? It's got to be,
like, 4:00 in the morning.

918
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,408
Did y'all hear that?

919
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,846
Did y'all hear that?!

920
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,648
What are you guys talking about?

921
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,854
Is that killer noises
or am I hallucinating?

922
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,889
Chanel, is that you?

923
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,757
I'm gonna ask one more time,

924
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,192
will you speak up?

925
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,229
Is that a lawnmower?

926
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:26,664
What's happening?!

927
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,165
Help me!

928
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:29,333
Help me! Help me!

929
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:30,334
Help me!

930
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,203
- Are you screaming?
- Help me!

931
00:45:32,238 --> 00:45:33,671
- Or are you singing?
- Help me!

932
00:45:33,706 --> 00:45:35,940
Help! This a nice neighborhood!

933
00:45:39,145 --> 00:45:40,311
Are you singing Taylor Swift?

934
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:56,928
Holy crap!

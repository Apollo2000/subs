1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:05,044
I always feel bad for the
silver-medal winner in the Olympics.

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:07,554
I mean, how do you live with
that for the rest fo your life?

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,624
People keep asking you:
"How much did you lose by?"

4
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,873
I don't even know.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,396
It was like from now to now.
Now to now. Now, now, now."

6
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:19,230
It was... and that was it, I lost.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,392
I trained, I worked out, I exercised.

8
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,944
I was doing pushups, sit-ups.

9
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,187
I never did anything but exercise
for 20 years.

10
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:27,355
I flew halfway around the world....

11
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:33,609
And that was that.
It was a photo finish.

12
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:35,951
Silver, gold.

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,664
"lf I had a pimple, I would have won."

14
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,452
Can't believe you write
for the J. Peterman catalogue.

15
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:50,377
Get this one,
"l packed my rod and reel.

16
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,086
Thirty hours later, lost in the fjord...

17
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,801
a welcoming smile.

18
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,464
Thank God she spotted the epaulets
on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest."

19
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:03,141
This catalogue is all about
how to score in a foreign country.

20
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,633
- Yeah, what do you do all day?
- Not that much.

21
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:08,639
I thought that new promotion
was supposed to be more work?

22
00:01:08,712 --> 00:01:10,010
When the season starts.

23
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,145
Right now, I sit around
pretending I'm busy.

24
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:15,683
- How do you pull that off?
- I always look annoyed.

25
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:20,773
When you look annoyed all the time,
people think that you're busy.

26
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:22,981
Think about it.

27
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:28,149
Yeah, you do.

28
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:29,821
- He looks busy.
- He looks very busy.

29
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:31,405
I know what I'm doing.

30
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,414
In fact, Mr. Wilhelm gave me
one of those little stress dolls.

31
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:37,831
All right. Back to work.

32
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:43,080
So did you come up
with a stupid story...

33
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:45,081
for the Himalayan
walking shoe yet?

34
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,497
No, I'm completely blocked.

35
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,295
In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight.

36
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:52,010
Oh, no.

37
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,341
I can't. I got that marathon runner
coming in tonight.

38
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:57,795
What marathon runner?

39
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:59,847
You know, this guy, Jean-Paul...?

40
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,974
I met him when I was
working at Pendant...

41
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:03,519
editing a book on running.

42
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:06,522
- Oh, wait Jean-Paul Jean-Paul.
- Yes.

43
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:08,847
He overslept at the Olympics
four years ago...

44
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:11,312
missed the marathon.

45
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:13,313
Yeah, that's him.

46
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:15,525
He's from Trinidad and Tobago,
right?

47
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:18,945
Yeah, he's
Trinidadian and Tobagan.

48
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,983
How do you oversleep
at the Olympics?

49
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,861
I know. I know.

50
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,862
It's like the biggest event
of your life.

51
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,911
You'd think you'd have
six alarm clocks...

52
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,653
paying off little kids
to come banging on your door.

53
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,374
Well, he was pretty devastated.

54
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:35,867
This is his first race in three years.

55
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:38,370
That's a big responsibility
on your hands.

56
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:41,037
What responsibility?
I don't have any responsibility.

57
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:43,670
Well, you gotta wake him up.

58
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,794
He'll get up.

59
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,879
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Elaine, how are you?

60
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,382
Fine.

61
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:52,215
- I've seen her in your building.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,631
- I didn't know she was married.
- She's not.

63
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,177
And the guy just took off.

64
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:02,976
- Don't say anything.
- Who am I gonna tell?

65
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:05,685
I know, it's just something
you have to say.

67
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:19,066
George, we just got
the final budget numbers.

68
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,070
We went over budget
on some of the items...

69
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:23,865
but I don't think
there's gonna be a problem.

70
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,698
I'll let you get back to work,
George.

71
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:37,922
He overslept
and missed the whole race.

72
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,296
- Isn't that amazing?
- I'll tell you what happened.

73
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:43,088
I bet he got
the AM-PM mixed up.

74
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,256
My money's on the snooze.

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,715
I bet he hit the snooze for an extra five,
and it never came back on.

76
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,807
Imagine, your whole life riding
on an alarm clock.

77
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:57,061
Alarm clocks? No, I never use them.
Don't trust them.

78
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,981
- What do you do?
- I have a mental alarm.

79
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,639
I set my head
for quarter to 7...

80
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:05,308
and... I get up.

81
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,312
- It always works?
- It never fails.

82
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:09,147
See, it's based on your body clock.

83
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:12,821
Your body has an internal mechanism.
It knows what time it is.

84
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,946
- What's with the bucket?
- Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.

85
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,947
- Hot tub?
- Yeah, it's in my living room.

86
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:21,153
I just gotta fill it.

87
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:24,416
You put a hot tub
in your living room?

88
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:27,500
It's a beauty. It's got these
high-volume accusage jets...

89
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:32,414
oscillating and pulsating,
soothing your every aching muscle.

90
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,922
That water's gonna get
over 120 degrees.

91
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:40,335
- Is that tolerable?
- Oh, it's tolerable.

92
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:44,714
Isn't that the same temperature
of the coffee that scalded you?

93
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,802
I think it's a little cooler than that.

94
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,179
He doesn't have any running water?

95
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:54,347
I don't ask those kind
of questions anymore.

96
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:57,972
Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.

97
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,605
- Hi, Jean-Paul, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:04,359
- Sorry about the Olympics.
- Me too.

99
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:08,363
Listen, I'm gonna go call work,
see if I can get my deadline extended.

100
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,858
I can't come up
with anything for this thing.

101
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,446
Catalogue-writer's block?

102
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,201
Yeah, that's funny.

103
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:23,077
So, what happened?

104
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:26,210
The snooze alarm, wasn't it?

105
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,040
No, man, it wasn't the snooze.

106
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:31,713
Most people think it was the snooze,
but no, no snooze.

107
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:36,047
- AM-PM?
- Man, it wasn't the AM-PM.

108
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:37,631
It was the volume.

109
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:41,215
- Oh, the volume.
- Yes, the volume.

110
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,012
There was a separate knob
for the radio alarm.

111
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:48,728
- Oh, separate knob.
- Yeah, separate knob.

112
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:52,894
Why separate knob!
Why separate knob!

113
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:56,399
Some people like to have the alarm
a little louder than the radio.

114
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,486
Oh, please, man, please!

115
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:03,438
It's not gonna happen again.
Not if I have anything to say about it.

116
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:06,320
Elaine, what's the alarm clock
situation at your house?

117
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:08,532
- Jerry....
- It's a simple question.

118
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,573
I've got an alarm, okay?

119
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:15,080
That old one? Didn't I miss a flight
to Cleveland because of that clock?

120
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,076
- Flight to Cleveland?
- It works.

121
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:20,454
- Elaine.
- It works.

122
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:27,419
"Singing duo, Captain and...."?

123
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,879
Tennille!

124
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,383
Come on.

125
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,770
George...

126
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,263
I think you may be
taking work too seriously.

127
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,895
Well, I've got a lot to do.

128
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:51,106
George, I'll tell you
what I'd like you to do.

129
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,941
I'd like you to drop everything.
I have this fun little assignment.

130
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,271
There are some reps in
from the Houston Astros...

131
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:59,191
for talks on
that lnterleague Play...

132
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,607
and I want you
to show them a good time.

133
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:08,694
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

134
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,450
You're 40 minutes late.

135
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:13,459
- What happened?
- I got held up.

136
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:16,461
- Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
- No.

137
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,954
What? What is the problem?

138
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:21,253
You said you were gonna be here
a certain time...

139
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,251
and you weren't.

140
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:26,295
And this all means what?

141
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,628
It means that a man
has come from very far away...

142
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:30,631
to compete in
a very difficult race...

143
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:33,213
put his faith in you,
and I'm a little concerned.

144
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:35,265
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am.

145
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,221
Hey, I'm not running
in the marathon, he is.

146
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:39,510
- Yeah, I know that.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,309
I've got enough to think about
trying to come up with...

148
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:44,474
some crap for that
Himalayan walking shoe.

149
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,975
I've given him a place to stay,
I'll set an alarm...

150
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:49,725
but I'm not gonna turn my life
completely upside down.

151
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:53,983
I'm not talking about upside down,
I'm talking about waking him up.

152
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,192
Hey, Jean-Paul.

153
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,986
Jean-Paul, how was your soak?
A good soak?

154
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:03,158
Oh, man, very good soak.
The soak of the year.

155
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:05,829
What's burning?

156
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,660
My muffin.

157
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:10,997
Shoot.

158
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,794
- What happened?
- I don't know.

159
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,505
I set this thing for 20 seconds.

160
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:17,507
This was for two minutes, see?

161
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,003
Don't say anything.

162
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:21,168
Don't say anything.

163
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:23,502
You mis-set the timer?

164
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,674
Jean-Paul, it's not
my microwave, okay? Okay?

165
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,174
All right, listen, let's just go.
Come on, Jean-Paul.

166
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:32,224
- Let's go.
- Okay.

167
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,594
- We'll see you at the race, okay?
- Yeah, I hope so.

168
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:37,396
Oh, that's cute.

169
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,441
Kramer, I'm telling you,
Elaine doesn't know what she's doing.

170
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,230
I gotta take over
this whole operation.

171
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,569
Jerry, look how tense you are.

172
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,897
You need to take a soak.

173
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:51,522
I'm not taking a soak...

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,985
in that human bacteria frappe
you got going there.

175
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:58,114
I'm telling you, it's great.
I opened up all the windows.

176
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:01,324
The air is cold,
the tub is boiling hot.

177
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,290
It's like Sweden, man.

178
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,080
Sweden.

179
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:22,046
Oh, yeah.

180
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:30,347
Till this bastard over here says;

181
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,225
"Let's call the sons of bitches,
go visit them in New York."

182
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,355
Well, we're certainly glad
that you could make it.

183
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,565
I like your organization, George.

184
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:43,318
We've been talking to a friendly
son of bitch in the front office.

185
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,987
- Wilhelm, I think his name is.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, Mr. Wilhelm.

186
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:51,736
He told us George Costanza's gonna
be taking us bastards out on the town.

187
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:55,991
We said, "That son of a bitch doesn't
know what he's got in store for him."

188
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,406
- Finish your drink?
- Oh, yeah, almost. Almost.

189
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:01,749
Let's get that bastard
to bring us another round, huh?

190
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,331
You a big drinker, George?

191
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:07,210
Well, maybe not
as much as this bastard.

192
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,008
I can hold my own.

193
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,569
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here
because I am concerned.

194
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,951
Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps
the biggest race of your entire career...

195
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:49,115
and the person with whom
you have chosen to stay is....

196
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:53,237
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, get the hell out of there!

197
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:55,865
Let me put you in a hotel.
You'll be comfortable.

198
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:59,411
You'll be near the starting line,
and most importantly...

199
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:02,125
you'll have a wake-up call,
Jean-Paul.

200
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:05,132
- A wake-up call.
- Wake-up call?

201
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,415
These people never fail.

202
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:09,676
They sit in a room
with a big clock all night long...

203
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:12,133
just waiting to make that call.

204
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:15,801
No, I will stay with Elaine,
it would be rude.

205
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,967
Hey, you bastards.

206
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:21,509
Hey, so how was the meeting?

207
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:24,012
I really like those sons of bitches.

208
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:26,181
- Sons of bitches?
- Yeah. That's how they talk.

209
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:28,729
You know, everyone's a bastard
or a son of a bitch.

210
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:32,150
Yeah, it's like, "Boy, that son of a bitch
Boggs can really hit."

211
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,483
- Really?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:36,026
That's how they talk
in the major league.

213
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,698
Oh, boy.

214
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:39,981
Hey.

215
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,406
- How many sweaters you got on?
- Four.

216
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,746
Could I have a cup of tea,
boiling hot?

217
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,784
What's going on?

218
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:54,244
I fell asleep in the hot tub,
and the heat pump broke.

219
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,171
Water went down to 58 degrees.

220
00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:00,256
I can't get
my core temperature back up.

221
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:01,921
Your core temperature?

222
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,970
Here, feel my hand. Yeah, feel.

223
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:08,006
This son of a bitch is ice cold.

224
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:12,672
- Hello?
- Is that you, George?

225
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,475
Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?

226
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:18,178
Well, listen, you son of a bitch,
you know where we are?

227
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:21,557
Thirty thousand feet
above your head, you bastard.

228
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,850
What are they doing
letting you on an airplane?

229
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,065
Don't they know
that's against FAA regulation?

230
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,860
Hush up now. I can't hear.

231
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,195
Listen, I want you to send those
agreements the minute you land.

232
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,321
Our boys can't wait
to kick your butts.

233
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:35,151
When's that bastard
coming to Houston?

234
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:38,196
Zeke wants to know when you
bastards are coming to Houston?

235
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,319
Hey, you tell that son of a bitch
no Yankee is ever coming to Houston.

236
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:44,739
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

237
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:47,288
Speak up, George, I can't hear you.

238
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,666
You tell that son of a bitch...

239
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:52,457
no Yankee
is ever coming to Houston.

240
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,168
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

241
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,712
- George! Get ahold of yourself.
- Mr. Wilhelm.

242
00:12:57,784 --> 00:13:00,042
What's the matter with you?

243
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:08,383
It was a cold winter's night
in Timbuktu.

244
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,676
This stinks.

245
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,518
Come on. Come on.

246
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,813
- Hello.
- Hello.

247
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,394
- I'm a friend of Elaine's.
- Oh, hi.

248
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:31,114
Oh, look at that cute little bastard.

249
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:35,233
You are mommy's little bastard,
aren't you?

250
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,912
What are you doing
harassing my tenants?

251
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:42,913
Oh, come on, you son of a bitch,
I'm just trying to be friendly.

252
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,787
All right, that's it. Let's go.

253
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:46,455
Man, I got a race tomorrow.

254
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,877
- It's like a furnace in here.
- What the hell is going on?

255
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,082
I turned up the heat.

256
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,004
Turn up the heat
in your own apartment.

257
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:58,756
I'm freezing.

258
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,590
I just need
to get my hot tub running.

259
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,097
I'm waiting for my new heat pump.

260
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,389
Well, what's in this giant box
out in the hall?

261
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,344
- Oh, that must be it.
- It's huge.

262
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:12,185
Yeah, I got the biggest one they had.
Yeah, it's industrial strength.

263
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:15,274
Sixteen thousand BTU's.

264
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,570
Hello.

265
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:23,359
Yeah, I can be there
in 10 minutes.

266
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:26,106
You can count on me.

267
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:28,195
- What?
- I got the call.

268
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,444
- Jean-Paul?
- Jean-Paul.

269
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,782
Very lucky to find this hotel,
Jean-Paul.

270
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:38,701
Man, I just want to get some sleep.

271
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:42,461
All right.
Let's check out the clock.

272
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,337
Notch good.

273
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:46,628
6:50.

274
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,172
Volume check.

275
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:56,131
What kind of music
you wanna wake up to?

276
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:58,548
- Top 40, Classical?
- Man, whatever.

277
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,476
- How about adult contemporary?
- Fine, adult contemporary.

278
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:04,099
- Just pick one.
- All right.

279
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:07,970
We're going with adult contempo.

280
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:12,644
Now the fail-safe.

281
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:14,647
The wake-up guy.

282
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,061
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.

283
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:19,195
- Front desk.
- Yes, this is room 419.

284
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,568
I'd like a wake-up call
for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.

285
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:24,023
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:27,653
That's room 419, 6:50 AM.

287
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,403
Four-one-niner.

288
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:33,957
Yes, I got it, sir.
You only had to say it once.

289
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:37,541
But it's a very important wake-up call,
and I don't wanna take any chances.

290
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:39,503
Every wake-up call I make
is important.

291
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,794
You're no more important
than any of our guests.

292
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:44,538
Well, I don't want to get into
a thing with you here, but...

293
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:48,548
- Are you through?
- Yeah, I am, but I just...

294
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,597
What is it?

295
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,260
I think I offended the wake-up guy.

296
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:01,976
- No, no.
- No, no, I did.

297
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,982
- I think he's got it in for me.
- He doesn't have it in for you.

298
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,640
- What if he doesn't call out of spite?
- It is his job.

299
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,404
I'm not comfortable.

300
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,904
For God's sake.

301
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,035
Jean-Paul?

302
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:26,912
Hey, Jean-Paul?

303
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:30,702
Jean-Paul?

304
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:34,211
Jean-Paul?

305
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,419
Oh, man.

306
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:43,216
- Oh, machine.
- I'm not here. Leave a message.

307
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:47,928
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul is missing.
He's alone in the city. Call me back.

308
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:57,394
- Judy, hi, listen...
- You have got some nerve, Elaine.

309
00:16:57,464 --> 00:17:00,136
I told you about that baby
in confidence.

310
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,228
Oh, I didn't tell anyone.

311
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:06,775
Well, your friend certainly seemed
to know all about it.

312
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:11,566
Jerry!

313
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,442
I feel much better here
at my home base, Jean-Paul.

314
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,078
It's a controlled environment.

315
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:20,202
It's a marathon, you know?
Twenty-six miles.

316
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,570
I need to get some sleep.

317
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:24,749
Hey, believe me, if I had been
with you there in Barcelona...

318
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:28,083
you'd be polishing that medal
right now.

319
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:31,326
I left a comfortable hotel bed for this.

320
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:33,747
That wake-up guy was trouble.

321
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:36,292
All right, I'll be right back.

322
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,589
Man, that thing is noisy.

323
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:51,765
We're cranking along pretty good.
We're almost up to 80 degrees.

324
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,436
Listen, do me a favour, set your mental
alarm for 6:30 and give me a call.

325
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,231
Okay.

326
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:01,188
Done.

327
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,479
He's put his faith in you.
He's put his faith in you.

328
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:08,779
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

329
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,943
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

330
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,451
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.

331
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,454
I'm exhausted.

332
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:20,410
I've been on this street
1000 times.

333
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,909
It's never looked so strange.

334
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,458
The faces, so cold.

335
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,412
In the distance, a child is crying.

336
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:30,966
Fatherless.

337
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:33,624
A bastard child, perhaps.

338
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:36,133
My back aches.

339
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:38,973
My heart aches, but my feet....

340
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,341
My feet are resilient.

341
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:48,938
Thank God I took off my heels
and put on my...

342
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:51,477
Himalayan walking shoes!

343
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,836
4:02?

344
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,683
8:47? Jean-Paul!
Wake up, wake up!

345
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,675
Jean-Paul, the electricity went out!
Wake up, wake up, we've gotta go!

346
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:43,177
- It's 8:47!
- 8:47?

347
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:46,854
Come on. Just put your clothes on.
You'll get dressed in the car.

348
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:49,850
Idiot, I trusted you!

349
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:52,434
Kramer, what happened?
The electricity went out.

350
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:55,102
Yeah, the heat pump
blew all the fuses.

351
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:57,362
What happened to your mental alarm?

352
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,692
Well, I guess I hit the snooze.

353
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,540
Make way. Watch out.
I've got a runner here.

354
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:22,914
Get out of the way.

355
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:25,757
Make way, make way.
Make way, he's a contender.

356
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:28,963
- Hey, hold it.
- I'm late, man. I'm in the race.

357
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,597
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Jerry.

358
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,887
You're a wonderful driver.
Fantastic route, man.

359
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,134
All right, go.
It's a race. Come on.

360
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:40,645
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, George, come in, come in.

361
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,269
Word has it you've been
cracking under the pressure.

362
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:45,516
Can't cope, can't stand the heat.
Spit the bit.

363
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,401
Mr. Steinbrenner, I can explain...

364
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:49,857
We all get a little cuckoo.
I used to be like you.

365
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,982
Berating personnel, calling managers
on the field during a game.

366
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:55,825
Threatening to move the team
to New Jersey to upset people.

367
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,237
Then I found a way to relax.

368
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,236
I've got two words
to say to you, George.

369
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,035
Hot tub.

370
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,155
I'm telling you, I never told
anyone about that baby.

371
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,910
I never even went near your building.

372
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:10,167
- Then how did she find out, Jerry?
- You should check with the rabbi.

373
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,706
- You want some hot tea?
- Oh, no, thank you.

374
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,837
Oh, there's some runners.
Here they come.

375
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:21,001
There's Jean-Paul.
He's out front.

376
00:21:22,704 --> 00:21:25,424
- He's leading! Go, Jean-Paul!
- Yeah!

377
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:26,760
Come on!

378
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:34,268
- One mile to go, Jean-Paul.
- Go, Jean-Paul!

379
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:04,748
How are you enjoying it, George?
Melts that tension away, doesn't it?

380
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:07,623
You gotta get that jet
on the good spot.

381
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:10,203
Yes, that feels good.
Yes, that's real good.

382
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,172
Yeah, that's where I keep
all my tension.

383
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,669
Right under that chicken bone.

384
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:16,795
I get my wife to stick her thumb
right in there like a screwdriver.

385
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,593
The Phillips head, not the flat one.

386
00:22:18,662 --> 00:22:20,754
Oh, God, those flat ones
frustrate me.

387
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:24,180
You got it in, but it slips out.
Put it in again, it slips out again.

388
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,970
- You a single man, George?
- Well, I just recently...

389
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:29,468
You wanna get something wild
going on in your life...

390
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:31,388
get a girl and
bring her in one of these.

391
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:33,271
It's like four shots of Wild Turkey.

392
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,231
She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy.

393
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,392
Terrible about that Mickey Mantle,
wasn't it?

394
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:40,568
You know, we used to talk.
I don't think he liked me very much.

394
00:22:41,305 --> 00:23:41,495
